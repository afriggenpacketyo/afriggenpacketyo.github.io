          <p>As the price of gold approaches record highs, potentially nearing $4,000 per ounce, beginner investors may feel priced out of the market. However, this article outlines several strategic approaches to enter the market without paying top dollar. These methods include exploring various investment vehicles like gold ETFs and stocks, considering fractional gold options for smaller, more affordable purchases, and employing a dollar-cost averaging strategy to build a position over time. The key takeaway is that while prompt action is advised, there are accessible entry points for those new to investing in the precious metal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Argentine police have launched an investigation into the family of a deceased Nazi financial adviser, Friedrich Kadgien, after a stolen 17th-century painting was spotted in a real estate advertisement. The artwork, believed to be Giuseppe Ghislandi's "Portrait of a Lady," was looted from Jewish art dealer Jacques Goudstikker during World War II. After the painting appeared in the ad, it vanished from the property, leading authorities to place Kadgien's daughter and son-in-law under house arrest. The search for the missing artwork, which is listed on an international registry, now involves Interpol and highlights the ongoing efforts to recover Nazi-plundered art.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued an injunction barring the Trump administration from using National Guard or other military troops for domestic law enforcement activities in California. The ruling, from Judge Charles Breyer, found that the deployment of troops in Los Angeles to address immigration protests willfully violated the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878. While the decision is limited to California and has been temporarily stayed to allow for an appeal, it represents a significant legal challenge to the president's authority. The White House criticized the ruling as an overreach, while California's governor praised it as a victory for democracy and the Constitution.</p>

          <p>Nearly 600 economists, including several Nobel laureates, have co-signed an open letter defending the independence of the Federal Reserve and supporting Governor Lisa Cook. The letter comes in response to President Trump's unprecedented attempt to remove Cook from her position on the Fed's Board of Governors, citing unproven allegations of mortgage fraud. The signatories argue that such political pressure undermines the credibility of the central bank, which is designed to be insulated from day-to-day politics. They emphasize that the institutional safeguards protecting the Fed are crucial for maintaining American economic strength and stability.</p>

          <p>Graham Linehan, co-creator of the sitcom "Father Ted," was arrested at London's Heathrow Airport in connection with social media posts critical of transgender activists. Linehan stated that five armed officers met him and arrested him over three posts on X, one of which suggested people should "punch" trans-identified males in female-only spaces. The arrest has sparked a significant backlash from free speech advocates and public figures like J.K. Rowling, who labeled the action as totalitarian. The incident has intensified the debate in the U.K. over the policing of speech and the balance between protecting marginalized groups and upholding freedom of expression.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military is mobilizing thousands of reservists as it prepares for a major offensive to conquer Gaza City, which it describes as a Hamas stronghold. This next phase of the ground operation, dubbed "Operation Gideon's Chariots II," follows heavy aerial and artillery bombardment of the city. The UN has warned that a full-scale assault would be catastrophic for the nearly one million civilians who remain despite evacuation orders. The call-up and escalating conflict have raised concerns among the families of the 48 hostages still held by Hamas, who fear for their safety and are demanding a negotiated release.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that many of President Trump's tariffs are illegal, creating significant uncertainty for the shipping industry and raising the possibility of refunding billions of dollars in collected duties. The ruling is currently stayed until October 14, and the administration is expected to appeal to the Supreme Court. In the meantime, logistics professionals report that shippers are in a holding pattern, awaiting a final decision before making changes to their operations. The outcome of the case will have major implications for U.S. trade policy and the $142 billion in tariff revenue generated this fiscal year.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin experienced a modest price increase, reclaiming the $111,000 level, while the broader stock market faced a sell-off and gold surged to a new record high of around $3,500 per ounce. The market divergence was influenced by concerns over the legality of President Trump's global tariffs, which drove investors towards safe-haven assets. While gold benefited from its traditional role as a hedge against uncertainty, Bitcoin's performance was also affected by a recent rotation of capital into Ethereum. Analysts note that crypto assets are increasingly competing with traditional safe havens, with future movements potentially tied to the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Federal Reserve prepares for its first interest rate cut of 2025, expectations for a significant drop in mortgage rates should be tempered. The anticipated cut is only 25 basis points, a marginal step that is unlikely to cause a dramatic shift in the mortgage climate. Furthermore, many lenders may have already priced this expected reduction into their current rate offerings, meaning borrowers might not see a noticeable difference after the official announcement. It is also important to remember that mortgage rates are influenced by multiple factors beyond the Fed's policy, including the 10-year Treasury yield, which also plays a major role.

          <p>Defender Marc Guehi's anticipated £35 million transfer from Crystal Palace to Liverpool fell through on deadline day, leaving the player's future uncertain. The collapse reportedly occurred after Palace failed to secure a suitable replacement defender, a key condition for sanctioning the move. While frustrating for Guehi, who missed out on joining the Premier League champions, the situation presents a new opportunity. As he is in the final year of his contract, he can now sign with a new club as a free agent in the summer, which will significantly increase his personal earning power and give him full control over his next career move.</p>

          <p>Walmart is enhancing its Walmart+ subscription service by adding NBCUniversal's Peacock as a streaming option, in a direct move to better compete with Amazon Prime. Starting September 15, members can choose between ad-supported versions of Peacock Premium or Paramount+ as part of their $98 annual membership, with the ability to switch between the two services every 90 days. This expansion of streaming content aims to add value for consumers without increasing the subscription price. Unlike Amazon, which invests heavily in original content, Walmart's strategy focuses on bundling existing popular streaming platforms to attract and retain subscribers.</p>

          <p>Members of the Proud Boys are calling for the resignation of Attorney General Pam Bondi after the Justice Department moved to dismiss their $100 million lawsuit. The lawsuit, filed by Enrique Tarrio and other members imprisoned for their roles in the January 6th Capitol riot before being pardoned by President Trump, alleges systemic abuse of the legal system. The Justice Department argues the suit should be dismissed based on sovereign immunity and the plaintiffs' failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The conflict places the Trump administration's DOJ in opposition to some of the president's staunchest allies.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett has stated his disappointment with the decision to split Kraft Heinz into two separate companies, a move that undoes the major 2015 merger he helped orchestrate. Berkshire Hathaway is the food conglomerate's largest shareholder with a 27.5% stake. Buffett remarked that while the original merger did not turn out to be a brilliant idea, he does not believe that dismantling the company will solve its underlying problems. Following his comments, shares of Kraft Heinz fell by more than 7%, reflecting investor concern over the strategic direction and the disapproval of its most prominent backer.

According to the arrest citation, she admitted to police that she gave birth and then attempted to hide all evidence, including placing the infant in the bag. An autopsy is pending to determine the baby's cause of death.

          <p>The deepening partnership between China's Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin, framed as a counterweight to U.S. dominance, has ironically helped to hold the Western alliance system together. Despite President Trump's disruptive approach to traditional U.S. allies, China has not capitalized on the opportunity to improve its ties with Europe or its Asian neighbors. Instead, Beijing's continued support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine and its aggressive stance on trade and territorial issues have reinforced the perception of a unified authoritarian bloc. This has left American allies with little choice but to maintain their alignment with the West, inadvertently preserving the global order that Xi and Putin seek to challenge.</p>

          <p>Financial experts highlight a "golden opportunity" for investors to potentially pay a 0% tax rate on long-term capital gains, thanks to new deductions in President Trump's recent tax legislation. For 2025, individuals with taxable income up to $48,350 and married couples filing jointly with income up to $96,700 qualify for this 0% rate. The increased standard deduction and other new tax breaks could allow more investors to fall within this bracket.
