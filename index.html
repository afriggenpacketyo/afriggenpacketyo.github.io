          <p>Anduril has topped the CNBC Disruptor 50 list for 2025, signaling a significant increase in interest and investment in the defense technology sector. This marks the first time in the list's 13-year history that a defense tech company has secured the top spot, with other companies like Flock Safety, Saronic Technologies, and Shield AI also making the list. These four companies collectively boast a valuation exceeding $45 billion and have attracted nearly $10 billion in investor funding, demonstrating the sector's rapid growth and diverse geographic presence outside of Silicon Valley. The growth is expected to accelerate with President Trump's proposed increase in defense spending, with a focus on modernizing military capabilities and opening opportunities beyond the legacy defense sector. Optimism is fueled by the sector's increasing focus on dual-use technologies and the explosion in generative AI's capabilities. </p>

          <p>Chinese state media are using the protests in Los Angeles against President Trump's immigration policies to depict the United States as a nation with a failing government and fractured social unity.

The state-backed Beijing Youth Daily commented that US politics is entering a chaotic phase, with the Trump administration setting a troubling precedent. Xinhua, another state news agency, emphasized the conflict between the Republican-led federal government and the Democratic-led state of California. </p>

          <p>Tampa Bay Rays shortstop Wander Franco, already on trial for alleged sexual assault of a minor, now faces an illegal handgun possession charge in the Dominican Republic. The charge stems from a November incident where a semiautomatic Glock 19, registered to Franco's uncle, was found in his vehicle after an altercation. Franco's lawyer argues the gun was licensed, making the charge invalid, but officials are requesting a trial on the gun charge. Franco is also facing charges of sexual abuse of a minor, sexual and commercial exploitation against a minor, and human trafficking, potentially carrying a 30-year prison sentence if convicted. </p>

Tax cuts under Presidents Bush and Trump have contributed significantly to the deficit.

          <p>Hummingbird feeders, intended to aid these tiny birds, can become deadly traps if not properly cleaned and maintained. Spoilage of sugar water in feeders leads to microbial growth, causing infections like candida in hummingbirds, which can lead to tongue swelling and starvation. Wildlife rehabbers report frequently rescuing hummingbirds with feeder-related infections. The solution involves using the correct sugar-to-water ratio (1:4) and cleaning feeders every one to three days, with more frequent cleaning in hot weather, to prevent harmful microbial growth. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nottingham Forest has formally requested clarification from UEFA regarding Crystal Palace's qualification for the Europa League. The concern stems from potential breaches of UEFA's multi-club ownership rules, as John Textor, who owns a 43% stake in Palace, also holds a 77% stake in Lyon, another Europa League qualifier. UEFA rules prevent any entity from holding a majority of voting rights in two clubs participating in the same European tournament. Forest, which finished seventh in the Premier League, could benefit if Palace is deemed ineligible for European competition. </p>

Newsom has initiated legal action against the president for deploying troops without the state's consent.
