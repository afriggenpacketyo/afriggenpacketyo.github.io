          <p>A U.S. trade court ruled against President Trump's broad tariffs, deeming them unauthorized under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.  The ruling, which the administration immediately appealed, halts the tariffs and could significantly impact Trump's economic policy.  The decision caused a surge in Dow futures, indicating positive market reaction to the potential reduction in trade barriers.  The Supreme Court may ultimately decide the case.</p>
