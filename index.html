          <p>Target has lowered its sales expectations for the year, citing a decline in discretionary spending, uncertainties surrounding tariffs, and negative reactions to the retailer's adjustments to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. The company's first-quarter sales fell short of Wall Street estimates, experiencing a nearly 3% drop compared to the previous year, with a decrease in both transaction volume and average customer spending. CEO Brian Cornell attributed these challenges primarily to economic factors, though the company is actively seeking to improve its market share across various merchandise categories. In response to these challenges, Target has announced leadership changes and the establishment of a new Enterprise Acceleration Office to streamline operations and boost growth.

          <p>House Republicans are currently negotiating the details of the 'One Big, Beautiful Bill Act,' a comprehensive legislative package that encompasses President Donald Trump's key campaign promises related to taxes and border security. The bill proposes significant changes to Medicaid, potentially causing over 8 million recipients to lose coverage, alongside substantial cuts to the SNAP food assistance program. It also aims to make the 2017 Trump tax cuts permanent, eliminate taxes on tips and overtime pay, and allocate substantial funds for border wall construction and defense spending. The impacts of the bill are still under review by the Congressional Budget Office, and its final form remains subject to change as negotiations continue.</p>

While this expedition is a record Everest ascent without acclimatizing in the Himalayas, it's not the fastest Everest time overall.

          <p>The UK inflation rate has risen to 3.5% in April, the highest in more than a year, primarily due to increases in household bills such as water, gas, and electricity. This figure exceeds economists' expectations and is further above the Bank of England's target of 2%. The rise in inflation may influence the Bank of England's decisions regarding interest rate cuts, with some economists now anticipating only one cut this year. Rising costs for firms, including increased employer National Insurance contributions and a higher minimum wage, also contributed to the inflationary pressure.</p>

The judge mandated U.S. officials to appear in court to provide information about the impacted immigrants and their opportunities to raise fear-based claims.

          <p>Donald Trump's recent trip to the Middle East was successful due to his use of the American private sector as an instrument of national power, positioning the U.S. as a commercial and strategic partner rather than just an arms merchant. His approach to Middle East politics is unconstrained by domestic concerns, allowing him to make decisions that other presidents might avoid. Trump's promise of no more nation-building projects and no more lectures on how to live resonates with both Gulf Arabs and Middle America. However, the success of this strategy hinges on balancing business interests with other priorities and ensuring that the U.S. remains an attractive investment destination.</p>

          <p>Heavy storms are impacting the East Coast as a Nor'easter heads toward New England, bringing strong winds, heavy rain, and potential coastal flooding. The system is expected to bring cold, windswept rain to New England, including Boston, with wind gusts up to 50 mph. Additionally, storms have reached the East Coast, with scattered severe storms reported in the Southeast. The storms follow a period of intense tornado activity across several states, highlighting the widespread severe weather affecting the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has upheld the legal right to wild camping on Dartmoor, rejecting an appeal by landowners who sought to restrict public access. The ruling, based on the interpretation of the 1985 Dartmoor Commons Act, affirms the public's right to 'open-air recreation,' which includes camping. The decision is likely to reignite the debate over public access to land in England, where Dartmoor National Park is a rare exception to the general lack of wild camping rights on private land. The Dartmoor National Park Association welcomed the ruling, emphasizing the importance of responsible access and respect for landowners.</p>

          <p>Mortgage applications experienced a 5.1% drop as interest rates climbed to their highest level since February. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages increased to 6.92%, driven by investor concerns about rising inflation and increasing deficits. Applications for home purchases also fell, reflecting a cooling effect on the spring season due to higher interest rates and economic uncertainty. Refinance applications decreased as well, with fewer borrowers able to benefit from refinancing at current rates.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has restarted collections on defaulted federal student loans, potentially leading to wage garnishment and other financial consequences for millions of Americans. Repayments on student debt had been paused since March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but collections have now resumed, with notices to borrowers in default to follow. Lenders can garnish up to 15% of a borrower's disposable pay without going to court, provided they give at least 60 days' notice. Experts warn that borrowers may have forgotten the severity of defaulting on student loans due to the extended pause.</p>
