          <p>Bill Gates announced that the majority of his foundation's $200 billion endowment will be dedicated to addressing challenges in Africa over the next two decades, during a speech to African leaders in Addis Ababa. Gates emphasized the importance of partnership and innovation to boost health and development, focusing on primary healthcare, nutrition for mothers and children, and advancements in vaccines. He highlighted Ethiopia, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe as examples of countries showing strong leadership in fostering innovation, while also noting the increasing commitment of the Gates Foundation to Africa, including establishing offices in multiple countries. This pledge occurs amidst concerns about cuts to US foreign aid and the potential impact on humanitarian crises in Africa. The article concludes with Gates urging other wealthy individuals to prioritize philanthropy to address societal issues, rather than accumulating personal possessions.</p>

          <p>Portuguese and German police have commenced a new search in Lagos, Portugal, near where Madeleine McCann disappeared in 2007. The search, authorized by German prosecutors, focuses on land between the Ocean Club resort and a house previously inhabited by Christian BrÃ¼ckner, the prime suspect. BrÃ¼ckner is currently imprisoned in Germany for an unrelated sexual assault and has been named a formal suspect in Madeleine's disappearance, although he denies involvement. The search involves German specialists and the closure of roads, with evidence to be handed over to German authorities; this marks the first search in two years, with a previous search in 2023 focusing on a remote dam. Madeleine's parents have marked the 18th anniversary of her disappearance, reiterating their determination to find answers, while the Metropolitan Police continues its investigation, known as Operation Grange.</p>

          <p>At least 24 people were killed and dozens injured by Israeli forces near a humanitarian aid distribution center in the Gaza Strip, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated that their forces fired warning shots at suspects approaching them near the aid site, followed by additional shots when the suspects did not move away. The IDF is investigating the incident and maintains that it allows the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) to distribute aid independently and prevents Hamas from accessing it. This incident follows a previous report of violence at a GHF aid distribution site, prompting UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to call for an independent investigation.</p>

          <h2>The Role of Shamelessness in Politics: From Trump to Party Loyalty</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-03 03:00:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the role of shamelessness in politics, particularly as a survival tactic employed by politicians, using Donald Trump as a prime example. It discusses how politicians often justify changing positions due to shifting public sentiment, party loyalty, or pressure from donors, and how they must do so with a straight face, even when the explanations are dubious. The piece references Trump's flip-flop on TikTok, his ability to contradict himself without hesitation, and his knack for delaying tariffs and declaring victory, which appeals to his supporters. It also touches on John Kerry's infamous "I actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it" comment, and how Trump's actions, such as pardoning a violent gang leader, would be met with outrage if done by a Democrat. The article concludes by suggesting that Trump's political skills and the lack of a strong national Democratic spokesperson contribute to his ability to get away with acts of shamelessness.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has expressed concerns over the intense price wars among car manufacturers in China, as deflationary pressures persist. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) and other state media outlets have warned that these price wars could threaten product quality and the long-term development of the industry. The MIIT described the competition as "involutionary," hindering sustained investment in research and development. The People's Daily echoed these concerns, noting the shrinking profit margins of domestic carmakers due to industrial overcapacity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has sharply reduced its growth forecasts for the U.S. due to the impact of President Donald Trump's tariff policies. The U.S. growth outlook has been revised down to 1.6% for this year and 1.5% for 2026, citing elevated economic policy uncertainty, a slowdown of net immigration, and a smaller federal workforce. Global growth is also expected to be lower than previously forecast, with the slowdown concentrated in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The OECD adjusted its inflation forecast, noting that higher trade costs due to tariffs will push up inflation, though this will be partially offset by weaker commodity prices.</p>

          <p>An independent review has found that the water sector in England and Wales is failing and requires stronger regulation to protect billpayers and the environment. The Water Commission, led by Sir Jon Cunliffe, highlighted a lack of public trust due to pollution, financial difficulties, mismanagement, and infrastructure failures. The review calls for clearer government direction, a better approach to long-term investment, and a stronger voice for local communities. Sir Jon emphasized the need for the regulators, including the Environment Agency and Ofwat, to ensure private water companies act in the public interest and that new legislation would be needed.</p>

Sources indicate that the politicization of the water industry was a major deterrent for KKR, but Thames Water will continue discussions with creditors and stakeholders, but the water services will continue as normal.</p>

          <p>Parents of babies who died while under the care of maternity units in Nottingham have welcomed a corporate manslaughter investigation into Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) NHS Trust. The investigation follows failings that led to hundreds of babies dying or being injured. Parents of Wynter Andrews, who died 23 minutes after birth, and Harriet Hawkins, who was stillborn, expressed their relief, though they believe individuals also need to be held accountable. NUH stated it is committed to the investigation and improving maternity services.</p>

Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that the UK "cannot ignore the threat that Russia poses" and pledged to undertake the most sweeping changes to British defenses since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The measures aim to send a message to Moscow and reassure Washington of Europe's commitment to its own defense.

The island's defense ministry has allocated more than NT$800 million (US$25 million) for the project, commissioning NCSIST to lead development.

The outcome underscores the resilience of populism and the ongoing challenges to liberal democracy.
