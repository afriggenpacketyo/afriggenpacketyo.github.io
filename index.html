          <p>President Trump and South African President Ramaphosa engaged in a tense discussion at the White House, with Trump raising concerns about a supposed White genocide in South Africa. Ramaphosa refuted these claims, bringing South African figures to vouch for the actual situation. Trump then screened a video showing alleged violence against White South Africans, which Ramaphosa countered by highlighting that crime affects all demographics in South Africa. The meeting underscored the strained relations between the two nations, with Trump asserting Elon Musk's support for allowing White Afrikaners into the U.S. as refugees.</p>

          <p>Despite inflation concerns, there are several ways to save money on your summer vacation this year. Flight and hotel costs are down compared to last year, presenting opportunities for deals. However, ride-share fares and entertainment expenses have increased, so setting a budget for dining out and activities is crucial to avoid overspending. Consider using credit card points and airline rewards to further reduce travel costs and remain flexible with travel dates and destinations to maximize savings.</p>

          <p>President Trump is working with House Republicans to advance a budget bill that includes extending tax cuts, increasing defense and border security spending, and cutting healthcare programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would add $2.3 trillion to the national debt. Trump faces opposition from the House Freedom Caucus, who seek deeper spending cuts, and from Republicans in Democratic-leaning states, who want bigger tax cuts for their constituents. Democrats uniformly oppose the legislation, citing its benefits for the wealthy and harm to lower-income Americans.</p>

          <p>The NFL's spring league meetings in Minnesota concluded with the "tush push," a signature play of the Philadelphia Eagles, remaining legal. A proposal by the Green Bay Packers to ban the play failed to reach the required 75% majority, with the Eagles and nine other teams voting against the ban. The "tush push," also known as "The Brotherly Shove," involves pushing the quarterback forward on short-yardage situations, and the Eagles have been exceptionally successful with it. The Packers argued for the ban citing player safety and pace of play, but the NFL has not reported any injuries related to the play.</p>

          <p>The FDA's new framework for COVID-19 vaccines may significantly restrict access to initial vaccine series for healthy children. The agency will now require new clinical trial data for approving new COVID shot formulations for individuals under 65, potentially preventing children from receiving their first doses. Experts fear this policy shift could leave children vulnerable to the virus without protection. While the FDA has not explicitly addressed the primary vaccine series for kids, the new framework is raising concerns among vaccinologists and pediatricians.</p>

          <p>A maintenance worker at a New Orleans jail has been arrested for allegedly aiding 10 inmates in their escape, with his attorney arguing the inmates used him. Sterling Williams, the worker, claimed he was threatened by an inmate to turn off the water in the cell used for the escape. Authorities allege Williams complied, facilitating the jailbreak, while his attorney asserts he was performing his job duties and did not conspire with the escapees. The escape went unnoticed for hours, leading to the suspension of three workers and an internal investigation.</p>

          <p>This article examines the UK government's progress on pledges related to illegal immigration and asylum. Despite promises to end the use of asylum hotels, numbers have increased since Labour took office. The government's goal to "smash the gangs" behind small boat crossings lacks clear metrics. While asylum claim decisions have increased, the overall backlog remains high. The government has increased returns of individuals with no legal right to stay, but forced removals remain a smaller proportion.</p>

This change comes after Trump grew frustrated with both sides and privately felt slighted by Putin's refusal to attend a meeting. Trump's primary motivation is reportedly to normalize relations with Moscow and negotiate a trade deal involving Russia's rare-earth minerals.</p>

          <p>Surge AI, an artificial intelligence training company, is facing a lawsuit alleging it misclassified its workers as independent contractors. The lawsuit claims that "data annotators" who ensure that AI systems can properly generate text responses were denied benefits given to employees. The plaintiff alleges they were made to do unpaid training and were subject to near-impossible time limits for tasks that caused their pay to be docked. This case is the latest in a trend of AI data training companies facing scrutiny over worker treatment.</p>

          <p>The future of President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill" could depend on the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction. The SALT deduction has created a division between Republicans representing high-tax districts and fiscal hardliners. Trump himself has shifted his stance on the issue, creating further confusion. The bill caps the SALT deduction at $10,000, and Republicans are trying to reach a deal to increase the cap, but they are facing resistance from fiscal hardliners seeking to reduce the debt.</p>
