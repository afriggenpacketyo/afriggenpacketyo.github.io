            <p>The United States, under Secretary of State Marco Rubio, is threatening to withdraw from brokering peace talks between Russia and Ukraine if significant progress towards a ceasefire isn't made within days, citing other priorities. This warning comes amid ongoing Russian strikes on Ukraine and follows news of a potential minerals deal between the US and Ukraine aimed at establishing an investment fund for Ukraine's reconstruction. Ukrainian negotiators are seeking security guarantees in the event of a ceasefire, but the US has so far resisted providing them, suggesting the presence of US businesses would deter further Russian aggression. Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze, an MP, says the Ukrainian Parliament will have the last word in the deal.</p>

            <p>Millions of people in the UK are bracing for Easter travel disruptions due to planned rail engineering works, potential airport strikes at Gatwick, and heavy road traffic. Network Rail will carry out over 300 maintenance projects, impacting services at major stations like London Euston and London Victoria. The RAC warns of potential "big jams" on roads, with nearly 20 million people expected to travel on Good Friday. Travelers are advised to plan ahead and check their journeys, while Gatwick Airport acknowledges potential impacts from strikes by ground handling staff.</p>

            <p>A Japanese bus driver with nearly three decades of service was fired and lost his $84,000 retirement package for stealing $7 from passengers' fares. The Kyoto City government initially denied his retirement money after security camera footage showed him pocketing 1,000 yen. While a lower court initially ruled the punishment excessive, the Supreme Court overturned that decision, citing the need to maintain public trust in the bus system. The driver had previously been reprimanded for smoking an electronic cigarette while on duty.</p>

            <p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is investigating a major pediatric teaching hospital, believed to be Texas Children’s Hospital (TCH), following the firing of a nurse who raised concerns about gender treatments for minors. The nurse, Vanessa Sivadge, claims she was terminated after seeking a religious exemption to avoid administering puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. HHS is emphasizing its commitment to protecting whistleblowers who expose potential violations of religious freedom or moral convictions. The investigation follows Sivadge's testimony about witnessing "disturbing trends and concerning practices" regarding gender dysphoria treatments.</p>

            <p>As the Los Angeles Dodgers enjoy a period of success, ticket prices have risen significantly, raising concerns about affordability for average fans. A study estimates that a family of four would spend nearly $400 to attend a game at Dodger Stadium, significantly higher than the league average. While the team and its sponsors provide some free and discounted tickets, the range of cheapest available prices per game are still expensive. Commissioner Rob Manfred defends the prices, citing the team's financial commitment to players, but a league survey suggests many fans disagree about the affordability of attending MLB games.</p>

            <p>Republicans in numerous state legislatures are advancing bills requiring documentary proof of citizenship to vote, citing concerns about election integrity despite lacking evidence of widespread voter fraud. These measures, including stricter voter ID provisions and restrictions on mail voting, are based on the false narrative that noncitizens are voting en masse in US elections. Critics argue that these bills could disenfranchise eligible American citizens and undermine confidence in elections.

            <p>Despite hype surrounding small modular reactors (SMRs) as a solution to energy needs and climate change, a contributor argues they are not a viable fix for California. The article claims that SMRs are even less economically sound than large nuclear plants, especially with the implementation of tariffs. The contributor also points to the history of failure and inflated costs associated with nuclear power. They contend that wind, solar, and batteries are cheaper and cleaner alternatives.</p>

            <p>Faced with the prospect of detention and deportation under the Trump administration, some immigrants are choosing to self-deport, returning to their home countries. This decision is driven by fear and the perception that the administration considers anyone without authorization to be a criminal. The administration has implemented tactics to encourage voluntary departure, including terminating legal status and suggesting stipends for self-deportation.
