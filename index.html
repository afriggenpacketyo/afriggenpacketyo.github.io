          <p>In honor of Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, a look back at the Great Wall Film Company, one of the first Chinese American film studios, founded in Brooklyn in the 1920s due to unfair portrayals in early Hollywood. Chinese leaders, frustrated by demeaning stereotypes, were encouraged to create their own movies. Harold Lee and his uncle Lee Kee Do established the studio, reflecting a 'do-it-yourself' mentality within the Chinese-American community. The studio later moved to Shanghai, but the Lee family continued to impact cinema through the New York Chinese Film Exchange.</p>

          <p>UNC athletic director Lawrence R. "Bubba" Cunningham avoided directly addressing concerns about whether Bill Belichick's girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, creates distractions for the football team. Cunningham praised Belichick's professionalism and focus but sidestepped questions about Hudson's involvement, simply stating that Belichick is incredibly focused. Belichick himself stated that his relationship with Hudson is personal and doesn't affect UNC football. Hudson has faced scrutiny for her reported influence on HBO's decision to not feature UNC on "Hard Knocks."</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole after serving over three decades. The brothers were convicted of killing their parents in 1989 and claimed they acted in self-defense due to years of alleged abuse. The decision to resentence was praised by their attorney, Mark Geragos, who believes it reflects a more evolved understanding of the case. The case will now go to the California Board of Parole Hearings before a final decision is made by the governor.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republican lawmakers in Missouri have approved a new referendum to repeal the abortion-rights amendment approved by voters last year. The proposed constitutional amendment would allow abortions only in cases of medical emergency, fetal anomaly, sexual assault, or incest up to 12 weeks of pregnancy. It would also prohibit gender transition surgeries, hormone treatments, and puberty blockers for minors, which are already barred under state law. The measure passed the Republican-led House and Senate and will go back to voters in November 2026, or sooner if the governor calls a special election.</p>

          <p>A British maritime authority report found that the Bayesian superyacht, which sank off Sicily killing seven, likely capsized due to an intense gust of wind. The yacht's towering mast, one of the tallest in the world, increased its vulnerability to capsizing. A deckhand delayed waking the captain and instead posted a video of the storm to social media. The boat's stability book lacked critical data about its vulnerability to capsizing, and its "angle of vanishing stability" was far less than many sailboats.</p>
