          <p>Authorities have discovered human remains at the site of a major explosion and fire at a fireworks warehouse in Yolo County, California. Seven individuals were previously reported as unaccounted for following the incident at Devastating Pyrotechnics, which also injured two people and sparked grass fires across 80 acres. Investigations are underway, revealing the facility lacked local licenses for fireworks storage on the agricultural property. The company has expressed condolences while legal and official inquiries, including by the ATF, continue.</p>

          <p>The UK government has officially banned the protest group Palestine Action, classifying it as a terrorist organization after a High Court judge rejected a last-minute appeal to block the measure. This decision makes supporting the group a criminal offense, punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The ban follows actions claimed by the group, including causing significant damage to aircraft, though the group's lawyers argued it is a non-violent civil disobedience organization. This move has been criticized by supporters as an "authoritarian abuse" of power.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods in Texas's Hill Country have led to at least 13 fatalities, with extensive search and rescue operations underway along the Guadalupe River. The river reportedly rose 26 feet in just 45 minutes, causing catastrophic damage and leaving around 20 children from a summer camp unaccounted for. Hundreds of emergency personnel, drones, and helicopters are involved in the response effort as officials warn of an ongoing threat of more flooding. Governor Greg Abbott has mobilized state resources to assist the affected communities.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy indicates that the recently enacted tax legislation will disproportionately benefit the wealthiest U.S. households, particularly in states without personal income taxes. The top 1% in states like Wyoming, South Dakota, and Texas are projected to see average tax cuts exceeding $100,000 annually. This outcome is attributed to provisions such as the extension of 2017 tax cuts and a higher estate tax exemption. In contrast, high-tax states like California and New Jersey will see smaller benefits for their top earners due to the bill's SALT deduction policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The newly signed Republican tax and spending package introduces sweeping changes to American finances by making the 2017 tax cuts permanent and adding new provisions. Key measures include an increased SALT deduction cap, a higher child tax credit, and temporary tax breaks for tip income, overtime, and auto loans. The legislation also enacts significant spending cuts to social safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP, which analyses suggest will primarily benefit higher earners while negatively impacting low-income households. The bill also overhauls federal student loans and eliminates various clean energy tax credits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied a final request to halt the removal of eight migrants detained in Djibouti, clearing the way for their deportation to South Sudan. The migrants, who were convicted of violent crimes in the U.S., were in legal limbo after a previous judicial order blocking their removal was lifted by the Supreme Court. Attorneys for the men expressed grave concerns, arguing the U.S. government should not send individuals to a place where they could face torture or harm, especially as they have no ties to the country. Despite these concerns, the Justice Department stated the flight to South Sudan was scheduled to proceed.</p>

This event highlights the zoo's vital role in the international breeding program for Humboldt penguins, which are a vulnerable species with declining population numbers.

          <p>President Trump signed a sweeping tax and spending package into law, marking a significant legislative achievement for his administration. The law makes many of the 2017 tax cuts permanent, while also instituting deep cuts to federal safety-net programs like Medicaid and SNAP. A key component of the bill is a massive increase in funding for immigration enforcement to support the administration's mass deportation efforts. While the White House touts the law as an economic booster, critics and immigrant rights groups have condemned it as a "disgraceful, anti-immigrant budget" that benefits the wealthy at the expense of the poor.</p>

          <p>England wicketkeeper Jamie Smith scored a record-breaking 184 not out against India, the highest score ever by an England wicketkeeper in a men's Test match. The 24-year-old's epic innings, which included a 303-run partnership with Harry Brook, surpassed the previous record held by his mentor, Alec Stewart. This performance is seen as a major milestone in Smith's burgeoning international career, solidifying his role as an aggressive and powerful batter in the number seven position. Despite being in Test cricket for less than a year, he is already being compared to Australian great Adam Gilchrist.</p>

          <p>Health advocates are warning that the wide variety of names used for state Medicaid programs could lead to widespread confusion and unintended loss of coverage for many Americans. With names like "Apple Health" in Washington or "SoonerCare" in Oklahoma, many beneficiaries may not realize that warnings about "Medicaid" cuts apply to their specific health plan. This lack of awareness is a significant concern as new federal rules, which include work requirements and more frequent eligibility checks, are set to take effect. The potential for confusion could result in eligible individuals losing their health insurance.</p>

          <p>The technology IPO market is showing signs of life after a prolonged downturn, sparked by the successful public debut of crypto company Circle, whose stock has surged sixfold since its IPO. This performance, along with other recent offerings, has provided much-needed returns for venture capital firms that have faced a liquidity drought since early 2022. While major private companies like SpaceX and Stripe remain on the sidelines, the increase in IPOs and strong market performance from companies like CoreWeave are fueling cautious optimism. Investors hope this signals a sustained trend, though potential roadblocks like geopolitical uncertainty remain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to a joint finding by Dutch and German intelligence services, Russia has increased its use of prohibited chemical weapons, including the WWI-era poison gas chloropicrin, in its war against Ukraine. The report states the use of these weapons has become "standardized and commonplace," with drones dropping chemicals on Ukrainian trenches to force soldiers into the open. Dutch officials have called for more sanctions against Moscow, condemning the use of these banned substances as a violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention. Russia has previously denied such accusations, while Ukraine claims to have recorded thousands of chemical attacks since 2022.</p>

          <p>President Trump is facing criticism for using the term "shylocks" during a speech in Iowa while discussing changes to the estate tax. The word, a reference to a Jewish character in Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice," is widely considered an offensive antisemitic trope related to greed. When questioned by reporters, the president claimed he was unaware of the term's antisemitic connotations and only knew it to mean a moneylender charging high rates. The Anti-Defamation League called the president's use of the term "troubling and irresponsible," while others labeled it "blatant and vile antisemitism."</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as one of the most important events in world history for creating the concept of a "citizen." Speaking ahead of the nation's 250th birthday, Burns emphasized that the Declaration of Independence's words, though not inclusive at the time, were inspirational and set in motion global movements for equality. He argued for embracing the complexity of American history, including the flaws of its founders, to create a richer and more accessible story for everyone. His new film, "The American Revolution," aims to explore these multifaceted narratives.</p>

Mohammed Fahir Amaaz and Muhammad Amaad allegedly used a "high level of violence" against the officers who were responding to a report that Mr. Amaaz had headbutted and punched another man in the coffee shop. The brothers, who deny the allegations and claim self-defense, were at the airport to collect their mother. The jury was shown CCTV footage of the events as the prosecution laid out its case.</p>

          <p>A provision within the newly signed Republican tax and spending package creates a temporary federal income tax deduction for tipped workers. The measure, which the White House frames as a win for the working class, allows employees like waiters and bartenders to deduct up to $25,000 in tip income from their federal taxes until 2028. However, critics argue the benefit is limited, as it doesn't affect state, local, or payroll taxes and excludes many low-wage workers who earn too little to have federal tax liability. Labor advocates suggest that raising the federal minimum wage would be a more effective way to help low-income earners. (not investment advice)</p>
