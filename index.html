          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook indicated that tariffs could increase inflation and complicate the Fed's rate policy decisions. Cook noted that while progress has been made on inflation, tariffs could reverse recent lower readings. She also suggested that President Trump's trade policies might negatively affect the labor market, creating uncertainty for both price stability and unemployment. Cook emphasized the importance of economic history in making decisions during periods of uncertainty and elevated risks to the Fed's dual mandate. (not investment advice) The economic outlook is uncertain, with tariffs posing risks to inflation and the labor market, which will require the Fed to remain vigilant.</p>

          <p>President Trump has increased his criticism of Republican Senator Rand Paul, who opposes the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" due to concerns about the debt ceiling. Trump stated that Paul has little understanding of the bill and accused him of habitually voting against everything. Paul defended his position, citing consistency on the issue of deficit concerns under both Republican and Democratic presidents. The legislation extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts and increases spending for military and border security, adding trillions to the national debt.

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to move Greenland from U.S. European Command to U.S. Northern Command, signaling a shift in how the U.S. views the island's strategic importance. This move suggests the U.S. sees Greenland as more integral to its own defense, similar to Canada, rather than as part of Europe. Top Trump officials, including Vice President Vance, have encouraged Greenland to align more closely with the U.S., citing its critical role in national security and access to rare earth minerals. While Greenlanders largely oppose joining the U.S., the administration continues to pursue closer ties, emphasizing potential economic benefits.</p>

The OECD advises Chancellor Rachel Reeves to boost tax revenue and cut spending to strengthen public finances.

          <p>A fresh search effort has been launched for Madeleine McCann, who disappeared from Portugal over 18 years ago. Police are focusing on land near a cottage previously used by Christian Brueckner, the only suspect in the case, who is currently jailed in Germany for unrelated charges. Investigators are using ground radar technology to scan the area, which includes wells and ditches. Brueckner, who has denied any involvement in Madeleine's disappearance, is serving a 7-year sentence for the 2005 sexual assault of a 72-year-old American woman.</p>

Elon Musk announced that Tesla has been testing Model Y vehicles without safety drivers in Austin.

Tesla's camera-based system differs from Waymo's sensor-based approach, and the success of Tesla's robotaxi service will depend on its ability to navigate the complex urban environment safely and efficiently.

The retailer's raised forecast assumes current tariff rates will remain in place through mid-August, and the company is working to mitigate tariff-related cost increases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While true "forgiveness" of personal loan debt isn't as simple as with student loans, there are legitimate ways to reduce what you owe. Debt settlement, where your lender agrees to accept less than what you owe, usually in exchange for a lump-sum payment, is one path forward. Qualifying typically requires being behind on payments, demonstrating financial hardship, and being ready to make a lump-sum offer. If you don't qualify for debt forgiveness, consider debt management plans, refinancing, or communicating with your lender. (not investment advice)</p>
