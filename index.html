        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Moody's Ratings lowered the United States' sovereign credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing the increasing burden of financing the federal government's budget deficit and the rising costs of rolling over existing debt amidst high interest rates. The ratings agency noted that successive administrations and Congress have failed to address the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs. This downgrade is expected to marginally increase the yield investors demand for U.S. Treasury debt and could negatively impact sentiment toward U.S. assets. The U.S. is currently running a massive budget deficit, with interest costs continuing to rise. Optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has issued an order continuing to block the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan migrants detained in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, pending a challenge to their removals. The court's order grants an emergency injunction sought by lawyers who argue the migrants face imminent risk of removal. The ruling vacates a lower court's judgment and remands the case for further proceedings, emphasizing that the detainees are entitled to more notice than they received. The court did not address the legality of using the Alien Enemies Act for deportations but directed lower courts to handle cases related to the law expeditiously. Optimism score is 40.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is increasing pressure on states, particularly those led by Democrats, that provide state-funded benefits to undocumented immigrants. This includes actions like targeting state laws offering in-state tuition to undocumented students and investigating programs providing assistance to impoverished immigrants. The administration is also pushing for a reconciliation bill that would penalize states using their own funds for undocumented immigrants' healthcare, potentially costing states billions. This has created a split among Democrats, with some arguing for continued support for undocumented immigrants while others are retrenching due to budget constraints and political pressures.

          <p>During President Trump's visit to the Middle East, Gulf countries, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, went all out to deepen ties with the U.S. and advance their economic agendas. Qatar and the U.S. agreed on a $1.2 trillion "economic exchange," Saudia Arabia promised to invest $600 billion in the U.S., and major projects were signed with the United Arab Emirates.
