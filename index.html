            <p>Two political appointees, Dan Caldwell and Dan Selnick, were fired from the Pentagon after being placed on administrative leave due to an ongoing leak investigation initiated by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's chief of staff, Joe Kasper. The investigation seeks to uncover unauthorized disclosures, potentially using polygraph tests, and also involves Colin Carroll, chief of staff to the deputy secretary of defense, who was also put on administrative leave. The probe was triggered after the Pentagon denied Elon Musk's classified briefing on war plans with China, but officials say the investigation is looking at more than just one story. Kasper is also under review, with discussions about suspending more officials as the investigation broadens.</p>

            <p>Large-scale protests against the Trump administration are planned across the U.S., organized by movements like 50501 and Tesla Takedown. The 50501 Movement is holding a "day of action" with protests in 50 states, focusing on community-based events and mutual aid efforts in response to what organizers call "anti-democratic and illegal actions." Tesla Takedown is protesting Elon Musk's role in the administration, with both groups sharing tenets of pro-democracy, preserving the Constitution, opposing executive overreach, and non-violence. Resistance involves strengthening communities to withstand assaults on democracy and prepare for a better future, with events including food drives to support those affected by wildfires and rising prices due to tariffs.</p>

The sisters are being hosted by Farha Ghannam and Hans Lofgren, who provide support and a home environment. While Abbas's situation represents a triumph, many children in Gaza lack access to medical treatment, and her visa renewal in May introduces uncertainty.</p>

            <p>Warming from climate change is making the pollen season longer and more intense, leading to increased allergy symptoms. Doctors recommend keeping the outside outside by removing shoes and clothes upon entering the house, showering before bed, and keeping windows closed. Wiping down pets, using masks, and rinsing the nose with saline spray or a neti pot can also help manage allergies. Different allergy medications treat different symptoms, with oral antihistamines for itchy eyes and runny nose, and steroid nasal sprays for congestion, used correctly by tilting the nozzle towards the ear.</p>

            <p>The article criticizes the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act (SAVE Act) for potentially disenfranchising women, who are more likely to have name changes due to marriage or divorce. It highlights the irony of Rep. Elise Stefanik, who authored the Women's Commemorative Coin Act celebrating suffrage activists, also supporting the SAVE Act. The proposed law would require voters to present a passport or birth certificate and photo ID, disproportionately affecting women who may face challenges in providing documentation for name changes. The author questions the motives behind requiring more documentation to vote than to buy a gun.</p>

            <p>The Eaton fire, which caused significant damage in Altadena, has reignited concerns about the town's unincorporated status and its impact on emergency response. Residents felt left in the dark, waiting for alerts and evacuation updates, compared to nearby incorporated cities with dedicated resources and leadership. While the fire's intensity made it difficult to fight, some wonder if a city government could have improved the emergency response, particularly regarding evacuation alerts. The lack of centralized communication and systematic evacuation has led to investigations and reviews.</p>

            <p>US chocolate prices are surging due to soaring cocoa costs and Donald Trump's tariffs, impacting Easter celebrations. Climate-related crises in West Africa have decimated cocoa production, leading to inflated prices. Trump's tariffs are expected to further increase chocolate prices, as manufacturers face challenges in shifting production to the US due to the cacao plant's tropical climate requirements. Smaller chocolate businesses are particularly vulnerable to these unstable conditions, with some already going out of business due to pricing turmoil.</p>

Russia, a major arms supplier to West African countries, faces constraints due to the war in Ukraine, creating an opportunity for China to expand its influence in the region.</p>

The deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, is highlighted as an example of unjust persecution.

            <p>China's beach resorts, particularly in Sanya, Hainan province, are experiencing a surge in Russian tourists. The number of Russian visitors has increased elevenfold year on year, becoming the top source of foreign guests in local hotels. This upswing is driven by a recovery in Russian outbound tourism and China's relaxed visa policies, allowing visa-free entry for tourists from many countries. The increase in Russian tourism is helping the local travel sector recover from the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

The ACLU challenged the deportations, arguing that the migrants were not given a chance to contest their case in court. The Trump administration invoked the act to deport immigrants identified as criminals, regardless of their immigration status. The Supreme Court's order provides a temporary reprieve, pending further legal challenges.</p>
