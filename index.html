          <p>The UK government has officially launched a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," a violent confrontation between police and miners during the 1984-85 strike. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper confirmed the inquiry, fulfilling a Labour manifesto promise to address unanswered questions that have persisted for four decades. The investigation will examine the events of June 18, 1984, at a Rotherham coking plant, as well as the subsequent discredited criminal prosecutions against 95 miners. Campaigners, who have sought this inquiry for over a decade, expressed cautious elation at the decision to finally seek truth and accountability for the historic industrial dispute.</p>

          <p>Automotive group Stellantis, which owns brands like Jeep, Fiat, and Peugeot, has announced it anticipates a net loss of €2.3 billion ($2.68 billion) for the first half of 2025. The company cited pre-tax net charges and the initial impact of U.S. tariffs as key factors for the downturn, with projected net revenue falling to €74.3 billion from €85 billion in the same period last year. This preliminary announcement comes after the company suspended its financial guidance in April. Full financial results are scheduled for release on July 29, which will provide a clearer picture of the company's performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alaska Airlines and its subsidiary, Horizon Air, experienced a temporary system-wide ground stop on Sunday evening due to a significant IT outage. The disruption began around 8 p.m. Pacific Time, grounding the entire fleet for approximately three hours before operations were cleared to resume. The airline has warned passengers of potential residual delays and flight impacts as it works to reposition its aircraft and crews. The specific cause of the computer system failure has not yet been disclosed by the carrier, which apologized for the inconvenience to its customers.</p>

          <p>Investors in China are increasingly turning to bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs), pushing the total assets under management in this category past US$50 billion as of June. This surge, up from just $10 billion at the start of last year, is driven by a search for low-risk assets in an economic environment marked by deflation and policy support for corporations. These ETFs offer diversification, lower costs, and better liquidity compared to direct bond investments. The trend reflects investor caution regarding China's economic outlook, with many hedging against unresolved trade tensions and weak domestic consumption. (not investment advice)</p>

Knowsley Council spent nearly £400,000 on safety patrols to keep residents in their homes temporarily.

          <p>Adolfo Macías Villamar, the notorious Ecuadorean gang leader known as "Fito," has been extradited to the United States to face drug and arms trafficking charges. Fito, leader of the Los Choneros gang, was recaptured in June after escaping from a high-security prison where he was serving a 34-year sentence. His gang is blamed for much of the violent crime that has plagued Ecuador and is also suspected in the 2023 assassination of a presidential candidate. His extradition represents a major step in President Daniel Noboa's crackdown on organized crime.</p>

          <p>A growing class of weight loss and diabetes drugs, known as GLP-1s, could be a game-changer for women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common hormonal disorder. Women with PCOS often suffer from irregular periods, infertility, and metabolic issues, and many report significant symptom improvement after taking drugs like Ozempic or Zepbound. Researchers believe the drugs help by improving insulin sensitivity and promoting weight loss, which in turn can help rebalance hormone levels. While larger clinical trials are needed, early results and anecdotal evidence suggest a major new therapeutic avenue for this underserved condition.</p>

          <p>A stark contrast is emerging between the United States and China on energy policy, particularly concerning the green transition. As global energy demand rises, driven partly by power-intensive technologies like AI, Beijing is accelerating its investment in renewable energy to secure a technological lead. In contrast, the Trump administration is actively canceling tax credits for wind and solar power, labeling them as unreliable sources that compromise the American electric grid. This policy divergence highlights a key area of strategic competition between the two global powers, with significant implications for the future of climate and technology.</p>

          <p>Former UFC champion Ronda Rousey continues to stand by her political beliefs and refuses to apologize for them. The article recounts her 2015 support for Bernie Sanders, citing his refusal of corporate campaign money as a key reason. It also reveals that she made a promise to UFC President Dana White not to speak negatively about Donald Trump, due to Trump's early support for the UFC. Rousey, who considers herself to owe White her career, has honored that promise. She has also encouraged people to exercise their right to vote, emphasizing the importance of participation in democracy.</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened to obstruct a deal for the Washington Commanders to build a new stadium in Washington, D.C., unless the NFL team changes its name back to the "Redskins." In a social media post, Trump claimed there is a "big clamoring" for the change and that he might put a restriction on the project if the team does not comply. The team dropped its previous name in 2020 following years of criticism that it was a racist slur against Indigenous people. It is currently unclear what authority Trump would have to intervene in the stadium project.</p>

          <p>A Delta Connection regional jet, operated by SkyWest, was forced to make an abrupt evasive maneuver to avoid a potential mid-air collision with a B-52 bomber near Minot, North Dakota. The incident occurred on July 18 as the passenger flight was on its final approach to the airport, which is near an Air Force base. The pilot later apologized to passengers, explaining the bomber appeared unexpectedly and he had to turn sharply to avoid it. Both SkyWest and the U.S. Air Force have stated they are investigating the matter to determine how the two aircraft came into such close proximity.</p>

          <p>Canada is currently experiencing a significant measles outbreak, with over 3,800 confirmed cases in 2025, making it a hotspot for the virus in the Western Hemisphere. This figure is nearly three times the number of cases in the much more populous United States, placing Canada among the top 10 countries with outbreaks globally. The surge, the worst since the disease was declared eliminated in Canada in 1998, is concentrated in provinces like Alberta and Ontario. Health officials attribute the rapid spread to low vaccination rates, fueled by vaccine hesitancy and misinformation that has grown since the pandemic.</p>
