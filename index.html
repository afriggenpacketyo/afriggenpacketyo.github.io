          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stated that Vladimir Putin is not preparing to end the war, citing intelligence that suggests Russia is redeploying troops for new offensive operations. This assessment comes just before a planned peace summit in Alaska between Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump, which Ukrainian representatives are not expected to attend. Zelenskyy emphasized that Kyiv will not cede territory or abandon its NATO ambitions, viewing Moscow's demands as an attempt to partition Ukraine. Trump has described the upcoming meeting as a preliminary discussion to gauge the possibility of a deal.</p>

          <p>A severe and unusual frost in Turkey, the world's largest hazelnut producer, has significantly damaged the 2025 crop, causing prices to surge over 35%. This shortage poses a major challenge for confectioners like Ferrero, the maker of Nutella, which uses about a quarter of the global hazelnut supply. The price spike could lead to recipe changes, smaller product sizes, or increased costs for consumers for popular items like Nutella and Ferrero Rocher. The incident highlights the vulnerability of global food supply chains to climate change and unpredictable weather events.</p>

          <p>The National Republican Congressional Campaign Committee (NRCC) has released a satirical memo mocking House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and the Democratic party's "Project 2026" goals. The memo portrays Democratic policies as wildly unpopular, focusing on themes like open borders, wasteful spending, and what it terms "woke" initiatives. In response, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) accused Republicans of attempting to distract from their own "failed leadership" and unpopular policies. This exchange highlights the escalating political rhetoric between the two parties as they position themselves for the upcoming midterm elections.</p>

          <p>Some schools in the United States are adopting the "Singapore math" curriculum, a teaching method that has consistently placed Singaporean students at the top of international math assessments. This approach de-emphasizes rote memorization in favor of a slower, more conceptual learning process that uses physical objects and drawings to build a deep understanding of mathematical principles. Proponents argue this method fosters better problem-solving skills and a greater appreciation for the subject. While the U.S. has varied educational standards, schools implementing the Singaporean model report positive results in student growth and confidence.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's job market is continuing to cool, with official figures showing a 5.8% drop in vacancies between May and July, reaching the lowest level since early 2021. The data from the Office for National Statistics also indicates a slight decrease in the number of people on company payrolls, suggesting some firms are slowing down recruitment. Despite this, wage growth remained steady at 5% and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.7%, indicating a gradual rather than sharp slowdown. Economists suggest this cooling could influence the Bank of England's future decisions on interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated E.J. Antoni, an economist from the conservative Heritage Foundation, to head the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The move comes shortly after the president fired the previous commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, following a jobs report that was weaker than expected. Antoni has been a vocal critic of the BLS's methodology and has been supported by former Trump strategist Steve Bannon. The nomination has drawn sharp criticism from some economists who argue Antoni is an extreme partisan and lacks the necessary qualifications, raising concerns about the future integrity and non-partisanship of the agency.</p>

          <p>The parents of Harvey Willgoose, a 15-year-old boy stabbed to death by a fellow student at a Sheffield school, are calling for the court to lift the anonymity order protecting his 15-year-old killer. Following the guilty verdict for murder, Harvey's mother argued that since her son's name was used throughout the trial, the defendant's should be as well to ensure fairness. The family has also reiterated their call for increased school safety measures, such as knife arches, to address the issue of weapons in schools. A judge will decide on the anonymity order when the killer is sentenced in October.</p>

The White House stated the extension provides more time for negotiations aimed at addressing trade imbalances and what it calls unfair practices.

          <h2>Spain's Foreign Policy on Defense and China Creates Tensions with U.S.</h2>

          <p>Spain is taking a foreign policy path that is creating friction with the Trump administration, becoming a rare European nation willing to openly challenge the U.S. The Spanish government has resisted committing to NATO's 5% defense spending target, opted for European over U.S. fighter jets, and pursued closer economic ties with China. Analysts suggest Spain's minority leftist government may be using foreign policy to distract from domestic issues. Despite threats from President Trump, Spain has been largely shielded from direct consequences like tariffs due to its membership in the EU, which negotiates trade deals collectively.</p>

          <h2>Investigation Reveals NHS Used Knee Implant Known to Have High Failure Rate for Years</h2>

          <p>A specific knee-replacement implant component used in thousands of UK operations had a concerning failure rate that was known for eight years before it was withdrawn, a BBC investigation found. Patients who received the NexGen implant, made by Zimmer Biomet, reported severe pain and immobility after the device slipped out of place, leading to hundreds of corrective surgeries. Concerns were first flagged by the National Joint Registry in 2014, but the component was not recalled until 2022. The case raises serious questions about patient safety and the timeliness of the manufacturer's and regulator's response to known problems.</p>

          <p>The trial examining the legality of President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles protests has begun, with a commanding general testifying he never heard the situation described as a "rebellion." The lawsuit, filed by California's governor, questions whether the deployment violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars domestic military law enforcement. The Trump administration justified the action under a law allowing for troop use during a "rebellion." The general's testimony challenges a key premise of the federal government's legal argument for federalizing the state's National Guard troops.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has stated that Republicans are considering adding even more GOP-leaning congressional districts than the five already proposed. In an interview, Abbott defended the potential for aggressive gerrymandering by comparing it to tactics used in Democratic-controlled states like California and Illinois. He also criticized Texas Democrats for breaking quorum to prevent a vote on the new maps. The comments indicate that the Republican party in Texas is exploring maximizing its political advantage through redistricting, further intensifying the partisan battle over the state's electoral maps.</p>

          <p>A Ukrainian drone firm, Wild Hornets, has released video showing its "Sting" interceptor drone reaching speeds up to 195 mph (315 km/h). This low-cost, first-person-view (FPV) drone is designed to chase down and destroy the Iranian-designed Shahed loitering munitions used by Russia. Speed is a critical factor for interceptors, and the Sting's velocity is comparable to that of a bullet train, making it a potentially effective countermeasure. The development showcases Ukraine's rapid innovation in drone technology as it seeks cheaper and more scalable ways to bolster its air defenses against Russian attacks.</p>
