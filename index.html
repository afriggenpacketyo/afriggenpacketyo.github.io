            <p>The UN warns that Asian crime syndicates behind multi-billion-dollar cyber scam operations are expanding globally, targeting victims through investment, cryptocurrency, and romance scams. These operations, primarily based in Southeast Asia, involve sprawling compounds where trafficked workers are forced to con people online. The UNODC urges international action to address this issue, noting that countries in East and Southeast Asia lost an estimated $37 billion to cyber fraud in 2023.

            <p>US stocks tumbled and the dollar weakened after President Trump renewed his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Trump's call for lower interest rates and potential actions to dismiss Powell raised concerns about the Fed's autonomy. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite all experienced significant declines. Uncertainty over Trump's tariffs and trade policies also contributed to the market downturn, causing investors to retreat from US markets. The situation reflects growing anxieties about economic stability and policy decisions.</p>
