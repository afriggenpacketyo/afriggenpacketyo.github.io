        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite ongoing diplomatic efforts, a resolution between Russia and Ukraine remains elusive as Russia intensifies attacks, including a drone strike on a civilian bus that resulted in nine deaths. President Trump announced plans to engage with Presidents Putin and Zelensky, as well as NATO leaders, to push for a ceasefire. Russia insists on Ukraine withdrawing from annexed eastern regions and limiting its military capabilities, while Ukraine seeks an immediate, unconditional ceasefire followed by peace negotiations. The United States has expressed openness to any mechanism that could foster lasting peace in the region, emphasizing its commitment to resolving the conflict, which has defined Putin's rule and destabilized Europe since February 2022.</p>

          <p>A Mexican Navy sailing vessel, the Cuauhtémoc, collided with the underside of the Brooklyn Bridge during a goodwill tour, leading to the deaths of two crew members and injuring at least 22 others, some critically. The ship, carrying 277 people, reportedly lost power and drifted into the bridge supports. The incident prompted a brief closure of the bridge as authorities assessed the damage, which Commissioner Rodriguez confirmed was not major. The NTSB is conducting a full investigation into the crash, and the ship is currently docked at Pier 36 while authorities determine its next steps. The Cuauhtémoc was en route to Iceland after departing from Pier 17 in Manhattan.</p>

          <p>Conan O'Brien and Ryan Reynolds playfully mocked Meghan Markle's entry into the jam industry on O'Brien's podcast, likening it to Reynolds' father's former role as a food broker. The comedians joked about the luxury jams being made from the 'oils of Montecito,' referencing Markle's new lifestyle brand, As Ever. This follows criticism of Markle's venture as inauthentic, with PR experts noting the brand lacks the relatability or aspiration found in successful lifestyle brands like Martha Stewart and Rachael Ray. The experts say that authenticity is critical for marketability, which Markle needs to succeed in the lifestyle industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite India's military actions against Pakistan this month, the conflict has strategically set back India's aspirations as a diplomatic and economic power, equating it with Pakistan, a smaller nation accused of sponsoring terrorism. The ongoing conflict, rooted in the 78-year division between the two nations, distracts India from focusing on its broader strategic goals, particularly concerning China. The rise of religious nationalism in both countries has hardened views and made reconciliation more difficult, limiting India's ability to show restraint. The United States and China's involvement further complicates the situation, with the US supporting India and China backing Pakistan.</p>

          <p>Born in 1925, Malcolm X, advocating resistance against Black oppression 'by any means necessary,' remains an icon of the civil rights movement. His experiences with racism, including a teacher's discouragement from pursuing law, shaped his activism. Joining the Nation of Islam (NOI), he denounced 'white devils,' later breaking with the NOI after a pilgrimage to Mecca altered his views on race. Today, with increasing historical whitewashing, Malcolm X's message, urging critical patriotism and facing reality, remains relevant amidst ongoing racial tensions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study in Bangladesh reveals that a simple change in brick stacking methods could significantly reduce air pollution from traditional kilns. By stacking bricks in a zig-zag pattern to improve airflow and ensuring consistent coal delivery, kilns can operate more efficiently and reduce fuel use by approximately 23 percent. This intervention not only lowers carbon dioxide and particulate matter emissions but also improves worker conditions and increases profits for kiln owners. Researchers are now collaborating with the Bangladeshi government to expand this training and implement these low-cost interventions across the country.</p>

These colleges play a crucial role in serving low-income and first-generation students in rural communities where access to higher education is limited. Efforts are underway to foster collaboration and increase visibility for the contributions of religious colleges, with some experiencing enrollment gains due to growing political divisions and ideological attacks on secular institutions.</p>

          <p>CATL, the world's largest EV battery maker, is expanding into clean energy technologies, including mobile EV charging robots, to diversify its business ahead of its Hong Kong IPO. The company aims to be a pioneer in the new-energy industry by creating a closed-loop ecosystem encompassing power generation, storage, and conversion. Its Shanghai-based unit, CharGo, plans to deploy thousands of charging robots globally, targeting markets in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Europe by 2026. The company's IPO could raise as much as HK$41 billion, and while EV batteries remain its largest revenue source, energy storage systems are a growing segment.</p>

          <p>Dan Richards contrasts Europe's revitalized sleeper train network, driven by climate consciousness and high-speed rail investments, with America's car-centric culture and underfunded public transport. He argues that America's focus on cars and niche transportation projects neglects the potential of trains for community, connection, and environmental sustainability. While Europe values and invests in rail infrastructure, the US lags behind, prioritizing individual freedom over collective and ecological benefits. The author urges America to rediscover and rebuild its railways, offering a more sustainable and connected future.</p>

The election tests the strength of other political forces, including the far right, and comes after reports of foreign interference during the campaign. The president's role in foreign and security policy, along with the power to veto legislation, makes the election outcome crucial for Poland's future.</p>

Under Newsom's plan, Medi-Cal would suspend access to comprehensive services for undocumented adults over 19, although limited services like pregnancy and emergency care would remain available.
