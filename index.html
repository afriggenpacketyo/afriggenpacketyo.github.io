          <p>Fast-fashion retailer Shein has launched an investigation after an image bearing the likeness of Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, was used to model a shirt on its website. The image, which appeared to be AI-generated or manipulated, was swiftly removed, and Shein is scrutinizing its third-party vendor, emphasizing stringent listing standards. This incident underscores a controversial "dark fandom" that has emerged around Mangione, fueled by public anger towards America's private health insurers, leading to similar product controversies on platforms like Etsy and Amazon. The ongoing murder and stalking case has gripped social media, prompting anonymous donations for his defense and drawing scrutiny to the ethics of AI-generated content and its potential for misuse.</p>

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano recently erupted, sending lava 500 feet into the air from its summit crater within Hawaii Volcanoes National State Park. This event, the 32nd in an ongoing eruption, produced approximately 337 million cubic feet of molten rock over a 13-hour period, covering a significant portion of the crater floor. Although the lava was contained within the protected and uninhabited area, the U.S. Geological Survey issued warnings about high levels of sulfur dioxide gas, which creates volcanic smog and can cause respiratory issues far downwind. Other hazards, including volcanic glass and fragments, are also a concern, potentially affecting areas up to 10 miles from the vent.</p>

          <p>In an exceptionally rare series of events, D.C. grand juries have rejected at least four Justice Department requests for indictments in the past week, including a high-profile case involving Nathalie Rose Jones, accused of an Instagram threat against President Trump. Former federal prosecutors expressed astonishment, suggesting a significant breakdown in the Justice Department's credibility with D.C. jurors, potentially due to perceived politicization. Other rejected cases included an alleged assault on a federal agent and interference with an immigration transfer, leading to dismissals or lesser charges. This trend raises concerns about the grand jury's vital function as a constitutional safeguard and a critical check on prosecutorial discretion, as guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment.</p>

          <p>President Trump indicated plans to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago, stating, "We're going in," as part of his controversial federal anti-crime initiative. This potential move, possibly without the state governor's request, has drawn strong pushback from Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who called Trump's comments "unhinged" and vowed legal challenges. The president argues for intervention due to violent crime rates, while Pritzker cites recent reductions in crime statistics. This potential deployment follows similar federal actions in Washington D.C. and Los Angeles, raising significant legal questions about presidential authority over state Guard forces and the role of federal law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Alphabet shares surged 9% following a U.S. District Judge's ruling that largely favored Google in its antitrust case, avoiding the Department of Justice's proposed breakup. Although Google was found to hold an illegal monopoly in internet search, the judge rejected calls to divest its Chrome browser or Android operating system. The company can also continue making payments for preloading products, crucially maintaining its lucrative deal with Apple to be the default search engine on iPhones. This decision is viewed as a "monster win" for Google, significantly reducing regulatory uncertainty and bolstering investor confidence in its core search business and its ambitious AI initiatives, such as Gemini.

          <p>Senator Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, criticized the Trump administration's decision to take a 10% stake in chipmaker Intel, labeling the $8.9 billion investment "a step towards socialism." This move, where the government purchased Intel common stock at a discount, has raised concerns among conservative lawmakers like Paul, who have historically opposed extensive government involvement in the free market. It follows other instances of the Trump administration exerting influence in the private sector, including stakes in rare-earth miner MP Materials and a "golden share" in U.S. Steel. Paul expressed worry that such policies are diminishing the free market principles traditionally central to the Republican Party. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cholera, an ancient and easily treatable disease, is experiencing a severe resurgence across Africa, with cases more than doubling in three years to over 230,000 across 23 countries. This alarming increase, driven by factors like conflict, poverty, and climate change impacting clean water access, has prompted African leaders to launch a $231 million emergency plan with the World Health Organization. The initiative, operating at a presidential level, aims to coordinate efforts across ministries and countries to improve water infrastructure and distribute an estimated 10 million oral cholera vaccine doses. The plan's long-term goal is to eliminate cholera as a major public health issue by 2030, despite current challenges in vaccine supply and access to care.</p>

          <p>A theft charge against Parviz Jafari, who was accused of stealing flowers from tributes left for rock legend Ozzy Osbourne in Birmingham city center, has been dropped by prosecutors. The court was informed that a security guard had actually granted Jafari permission to take the flowers, thereby undermining the prosecution's ability to prove dishonesty, a key element for conviction. The incident occurred amidst thousands of floral tributes left near the Black Sabbath bench and mural following Osbourne's death in July at age 76. This resolution clarifies a minor legal matter that arose from the public outpouring of grief for the iconic heavy metal pioneer, bringing closure to the case.</p>

Her resurgence follows a challenging period, including a 14-month break after childbirth and a discouraging Wimbledon exit where she felt apathetic. A key factor in her turnaround was hiring Polish coach Tomasz Wiktorowski, known for guiding Iga Swiatek. Osaka attributes her renewed success to a more encouraging coaching approach, which has restored her renowned ball-striking, confidence, and fighting spirit. This shift has allowed her to enjoy the game again, evident in her strong performances and improved statistics against top opponents, marking a significant comeback.</p>

These individuals, some of whom fled Putin's war and repression, were reportedly shackled and transferred via Cairo to Moscow, where they faced interrogation by Russia's federal security services. Human rights activists are appealing to US authorities to halt these deportations, highlighting the severe risks faced by those returned, including immediate arrest and potential imprisonment for charges like desertion. The practice has intensified significantly under President Trump, despite an 85% asylum grant rate for Russians in 2024, prompting calls for intervention from international opposition figures.</p>

Rayner asserts she acted on flawed legal advice, a claim that forms the basis of her defense against calls for her resignation and an independent investigation into potential breaches of the ministerial code. While Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has robustly defended her, emphasizing her vital role in his political project, the incident fuels public perception of "one rule for them and another for us," a potent political attack.
