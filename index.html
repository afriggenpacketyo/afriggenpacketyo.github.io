        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Exxon Mobil's first-quarter earnings exceeded Wall Street forecasts, although profits decreased compared to the previous year due to falling crude oil prices driven by concerns over President Trump's tariffs impacting global demand. Volume growth in the Permian Basin and Guyana, along with cost-cutting efforts, helped offset the negative impact of lower oil prices. The company reported earnings per share of $1.76 versus the expected $1.73, with revenues at $83.13 billion, falling short of the $86.72 billion expectation. Exxon returned $9.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Reform UK, an anti-immigration party, has made significant gains in recent UK local elections, including winning a parliamentary seat from the Labour Party by a narrow margin. The results indicate a decline in support for the Labour Party since it took power last July, as well as a broader fragmentation of the political landscape. Reform UK, formerly known as the Brexit Party, advocates for strict immigration controls and withdrawal from global environmental commitments. The party's success signals a potential shift in British politics, capitalizing on voter dissatisfaction with both Labour and Conservative parties.</p>

          <p>According to the New York Times article, U.S. oil companies reported their lowest first-quarter profits in years, impacted by President Trump's trade policies that have lowered oil prices and increased material costs.

Companies are cutting costs and seeking local supplies to mitigate the effects of tariffs, while Chevron is working to wind down activity in Venezuela due to policy changes.</p>

          <p>PayPal's stock has declined 24% in 2025 despite reporting mixed first-quarter financial results, with revenue slightly up but below expectations, and EPS beating expectations. The company is focusing on driving profitable growth, with Venmo showing strong revenue growth. While PayPal has a strong brand and competitive advantages, increased competition creates uncertainty. CEO Alex Chriss stated that PayPal had a great start to the year and its strategy is working, adding that this is the fifth consecutive quarter of profitable growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to the New York Times article, Russell Brand appeared in a London court on sexual assault charges, including two counts of sexual assault. The hearing was the first step in what are expected to be lengthy criminal proceedings. Brand has denied all charges, stating that he has "never engaged in nonconsensual activity". The case has been referred to a higher court, and any trial might only begin "a year from now" due to a backlog of cases in Britain’s judicial system.</p>

          <p>A lynx born in a zoo in Cornwall could become the first UK zoo-born cat to be successfully released into the wild, and has been moved to Germany where it will spend the next few months being monitored in an enclosure to see if it's up to the challenge. The lynx-breeding coordinator for the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP), matches females and males from across the continent as well as finding new homes for their offspring. Usually Dina's lynxes have been raised from birth with the minimum of human contact, specifically with release in mind.</p>

          <p>As reported in the Los Angeles Times article, Florida and other states are loosening child labor laws, driven by business lobbying groups and right-wing think tanks. These measures allow teens to work longer hours and in more hazardous jobs. The Trump administration is likely to reduce enforcement of child labor protections, potentially leading to more violations and injuries. Critics argue this rollback is a moral test for America, bringing back an "ancient atrocity" in the name of parental rights and economic expediency.</p>

          <p>Christina Li's "The Manor of Dreams" is a Gothic haunted house novel featuring two families brought together by the will of a deceased Oscar-winning actress. The story unfolds in a crumbling mansion in Altadena, where secrets and ghostly occurrences affect each character differently. The novel delves into themes of family, exploitation, and identity, with a surprising queer romance woven throughout the narrative. While the attempt to connect the haunting to the exploitation of Chinese migrants falls short, the book is a swift and enjoyable read.</p>

The study, focused on brain and vascular conditions related to dementia, was initially terminated due to "artificial and non-scientific categories" but funding was later restored following an appeal.

Weber criticizes the SAVE Act, recently approved by the House, as a voter suppression tactic that would disenfranchise millions of eligible voters, particularly those in underserved communities, military families, and individuals who have changed their names. She argues that the act's unnecessary documentation requirements would create barriers to voting, likening it to "Jim Crow 2.0." Weber emphasizes that voter fraud is virtually nonexistent and that existing state measures already ensure election security.
