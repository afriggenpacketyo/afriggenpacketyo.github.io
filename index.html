          <p>A year after Hurricane Helene caused devastating flooding in eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina, a group of whitewater raft guides has transitioned to 'professional trash ladies' to clean up the Nolichucky River. The storm's remnants caused unprecedented geological changes, forcing most rafting companies to close. State-funded grants now enable outfitters to employ guides for debris removal, clearing railroad tracks, house fragments, and hazardous materials. This article highlights community resilience and environmental restoration efforts, with hopes for the river's reopening in 2026.</p>

          <p>An American Airlines pilot aborted takeoff at Los Angeles International Airport after an AeroLogic cargo plane inadvertently crossed the runway in front of it.

          <p>Democrats are proposing a potential short-term compromise to avert a government shutdown, suggesting a 7-10 day funding extension to allow for further negotiations. This article reports that Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and others are weighing options ahead of a White House meeting with President Trump. Democrats insist any agreement must address expiring Affordable Care Act tax credits, while Republicans maintain that health and funding issues should be separate.

          <p>This article analyzes the Democrats' strategy in the impending government shutdown, suggesting they are calling President Trump's bluff regarding mass federal worker firings. White House budget director Russell Vought had instructed agencies to consider permanent layoffs, particularly in departments not aligned with Trump's agenda. However, the article argues Trump lacks greater legal authority during a shutdown for permanent firings and that such moves would be politically explosive. Democrats are refusing a clean spending bill, demanding healthcare provisions, betting that Trump's threats are exaggerated.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has reiterated his threat to impose a 100% tariff on films not made in the U.S., claiming the American industry has been 'stolen' by other countries. This article analyzes the complexities and potential consequences of such a tariff, noting that movies are services, not goods, making tariff implementation unclear. Industry experts express concerns about chaos, retaliatory measures from other countries, and increased production costs. Many productions moved overseas due to tax incentives and lower labor costs, a trend California is trying to reverse with its own incentives.</p>

          <p>While past government shutdowns had minimal economic impact, this time could be different due to President Trump's threat of permanent federal worker furloughs. This article explains that if Trump follows through, it could significantly affect the already precarious employment picture, especially in the Washington, D.C. area. Beyond direct job losses, a prolonged shutdown could delay the release of crucial economic data from the Labor Department, impacting cost-of-living adjustments and Federal Reserve policy decisions. Economists generally anticipate a mild overall impact, but acknowledge new uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

Netanyahu affirmed Israel would 'finish the job' against Hamas, ensuring Gaza's demilitarization and Israeli security responsibility.
