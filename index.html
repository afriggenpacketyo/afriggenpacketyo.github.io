          <p>Devastating flash floods in Central Texas have resulted in what officials are calling a "mass casualty event," with at least 24 fatalities confirmed by the Kerr County Sheriff. The Guadalupe River rose an unprecedented 26 feet in just 45 minutes following intense rainfall, inundating the region and triggering a massive search and rescue operation involving state and local agencies. A significant point of concern is Camp Mystic, an all-girls summer camp where approximately 20 children remain unaccounted for after the sudden deluge destroyed infrastructure and cut off communication. The governor has issued a disaster declaration for the affected counties as emergency crews continue their efforts.</p>

          <p>Several New York City beaches in Queens were temporarily closed on the Fourth of July after multiple shark sightings were reported dangerously close to swimmers. The sightings occurred in Far Rockaway, with one video on social media showing a shark swimming near beachgoers. City officials, including the deputy mayor for public safety, confirmed the closures and noted that drone technology was being used to monitor the situation. This event comes as New York state officials had already increased shark surveillance measures along Long Island beaches ahead of the holiday weekend to ensure public safety.</p>

          <p>As the United States takes aim at China's dominance in the shipbuilding industry, rivals South Korea and Japan are stepping up efforts to revitalize their own sectors. South Korea's new presidential administration has labeled the domestic industry as being in a "major crisis" and has outlined policies to support it. The government's growth guidelines focus on developing future vessels, such as autonomous and eco-friendly ships, through enhanced digitalization and automation. These measures are intended to help South Korea create a maritime power that can effectively compete with and lead the global market.</p>

          <p>A controversial Connecticut law that permits towing companies to sell seized vehicles just 15 days after they are towed is facing sharp criticism from residents who label it as predatory. Critics argue that private tow operators are targeting working-class and low-income neighborhoods, where residents may struggle to quickly pay the hundreds of dollars in fees required to retrieve their cars. The article highlights the story of a couple who lost their car and organized a neighborhood watch against one specific company, MyHoopty.com LLC. The owner of the towing company defends his actions, stating he is simply enforcing the rules of private apartment complexes.</p>

          <p>The Madre Fire in a rural area of San Luis Obispo County, California, has rapidly expanded to over 70,800 acres, making it the largest wildfire in the state this year. The blaze, which is only 10% contained, is being fueled by hot and windy conditions and currently threatens approximately 50 structures, prompting evacuation orders for over 200 people. This fire is significantly larger than other recent deadly fires in the state, such as the Palisades and Eaton fires. Over 600 personnel, dozens of fire engines, and air tankers from across California are actively engaged in battling the fire, with its cause still under investigation.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed his signature tax and spending bill into law, making his 2017 tax cuts permanent while enacting major spending cuts to social safety-net programs. The legislation also provides significant funding for border security and defense. Despite Republican support, the bill faced strong opposition from Democrats, who warn it will primarily benefit the wealthy and could lead to up to 17 million people losing health insurance coverage. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects the bill will add over $3 trillion to the national debt, a figure that has drawn criticism and concern over the nation's long-term fiscal health.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to some claims, President Trump's newly passed tax and spending bill does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits. Instead, the legislation introduces a new temporary "bonus" tax deduction for seniors, which can lower their overall taxable income. This deduction is up to $6,000 for individuals aged 65 and older with incomes below $75,000, but it does not alter the fundamental way Social Security benefits are taxed. Policy experts note that this approach provides some relief but primarily benefits higher-income seniors, while many low-income recipients who already pay no federal income tax will see no change.</p>

The discovery was made after coroner's personnel gained access to the site, though no positive identifications have been confirmed yet.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the path for the Trump administration to deport a group of migrants with criminal records who are currently being held at a naval base in Djibouti. The high court clarified a previous order, effectively removing legal barriers that had prevented their removal to a third country, South Sudan, with which they have no ties. This decision follows a protracted legal battle where a lower court judge had initially blocked the deportations, citing due process concerns. In a dissenting opinion, Justice Sonia Sotomayor expressed grave concern for the migrants' safety, stating they could face torture or death upon arrival.</p>

          <p>Italian luxury brand Prada is facing accusations of cultural appropriation after releasing a line of sandals that bear a striking resemblance to traditional, handcrafted Kolhapuri sandals from India. Local artisans, who earn very little for their craft, were angered that the design's origins were not acknowledged, prompting a social media backlash. The controversy has drawn attention to the struggles of the approximately 5,000 artisans in Kolhapur, who work in difficult conditions for low wages.

          <p>New research highlights the crucial role of tiny, often overlooked sea creatures called zooplankton in mitigating global warming. These animals engage in an epic annual migration in the Southern Ocean, gorging on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the surface before sinking deep into the ocean to burn their fat reserves. This process effectively locks away vast amounts of carbon, equivalent to the annual emissions of about 55 million cars, preventing it from entering the atmosphere. Scientists describe these creatures as "unsung heroes," but warn that their populations are facing growing threats just as their significant contribution to the planet's health is being fully understood.</p>

          <p>An investigation by BBC News has exposed a criminal network in southern England that systematically forges wills to steal millions of pounds from the estates of deceased individuals. The fraudsters exploit weaknesses in the UK's probate system by identifying unclaimed estates on a public government register, then producing fake wills naming a member of the gang as the sole heir. The report details multiple cases where rightful heirs were cheated out of their inheritance, with criminals also committing tax fraud by undervaluing estates. The investigation highlights how the digitization of the probate application process has made it easier for these fraudulent claims to go undetected.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy reveals that the tax cuts in President Trump's major spending bill disproportionately benefit the wealthiest Americans, with the largest windfalls concentrated in specific states. The top 1% of households in Wyoming, South Dakota, and Texas are projected to receive average tax cuts exceeding $100,000. This is largely because the bill's benefits, such as business tax breaks and estate tax exemptions, favor high earners, while the impact of the increased SALT deduction cap is minimal in states with no income tax. Conversely, the wealthiest in high-tax states like California and New Jersey will see smaller average cuts.</p>

          <p>Oasis launched their highly anticipated reunion tour in Cardiff with a performance that critics are calling refreshed, rejuvenated, and their best since the 1990s. The band, fronted by brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher, tore through classics like "Wonderwall" and "Live Forever" for a crowd of 70,000 fans, burying a decades-long feud. Liam Gallagher's vocals were noted as particularly powerful, putting to rest concerns about past vocal issues. While maintaining their characteristic stoic stage presence, the emotional weight of their reconciliation was palpable, culminating in a brief hug between the brothers as they left the stage after a two-hour show.</p>

          <p>Hamas has reportedly delivered a "positive response" to the latest Gaza ceasefire and hostage release proposal, stating it is ready to enter negotiations. According to a senior Palestinian official, the group accepted the general framework but has requested key amendments. These include a U.S. guarantee that hostilities will not resume if permanent ceasefire talks fail, and a demand that all humanitarian aid be distributed exclusively by the UN. The US-backed plan is believed to involve a 60-day ceasefire and the staggered release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, though Israel has not yet formally responded to Hamas's latest position.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in downtown Los Angeles on the Fourth of July to protest the Trump administration's immigration raids and the recent passage of a budget bill that significantly funds them. Many protestors said they were forgoing traditional holiday celebrations to voice their opposition, with some dressing in costumes like a shackled Lady Liberty. The rally moved from City Hall to the Federal Building, where marchers chanted against deportations. The protest reflects heightened tensions in the region following weeks of ICE enforcement actions and the deployment of the National Guard, which has drawn criticism from local and state officials.</p>

          <p>Germany secured a victory against Poland in their Women's Euro 2025 opening match, but the win was overshadowed by a potentially serious injury to captain Giulia Gwinn. The Bayern Munich fullback, who has a history of two ACL injuries, left the pitch in tears during the first half after appearing to injure her knee. While goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller sealed the win, the team's performance was at times wasteful. The loss of Gwinn, a key player and the face of the squad, casts a shadow over Germany's tournament prospects as they await MRI results to determine the extent of the damage.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that will increase entry fees for international tourists visiting U.S. national parks and give American citizens preferential treatment in park lotteries or permitting rules. The order states that revenue from the higher fees will be used for infrastructure improvements at federal recreation sites. Additionally, the order revokes a 2017 memorandum from the Obama administration that promoted diversity and inclusion efforts in the management of public lands. This move aligns with the Trump administration's broader policy of ending government diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs.</p>

          <p>India is leveraging its position within Global South alliances like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) to challenge China's regional leadership. During a recent meeting of SCO defense chiefs, India's refusal to agree on the language regarding terrorism in a joint statement prevented a consensus, highlighting a key point of divergence with China. Because organizations like the SCO and BRICS require consensus for decision-making, India can effectively block initiatives and assert its own foreign policy priorities. This dynamic complicates China's efforts to project undisputed leadership across these significant international forums.</p>

          <p>An interventional cardiologist with over 20 years of experience has shared a list of five common foods he avoids feeding his children to promote long-term heart health. The list includes microwave popcorn, due to chemicals in the bag lining; flavored yogurts, for their high sugar content; and processed meats like bacon and deli meat, which are loaded with sodium and nitrates. He also advises against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which can fuel inflammation. Instead, he recommends healthier alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain Greek yogurt with fruit, lean proteins, and using an air fryer for a crispy texture.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team kept their T20 series against India alive with a dramatic five-run victory in the final moments at The Oval. Chasing 172, India needed six runs off the last ball, but England seamer Lauren Bell secured the win by having captain Harmanpreet Kaur caught. The match was a rollercoaster, with England initially racing to 137-0 thanks to half-centuries from Sophia Dunkley and Danni Wyatt-Hodge, before a stunning collapse saw them lose nine wickets for just 31 runs. Despite a chaotic fielding performance with multiple dropped catches, England's bowlers held their nerve to narrow the series deficit to 2-1.</p>

          <p>Thomas Partey, a Ghanaian international footballer whose contract with Arsenal recently ended, has been formally charged with multiple counts of sexual assault. The charges, which Partey denies, stem from a police investigation that began in February 2022 and involve allegations from three different women regarding incidents between 2021 and 2022. According to his lawyer, the footballer has cooperated with the investigation and "welcomes the opportunity to finally clear his name." He is scheduled to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court in early August to face the charges.</p>
