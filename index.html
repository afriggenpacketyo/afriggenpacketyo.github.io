          <p>Several mainland Chinese companies, including humanoid-robotics start-up Unitree, are considering initial public offerings (IPOs) or secondary listings in Hong Kong, signaling a potential boost for the city's fundraising efforts. Unitree's founder expressed interest to Hong Kong's chief executive, while companies like Suzhou Novosense Microelectronics and Fibocom Wireless have firm plans to list. Bubble-tea chain Auntea Jenny recently launched its Hong Kong IPO, aiming to raise up to HK$270 million despite a slight revenue drop last year. These listings could help Hong Kong regain its position as a leading global fundraising destination.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that President Trump's tariffs, intended to protect the U.S. auto industry, risk isolating it from global innovation in electrification, digitization, and automation. China's significant advancements in next-generation vehicles, supported by state subsidies, pose a threat to the American auto industry. The piece suggests that Trump's policies create a 'Luddite trap' by hindering competition and innovation, potentially impacting the economy and national security. The auto industry has historically been a cornerstone of American industrial power, and these policies could undermine its future competitiveness.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pakistan's closure of its airspace to Indian airlines is forcing carriers to reroute flights between India and Europe, North America, Central Asia, and the Middle East, resulting in longer and more expensive journeys. Some flights may require refueling stops or cancellations, with IndiGo temporarily suspending flights to Almaty and Tashkent. The closure stems from heightened tensions following the killing of tourists in Jammu and Kashmir, which India attributes to Pakistani militants. While Indian carriers face challenges, analysts believe airfares may not significantly increase, and the impact may be more symbolic than disruptive.</p>

          <p>Major companies, including mining giants like Rio Tinto and energy majors like BP and Gazprom, are investing in natural hydrogen, also known as white hydrogen. This resource, found naturally beneath the Earth's surface, produces only water when burned and contains no carbon, making it a potentially clean energy source. Exploratory efforts are underway in several countries, with companies hoping to locate viable sources of the gas. While some critics express concerns about environmental impact and distribution challenges, proponents believe natural hydrogen could revolutionize the global energy landscape.</p>

          <p>This article discusses how populist politics, while initially appearing liberating, often result in increased hassle and chaos when applied to real-world problems. Examples include Brexit, which has led to more border controls and paperwork, and stricter immigration policies, which have created new bureaucracies. The Trump administration's attempt to micromanage institutions is also highlighted as an example of populist governments becoming increasingly bureaucratic. The article argues that while some voters are satisfied with seeing elites challenged, others who voted for less government may be disillusioned by the outcome.</p>

Savory pouches often lack sufficient iron, while fruit pouches, despite being labeled as having 'no added sugar', contain high levels of free sugars. Some pouches are also marketed to babies as young as four months, against expert recommendations.</p>

          <p>Japan and Vietnam have agreed to establish a vice-ministerial-level foreign affairs and defense dialogue framework, aiming to enhance security cooperation amid China's increasing military presence. The two nations also plan to collaborate on defense equipment and technology, with Vietnam potentially becoming the fourth recipient of Japan's Official Security Assistance scheme. This move reflects Japan's broader effort to strengthen security ties with ASEAN states in response to China's activities in the South China Sea.

          <p>The NBA admitted that referees missed a foul on Tim Hardaway Jr. in the final play of the Detroit Pistons' 94-93 playoff loss to the New York Knicks. The league acknowledged that a foul should have been called on Josh Hart, which would have awarded Hardaway three free throws with 0.3 seconds remaining. The Knicks now lead the series 3-1. The missed call sparked outrage from the Pistons, who argued that the contact was blatant and impacted the game's outcome.</p>

          <h2>Repowering of Aging Wind Energy Industry Begins Amid Political Challenges</h2>

          <p>Despite President Trump's efforts to hinder the wind energy industry, a 'repowering' era has begun for America's aging wind farms. As the existing infrastructure ages, operators are increasingly choosing to upgrade or replace older turbines with newer, more efficient models, increasing electricity output by up to 50%. This repowering activity provides new opportunities for companies like GE Vernova, Vestas, and Siemens Gamesa. The repowering of existing wind farms presents economic benefits, including no need to acquire property and the ability to generate more electricity with fewer turbines.</p>
