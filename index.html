          <p>President Trump asserted that U.S.-Israeli strikes had completely destroyed Iran's nuclear program, contradicting an early Pentagon analysis suggesting a limited setback. Trump highlighted Iranian reports of significant damage and dismissed the need for further negotiations, stating the "war's done." He likened the strikes to the atomic bombings of Japan during World War II and expressed optimism about future U.S.-Iranian relations, noting their agreement to a ceasefire. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio supported Trump's position, criticizing the leak of the preliminary intelligence report as politically motivated. The president's opponents in Washington, including Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Chris Coons, called for answers and a return to negotiations. Optimism from the president followed after the dust settled.</p>

He met with world leaders at the NATO summit, expressing optimism about the ceasefire and progress in Gaza. Trump also discussed ending the conflict in Ukraine with President Zelenskyy and considered providing Patriot missile defense systems.

          <p>Marcus Monzo was found guilty of murdering 14-year-old Daniel Anjorin with a samurai sword in Hainault, in addition to attempted murder, wounding with intent, and possession of an offensive weapon. The attacks occurred over a 20-minute period, during which witnesses described Monzo as screaming "in delight." Monzo, who had a blue belt in Brazilian jiu jitsu, also attacked a pedestrian, two police officers, and a couple in their home. Monzo claimed to have no memory of the events, attributing his actions to a cannabis-induced psychosis and likening them to the film *The Hunger Games*, but the prosecution argued that self-induced intoxication was no defense for murder.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing a significant decline in its incarceration rate after decades of mass imprisonment. The prison population, which peaked in 2009, has decreased by roughly 60% and is expected to continue falling. This trend is attributed to a decline in crime rates and an aging prison population, with fewer young offenders entering the system. States are encouraged to tear down deteriorated correctional facilities and shift resources from prisons to other policy priorities such as education, which costs less than imprisoning someone for a year.</p>

The project faces challenges, including burying overhead wires, moving water lines, stabilizing an underground creek, and preserving a grove of native oak trees.

Slow-paced games, sweltering players, and complaints about the heat have been recurring themes, with some calling for FIFA to revise scheduling protocols to shift kick-off times to safer periods of the day. FIFA insists it is implementing a preventative concept, including cooling breaks, but many believe more significant changes are needed.

          <p>President Trump, at a NATO summit in the Netherlands, celebrated allies' commitment to dramatically increase defense spending to 5% of GDP. Trump called the agreement "The Hague Defense Commitment," estimating it will add over $1 trillion a year toward common defense. He described it as a "monumental win" for the United States, which he said was previously carrying more than its fair share. Trump emphasized that this commitment is a significant victory for Europe and Western civilization.</p>

          <p>Sales of new single-family homes experienced a significant drop in May, decreasing by 13.7% compared to April, according to the U.S. Census. This decline resulted in a surge in supply, reaching a 9.8-month supply at the current sales rate, the highest level in three years. The median price of a new home sold in May was $426,600, a 3% increase from the previous year. High mortgage rates are contributing to affordability challenges, leading to a decrease in buyer activity. (not investment advice)</p>

For years, Netanyahu wanted to attack Iran, but the United States and his own security chiefs deterred him. Israel used to be deterred from attacking Iran by the threat of retaliation from enemies on its borders, but those threats were beaten back in the last few years of war. Netanyahu's focus on Iran has also benefited him over the years, helping distract from Israel's unresolved conflict with the Palestinians.</p>

          <p>An initial classified assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) found that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months. The assessment indicates that the strikes caused the entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities to be sealed off. Resumption of the enrichment program may be determined by how long it takes Iran to clear the entrances and make repairs to electrical and water supplies. The DIA assessment also indicates some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was moved before the strikes.</p>
