          <p>Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff, key negotiators for President Trump in the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, expressed feeling "a little bit betrayed" by Israeli airstrikes on Qatar during last month's peace talks. Witkoff learned of the strike, which Israel claimed targeted Hamas leadership in Doha, the morning after it occurred. The negotiators stated the strike impeded progress by eroding the confidence of Qataris, who served as a vital link to Hamas. Trump reportedly felt Israel was acting "out of control," believing their actions were not in their long-term interests. Despite the setback, a deal was eventually reached, leading to the release of 20 living hostages and the remains of others.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen secured pole position for the United States Grand Prix sprint race in Austin, narrowly edging out McLaren's Lando Norris by just 0.071 seconds on his final attempt. This significant result highlights Verstappen's persistent challenge for the championship, despite a substantial points gap, following a recent resurgence by his Red Bull team. Drivers reported difficult conditions, including strong gusty winds and a very bumpy track, which tested their control and precision. The qualifying also featured a standout performance from Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg, who achieved a sensational fourth place, indicating a potentially thrilling and unpredictable sprint event.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced the immediate commutation of former New York Representative George Santos's prison sentence for federal fraud and aggravated identity theft charges. Santos, who began serving an 87-month sentence in a New Jersey federal prison in July, had appealed to the Trump administration, asserting that his punishment was politically influenced and excessively severe. This decision is part of a pattern of high-profile clemency acts by Trump for former Republican politicians, including Michael Grimm and John Rowland. The former lawmaker was expelled from Congress in 2023 after a House Ethics Committee report found substantial evidence of law violations, including extensive lies about his background and misuse of campaign funds.</p>

          <h2>The Viral "6-7" Phrase Disrupting Classrooms Explained</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 18:43:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A viral phrase, "six, seven," derived from Philadelphia rapper Skrilla's song "Doot Doot (6 7)," is causing widespread, playful disruption in classrooms and among teens. Despite the rapper stating he never assigned an actual meaning, the term has become a pervasive, seemingly random inside joke, prompting spontaneous shouts and laughter. Educators are reacting differently, with some schools banning the phrase due to classroom disruptions, while others attempt to embrace or simply endure the trend. Social media has amplified its reach, and experts suggest its unusual longevity is partly fueled by the enjoyment children derive from a secret code that playfully frustrates adults.</p>

          <p>After a "very interesting, and cordial" White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President Trump proposed that both Ukraine and Russia should declare victory and "let history decide!" Zelenskyy stated that public discussion of long-range weapons, such as Tomahawks, was avoided to prevent escalation, despite Trump's earlier indication of openness to trading them for Ukrainian drones. Trump also confirmed an upcoming meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest, preceded by advisor-level talks.

While he declined a final statement, he had previously acknowledged the killings and apologized for the pain caused. This execution, Arizona's second this year, aims to provide justice and closure for the surviving family members, though the state has faced past criticism for its death penalty procedures.</p>

          <p>The US-China trade war is increasingly defined by reciprocal threats, blame games, and erratic meeting schedules between Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping, resulting in significant tariff fluctuations. Experts and former government officials attribute these "shock tactics" to a disregard for traditional diplomatic norms, which fosters poor communication and mutual misreadings between the two global powers. The cycle of escalation is evident in recent events, such as Washington's expanded sanctions on blacklisted companies and Beijing's increased export controls on strategic rare earth minerals. This confrontational strategy raises substantial doubts about the prospects for a stable and enduring resolution to the persistent trade conflict.</p>

Acosta, who brokered the controversial plea deal, argued that securing a guilty plea for soliciting sexual assault from a minor, even at the state level, was preferable to risking an acquittal at trial. He highlighted challenges like inconsistent victim testimonies and potential "withering" cross-examination by Epstein's defense team.

The administration contends that federal law permits the president to call upon the Guard when unable to "execute the laws of the United States" or facing "a rebellion." Lawyers argue that "organized and often violent protests" targeting US immigration agents justify the deployment, citing injuries to over 30 officers. However, judges in Chicago and the 7th Circuit Court have rejected these claims, seeing no "danger of rebellion" and accusing the administration of equating protests with riots.</p>

Over half of the cancers identified were at an early stage, when treatment is typically most effective. While these impressive findings suggest a major role for earlier cancer diagnosis, researchers caution that more evidence from large-scale studies, such as the ongoing NHS trial, is required to definitively prove a reduction in cancer mortality.</p>

          <p>Northampton Saints ascended to the top of the Prem table with a convincing 36-19 victory against Newcastle Red Bulls, who are still seeking their first league win of the season. Saints secured a five-try bonus point, an impressive feat given they spent half an hour of the match with a man disadvantage due to JJ van der Mescht receiving two yellow cards. Despite Newcastle drawing within two points twice during these periods, they ultimately failed to fully capitalize. This defeat prolongs Newcastle's league victory drought, which dates back to November of the previous year, while Northampton continues its strong, unbeaten run in the competition.</p>

          <p>Comedians Kumail Nanjiani and Ilana Glazer withdrew from performing at Salesforce’s annual Dreamforce tech conference after CEO Marc Benioff made controversial remarks supporting President Trump's suggestion to deploy the National Guard to San Francisco. Benioff subsequently apologized and walked back his comments, clarifying they stemmed from caution for the event, but the backlash had already begun. Both comedians have historically been critical of Trump and his policies. This incident underscored the immediate cultural and professional fallout for Benioff, leading to a prominent Democratic donor resigning from the Salesforce Foundation board and diverting attention from the conference's technology and business announcements.</p>

          <p>Prince Andrew, the third child of the late Queen Elizabeth II and eighth in line to the throne, has formally relinquished the use of his royal titles, including the Duke of York, following discussions with King Charles III. This decision builds upon his earlier return of military titles and patronages in 2022, and his cessation of using "His Royal Highness" in an official capacity, stemming from accusations of sexual assault in a US civil case. Andrew, who consistently denies Virginia Giuffre's allegations of sexual assault when she was underage, ultimately reached an out-of-court settlement. The article provides a comprehensive overview of his royal background, the controversies, and the specific honors he has now given up.</p>

          <p>Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy has formally requested President Trump to declare a major disaster in the state's southwest, following the widespread devastation caused by the remnants of Typhoon Halong. The powerful storm displaced 1,500 people from remote Alaska Native communities, causing extensive damage to homes, with some floating off their foundations, and resulting in at least one death and two missing persons. State senators and the congressman urged immediate federal assistance to repair housing and utilities before winter, emphasizing that the disaster's scale has surpassed the state's response capabilities. The event also highlighted previous Trump administration cuts to grants aimed at helping Indigenous villages prepare for such storms.</p>

          <p>Boeing has secured approval from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to increase its 737 Max jetliner production to 42 aircraft per month, marking a significant milestone almost two years after a near-catastrophic midair accident. The FAA had previously restricted Boeing's output to 38 planes monthly following a January 2024 incident where a door plug detached from an Alaska Airlines flight, later found to be due to uninstalled bolts. The FAA confirmed extensive safety reviews were conducted to ensure the production rate increase is safe, while Boeing reiterated its commitment to safety and quality. This approval, coupled with other recent regulatory concessions, indicates a renewed, albeit cautious, confidence in Boeing's manufacturing integrity after years of scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Ford is issuing recalls for a total of nearly 750,000 vehicles due to three distinct safety concerns: rearview camera display malfunctions, steering system defects, and seatbelt issues. Over 290,000 vehicles, including specific F-250, F-350, and F-450 Super Duty models from 2020-2022, are affected by a camera system glitch that may improperly display rearview images, increasing crash risk. An additional 115,539 Super Duty trucks from 2020-2021 are being recalled because the steering column upper shaft could detach, leading to a loss of steering control. Furthermore, 332,778 Mustang models from 2015-2017 have corroding seatbelt cables that could fail in a crash. Ford dealers will perform necessary repairs free of charge.</p>

          <p>President Trump is actively working to cement his architectural legacy, overseeing the construction of a $250 million White House ballroom and proposing a new arch opposite the Lincoln Memorial. The ballroom project, entirely financed by private donors, recently hosted an exclusive dinner to thank contributors, including prominent figures from the tech and finance sectors. Democrats are strongly opposing these initiatives, with California Representative Mark Takano introducing legislation to prevent donor names from being displayed on White House structures and to halt federally funded construction during government shutdowns. Trump, however, views these ambitious projects as a "respite" from his presidential responsibilities, with heavy machinery already at work on the expanded ballroom.</p>

          <p>President Trump expressed openness to considering the Kremlin's proposal for Elon Musk's Boring Company to construct a 70-mile undersea rail tunnel through the Bering Strait, connecting Russia and Alaska. Russian investment envoy Kirill Dmitriev suggested the project, conventionally estimated at $65 billion but potentially reduced to $8 billion with Boring Company technology, would symbolize unity. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy voiced disapproval of the idea. This proposal emerged following recent phone calls between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, during which plans were made to discuss potential resolutions to the Ukraine War. Musk's company, however, lacks experience in such extreme, infrastructure-poor, and earthquake-prone environments, and has faced regulatory fines for violations in previous projects.</p>

Longtime CBS News chief national security correspondent David Martin, who spent 40 years covering the Pentagon, underscored the critical role of physical presence in fostering trust and breaking significant stories.

          <p>President Donald Trump controversially asserted that Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro offered "everything" in natural resources to alleviate US tensions, using an expletive to emphasize Maduro's apprehension towards the United States. This declaration was made during a White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Reports from The New York Times had previously indicated Maduro's willingness to offer a stake in Venezuela's oil and mineral wealth to counter mounting US pressure. Concurrently, the US has executed at least six strikes on alleged Venezuelan "drug vessels," with the most recent resulting in survivors now held aboard a US Navy ship. Legal experts and human rights organizations have strongly criticized these strikes, labeling them as potentially illegal extrajudicial executions.</p>
