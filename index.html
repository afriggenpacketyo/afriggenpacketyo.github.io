          <p>King Charles has sent a heartfelt message to fellow cancer patients, acknowledging the challenges and fears associated with the illness while highlighting the compassion that can arise during such times. The King, who was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer in February 2024, emphasized the importance of human connection and the "community of care" in helping patients cope with their diagnosis. He also quoted Dame Deborah James, a bowel cancer advocate who passed away in 2022, inspiring others to maintain rebellious hope. The King's message was delivered at a Buckingham Palace reception for cancer charities, attended by health groups, cancer survivors, and relatives of those who have died from the disease.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared a national emergency as rapidly spreading wildfires near Jerusalem prompted evacuations and raised concerns about the fires reaching the city. Firefighters are struggling to control the blazes, which have injured several people and led to the deployment of troops and resources. High temperatures and strong winds are exacerbating the situation, with officials suspecting arson as a potential cause. Neighboring countries have been contacted for assistance, and the government is working to bring more resources to the affected areas. The priority remains defending Jerusalem and saving lives, as the fires are considered the largest in Israel in a decade.</p>

          <p>Moorcroft Pottery, a renowned ceramics firm based in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent, has ceased trading after more than 100 years, resulting in the loss of 57 jobs.

Moorcroft, known for its colorful depictions of animals, birds, and geometric patterns, has a rich history, including royal patronage and international recognition. Local officials expressed disappointment and pledged to support affected employees, while the GMB Union called for government action to support the struggling ceramics sector.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) maintained its policy rate at 0.5% for the second consecutive meeting, amid concerns over U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs and their potential impact on the Japanese economy. While inflation has remained above the BOJ's 2% target, the central bank acknowledged the likelihood of moderating growth due to global economic slowdown and declining domestic corporate profits. The BOJ stated it would continue to raise the policy rate if economic and price forecasts are realized, while also expecting inflation to range between 2-2.5% in fiscal year 2025. The decision comes after trade discussions between Washington and Tokyo reportedly did not yield a breakthrough.</p>

          <p>The REAL ID deadline is approaching, and starting May 7, travelers without compliant identification documents may face delays or be barred from boarding their flights. REAL ID is a new standard for state-issued identification that requires more stringent verification of identity and residency. While federal documents like passports are also compliant, travelers without a REAL ID driver's license or acceptable alternative may undergo an identity verification process at the airport. However, the TSA warns that this alternative process does not guarantee the ability to travel, and passengers may still face delays and additional screening.</p>

          <p>An article in The Guardian discusses the UK's strategy of appeasing Donald Trump in hopes of securing a favorable trade deal, suggesting that this approach has been unsuccessful. Despite efforts to cater to Trump's demands, the UK may be placed behind South Korea and Japan in trade talks. The article draws parallels to Columbia University's experience, where concessions to Trump did not guarantee the restoration of federal funding. The piece questions whether humoring Trump will yield better outcomes than a more assertive stance, noting that other entities like Apple and Walmart have more leverage over him than the UK does.</p>

The authors highlight Ukraine's high usage of artillery shells and the limited production capacity of the United States.

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has lowered its economic and inflation forecasts for the current fiscal year, citing concerns over the impact of U.S. tariffs on the economy. The central bank expects the Japanese economy to grow by 0.5 percent in fiscal 2025, down from its earlier projection of 1.1 percent. Core consumer prices are projected to rise 2.2 percent, compared to the previous forecast of 2.4 percent. Despite the revisions, the BOJ has kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged, while remaining committed to raising rates further if the economy and prices align with expectations.</p>

          <p>Eleven students involved in an alleged hazing incident targeting younger members of the Westhill High School boys lacrosse team turned themselves in after the district attorney threatened kidnapping charges. The alleged incident involved older players arranging an outing with younger teammates, who were then subjected to a simulated abduction. The incident is being investigated by the district attorney's office and the county sheriff's department. No injuries were reported, and the students who turned themselves in will likely face prosecution in family court.</p>
