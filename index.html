          <p>The Kremlin announced that President Vladimir Putin has ordered a three-day cease-fire in Ukraine from May 8-10, coinciding with Russia's World War II Victory Day. This marks the second time in two weeks that Putin has promised a temporary pause in the fighting. Ukraine's foreign minister responded skeptically, stating that Russia must cease fire immediately if it truly wants peace, but that Ukraine remained ready for a 30-day halt in the fighting. The announcement comes amid growing pressure from President Trump for both sides to reach a resolution to the conflict.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have successfully tested a compact high-power microwave (HPM) system, firing over 10,000 shots without failure, marking a milestone in directed-energy weapon technology. The new technology leverages advanced vacuum-sealing to overcome durability and miniaturization barriers in HPM weapons. The microwave gun, developed by the Northwest Institute of Nuclear Technology (NINT), is significantly lighter than traditional HPM weapons and powered by a three gigawatt-pulsed current. This development could potentially shift the balance in the global race for next-generation warfare systems.</p>

          <p>IBM has pledged to invest $150 billion in the U.S. over the next five years, with over $30 billion specifically aimed at advancing American manufacturing of mainframe and quantum computers. CEO Arvind Krishna stated that this investment reinforces IBM's commitment to American jobs and manufacturing, ensuring the company remains at the forefront of advanced computing and AI. This announcement follows President Trump's unveiling of a "reciprocal" tariff policy intended to boost domestic manufacturing.

          <p>The U.S. military has reported hitting over 800 targets in Yemen as part of an ongoing air campaign against the Houthi militia, dubbed Operation Rough Rider.

Congressional officials estimate the campaign's cost to be over $1 billion thus far, raising concerns about the rapid rate of munitions usage. The U.S. Central Command stated that the strikes were aimed at degrading the Houthis' ability to attack ships in the Red Sea.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is focusing on expanding its domestic drone program as a strategic initiative amid uncertainties surrounding President Trump's cease-fire talks and potential withdrawal of U.S. military support. The "Line of Drones" program emphasizes the assembly of unmanned systems within Ukraine, primarily small exploding drones operated from shelters. This initiative aims to provide Ukraine with a means to continue its defense efforts should cease-fire talks fail or if U.S. arms shipments are discontinued.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government faces pressure as pay review bodies recommend higher-than-budgeted pay rises for teachers and NHS staff. The pay review body for teachers in England has recommended a pay rise of about 4% this year, while its NHS equivalent has recommended about 3%, both figures are higher than the 2.8% the government had budgeted for in their proposals to the pay bodies. Downing Street has ruled out any extra cash for the higher pay deals, suggesting cuts and efficiency savings would be needed. This could lead to potential clashes with trade unions and a new wave of strikes, as teaching unions have already threatened strikes if pay rises trigger cuts or layoffs.</p>

The BBC has pledged to introduce reforms, including a more robust disciplinary policy, a strengthened code of conduct, and improved complaint mechanisms. The report heard from 2,500 staff members and freelancers, highlighting instances of powerful individuals abusing their power and a perception that senior management turns a blind eye to poor behavior when productions are successful.</p>

          <p>In Polson, Montana, and communities nationwide, individuals accused of crimes and experiencing mental health crises are often held in jail cells due to a lack of adequate mental health services. Lake County Attorney James Lapotka describes the situation as a failure to provide necessary crisis care, with nearly half of local jail inmates in the U.S. having a mental illness. Patients can be jailed for months as their mental health worsens, often without being convicted of a crime. State officials acknowledge the problem, citing capacity issues at the Montana State Hospital and a lack of local services.</p>

          <p>China is diversifying its soybean imports by increasing shipments from Brazil amid an escalating trade war with the U.S. An estimated 40 ships carrying Brazilian soybeans are expected at Ningbo Zhoushan Port this month, marking a 48% year-on-year increase. This follows the cancellation of orders for 12,030 metric tonnes of American pork, highlighting China's efforts to reduce reliance on U.S. agricultural imports. The hit to America’s soybean trade has been "a tough pill to swallow considering China remains US soy’s greatest export market."</p>

          <p>Japan is considering allowing more imported cars to qualify for a simplified safety and environmental screening process to gain concessions in tariff negotiations with the United States. The idea to enhance Japan's Preferential Handling Procedure may be discussed along with a proposal to increase U.S. farm imports. The Trump administration has criticized the lack of access to Japan's automotive market, citing non-tariff barriers. Japan does not impose tariffs on imported cars, trucks, or buses.</p>

          <p>The increasing accessibility of private equity to retail investors raises concerns about their preparedness for the complexities and risks involved. While private equity offers diversification and potentially higher returns, retail investors may lack the sophistication and resources of institutional players.

The fear of missing out can lead to poor decision-making, as retail investors may underestimate the higher fees, longer lock-up periods, and limited liquidity associated with private equity.

Senators and Representatives have sent a letter to the White House requesting a commitment from senior officials to transmit all securities transaction reports to the Office of Government Ethics and make them public. The letter highlights concerns that individuals close to the President with access to non-public information may have violated federal ethics and insider trading laws. The request follows Trump's announcement to roll back tariffs to 10% to all countries except China, which sent the stock market soaring.</p>
