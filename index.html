          <p>Independent candidate Catherine Connolly has decisively won Ireland's presidential election, securing over 64% of the vote to become the successor to Michael D. Higgins. The 68-year-old lawmaker from Galway, endorsed by left-wing parties like Sinn Fein, ran on a platform of "peace" and "neutrality," and has been a vocal critic of U.S. and EU foreign policy. The election was marked by a low voter turnout and a high number of spoiled ballots, which some analysts interpret as a protest against mainstream parties and their handling of issues like immigration. The article notes that prominent figures like Conor McGregor, who was convicted in a civil sexual assault case, had previously considered running.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping personally led the drafting team for the country's upcoming 15th five-year plan, according to state media reports. This direct involvement highlights his centralized authority and decisive role in shaping China's future economic and social development. The plan was reportedly formulated based on extensive investigations during Xi's national tours throughout the year, with multiple revisions made by the Politburo Standing Committee before its presentation. This hands-on approach signifies the immense personal influence Xi wields over the nation's strategic direction, ensuring his vision is deeply embedded in long-term policy.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa is projected to intensify into a major hurricane over the weekend, posing a significant threat to Jamaica, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. The National Hurricane Center has issued warnings for potentially "life-threatening and catastrophic" flash flooding and landslides early next week, with some areas expecting up to three feet of rain. A hurricane warning is currently in effect for Jamaica, which is expected to bear the brunt of the storm's impact, including winds potentially reaching 140 mph. While the storm is not anticipated to have major effects on the mainland U.S., its rapid intensification and slow movement are causing serious concern for the Caribbean islands in its path.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The growing trend of "sleepmaxxing," or using technology to optimize sleep, has fueled a multi-billion dollar industry of gadgets like sensor-filled mattress covers and smart alarm clocks. However, the reliance on these technologies introduces new vulnerabilities, as demonstrated when an Amazon Web Services outage caused Eight Sleep smart beds to malfunction, trapping users in cold temperatures or upright positions. While some advanced sleep tech offers genuine benefits for those with medical conditions like PTSD, for the general user, it often adds complexity to a natural process. The incident serves as a cautionary tale about integrating technology into every aspect of life, potentially turning a basic human function into another system prone to failure.</p>

          <p>The recent FBI arrests of Miami Heat's Terry Rozier and Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups in an illegal gambling probe are the latest in a long series of betting scandals that have plagued professional sports for over a century. This article recounts a history of major incidents, from the 1919 "Black Sox Scandal" to modern-day cases involving figures like Pete Rose and Shohei Ohtani's former interpreter. The events span across MLB, NBA, NHL, and college sports, illustrating a persistent struggle to maintain the integrity of the games against the influence of gambling. These scandals often involve players betting on their own sports, sharing inside information, or associating with illegal bookmakers, leading to suspensions and lifetime bans.</p>

          <p>In its debut season, San Diego FC has made MLS history by setting records for the most wins and points by an expansion team, securing the Western Conference's top seed for the playoffs. The club's success is built on a philosophy that combines star players like Hirving "Chucky" Lozano with a strong team-first mentality and a focus on data analytics. A cornerstone of their strategy is the Right to Dream academy, which develops homegrown talent from both San Diego and Tijuana, reflecting the region's unique cross-border culture. As they aim to become the first expansion team since 1998 to win the MLS Cup, the team embodies a blend of high-level recruitment and deep community integration.</p>

          <p>Lucy Powell, who was dismissed from the cabinet just seven weeks ago, has been elected as the new deputy leader of the UK's Labour Party. Her victory over Bridget Phillipson, who was seen as closer to Prime Minister Keir Starmer, is interpreted as an expression of dissatisfaction within the party, which has faced a series of internal disputes and public blunders. While not a landslide, Powell's win places a critical voice in a senior, directly elected role. The result highlights the challenges facing the Labour government as it grapples with losing public support and navigating internal divisions, with Powell's leadership now a key factor in the party's future direction.</p>

This divergence is partly attributed to Berkshire's decision to significantly reduce its stake in Apple, which has since surged to a record high. By selling a large portion of its Apple shares, Berkshire has potentially left an estimated $50 billion in unrealized profits on the table. Buffett has previously justified the sales by citing the likelihood of future increases in capital gains tax rates, suggesting it was prudent to realize some gains at the current lower rate.

          <p>The modern wedding has evolved into a multi-event affair, a phenomenon known as "wedding sprawl" that often includes destination bachelor/bachelorette parties, welcome dinners, and post-wedding brunches. This expansion, fueled by social media expectations, is placing increasing financial and logistical strain on guests and bridal parties. The concept of "bridesmaid inflation" highlights the rising costs and time commitments expected of close friends and family, turning a celebration of love into a source of stress. This trend reflects a cultural clinging to the aspiration of a grand wedding, even as other traditional middle-class goals have become less attainable for many.</p>

This trend stands in stark contrast to the significant price increases seen across most of the U.S. While the luxury market, specifically properties over $10 million, has remained profitable, the broader market's weakness is attributed to factors like tax law changes and pandemic-related migration. Analysts note that when accounting for inflation, transaction costs, and renovations, the actual losses for sellers are likely even greater than the sale price data suggests.

The former soccer star suggests that a parent's presence can cause children to "outsource their motivation," making them either nervous or overly focused on impressing their parents rather than playing freely. By allowing children to interact with coaches and teammates independently, parents can help them become self-starters who learn from mistakes and take risks without pressure. This approach, she believes, fosters key traits that contribute to becoming successful and self-reliant adults.</p>

          <p>Marking the 80th anniversary of Taiwan's return from Japanese rule, senior Chinese official Wang Huning stated that Beijing will leave no room for any form of "Taiwan independence" separatist activities. His address emphasized the need to deepen cross-strait integration and foster a shared Chinese national identity. Beijing's official recognition and commemoration of "Taiwan Restoration Day" is viewed as a strategic move to reinforce its sovereignty claims over the self-ruled island. Wang's comments underscore the Communist Party's unwavering commitment to achieving what it terms the "complete reunification of the motherland."</p>

          <p>A renewed interest in gold prospecting is emerging in California, with locals finding gold dust, flakes, and nuggets in rivers as gold prices have surged over 50% in the past year. Some prospectors, like Manny Goza, have found significant success, with Goza claiming to have paid for his house with gold he found. While striking it rich often depends on luck, even amateur prospectors can earn a modest daily income. This trend coincides with prominent financial figures like Ray Dalio and Jamie Dimon advocating for gold as a crucial portfolio diversifier and a hedge against inflation and market volatility.

          <p>President Trump has publicly called for the prosecution of several former Biden-era Justice Department officials, including former Attorney General Merrick Garland and special counsel Jack Smith. Trump accused them of illegal conduct related to an FBI probe that reportedly examined the phone records of nine Republican lawmakers following the 2020 election. This demand is the latest in a series of calls by the president to prosecute political adversaries, some of whom have since been indicted. The FBI investigation in question, known as Arctic Frost, was part of a broader inquiry into efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.</p>

          <p>A stark economic divide is emerging as massive spending in the artificial intelligence sector buoys GDP growth and stock market highs, masking struggles in other parts of the economy. While AI-related companies like Nvidia are thriving, small businesses and sectors like retail and construction are contending with higher costs from tariffs and reduced consumer spending, with many in "survival mode." This divergence is reflected in the stock market, where a handful of tech giants account for a disproportionate share of the S&P 500's gains. The data suggests that the AI boom is currently a primary driver of economic expansion, while the non-tech, real economy faces a more challenging environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A family in West Virginia discovered that four of their six children share a rare brain condition known as Chiari malformation, where brain tissue extends into the spinal canal. The journey began when their youngest daughter's constant crying and developmental delays led to the diagnosis and a successful surgery that transformed her personality. Subsequently, three of her older sisters, who had been suffering from various unexplained symptoms, were also diagnosed with the condition and underwent successful treatments. The case is highly unusual, as while the condition can have a genetic link, it is rare for it to manifest in so many siblings, and the family credits the surgeons with giving them their children's lives back.</p>

The raid in Northampton resulted in the largest-ever single seizure of trafficked weight loss medications by a law enforcement agency worldwide, with an estimated value over £250,000. Authorities confiscated thousands of unlicensed and potentially deadly pens of Retatrutide and Tirzepatide, along with raw ingredients and manufacturing equipment. Officials warned the public about the severe health risks of purchasing such untested and unauthorized products online, which they say enriches criminal networks.</p>

          <p>Dr. Roy Meals, a hand surgeon nearing 80, recently completed a solo trek along the entire 342-mile perimeter of Los Angeles, a journey he chronicled in a new book. Motivated by curiosity and a desire to truly know the city where he has lived for half his life, Meals divided the oddly shaped city limits into 34 manageable segments. His walk revealed a diverse tapestry of history, culture, and community, from historical treaty sites to vibrant local eateries and small businesses. Dr. Meals' prescription for others is to escape their own neighborhoods, venture forth on foot, and make their own life-enriching discoveries by being curious, fit, and engaged with their surroundings.</p>

Starboard is pushing for a separation of the NuScale asset, either through a sale or a tax-free spinoff, to eliminate the valuation discount on Fluor's core business.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid ongoing trade tensions, China's near-total dominance of the global rare earth elements supply chain remains a critical vulnerability for Western nations. China controls nearly 70% of mining and up to 90% of processing for these metals, which are essential for high-tech sectors like defense, renewable energy, and electric vehicles. Recent export controls from Beijing have heightened concerns about supply chain disruptions. Despite efforts by the U.S. and others to diversify, significant challenges remain, including the high environmental cost, technical complexity, and massive investment required to build new processing and refining capacities outside of China, making a near-term shift away from Chinese dependency unlikely.</p>
