          <p>The death toll from catastrophic flooding in Texas has climbed to at least 78, with state officials providing updated figures from across the state. In hard-hit Kerr County, the sheriff confirmed 68 fatalities, including 28 children, highlighting the devastating impact on local communities and a summer camp. A major disaster declaration has been signed for the county, activating federal resources, including FEMA and the U.S. Coast Guard, to aid in extensive search and rescue operations. Officials are urging the public to avoid non-essential calls to allow emergency lines to remain open for those with specific information about the dozens still missing.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris celebrated an emotional first victory at his home race, the British Grand Prix, after a chaotic, rain-affected event at Silverstone. The win was secured after his teammate, Oscar Piastri, who had been leading for most of the race, received a controversial 10-second penalty for an erratic maneuver behind the safety car. Piastri expressed confusion and frustration over the ruling, which was pivotal in the race's outcome. For Norris, the victory marks a significant career milestone, and he celebrated enthusiastically with his team, acknowledging the challenging conditions and the exceptional performance of both McLaren drivers throughout the difficult weekend.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-06 17:32:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The All England Club has issued an apology after its electronic line-calling system on Centre Court was mistakenly deactivated, causing it to miss three crucial calls in a single game. The error occurred during the fourth-round match between Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Sonay Kartal, with one missed call on a point that would have won Pavlyuchenkova the game. The chair umpire, unaware of the system failure, ordered the point to be replayed, which Kartal subsequently won. Although Pavlyuchenkova went on to win the match, the incident has sparked debate about the reliance on technology and the role of umpires in overriding obvious errors.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the relationship between Hong Kong and mainland China is hampered by a persistent lack of mutual understanding, challenging the early assumption that close proximity would naturally foster deeper ties. Instead of growing closer, the author contends that misunderstandings and misjudgments from both sides have complicated the "one country, two systems" framework. The piece suggests that for many in Hong Kong, mainland Chinese politics remain difficult to interpret, and conversely, Beijing has not fully appreciated Hong Kong's unique identity. Fully grasping this complex dynamic is presented as essential for navigating the city's future and addressing what has gone wrong in the cross-border relationship.</p>

          <p>Police in the Turks and Caicos Islands have discovered a man's body during the search for Brian Tarrence, a 51-year-old American tourist who went missing in late June. The unidentified body was found in a state of decomposition in the Grace Bay area, where Tarrence was last seen leaving his vacation rental in the early morning. Authorities have not confirmed the identity of the deceased and are urging the public to avoid speculation until the investigation is complete and the next of kin are notified. The discovery adds a grim dimension to the ongoing search for Tarrence, whose disappearance from the popular tourist destination remains a mystery.</p>

          <p>Following a heavy 336-run defeat to India, this analysis suggests that Ben Stokes' England Test cricket team is trapped in a frustrating cycle of inconsistency. Despite moments of brilliance, such as their recent win at Headingley, the team is prone to significant losses that expose familiar weaknesses. The article points to the feast-or-famine form of key batters like Ollie Pope and Zak Crawley, as well as questions surrounding the effectiveness of spinner Shoaib Bashir. Until England can eliminate these recurring collapses and find greater consistency, their ambition to become a top-ranked team will remain unfulfilled, despite their potential for greatness.</p>

          <p>Delegations representing Israel and Hamas have begun a new round of indirect ceasefire negotiations in Qatar, mediated by Qatari and Egyptian officials. The negotiations aim to secure the release of hostages held in Gaza and establish a truce in the ongoing conflict.

Hamas is reportedly seeking a guaranteed end to all hostilities, a condition Israel has previously rejected.

          <p>A new comprehensive tax and spending bill signed by President Trump will introduce significant changes, but many of its key impacts will be staggered over several years. The bill's effects on Medicaid, including new work requirements for some recipients and funding cuts, are not set to begin until 2026. Changes to food assistance programs (SNAP) will take effect sooner, raising the work requirement age this year. For taxpayers, some changes like deductions for tips and overtime will apply to 2025 taxes, while a temporary increase in the SALT deduction cap will also be implemented before resetting in 2030, impacting household finances on different timelines.

Burns emphasizes that the founders, though flawed, created a system based on the 'pursuit of happiness,' which he defines as lifelong learning in a marketplace of ideas. He advocates for telling a complete and gritty history, believing that this approach strengthens, rather than diminishes, the nation's founding ideals and allows everyone to find a place in the American story.</p>

They argue that in many communities, Planned Parenthood is the primary or only provider of essential services like vaccinations, prenatal care, and cancer screenings.

          <p>Following a public feud with President Trump over a massive tax and spending bill, Elon Musk has announced the formation of a new political party called the 'America Party.' The billionaire, who previously headed a government efficiency task force for Trump, has been a vocal critic of the new law, which he claims will bankrupt the country. Musk's move signals a definitive break with his former ally and an intent to disrupt the two-party system by potentially backing candidates in key 2026 midterm races. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent responded by suggesting Musk should focus on his businesses rather than politics, noting his unpopularity in previous government roles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With a key tariff deadline approaching this week, a top White House economic adviser stated that the "rough outlines" of several new trade deals are becoming clear. The 90-day pause on sweeping tariffs President Trump announced in April is set to expire, and the administration is preparing to finalize new agreements with some nations while sending notices to others where deals are not yet complete. The official indicated that people are responding to the potential threat of high tariffs by moving business activity and production to the U.S., which he credited for creating jobs. The administration is signaling that countries without a new agreement could face renewed tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The deadly flash floods in Texas, which saw three months' worth of rain fall in just hours, underscore the difficulties in predicting such extreme weather events. While the National Weather Service issued timely watches and warnings, including a top-tier flash flood emergency, the sheer volume of rainfall far exceeded initial forecasts. This event highlights a critical limitation in current technology: while forecasters can predict a high potential for severe rain in a region, pinpointing the exact location and intensity remains a major challenge. The disaster serves as a stark example of how climate change is amplifying rainfall intensity, straining forecasting systems and emergency response capabilities.</p>

On trade, the document slammed measures that distort global commerce and are inconsistent with WTO rules, a clear reference to recent U.S. tariff policies.

          <p>A federal jury has acquitted music mogul Sean 'Diddy' Combs of the most serious charges against him, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. He was, however, convicted on lesser prostitution-related charges and remains in custody. His lawyer reported that fellow inmates gave Combs a standing ovation upon his return to jail, viewing the outcome as a rare victory against the government. The defense team's strategy involved acknowledging Combs's history of domestic abuse and drug problems but arguing that these issues did not constitute sex trafficking. The verdict concluded a high-profile, two-month trial that featured testimony from nearly three dozen witnesses.</p>
