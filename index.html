          <p>China has sanctioned five U.S. subsidiaries of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean, causing an 8% drop in its shares, due to their alleged involvement in U.S. probes against the Chinese shipping industry. This action follows the U.S. imposing steep port fees on Chinese ships, to which Beijing retaliated with similar charges on American vessels. The Chinese Commerce Ministry stated the sanctions, effective immediately, aim to safeguard China's sovereignty and security, prohibiting Chinese entities from doing business with the targeted companies. This article underscores a significant escalation in trade and geopolitical disputes between China and the U.S. and its allies.</p>

          <p>A spending watchdog revealed that two UK government schemes, ECO4 and the Great British Insulation Scheme, have resulted in tens of thousands of homes needing repairs due to botched insulation. The National Audit Office found that 98% of external wall insulation and 29% of internal insulation installations have problems, potentially causing damp, mould, and immediate health and safety risks. Energy Consumer Minister Martin McCluskey stated the government would implement comprehensive reforms and fix affected homes at no cost to consumers.
