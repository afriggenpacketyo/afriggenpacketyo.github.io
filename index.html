          <p>Harvard's Kenneth Rogoff and Yu Yongding, formerly an advisor to China's central bank, discuss the US dollar's future and the potential of the Chinese yuan. Yu Yongding asserts that foreign investors' demand for US assets, particularly Treasury bonds, will gradually decline, making it increasingly difficult for the US to sustain its balance of payments and maintain a strong dollar. Rogoff has previously warned of a crisis of legitimacy for the US dollar, while Yu advocates for a free-floating yuan and broad fiscal stimulus in China. This discussion highlights the shifting dynamics in the global financial hierarchy and the potential challenges to the dollar's dominance (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett addressed concerns about Medicare in the Trump administration's budget proposal. Hassett stated that the administration is not targeting Medicare for cuts but would consider changes if the Senate identifies fraud or abuse. The proposed budget includes tax cuts, border security measures, and changes to Medicaid and food assistance programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will add $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The article explores concerns among soccer fans that they may become targets of U.S. immigration raids. The Trump administration's policies are suggested to have contributed to lower ticket sales for an upcoming Club World Cup tournament.
