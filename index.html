          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has removed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, stating that the committee had become a rubber stamp for vaccines and a clean sweep was needed to restore public confidence. This move has been criticized by medical groups like the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, who believe it undermines a transparent process that has saved lives and silences independent medical expertise. Kennedy has faced criticism for his handling of public health agencies, including changes to COVID-19 vaccine guidance and spreading myths about measles shots. Experts are concerned about conflicts of interest, with some pointing out that Kennedy himself has sued vaccine manufacturers and stands to gain or lose from the outcome of vaccine decisions.</p>

          <p>An appeals court has paused a ruling that would have required the Trump administration to provide due process for deported Venezuelans. The court's decision came a day before the administration was scheduled to outline how it would allow approximately 140 Venezuelans, who had been deported to El Salvador, to challenge their expulsion. This pause introduces uncertainty regarding the rights of these individuals and the procedures they can access to contest their deportations. The initial order sought to ensure that these Venezuelans had the opportunity to present their cases and seek legal recourse before being removed from the United States.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reiterated false and misleading statements about the situation in Los Angeles, as the city prepares for the arrival of federal troops. In a speech at Fort Bragg, Trump spread conspiracy theories, maligned California's Democratic leaders, and inaccurately portrayed protesters as part of a "foreign invasion." Trump also repeated a debunked conspiracy theory about bricks being staged for protesters and falsely claimed that California officials are paying agitators. These claims are contradicted by available evidence and serve to inflame tensions and misrepresent the reality of the protests.</p>
