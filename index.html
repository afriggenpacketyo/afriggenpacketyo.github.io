          <p>China's defense ministry announced it had warned and expelled a U.S. destroyer, the USS Higgins, for allegedly entering its territorial waters near the Scarborough Shoal without permission. Beijing accused the U.S. of infringing on its sovereignty and undermining regional stability. In response, the U.S. Seventh Fleet called China's statement false, asserting the warship was conducting a lawful freedom of navigation operation in international waters. The incident occurs amid heightened tensions, including a recent collision between Chinese and Philippine vessels and escalating rhetoric over trade and regional dominance.</p>

          <p>Demand for mortgage refinancing in the U.S. jumped 23% last week, reaching its highest level since April of the previous year, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The increase was largely driven by a renewed interest in adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which saw applications rise by 25% as their interest rates became more attractive compared to fixed-rate loans. While homeowners are actively seeking savings, applications for home purchases saw only a modest 1% increase, indicating that high home prices continue to challenge potential buyers despite slightly lower rates.

          <p>TikTok has removed the account of a man who was using the platform to share videos on how to cross the English Channel in a small boat and encouraging others to do so. The user, who is believed to have recently arrived in the UK, live-streamed from an asylum hotel and answered questions about the journey, gaining hundreds of thousands of views. TikTok stated it has a zero-tolerance policy for content promoting human smuggling and works with law enforcement to disrupt such activities. The incident comes as the UK government seeks to introduce new laws to prosecute individuals promoting illegal crossings online.</p>

          <p>The domestic abuse charity Refuge has reported a significant increase in violent threats and non-fatal strangulation targeting young women and girls aged 16-25 in Britain. According to their data from the past year, nearly half of the young women reporting physical abuse were subjected to strangulation or suffocation, a 9% rise. Additionally, there was a 4% increase in threats to harm, with 35% of those experiencing psychological abuse being threatened with death. The charity is calling for improved education on the signs of abuse and coercive control to be embedded in schools.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time since the market turmoil caused by Liz Truss's mini-budget in September 2022, the average rate for a two-year fixed mortgage in the UK has fallen to 4.99%. Financial data provider Moneyfacts called this a "symbolic turning point," indicating increased competition among lenders. While this offers some relief to homebuyers and the 1.6 million borrowers needing to remortgage this year, rates remain significantly higher than the historic lows seen before the mini-budget. Analysts suggest that substantial further drops are unlikely as the Bank of England is expected to hold its base rate steady. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists are analyzing data from the destructive magnitude 7.7 earthquake that struck Myanmar in March to better forecast future seismic events. The quake, which caused thousands of deaths, was a "supershear" rupture that moved with incredible speed along the Sagaing Fault. A new study used this data to create a computer model incorporating the fault's "memory effect" from past ruptures. While precise earthquake prediction remains impossible, this research helps refine probabilistic forecasts, estimating that the next major quake on this fault could occur around 2166, which is crucial for long-term disaster planning.</p>

          <p>This opinion article in The Guardian argues that Israel is openly and deliberately targeting journalists in Gaza, abandoning any pretense of supporting press freedom. The author points to the recent killing of six media workers, including Al Jazeera's Anas al-Sharif, whom Israel accused of being a terrorist without providing verifiable evidence. The piece contends this is part of a long-standing pattern where Israeli forces have killed journalists with impunity. The writer criticizes the muted response from the international community and media organizations, warning that this inaction enables further attacks and risks closing the world's window into Gaza.</p>
