          <p>Elon Musk is exploring the idea of funding a new political party, tentatively called the 'America Party,' to challenge the two-party system. He suggests a strategy of focusing on a few key Senate and House races to gain leverage as a deciding vote on major legislation. This consideration follows a public falling out with President Trump over a new spending bill, despite Musk's previous financial support and role in the administration's 'department of government efficiency.' The article highlights the tense political dynamic, including Trump's public threats against Musk.</p>

          <p>North Korea has opened the Wonsan Kalma Coastal Tourist Area, a large-scale luxury beach resort, reflecting Kim Jong Un's long-held ambition to boost the economy through tourism. Despite its grand scale, the resort's opening is overshadowed by the country's ongoing military tests and deep international isolation. It remains unclear if the resort will be open to anyone beyond domestic tourists and select groups from allied nations like Russia. Analysts note the project highlights Pyongyang's goal of pursuing economic development alongside its military programs, not in place of them.</p>

          <p>The death toll from a residential building collapse in southern Pakistan has risen to at least 16, with rescue operations continuing into a second day. Emergency crews are using heavy machinery to search for at least eight more people believed to be trapped in the rubble. The building was situated on a narrow street, complicating rescue efforts and the use of heavy equipment. Such incidents are unfortunately common in Pakistan, where poor construction standards and a lack of regulation enforcement often lead to unsafe structures.</p>

          <p>A doctor at a public hospital details the severe challenges that new Medicaid work requirements will pose for the most vulnerable patients. Using the example of a man injured in an accident who is homeless and lacks an ID, the article argues that bureaucratic hurdles will disproportionately affect those who should be exempt but lack the resources to prove it. The author contends that these rules are designed to cut costs by disenfranchising eligible individuals, not to curb fraud. The changes are projected to cause millions to lose insurance and could lead to the closure of safety-net hospitals.</p>

          <p>James McMurdock, the Reform UK Member of Parliament for South Basildon and East Thurrock, has voluntarily given up the party whip following allegations related to business propriety. According to Reform's chief whip, the claims concern McMurdock's conduct during the pandemic, before he was elected to Parliament. McMurdock has agreed to cooperate with a pending investigation into the matter. This development reduces the number of sitting Reform MPs to four, marking the second instance of an MP from the party losing the whip since the 2024 election.</p>

          <p>Happiness researcher Mo Gawdat promotes a "90-second rule" for better emotional regulation and a more fulfilled life, a concept he embraced after the tragic death of his son. The rule, based on neuroscience, suggests that the physiological response to anger or stress hormones like cortisol lasts only about 90 seconds. After this initial period, individuals can consciously choose not to refuel the negative emotion by replaying the triggering thought. Gawdat advises asking practical questions to assess the situation's reality and one's ability to act, thereby preventing prolonged distress over minor or unchangeable events.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the mixed verdict in Sean "Diddy" Combs's federal sex-trafficking trial demonstrates the legal system's inadequacy in addressing complex issues of domestic and intimate partner violence. While Combs was convicted on lesser charges, he was acquitted of the most serious ones, which the author suggests is because prosecutors had to use trafficking laws to address what is fundamentally coercive control and abuse. The piece criticizes how the law and some media outlets struggle to grasp the dynamics of power and trauma in such cases. It reflects on a broader culture where powerful men often evade full accountability for violence against women.</p>

North Carolina and Arizona followed as the next most popular destinations. In contrast, California saw the largest exodus of retirees, with a net loss of nearly 57,000.

The article references different approaches, such as weight lifting or group fitness, that can help people feel stronger and more comfortable in their own skin.

          <p>The mortality rate from heart attacks in the United States has plummeted by nearly 90% since 1970, marking a major public health victory. This dramatic improvement is attributed to a combination of factors, including successful anti-smoking campaigns, the development of cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, and improved emergency and hospital care like CPR and angioplasty. While deaths from acute heart attacks have fallen, overall heart disease remains a leading killer, partly because people are living longer and developing chronic conditions.

          <p>Following a grassroots campaign, Florida has passed a law banning oil and gas exploration within 10 miles of national estuarine research reserves in certain rural counties. The "Kill the Drill" movement was sparked when a permit was granted for exploratory drilling near the Apalachicola River basin, a region devastated economically by the mere threat of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The new law, co-authored by state representatives and signed by the governor, provides a permanent safeguard for the area's precious water resources and the tourism and seafood industries that depend on them. The victory is seen as a major win for local environmental and business groups.</p>

          <p>Amid economic uncertainty and reduced consumer spending, fast-casual restaurant chains like Chipotle, Starbucks, and Cava are intensifying their focus on loyalty programs. These programs are shifting from a bonus feature to an essential tool for driving repeat business and building customer habits. Data shows that loyalty members visit restaurants more frequently and spend more, providing a crucial buffer against industry-wide traffic declines. Brands are revamping their rewards systems to offer more value and flexibility, hoping that the cost of freebies will be offset by long-term customer retention and increased sales on full-price items.

          <p>The Apple TV+ series "Murderbot," based on Martha Wells's novellas, presents a unique and quirky vision of artificial intelligence. Its protagonist is a security cyborg that hacks its own governing module to achieve free will, only to use its freedom to secretly watch soap operas and avoid human interaction. The show subverts the common sci-fi trope of AI yearning for humanity, instead imagining a consciousness that finds human emotions and social norms alien and undesirable. This perspective offers a delightful departure, exploring a future where a sentient machine's greatest desire is simply to be left alone, not to become more human.</p>

As the Prince and Princess of Wales prepare to grant their own warrants, the article notes the eclectic list of approved suppliers, from luxury car brands to chimney sweeps. A marketing professor explains that the royal coat of arms serves as a powerful symbol of quality and class, particularly for American consumers. The author humorously connects this appeal to a recent poll suggesting a surprising number of young Americans would favor replacing the U.S. president with the British monarch.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Fish and Wildlife has cracked down on an illegal black market for caviar, stemming from the poaching of protected sturgeon and salmon in the Sacramento River. With sturgeon fishing limited to catch-and-release and salmon fishing banned, a lucrative illegal trade has emerged. Investigators conducted surveillance and traffic stops, leading to the capture of poachers and the seizure of over 150 pounds of black market salmon roe. These enforcement actions aim to protect the threatened fish populations, which are vital to the local ecosystem, from the severe damage caused by poaching and illegal trafficking.</p>

Raducanu lamented the change, stating she felt the previous system of challenging calls with Hawk-Eye was more accurate and that a tradition has been broken.

The decision was attributed to a stable global economic outlook and healthy market fundamentals, such as low oil inventories.

Additionally, rising land prices, a shortage of agricultural labor, and the economic impact of tariffs are squeezing the multigenerational family farms that are the backbone of the industry.
