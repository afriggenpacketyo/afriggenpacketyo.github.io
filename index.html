          <h2>German Airport in Munich Reportedly Plans Dedicated Terminal for Deportations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 02:26:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Munich Airport is reportedly planning to build a dedicated terminal for processing deportations, a move supported by conservative politicians but criticized by the Green Party. The facility, slated for 2028, aims to streamline the repatriation of migrants with rejected asylum claims or criminal convictions. Separately, the Central Committee of German Catholics has expressed alarm over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, urging the German government to advocate for the enforcement of international law and an end to actions by the Israeli government that disproportionately harm civilians. The committee highlighted the severe suffering and risk of starvation faced by the Palestinian population.</p>

          <h2>UK Conservative Leader Kemi Badenoch Views Argentine President as a Template Amid Party Struggles</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch stated that the Tories must offer hope and fix problems, rather than just being a "repository of disenchantment," especially as the Reform UK party gains traction. In an interview, she cited Argentine President Javier Milei, known for his aggressive cost-cutting measures, as a "template" for her leadership style, expressing concern about the state's expanding influence. This comes as the Conservative Party consistently polls behind Labour and Reform, and following a recent reshuffle of her shadow cabinet to include "heavy hitters" like James Cleverly. Badenoch dismissed concerns about her leadership's stability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Deutsche Bank reported a second-quarter net profit of €1.485 billion, surpassing analyst expectations despite challenges from a strong euro. The bank affirmed it is on track to meet its full-year targets, with its profit before tax rising 34% year-on-year when excluding litigation impacts. Its core investment banking unit saw a 3% revenue increase, driven by fixed income and currencies, although the origination and advisory division declined. The bank noted a slowdown in corporate loan growth but expressed confidence in its overall momentum and cost discipline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Irish centre Garry Ringrose has been withdrawn from the British and Irish Lions' second Test match against Australia after reporting concussion symptoms following a training session. This marks the second time a head injury has sidelined him during the tour.

Huw Jones will now start alongside Bundee Aki in the midfield for the crucial match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, as the Lions aim for a historic back-to-back tour victory.</p>

          <p>Court documents from a New Orleans lawsuit show that the late Jesuit leader Pedro Arrupe, a candidate for Catholic sainthood, was aware of multiple sexual abuse allegations against an aspiring priest, Donald J.

Dickerson was later accused of sexually assaulting other minors, including a 17-year-old student at Loyola University New Orleans. The revelations have prompted calls to halt Arrupe's canonization process and raise further questions about the Catholic Church's handling of its historical abuse crisis.</p>

A key order, "PREVENTING WOKE AI IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT," mandates that federal agencies procure AI models that are neutral and nonpartisan, specifically avoiding what it terms ideological agendas like Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). The administration argues that such concepts compromise truthfulness and can lead to distorted outputs, citing past examples from major tech companies. The plan also seeks to remove regulatory hurdles for AI development and establish a program to support U.S. AI exports.</p>

          <p>The MLS All-Star game proceeded with its usual festivities, but the absence of its biggest star, Lionel Messi, has intensified questions about the event's relevance and future. While the game provided entertainment and a showcase for top talent, Messi's decision to skip the event, potentially saving himself for more crucial club matches, is seen by some as a sign of disrespect for American sports culture and by others as a professional prioritizing meaningful competition. MLS Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged the need to rethink the event's format, especially as the league seeks to grow its viewership and manage increasing fixture congestion for its players.</p>

          <p>A major study published in The Lancet suggests that walking 7,000 steps a day, rather than the commonly cited 10,000, is enough to significantly reduce the risk of serious health issues like heart disease, cancer, and dementia. The research, which analyzed data from over 160,000 adults, found this more achievable target was linked to substantial health improvements compared to lower activity levels. Researchers note that the 10,000-step goal originated from a 1960s marketing campaign, not scientific evidence. They hope these findings will encourage more people to adopt step-tracking as a practical way to improve their wellbeing.</p>

          <p>A Venezuelan man, Arturo Suarez, has described enduring months of physical and psychological abuse after the Trump administration sent him and over 250 other Venezuelans to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador. Suarez, who had no criminal record, was accused of being a gang member and detained in the notorious CECOT prison for four months before being released in a prisoner swap. He recounts being beaten, humiliated, and told he would only leave "dead." The policy, which involved deporting men to a third country they had never visited, has drawn sharp criticism.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials to offer migrant teenagers aged 14 and older the option to voluntarily return to their home countries. This changes a long-standing policy under a 2008 anti-trafficking law, which required unaccompanied minors from non-contiguous countries to be transferred to government shelters. Now, these teens will be given a choice between prompt self-deportation or being sent to the shelter system overseen by HHS.

          <p>The UK's Environment Agency (EA) has cancelled thousands of water tests intended to detect harmful pollution in England's rivers, lakes, and estuaries over the last three months due to severe staff shortages. Internal documents reveal that 10,000 scheduled tests for inorganic pollutants like nitrates and phosphates were not conducted at the main laboratory. Seven national testing programs have been completely paused, affecting monitoring of everything from river chemistry to drought plans. Critics and former employees state the cuts undermine the ability to track pollution trends and identify problems, while the EA insists its overall program remains robust.</p>

          <p>The rare discovery of vibrant violet sea snails (Janthina janthina) on a La Jolla beach has caught the attention of oceanographers. These creatures, which typically live in warmer subtropical seas, have not been seen locally by Scripps Institution of Oceanography researchers in a decade. The snails float on the open ocean using a self-secreted bubble raft and are distinguished by their striking purple shells. Their appearance coincides with notably warm offshore water temperatures, prompting researchers to consider if their presence is a potential indicator of broader climate change impacts on ocean currents and marine life distribution.</p>

This development occurred as a Florida judge denied a DOJ request to unseal grand jury records from Epstein's 2006 case, citing state secrecy laws.

Formed in Aston, Birmingham, the band reacted against the "hippy-dippy" music of the era by creating a darker, heavier sound inspired by horror films. Guitarist Tony Iommi's unique playing style, developed after an industrial accident injured his fingertips, was central to their sound, creating detuned, powerful riffs. Their controversial, supposedly satanic imagery sparked moral panic but also attracted legions of fans, cementing their legacy as the architects of a new musical genre.</p>
