          <p>Ken Dryden, the Hall of Fame goaltender who led the Montreal Canadiens to six Stanley Cup titles, has died at 78 after battling cancer. Dryden, known for his relaxed stance in goal, backstopped the Canadiens to championships in six of his eight seasons in the NHL. He earned numerous accolades, including the Calder Trophy, five Vezina Trophies, and the Conn Smythe Trophy. Beyond hockey, Dryden was an accomplished author, broadcaster, and politician, serving as a Member of Parliament and a cabinet minister. The article details his career as a player, including his time at Cornell University and his role in the 1972 Summit Series, and his post-playing career. His contributions to hockey and Canadian society were widely celebrated, and he is survived by his wife and two children.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Olivia Smith, who made history as women's football's first £1m player when Arsenal signed her from Liverpool. The 21-year-old Canadian international's former coaches and family emphasize her grounded nature despite her meteoric rise, highlighting her dedication and passion for the sport. Smith's journey included playing in Canada, a brief stint at Penn State University, and a move to Sporting in Portugal before joining Liverpool. She acknowledges the pressure of her price tag but focuses on her hunger to learn and win, and her former coaches believe she will be the best player in the world. The article details Smith's early life and the support she received from her parents. Her debut season in the WSL saw her score seven goals in 20 games for Liverpool, as well as being named the PFA young player of the year. </p>

          <p>A fire broke out at the BBC's former headquarters, Television Centre, in west London, requiring the response of approximately 100 firefighters. The blaze affected the nine-story building, which now houses a restaurant, flats, and television studios, leading to the evacuation of residents. The London Fire Brigade was called to the scene early Saturday morning and utilized turntable ladders to combat the fire from above. Authorities worked to evacuate buildings in the area as a precaution, and an investigation into the cause of the fire is underway, with Wood Lane closed to traffic.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the geopolitical competition unfolding in central-southern Africa, where China, the United States, and Japan are vying for control of key logistical routes to secure critical minerals. The race to build corridors like the Lobito Corridor and the Nacala Corridor is viewed as a strategic effort to secure long-term influence over critical mineral supply chains and reduce reliance on rivals. The Nacala Corridor, for example, connects landlocked Zambia and Malawi to the Port of Nacala in Mozambique. These corridors are essential for transporting minerals needed for the green energy transition, highlighting the strategic importance of the region.</p>

          <p>This article examines the response in Chicago to President Trump's plan to deploy National Guard troops to combat crime.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 1 million people from Haiti and Venezuela. The ruling prevents the deportation of these individuals and allows them to continue working in the United States.

The Trump administration argued that conditions in Haiti and Venezuela had improved, but the judge deemed the decision arbitrary and capricious, highlighting the legal battles and uncertainty faced by TPS holders.

Forecasters warned of life-threatening surf and rip currents reaching the Hawaiian Islands by the end of the weekend. As of Friday, the storm had maximum sustained winds of 140 mph and was located east-southeast of Hilo, Hawaii. The storm is expected to gradually weaken after strengthening into Saturday.

          <p>This article addresses claims made by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. regarding a potential link between Tylenol use during pregnancy and autism in children. Medical experts, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, state that there is no clear evidence to prove a direct relationship. Research on the topic has been conflicting, with some studies showing no association and others showing a positive or negative association. Factors such as dosage, duration of use, and the condition being treated are considered when examining the potential link. The FDA and leading medical organizations agree on the safety of acetaminophen.</p>

          <p>This article discusses China's use of party-to-party diplomacy, particularly with communist parties, as an important part of its diplomatic strategy. President Xi Jinping recently met with leaders from the four remaining communist countries, and the Communist Party's International Department plays a central role in these interactions. The department has established connections with over 600 parties in other countries and has become a key diplomatic channel for China. This includes increased diplomatic engagement with the Middle East, highlighting the department's increasingly active role.</p>

          <p>A brush fire, dubbed the Pyrite fire, ignited near Jurupa Valley, California, prompting evacuation orders in the nearby communities of Jurupa Hills and Sunnyslope. The fire, reported as a 15-acre vegetation fire, quickly grew to 200 acres, leading to expanded evacuation warnings. Firefighting personnel, engines, helicopters, and water tenders were assigned to combat the flames. The fire burned toward the San Bernardino County border, and residents in Fontana were urged to stay alert. Sierra Avenue was closed to allow fire crews access to the burn zone.</p>

          <p>Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, saw its shares drop after a report suggested that US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. would potentially link autism to the use of the medication during pregnancy. Kenvue defended the safety of its product, stating that there is no causal link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism. The US Department of Health and Human Services called claims about the contents of its autism report speculation. US doctors typically recommend that pregnant women in need of pain relief take Tylenol, or another form of acetaminophen, rather than ibuprofen, which is sold as Advil.</p>

President Trump responded by stating that Venezuela would be in trouble if they continued such actions. The Dunham is part of a U.S. flotilla deployed to the region to target criminal organizations and narco-terrorism. The White House also announced a strike on an alleged drug-trafficking boat from Venezuela, killing 11 people.</p>

Analysts believe that this period of strengthening will remain measured, as Beijing aims to avoid harming the competitiveness of its exporters amid trade tensions with the United States.

          <p>The Garnet fire in the Sierra National Forest has come within three miles of the McKinley grove, home to roughly 200 giant sequoias. Firefighters are working to protect the trees, laying down sprinkler lines and carrying out strategic burns to reduce fuels. Temperatures have dipped and relative humidity has climbed, improving conditions for firefighters. The McKinley grove is considered vulnerable due to its isolation and lack of recent burns, with the nonprofit Save the Redwoods League estimating that 20% of the world's mature giant sequoias have perished in the last decade due to severe wildfires.</p>

          <p>Economists are concerned about the August jobs report, which showed only 22,000 jobs added and the unemployment rate rising to 4.3%. The weak hiring is attributed to economic uncertainty caused by the Trump administration's tariffs and the increasing adoption of artificial intelligence. Some economists warn about the risk of stagflation, with rising inflation and weak growth. The Federal Reserve is now highly likely to cut interest rates at its September meeting in response to the weak job growth. (not investment advice)</p>
