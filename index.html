          <p>Bitcoin experienced a significant drop, falling below $79,000, as investors reacted to increased financial market volatility spurred by President Trump's global tariffs. The cryptocurrency's decline reflects broader market anxieties, mirroring the downturn in U.S. equities, and the price of bitcoin was last lower by 4% at $78,835.07, according to Coin Metrics. Other cryptocurrencies, like Ether and Solana, faced even steeper losses, triggering substantial liquidations among traders who had bet on rising prices. This downturn highlights Bitcoin's sensitivity to global economic shifts and investor sentiment. (not investment advice) <br/><i></p>

          <p>Former NFL linebacker Anthony Barr voiced his opposition to a potential ban on the 'tush push' play, arguing it could set a precedent for further restrictions in the league. The Green Bay Packers proposed a rule change to prohibit offensive players from pushing teammates behind the snapper. While the NFL postponed the discussion until May, arguments persist regarding the play's safety and impact. Rich McKay, NFL Competition Committee chair, noted a lack of data indicating the play is dangerous, as no injuries have been reported.</p>

          <p>The UK government is relaxing regulations for car firms as they transition to electric vehicle production ahead of the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander announced the changes to protect jobs amid uncertainty following U.S. tariffs on imported cars. Smaller UK firms like Aston Martin and McLaren will be allowed to continue producing petrol cars beyond 2030, and some hybrid vehicles can remain on the market until 2035. Prime Minister Keir Starmer framed the measures as a boost to growth and support for homegrown firms.</p>

          <p>Federal probationary workers, initially targeted in President Trump's government downsizing efforts, are in a state of limbo due to ongoing legal challenges. Mass firings across federal agencies have been challenged in court, leading to reinstatement orders for thousands of workers. Despite reinstatement, many employees remain on administrative leave, uncertain about their future employment. The Justice Department has appealed one of the court orders, while some workers have found relief through the Merit Systems Protection Board, adding to the confusion and stress among affected federal employees.</p>

          <p>Hamas launched a barrage of rockets at cities in southern Israel in response to alleged Israeli "massacres" of civilians in Gaza. The Israeli military reported intercepting most of the projectiles, but a direct hit was reported in Ashkelon. In response, Israel issued new evacuation orders for residents of Deir Al-Balah city in Gaza, citing earlier rocket firings and warning of an impending attack. Prime Minister Netanyahu, en route to Washington, instructed a "vigorous" response and approved continued intensive military activity against Hamas, as tensions remain high following a stalled ceasefire agreement.</p>

The game concluded in a goalless draw, leaving City fifth in the Premier League and United in 13th, but the focus remained on the unsavory behavior of some fans.</p>

Jayapal expressed concerns about conditions at detention facilities amid the Trump administration's immigration crackdown and emphasized the need to treat all detained individuals with dignity and fairness.</p>

Ovechkin's feat is remarkable considering he broke his leg earlier in the season, and he expressed relief at finally achieving the record.</p>

          <p>California is missing significant opportunities to reduce emissions and improve climate resilience by not adequately investing in climate-smart agricultural practices. Despite approving a $10 billion climate bond in November 2024, the state legislature has not consistently funded programs that help farmers adopt environmentally friendly methods. These programs, which include strategies like planting perennials and using cover crops, enhance soil carbon and improve farmers' ability to capture and store moisture. The author urges the legislature to allocate 15% of the State Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to climate-smart agriculture programs to support farmers in leading climate action.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has ordered all national parks to remain open despite severe staffing shortages, a move criticized by conservation groups as reckless. The order requires approval from the National Park Service director before any closures or reduced hours, raising concerns about micromanagement. The directive comes after the President cut about 1,000 National Park Service workers, leading to concerns about the agency's ability to maintain the parks and provide services during peak visitation season. Critics argue that the order prioritizes access over the well-being of the parks and their staff.</p>
