        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft has resigned from her position as a government whip due to disagreements over proposed cuts to disability benefits. In a letter to the prime minister, Foxcroft expressed her understanding of the need to address the rising welfare bill but argued that cuts to Personal Independence Payments (PIP) and Universal Credit should not be part of the solution. She stated that she could not support the Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment Bill, scheduled for debate in Parliament on July 1st, as over 100 Labour MPs have voiced concerns about the legislation, and the government may face a rebellion from its own members. Ministers have defended the bill, claiming that claimant levels are becoming unsustainable. </p>

          <p>The article discusses Iran's Fordo nuclear facility, an underground enrichment site of significant concern to international monitors and experts. Buried deep within a mountain, Fordo is suspected of housing clandestine efforts to develop nuclear weapons capabilities. While U.S. intelligence agencies previously stated they did not believe Iran was building a nuclear weapon, Israel's military claims to have intelligence indicating a secret program focused on building nuclear weapons. President Trump is reportedly considering the risks and benefits of bombing Fordo, with a decision expected within two weeks, as Iran denies any intention of building nuclear weapons, maintaining that its nuclear program is for civilian purposes.</p>

          <p>A meta-analysis by French researchers, published in the journal Heart, indicates a potential link between cannabis use and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). The review of multiple studies, involving over 400 million patients, found a significant increase in the risk of heart attack, stroke, and cardiovascular death associated with cannabis use. The danger was also elevated in people who used cannabis at least once a week. Despite medical marijuana's benefits for certain conditions, overuse may pose health risks, especially for seniors. </p>

The movie's editing and score create a deliberate abrasive and confounding experience, suggesting humanity's natural state is struggle and division. The film is an intriguing comment on human progress, with a mix of smart and silly elements, and it dares viewers to devolve.</p>

Researchers reviewed over 600 bag policies and 45,000 shoreline cleanups, finding that plastic bag policies led to a 25% to 47% reduction in discarded bags near coastlines, rivers, and lakes over six years. The study indicates that fees on plastic bags may be more effective than bans, especially partial bans, in limiting shoreline litter, bringing insights to the issue of plastic pollution and its threats to marine environments.</p>

Fordo is a key uranium enrichment site located 300 feet beneath a mountain and protected by Russian air defenses. The MOP is a U.S.-produced bomb designed to attack deeply-buried facilities, weighing nearly 30,000 pounds and capable of penetrating up to 200 feet underground. The B-2 Spirit is the only aircraft equipped to carry and deploy the MOP due to its weight and stealth capabilities, as the combination is designed to evade air defenses and reach heavily defended targets.</p>

          <p>Oil prices increased by approximately 3% following Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's order to intensify attacks against Iran. The rise in prices reflects investor concerns about potential disruptions to oil supplies amid the escalating conflict. Netanyahu instructed the military to target strategic and government targets in Iran, aiming to undermine the ayatollah's regime after an Iranian missile struck a hospital in Beersheba.

Prosecutors also moved to dismiss charges against a second protester arrested at the same time.
