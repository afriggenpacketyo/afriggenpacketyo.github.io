          <p>A tragic incident unfolded at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, where a gunman drove his vehicle into the building and opened fire during Sunday services. The attack resulted in four fatalities and multiple injuries, not including the suspect who also died. The FBI has launched an investigation, classifying the event as "an act of targeted violence" and is looking into the suspect's motives and the extent of premeditation involved. Law enforcement officials, including Michigan's governor and the FBI, are coordinating the response and have interviewed over 100 witnesses to gather information about the deadly assault.</p>

          <p>Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old accused of killing conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, made a remote court appearance where his legal team requested a preliminary hearing. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty on an aggravated murder charge, citing text messages and DNA evidence allegedly linking Robinson to the crime. According to prosecutors, Robinson expressed hatred for Kirk's views in messages to his roommate, stating he had an opportunity to kill a leading conservative voice and was going to take it. The assassination has intensified political rhetoric, with former President Trump declaring Kirk a "martyr" and vowing to crack down on the "radical left."</p>

Kirby recounted hearing a loud boom and going outside to investigate, only to be met by a gunman who immediately opened fire. He described running back inside to find his family, feeling shrapnel hit his leg as a bullet shattered a nearby glass door, calling it the scariest moment of his life while fearing he would be shot in the back.</p>

          <p>The suspect in the fatal attack on a Michigan church, Thomas Jacob Sanford, was an Iraq war veteran who reportedly harbored a deep hatred for people of the Mormon faith. A White House official stated that the FBI believes this animosity was the primary motive for the targeted violence. A local political candidate who met Sanford while campaigning recalled him expressing a particular dislike for the Latter-day Saints church, stemming from a past relationship with a church member in Utah.

          <p>The U.S. government is on the brink of a shutdown as funding is set to expire at the end of Tuesday without a new spending agreement between Republicans and Democrats. The Republican-controlled Congress needs Democratic support in the Senate to pass a spending bill, but Democrats are leveraging their position to demand extensions of healthcare tax credits and oppose proposed budget cuts. President Trump has expressed uncertainty about reaching a deal and is scheduled to meet with congressional leaders in a last-ditch effort. Unlike previous shutdowns, the current administration has signaled a willingness to shutter parts of the government and has even threatened to use the situation to identify and permanently fire "non-essential" workers.</p>

          <p>Approximately 58 million pounds of corn dogs and sausage-on-a-stick products, including popular brands like State Fair and Jimmy Dean, have been recalled across the United States. The recall was initiated by Hillshire Brands, a Tyson Foods subsidiary, after receiving multiple consumer complaints about finding pieces of wood embedded in the batter. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service noted that five of these complaints involved injuries. The affected products were produced at a single Texas facility between March and September and were distributed nationwide to retailers, schools, and Defense Department facilities, prompting concerns that they may still be in consumers' freezers.</p>

          <p>The Taliban has imposed a total internet blackout across Afghanistan, severing fiber optic connections and disrupting telephone services in a significant crackdown on communications. According to cybersecurity watchdog Netblocks, the shutdown was implemented in a stepwise manner, cutting off networks throughout the country. A local Taliban spokesperson stated the ban was ordered by their supreme leader to "prevent immoral activities." This move further isolates the Afghan population, hindering access to online education and business communications, and compounds the severe humanitarian crisis the country is already facing.

          <p>The Scottish government has issued new guidance requiring schools to provide separate toilet facilities for boys and girls, defined by biological sex. This policy shift follows two landmark court rulings, including a Supreme Court decision that defined a woman by biological sex under equalities law. While single-sex facilities are now mandatory, schools are also permitted to offer gender-neutral toilets as an alternative. The updated guidance reverses a 2021 policy that allowed transgender pupils to use the facilities aligning with their gender identity. Education Secretary Jenny Gilruth stated the new rules provide necessary clarity, though critics have called the guidance contradictory and potentially harmful.</p>

          <p>To improve savings outcomes, behavioral economists recommend a simple two-step plan: set a clear goal and then create a reminder to take action. While many people set financial goals, a significant portion fails to stay on track. This method can be as simple as a recurring calendar notification to transfer money, or automating the savings process entirely for better results. Research also indicates that people are more motivated to start new habits during "fresh starts," such as the beginning of a new year, a new week, or after a birthday. These moments create a psychological disconnect from past behaviors, fostering optimism about achieving new financial milestones. (not investment advice)</p>

He claimed the levy would solve a long-standing problem and specifically mentioned that California has been hit hard by productions moving abroad. This follows his announcement of other new tariffs, including on imported drugs and cabinets. It remains unclear how such a tariff on films would be implemented or if it would apply to streaming services.

The frustration was highlighted when a photographer captured a text message read by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in which an Iowa grain trader expressed anger that the U.S. had bailed out Argentina only for it to lower its prices for China.</p>

          <p>Following Mayor Eric Adams's decision to suspend his campaign, President Donald Trump directed criticism at Zohran Mamdani, the new front-runner in the New York City mayoral race. Trump labeled Mamdani, a self-described democratic socialist, a "Communist" and threatened to withhold federal funding from the city if he wins the election. He argued that Mamdani would need federal money to fulfill his promises and would not receive any from his administration. The political landscape shifted after Adams dropped out, a move seen as an attempt to consolidate support behind former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent against Mamdani and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves's recent speech suggests she is preemptively building a case for potential tax increases in her November Budget. By linking tough decisions to global headwinds and a forthcoming reassessment of the UK's long-term productivity by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), she appears to be laying the groundwork. This strategy would allow the government to blame any necessary tax hikes on external factors and the economic record of her predecessors. The Chancellor confirmed she will receive the OBR's draft forecast this week, which will determine the scale of the fiscal gap she needs to address, leaving many specific tax policy options still undecided.

          <p>A group of women in Minneapolis discovered their social media photos were used to create nonconsensual, explicit deepfake images on a website called DeepSwap, sparking a fight against the proliferation of AI "nudify" tools. These services use generative AI to merge real photos with pornographic content, requiring no technical expertise from the user. The victims found they had limited legal recourse because the images were not publicly distributed. This has led them to advocate for new legislation, resulting in a proposed Minnesota bill that would fine tech companies $500,000 for every nonconsensual deepfake generated, aiming to hold the platforms accountable for enabling such misuse.</p>

          <p>The UK's COVID-19 inquiry heard that the government had only one day to plan for the nationwide closure of schools in March 2020. Former Education Secretary Gavin Williamson's evidence revealed that because the focus had been on keeping schools open, no contingency plans were in place, leading to what he described as a "discombobulating 24-hour sea change." The inquiry is examining the severe and long-lasting impact of the pandemic on children, including disruptions to education and wellbeing. Williamson also characterized the subsequent decision to close schools again in January 2021 as a "panicked decision," a description that former Prime Minister Boris Johnson has reportedly rejected.</p>

          <p>Following a recent decision by the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark rate, average 30-year fixed mortgage rates have fallen to a three-year low of 6.13%. This reduction provides significant savings for homebuyers, with the monthly principal and interest payment on a $300,000 mortgage now approximately $1,824. This represents a monthly savings of about $180 compared to rates seen in January 2025, and over $330 compared to the peak rates of October 2024. The article explains that these lower rates benefit both new buyers and existing homeowners considering refinancing, potentially saving borrowers tens of thousands of dollars over the life of their loan.

While Amazon does not hold inventory, it provides the online infrastructure for the transaction.
