          <p>UCLA Athletic Director Martin Jarmond outlined the university's strategy in response to the House settlement, which allows direct payments to athletes beginning July 1. UCLA plans to allocate $20.5 million in revenue sharing, the maximum permitted under the settlement, while maintaining its Olympic sports programs and staffing levels. The revenue will be distributed following a formula similar to the back-payment model, with a larger share going to football and men’s basketball players, with payments increasing annually over the 10-year agreement. This move aims to level the playing field with other Big Ten schools and enhance UCLA's competitiveness in attracting top athletes while ensuring resources for Olympic sports.</p>

          <p>A death row inmate, Julian Mendez, was killed at Kern Valley State Prison in Delano, California, after being attacked by fellow inmate Mario Renteria.

          <p>Charlotte Edwards began her tenure as head coach of the England women's cricket team with a clean sweep in both T20 and ODI series against the West Indies. This victory marks a positive start for Edwards and new captain Nat Sciver-Brunt after a disappointing Ashes series. However, previous successes in home bilateral series have not translated to success on the big stage, and tougher tests lie ahead, including a series against India and the 50-over World Cup in India and Sri Lanka. Questions remain about whether the "new" England team can perform under pressure when it matters most.</p>

          <p>The public feud between President Trump and Elon Musk has raised concerns among some Republicans about potential divisions within the party ahead of the midterm elections. Musk's criticisms of Trump's "big, beautiful bill" and his suggestion of forming a new political party have created uncertainties for the GOP. Some lawmakers worry that Musk's departure from Trump's inner circle could undermine negotiations on key legislation and fracture party unity. Despite the tensions, some Republicans believe the dispute will eventually be resolved, and others downplay its political implications.</p>

          <p>Cardiologists are cautioning against the habit of excessive phone scrolling, which is often perceived as relaxing, due to its potential harm to heart health. Endless scrolling, especially in the morning or before bed, can increase anxiety, blood pressure, and sedentary behavior, leading to a higher risk of cardiometabolic conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. Additionally, scrolling can disrupt sleep, disconnect individuals from hunger cues, and expose them to misinformation about health. Cardiologists recommend setting time limits, avoiding scrolling in bed, and replacing the habit with healthier activities like exercise and spending time with loved ones.</p>

          <p>Amid ongoing parliamentary deadlock, French politicians have turned to remembrance politics, initiating three new measures to recognize and address historical injustices. These initiatives include posthumously promoting Alfred Dreyfus, recognizing and compensating returnees from French Indochina, and addressing Haiti's "double debt" from 1825. While these symbolic gestures have been met with mixed interpretations, some see them as a form of social maturity, while others view them as easier to pass than structural reforms. The shift towards remembrance politics reflects the challenges in addressing pressing issues such as pensions, education, and the budget.</p>

          <p>Sir David Attenborough told Prince William that he is "appalled" by the damage certain fishing methods are causing to the world's oceans, particularly the impact of bottom trawling on the deep ocean floor. The interview took place ahead of the UN Oceans Conference, where countries will discuss protecting the oceans from threats like plastic pollution, climate change, and over-exploitation. Attenborough emphasized the importance of the oceans to all citizens and expressed hope that leaders at the conference will realize their significance. The UN's key aim is to get the High Seas Treaty ratified by 60 countries to bring it into force.</p>
