          <h2>Russian Soldiers Express Skepticism About Peace Efforts in Ukraine</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times article presents a rare glimpse into the morale of Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine, revealing their deep skepticism towards diplomatic efforts that propose a cease-fire along the current front lines. These soldiers, interviewed anonymously, express a desire to continue fighting until they control all four southern and eastern Ukrainian regions claimed by the Kremlin, fearing that any less would render their sacrifices meaningless. Their sentiments highlight the domestic challenges President Putin faces in ending the war on terms short of his maximalist goals, suggesting that his annexation of Ukrainian regions has limited his negotiation options. The soldiers also voice bitterness towards officials and civilians whom they accuse of benefiting from the war while ignoring frontline hardships.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article covers a range of topics, including the Supreme Court's decision to extend the ban on the Trump administration's use of a wartime law to deport Venezuelans, while a lower court re-examines the case. Other key points include Senate Democrats opposing weapons sales to Qatar and the U.A.E. due to financial ties to Trump, and Republicans blocking their party's megabill over deficit concerns. Additionally, the article reports on a tornado in St. Louis, an inmate escape in New Orleans, Moody's downgrading the U.S. credit rating, and the theft of a Melania Trump statue in Slovenia. Linda McMahon, the education secretary, also discusses ending the Trump administrationâ€™s standoff with Harvard.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This CNBC article highlights the growing concern over long-term care costs, which can easily exceed $100,000, and the lack of preparedness among American households to manage these expenses. Experts emphasize that many people fail to plan for these costs in advance, leading to a potentially significant financial burden. The article notes that a substantial portion of Americans turning 65 will require long-term care due to disabilities, and the average future cost is estimated to be around $122,400, with some needing care for many years, driving costs much higher. It also notes that most health insurance and Medicare plans do not cover these expenses, potentially leaving many households to pay out-of-pocket.</p>

          <p>This Fox News article analyzes President Trump's Middle East trip, suggesting it presented Israel with a historic opportunity despite the president not landing there. Experts argue that Trump advanced policies aligning with Israeli interests, particularly regarding Iran and normalization with Arab states. The article notes continued U.S. support for Israel's security and commitment to preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. However, concerns are raised about Israel potentially missing opportunities to leverage U.S. influence in the region, particularly concerning normalization with Saudi Arabia and addressing the situation in Syria. The piece concludes that Israel must act decisively to shape events rather than merely reacting to them.</p>

          <p>This Guardian article discusses how US cancer researchers are exploring the potential of fecal waste biobanks to understand and personalize cancer treatment. The Mayo Clinic's biobank is part of a broader effort to uncover how the microbiome affects patients' responses to cancer medications, with the goal of predicting which drugs will be most effective for individual patients. Researchers are experimenting with fecal transplants to colonize patients' guts with new bacteria. This research comes amid proposed cuts to scientific institutions, raising concerns about the ability of private funding to fill the void left by government support.</p>

          <p>This Guardian article reports that Republicans in the US House are proposing new fees on immigrants seeking to remain in the country to fund President Trump's immigration crackdown. These fees, potentially totaling thousands of dollars, would apply to asylum seekers, children, and survivors of crimes, creating financial barriers for vulnerable immigrants. Critics argue that these fees are a targeted attack on those seeking humanitarian protections and could force them into exploitative situations. The proposed legislation also includes significant funding for border wall construction and increased ICE operations.</p>

The authors suggest there was a conspiracy to conceal Bidenâ€™s symptoms from the press, public, and top Democrats. While the reviewer is not convinced there was a coordinated campaign, the book highlights the power dynamics within the White House and the challenges of addressing concerns about a president's health.</p>

          <p>This BBC article discusses the possibility of a youth mobility scheme forming part of a new agreement between the UK and the EU, allowing young people to work abroad for up to two years. While the Prime Minister has signaled that it would be a "reciprocal" arrangement, some conservative party members have expressed concerns that this will amount to free movement through the back door. The article highlights the potential benefits of such a scheme for businesses and young people, but also notes the need to respect the government's red lines.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article reports that the Israeli military has begun mobilizing its forces to advance farther into Gaza, conducting intense airstrikes in preparation for the planned offensive. The escalation comes despite ongoing diplomatic efforts to broker a truce. The Israeli campaign has resulted in a high number of casualties, and the United Nations has warned of a growing risk of famine due to an Israeli blockade on humanitarian aid. Hamas is refusing to release the remaining hostages without a permanent end to the war and a withdrawal of Israeli forces.</p>
