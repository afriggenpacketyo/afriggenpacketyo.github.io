          <p>The Trump administration's move to temporarily shut down Job Corps centers nationwide has been blocked by a U.S. District Judge, following a lawsuit from Job Corps contractors. The Labor Department cited concerns about the program's outcomes and fiscal analysis, including low graduation rates and numerous serious incident reports, as reasons for the pause. Students, like Emily Scott and Andrea Watts, are now in limbo as their training and future careers are uncertain. Republican and Democratic lawmakers have criticized the administration's decision, arguing it is illegal and undermines a program that has received bipartisan support.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily barred the Trump administration from deporting the wife and five children of Mohamed Soliman, who is accused of attacking demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado. The order came after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents took the family into custody, initiating removal proceedings. Lawyers for the family argued that punishing individuals for the crimes of their relatives violates the foundations of a democratic justice system. Soliman's family entered the United States in late August 2022 and applied for asylum in September 2022.</p>

          <p>Following the Trump administration's travel ban targeting 12 countries, Venezuela has warned its citizens about the dangers of traveling to the United States, citing persecution of Venezuelans.

The travel ban, spurred by an attack in Colorado, restricts travel from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, and other countries. This action has drawn criticism from advocates who argue that blanket travel bans discriminate based on ethnicity and could lead to family separations.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered an investigation into the alleged use of an autopen machine by the Biden administration to sign presidential documents, including pardons, claiming it was a "conspiracy" to conceal Biden's cognitive decline. The order questions the legality and validity of numerous executive actions if Biden's advisers secretly used the mechanical signature pen. Biden has refuted these claims, stating that he made all decisions during his presidency. The investigation aims to determine which executive actions involved the use of an autopen and who directed its use, although past administrations have used autopens for certain documents.</p>

Researchers analyzed 99-million-year-old feathers from the Cretaceous period to understand how feathers evolved during this era. The development of feathers that generate thrust and lift was a critical step in bird evolution. Scientists believe that most feathered dinosaurs lacked the same flight capabilities as modern birds.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has stated that Columbia University has failed to meet accreditation standards due to alleged violations of federal antidiscrimination laws regarding harassment of Jewish students. The department's Office for Civil Rights notified the Middle States Commission on Higher Education of the alleged violation. Education Secretary Linda McMahon claimed that Columbia's leadership acted with deliberate indifference towards the harassment of Jewish students after the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. The university accreditor is now required to establish a compliance plan or face action.</p>

          <p>The Department of Education has warned Columbia University's accreditor, alleging the Ivy League institution violated federal anti-discrimination laws by failing to address harassment of Jewish students.

The department claims Columbia failed to establish effective reporting mechanisms for antisemitism and did not properly investigate or punish vandalism. Columbia denies the allegations and affirms its commitment to combating antisemitism.</p>

          <p>A UK study has found that the first bacteria our bodies encounter after birth can protect against dangerous infections, potentially halving the risk of young children being hospitalized with lung infections. Researchers at University College London and the Sanger Institute analyzed stool samples from 1,082 newborns and tracked their health for two years. Bifidobacterium longum, an early inhabitant of the human body, appeared to have a protective effect. Babies with this species were less likely to be hospitalized with lung infections.</p>

          <p>A judge has sided with environmental groups, issuing a temporary restraining order against Sable Offshore Corp., delaying the restart of offshore oil operations near Santa Barbara. The order halts work on the onshore pipeline system due to a major rupture and spill in 2015. Environmental groups argued that the state fire marshal improperly issued waivers for repair work without environmental review or public process. The ruling pushes back Sable's timeline for first sales to August 1, 2025.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has requested that the FDA Commissioner review the latest data on mifepristone, the abortion pill, raising concerns about access to the medication. The review aims to closely monitor the drug's safety, but experts argue that concerns about its safety are misguided. Mifepristone was first approved by the FDA in 2000 and has been used by millions of patients since. This comes after the Supreme Court rejected a challenge targeting the availability of the pill in 2024.</p>
