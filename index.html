          <p>Los Angeles is experiencing significant backlash following President Trump's deployment of the National Guard in response to protests against immigration raids. The administration's intensified immigration enforcement, including raids conducted without judicial warrants, has ignited widespread fury and resistance within the city. Union leaders and community advocates have condemned the brutality of federal agents and the separation of families. The deployment of the National Guard, bypassing the governor, has further escalated tensions, with critics accusing the administration of targeting a Democratic city for political reasons.</p>

          <p>China's exports experienced a notable drop in May, particularly to the U.S., where shipments decreased by over 34%, marking the sharpest decline in more than five years. This decline is attributed to the impact of prohibitive tariffs imposed earlier in the year, despite a recent trade truce. While overall exports saw a slight increase due to shipments to Southeast Asia and Europe, imports fell, reflecting sluggish domestic demand. Renewed trade talks are anticipated between Chinese and U.S. officials in London, addressing concerns over compliance with the Geneva trade agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent study published in Pediatrics reveals that teen skin care routines promoted on TikTok often involve elaborate and potentially harmful products. Researchers analyzed 100 TikTok videos and found that the average routine contained 11 active ingredients, many of which could cause skin allergies and increased sun sensitivity. The average cost of these routines was around $168 per month, raising concerns about unrealistic beauty standards and the influence of social media on young people. Dermatologists recommend simple routines with gentle cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen for children under 18.</p>

          <p>Japan is enhancing its military capabilities, including establishing a missile base on Okinawa, in response to China's growing power and concerns about U.S. commitment to the region. This defense buildup reflects Japan's efforts to bolster its security amid rising tensions in the area. The increased military presence signals a shift in Japan's defense strategy and its willingness to assert its role in maintaining regional stability. The move underscores the complex geopolitical dynamics in East Asia.</p>

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board argues that President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles is an overreach of power and based on false pretenses. The board asserts that local law enforcement had the protests under control, and Governor Newsom did not request or want the troops. The editorial highlights the historical context of presidential authority over the National Guard and criticizes Trump's invocation of a rarely used provision of the U.S. Code. The board suggests that Trump's actions are creating chaos rather than preventing it.</p>

          <p>The UK government is proposing a wider ban on destructive bottom trawling in English waters to protect marine life and habitats. The proposal would expand the prohibition of bottom trawling from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 of the UK's offshore protected areas. The announcement comes amid growing concerns about the environmental impact of bottom trawling, with Sir David Attenborough highlighting its destructive effects. The plan is subject to a 12-week industry consultation.</p>

          <p>China's consumer prices have declined for the fourth consecutive month in May, indicating persistent deflationary pressures. The national consumer price index (CPI) fell 0.1% year on year, beating market expectations slightly.
