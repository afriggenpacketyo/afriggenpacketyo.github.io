          <p>International calls for restraint are being ignored as the world anticipates an escalating conflict between Iran and Israel. The U.S. President Donald Trump is considering direct military strikes on Iran, which would significantly deepen U.S. involvement. The Kremlin has warned that U.S. intervention could trigger a "terrible spiral of escalation," with Russia's Foreign Ministry noting the proximity to nuclear catastrophe. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated Israel was doing the "dirty work" by striking Iranian nuclear sites, while the foreign ministers of Germany, France, and the U.K. are scheduled to meet with their Iranian counterpart.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As economic uncertainties impact seniors, more are considering annuities for steady retirement income and protection against outliving savings. Experts advise seniors to understand annuity fees, including surrender charges and withdrawal penalties, and to ensure the annuity aligns with their long-term financial goals. Choosing the right type of annuity is crucial, with immediate annuities best for guaranteed income now, indexed annuities for growth with downside protection, and fixed annuities for predictable growth. Seniors should also designate a beneficiary to prevent annuity benefits from going through probate and avoid withdrawing excessive funds early, as annuities are designed for long-term income.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping urged a cease-fire amid rising tensions between Iran and Israel in a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Xi emphasized that the international community should strive to de-escalate the situation and resolve disputes through negotiation, protecting civilians. He also suggested that major powers should work to cool down the situation, rather than exacerbate it. Putin expressed Moscow's readiness to mediate a possible settlement of the conflict, as tensions have been further fueled by speculation that U.S. President Donald Trump may join Israel in striking Iran.</p>

          <p>An Iranian missile struck a hospital in southern Israel, causing damage and injuries, prompting Israeli leaders to vow intensified attacks on Iran. Israeli Defense Minister accused Iran of war crimes, holding Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accountable. Israel's Home Front Command reported that Iran used a "dispersal munition" missile, releasing smaller bombs over a wide area, and is launching a public awareness campaign. Meanwhile, President Trump is considering direct U.S. involvement in Israel's efforts against Iran's nuclear program.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has maintained interest rates at 4.25% but indicated potential cuts as early as August. While inflation remains above the Bank's target rate, Governor Andrew Bailey stated rates are on a "gradual downward path," cautioning about global unpredictability due to the Iran-Israel conflict's impact on energy costs. The Bank noted a 26% rise in oil prices and an 11% increase in gas prices since May, marginally increasing expectations for the UK economy while acknowledging weak underlying growth. Wage growth is slowing, unemployment is rising, and businesses are hesitant to hire, suggesting a softening labor market.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice is suing Kentucky over its policy that allows undocumented immigrants to qualify for in-state tuition rates at public universities. The lawsuit alleges that the law unconstitutionally discriminates against U.S. citizens, particularly those from out-of-state. Kentucky's Governor Andy Beshear stated he had no role in creating the policy, which is enforced by the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education (KCPE). Republicans in the state legislature have criticized the policy and introduced legislation to remove undocumented immigrants from any classification of Kentucky residency for tuition purposes.</p>

          <p>Juneteenth, now a federal holiday, is observed amidst concerns that America is retreating from racial egalitarianism. The article argues that, similar to historical periods following Memorial Day and Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the promise of progress is fading. The Trump administration has rolled back DEI initiatives, threatened federal health care for Black populations, and attacked the presentation of Black history. The author suggests that what was promised as a racial reckoning has resulted in a day off, while actual policies and structures that enabled progress are being dismantled.</p>

Economic instability and political fragility threaten South Asia, with countries like Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka facing significant challenges.

While debt charities welcome the move, some argue it still excludes those on non-means tested benefits.
