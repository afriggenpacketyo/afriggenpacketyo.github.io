          <h2>China's Critical Metal Exports Plunge Amid Trade War</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 02:00:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's restrictions on critical metal exports to the US are significantly impacting trade, with exports plummeting and some shipments ceasing entirely. This move is a retaliation against US tariffs on Chinese goods and is likely to pressure US manufacturers reliant on Chinese rare earths. China's dominance in rare earth processing gives it a strategic advantage in the trade war, as demonstrated by the sharp decline in US-bound shipments of tellurium, tungsten, molybdenum, and bismuth. This situation highlights the vulnerability of global supply chains and the potential for geopolitical tensions to disrupt industries.</p>

          <h2>Central Banks Navigate Weaker Dollar: Devaluation Dilemma</h2>

          <p>The weakening US dollar presents a complex challenge for central banks worldwide, offering both relief and potential complications. A weaker dollar eases the debt burden for emerging markets with dollar-denominated debts and can lower inflation by making imports cheaper. However, it also complicates export competitiveness and may lead to capital flight if central banks cut rates. While devaluation is a consideration, central banks are wary of triggering currency wars and higher inflation.</p>
