          <h2>EU Seeks to Bolster Manufacturing Sector Amidst Competition from China</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 04:00:57 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union is growing increasingly concerned about protecting its manufacturing industry from Chinese competition, even as it seeks warmer diplomatic ties with Beijing. While a key German manufacturing index recently hit a 34-month high, it still indicates a contraction, highlighting the sector's vulnerability. Analysts suggest Europe's desire to rebuild its industrial base means it cannot afford an influx of inexpensive Chinese imports, making this a central issue in the EU-China relationship. The EU's manufacturing output, though significant, trails behind China's, fueling protectionist sentiments in Brussels.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Democratic leaders have reacted with fury to the passage of a major Republican-backed budget bill, framing it as an attack on working-class Americans that benefits only the wealthy. Prominent Democrats argued the legislation will lead to millions losing healthcare, reduced food assistance, and other critical social support cuts, while providing permanent tax breaks for billionaires. They are mobilizing to use the bill's contents, such as a massive funding increase for ICE and cuts to Medicaid, as a key campaign issue for the upcoming midterm elections. The bill passed without any Democratic support.</p>

          <p>A North Korean man has successfully crossed the heavily militarized border into South Korea and is now in custody. The South Korean military detected the individual and conducted an operation to guide him safely out of the Demilitarized Zone on Thursday night. Authorities are currently investigating the man's motives and have not yet confirmed if it was a defection attempt. The incident occurs amid heightened tensions, though the military has not observed any unusual activity from the North following the crossing.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has barred U.S. trading firm Jane Street Group from its securities market, accusing it of manipulative practices. SEBI's interim order also freezes over $566 million in what it claims are illegal gains. The regulator alleges Jane Street artificially influenced India's Nifty 50 and BANKNIFTY indices by making large, strategically reversed trades to profit from much larger positions in index options.

          <p>President Donald Trump held a campaign-style rally in Des Moines, Iowa, to celebrate the passage of his signature tax and spending bill, calling it the "best birthday present for America." During the event, which also launched the country's 250th-anniversary celebrations, Trump touted the bill's provisions, mocked political opponents, and repeated his claims of a stolen election. He also announced future anniversary plans, including a UFC fight on the White House lawn, and signaled a policy shift allowing some migrant farm laborers to remain in the U.S.</p>

          <p>After a significant victory over a former champion, British tennis player Emma Raducanu now faces world number one Aryna Sabalenka in the third round of Wimbledon. The match represents a major test for Raducanu, who has struggled against the sport's top-ranked players this season despite her own climb back into the top 40. Raducanu acknowledges she needs to add more "weapons" to her game to bridge the gap with elite competitors like Sabalenka, who is known for her powerful, aggressive style. She hopes playing at home will help her rise to the challenge.</p>

          <p>A strike by bin collectors in Birmingham has now lasted for six months, leaving residents with "apocalyptic" piles of uncollected rubbish and a persistent stench of rotting waste. The industrial action by Unite union members began in January over council plans to downgrade some roles to address equal pay liabilities. With recycling and green waste collections also suspended, residents are expressing frustration and concern, particularly as students moving out for the summer add to the problem. Birmingham City Council states it remains committed to resolving the ongoing dispute.</p>

          <p>The newly passed "One Big Beautiful Bill" is a major legislative victory for President Trump, funding many of his key campaign promises through a mix of tax cuts and spending increases. The legislation allocates significant funds to immigration control and defense, while also boosting fossil fuel incentives and rolling back some of former President Biden's climate initiatives. However, the bill is projected to add over $3 trillion to the national debt and includes major cuts to health and social programs like Medicaid and SNAP, which could cause millions to lose coverage.

The launch, facilitated through Hainan province and Hong Kong, marks a significant step for the company in accessing the large Chinese healthcare market.</p>

          <p>A jury in Clackamas County, Oregon, has found former NBA player Ben McLemore guilty of sexual assault and unlawful sexual penetration. The charges stemmed from an incident in October 2021, where he sexually assaulted a 21-year-old woman who was incapacitated from heavy drinking at a party. Prosecutors argued the woman was unable to give consent, while the defense claimed the encounter was consensual. The District Attorney stated the verdict shows that celebrity status does not prevent prosecution for criminal acts in the county.</p>
