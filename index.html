          <p>David Huerta, president of the California division of the Service Employees International Union, was charged with conspiracy to impede an officer after being arrested during anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles. According to court documents, Huerta allegedly blocked a gate to an ICE staging ground and resisted law enforcement efforts to move him. Newsom and other Democratic leaders have denounced the arrest, while Huerta himself stated the protests are about resisting injustice against hard-working people and families. He was released on a $50,000 bond and is due back in court in July.</p>

          <p>Chinese exports to Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia have increased significantly in the first five months of the year, driven by consumer demand, factory investments, and the need to offset losses from US tariffs. Manufacturers are increasingly shipping goods to Southeast Asia for final assembly and re-export, including to the United States, to avoid tariffs. Analysts note that this shift reflects a diversification of export destinations and closer economic ties between China and Southeast Asian countries. This allows some exports to be transshipped from China via Southeast Asia to avoid US tariffs.</p>

          <p>A think tank in Taiwan has initiated a two-day war game simulation with retired US and Japanese generals to assess the island's defense capabilities in the event of a military attack from mainland China. The exercise aims to identify defense issues that Taiwan urgently needs to strengthen and provide recommendations for the government. The simulation involves discussing the feasibility of Taiwan's military strategy and operational concepts in response to a potential Chinese attack by 2030. The event marks the first operational-level military simulation by a civilian institution.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has asserted that Los Angeles is under siege and has defended his decision to deploy National Guard troops to quell protests over immigration enforcement. However, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and California Gov. Gavin Newsom have disputed Trump's characterization, stating that local law enforcement can manage the situation. Newsom has accused Trump of escalating tensions and has initiated a lawsuit over the deployment of troops without state consent. Despite Trump's claims, much of Los Angeles has continued to operate normally.</p>

          <p>More than 300 Foreign Office staff who raised concerns about the UK's approach to Israel's actions in Gaza were told they could consider resigning if they profoundly disagreed with government policy. The staff questioned continued arms sales and what they termed a "stark disregard for international law" by Israel. Senior civil servants responded by saying that while healthy challenge was welcome, resignation was an "honourable course" for those with profound disagreements. This response has led to frustration and disappointment among some officials.</p>

          <p>The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) has issued a report warning of an unprecedented decline in world fertility rates. The report cites the prohibitive cost of parenthood and the lack of suitable partners as reasons why many people are unable to have the number of children they desire. A survey of 14,000 people in 14 countries found that one in five respondents said they have not had or do not expect to have their desired number of children. The UNFPA is urging caution in response to low fertility, advising against panicky policies.</p>

          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have significantly decreased, with a 47% reduction in fatal overdose risk for those aged 20 to 29. This trend is attributed to factors including wider distribution of Narcan, weaker fentanyl potency, and less risky drug use among teens. Despite this positive shift, addiction remains a severe issue for many, and potential cuts in funding for addiction services pose a threat to sustaining progress. Researchers are studying the reasons behind this decline to better understand how to continue saving lives.</p>
