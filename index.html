          <h2>Trump's Attacks on Fed Chair Powell Trigger Market Slide</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 02:34:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump intensified his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling him a "major loser" for not lowering interest rates preemptively to boost the economy. This criticism, coupled with concerns over Trump's tariff plans, led to a plunge in US stocks and a weakening dollar. The S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq all experienced significant drops, and investors sought safe-haven assets like gold, which hit a new record high. Trump's attacks on Powell, whom he appointed, have added to market uncertainty amidst fears of an economic slowdown. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 02:14:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US Commerce Department announced tariffs as high as 3,521% on solar panel imports from Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam, responding to allegations of Chinese subsidies and unfair dumping practices. The tariffs aim to protect US solar panel manufacturers, who claim Chinese-headquartered companies are cheating the system. While these tariffs could benefit domestic producers, they may also increase costs for businesses and consumers who rely on cheaper solar products. The International Trade Commission will make a final decision on the tariffs in June, potentially reshaping the solar energy market. </p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with Japanese officials to advocate for increased power generation to support the growing demands of artificial intelligence development. Huang emphasized Japan's strong position in robotics and industrial manufacturing, but noted that significant energy infrastructure is needed to fuel AI advancements. Japan faces challenges in balancing data center electricity needs with restarting nuclear reactors and importing fossil fuels. The country is considering investing in a large liquefied natural gas project in Alaska as part of its efforts to secure energy resources.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's restrictions on critical metal exports to the US are having a significant impact, with exports of these minerals plummeting and shipments of several items halting entirely in March, according to customs data. This move is seen as retaliation for US tariffs on Chinese goods, putting pressure on US manufacturers who rely on Chinese rare earths. The cutbacks affect metals like tellurium and tungsten, vital for solar panels and thermoelectric devices. The situation highlights China's strategic advantage in the rare earths supply chain amid ongoing trade tensions.</p>

          <p>CATL, the world's largest EV battery supplier, announced its second-generation Shenxing battery, claiming it can add 520 km (323 miles) of driving range with just five minutes of charging. This surpasses claims by BYD, which recently introduced a system adding 400 km of range in the same time. If proven feasible on a larger scale, CATL's technology could alleviate consumer concerns about electric vehicle range and charging convenience. The company's claims would also place it ahead of Western competitors like Tesla and Mercedes-Benz in terms of charging speed.</p>

          <p>The UK government will publish data on the nationalities of foreign criminals living in the country for the first time. The move comes amid pressure to disclose figures on foreign offenders awaiting deportation. The Home Office attributes the increase in foreign criminals awaiting deportation to early releases, instability in other countries, and human rights appeals. The most common offenses among these individuals are drug production, theft, robbery, and violent assault.</p>

While a weaker dollar can ease debt burdens and lower inflation, it also complicates export competitiveness and may prompt currency devaluations.

Some, like the European Central Bank, have used the opportunity to cut rates, while others, like Indonesia's central bank, are hesitant due to currency volatility.</p>
