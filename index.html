        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Keurig Dr Pepper is set to acquire the Dutch coffee and tea firm JDE Peet's in an approximately $18 billion transaction, paying shareholders 31.85 euros per share, which represents a substantial 33% premium on the Dutch firm's 90-day volume-weighted average stock price. Following this significant acquisition, Keurig Dr Pepper plans to split its beverage and coffee units into two separate, U.S.-listed companies, effectively unwinding the 2018 merger that created the third-largest beverage company in North America. This strategic move aims to optimize business focus and enhance shareholder value within the competitive global beverage market. The article details the financial specifics and future organizational plans.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A limited number of National Guard members in Washington D.C., likely fewer than 50, have been authorized to carry service weapons, an escalation directed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. This decision comes amidst President Trump's law enforcement crackdown in the capital, despite previous Pentagon and Army statements that troops would not be armed. Local officials, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, deem the initiative unnecessary, citing declining violent crime rates in D.C. for the past year and a half. The arming raises significant concerns about the changing role of the Guard in domestic policing and potential for increased tension.</p>

Chinese property and technology stocks were key contributors to the gains, with the Hang Seng Tech index rising over 3%. Analysts at Goldman Sachs noted a popular view of maturing time deposits shifting into equities, sustaining momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Singapore's inflation rate for July eased to a cooler-than-expected 0.6%, marking its lowest level since January 2021, according to data from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). Core inflation, excluding private transport and accommodation, also dipped to 0.5%, below Reuters' forecasts. The MAS attributed the moderation to falling retail and other goods prices, alongside lower electricity and gas inflation. While the central bank forecasts moderate inflation in the near term, it warns of slower economic growth later this year due to global trade shifts. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite slowing hiring momentum, initial U.S. jobless claims remain near historical lows, while the U.K. also reports declining job vacancies.
