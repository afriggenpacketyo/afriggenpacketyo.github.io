          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's office stated that he no longer believes transgender women are women, following a UK Supreme Court ruling defining 'woman' as biological sex under equalities law. This marks a shift from Starmer's previous stance, drawing criticism from political opponents. The government insists single-sex spaces are protected by law, and a person born male does not have the right to use women-only spaces. The announcement has sparked debate within the Labour Party, with some MPs expressing concern about anxieties within the trans community.</p>

          <p>Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, stepped down as chairman of the board of nuclear startup Oklo, which he took public in May 2024.

          <p>The Supreme Court seems inclined to require a Maryland school board to allow parents to opt their children out of instruction involving storybooks on gender identity and sexual orientation. The case revolves around whether schools unconstitutionally burden parents' First Amendment right to religious freedom. The conservative majority of the court questioned the school board's refusal to allow opt-outs, noting that many states already have similar policies. The Trump administration supports the parents' claim that the no-opt-out policy forces them to choose between violating their religious beliefs and forgoing public education.</p>

          <p>In a narrow 5-4 ruling, Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Chief Justice John Roberts sided with left-leaning justices in an immigration appeals case. The case, Monsalvo Velazquez v. Bondi, centered on the government's interpretation of a 60-day "voluntary departure" deadline for immigrants. The court ruled that any voluntary departure deadlines falling on a weekend or legal holiday should be extended to the next business day. This ruling could signal the court's future approach to immigration-related legal challenges.</p>

          <p>A growing trend on social media involves creators reading and analyzing legal documents, often line by line, for large audiences. This phenomenon, dubbed "lawyerly ASMR," has surprised even its creators, who find that viewers enjoy the monotony and minutiae of legal proceedings. The popularity of this content may stem from a desire for transparency and a belief that anyone can become an expert by reading publicly available documents. Some creators also express concerns about the potential for misogyny and the spread of misinformation within the comments sections.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's plan to resume collecting defaulted student loan payments from millions of borrowers could negatively impact the economy. Experts warn that wage garnishments will reduce consumer spending, potentially contributing to an economic slowdown. The policy affects roughly 5 million borrowers, with millions more at risk of default. The debt collections will be paid to the U.S. Treasury, potentially easing a fraction of the nation's debt.

          <p>The Trump administration is proposing a major overhaul of the State Department, including eliminating a war crimes office and shifting the focus of staff working on migration and refugees. The plan involves cutting around 130 domestic offices and 700 jobs. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the restructure aims to eliminate "radical ideologues" and "bureaucratic infighters". The changes echo the administration's broader efforts to reduce government spending and streamline agencies.</p>
