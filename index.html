          <p>Apple has removed ICEBlock and similar applications from its App Store, citing safety concerns for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. This action followed pressure from Attorney General Pam Bondi and was prompted by a recent Dallas ICE facility attack where the assailant reportedly used such an app. The app's creator, Joshua Aaron, had developed it to assist immigrants, drawing parallels between current immigration enforcement and historical events in Nazi Germany.</p>

          <p>A new Goldman Sachs study indicates that 42% of younger working Americans, including Gen Z, millennials, and Gen X, live paycheck to paycheck with no spare savings, making retirement planning increasingly difficult. This figure is projected to rise to over half of Americans by 2033, driven by escalating costs for essentials like housing and healthcare. The article highlights the inadequacy of simply advising people to "save more" and suggests strategies like early childhood savings or private market investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study reveals U.S. rivers are experiencing "riverine heat waves" at a faster rate than air heat waves, a surprising and concerning trend. These prolonged periods of abnormally high water temperatures, driven primarily by climate change and human-induced structural changes like dams, pose a significant threat to aquatic ecosystems. Researchers hope this analysis will increase public awareness of the critical water quality issues exacerbated by climate change.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly asserting the U.S. is in a "non-international armed conflict" with drug cartels to legally justify recent military strikes on Venezuelan drug boats that killed 17 people. This novel legal theory, presented to Congress, designates cartels as "non-state armed groups" whose actions constitute an "armed attack" against the U.S. Critics question the legality and escalating nature of these military actions, which are seen as increasing pressure on Venezuela amidst drug war efforts.</p>
