          <p>Japan's professional women's football league, the WE League, concluded its fourth season with a new attendance record, drawing over 337,000 spectators. This success was driven by innovative promotional strategies, including a collaborative doubleheader with the men's J-League that attracted over 26,000 fans to a single match. The league, now working in tandem with the J-League under a shared chairperson, also saw individual clubs like Sanfrecce Hiroshima Regina achieve massive turnouts through player-led campaigns. The league plans to build on this momentum by providing all clubs with data and marketing tools to further grow its audience.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has approved a $5 increase for general admission tickets to the L.A. Zoo, effective July 1, to help mitigate the city's budget crisis. Adult tickets will now cost $27, while children's tickets will be $22, a move intended to generate revenue after the mayor's proposed budget included significant staffing cuts at the facility. Zoo officials had warned that the proposed cuts would negatively impact animal care and the visitor experience. This price hike is the first major increase since 2012, though admission remains significantly lower than other major California zoos.</p>

          <p>Japan successfully launched its 50th and final H2A rocket, concluding a 24-year era for the country's space program. The rocket, developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, successfully placed a government climate-monitoring satellite into orbit from Tanegashima Island. With a high success rate of approximately 98%, the H2A has been a cornerstone of Japan's space exploration, despite an early failure in 2003. The program is now succeeded by the more cost-effective H3 rocket, which is designed to compete in the commercial satellite launch market dominated by companies like SpaceX.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis is proposing that the county explore legal action to challenge what she describes as unconstitutional immigration enforcement by federal agents. The motion follows several recent incidents, including a violent arrest in Valinda, where agents allegedly used excessive force. Citing widespread fear in communities that is impacting the local economy and public health, the proposal seeks to prevent unlawful stops, searches, and detentions by federal personnel. This move mirrors a similar effort by the L.A. City Council, as critics point to an escalation in tactics by federal agents.</p>

          <p>Following the recent 12-day war with Israel, Iran's regime has deepened its domestic crackdown, executing several men accused of collaborating with Israel and arresting hundreds more. Human rights activists argue the executed individuals were denied fair trials and that the government is using the post-war climate to instill fear and suppress dissent. The regime has also announced new surveillance measures, forming a special committee to monitor citizens' online activities. Many Iranians express fear that the government, feeling wounded after the conflict, is taking revenge on its own people, creating a terrifying atmosphere of repression.</p>

Displaced multiple times and now living with her family in a small apartment, she describes the psychological torture of constant drone sounds and the struggle to find meaning as her world collapses. Hanya details the daily fear, the malnourishment, and the profound sense of loss, not just of loved ones and her home, but of her own identity and future. Her diary illustrates how the war has stripped away normalcy, making grieving a luxury and finding beauty an act of resistance.</p>

Talks for a pause in fighting have been intermittent, with a recent proposal involving a hostage and prisoner exchange failing to gain traction.

          <p>A team of astronomers has discovered mysterious, ancient radio waves that traveled for 10 billion years to reach Earth from the distant galaxy cluster SpARCS1049. The signals originate from a "mini-halo," a vast cloud of high-energy particles and magnetic fields, which has never been observed at such a great distance before. This discovery, made using the LOFAR radio telescope, challenges existing timelines for the universe's development. Researchers believe the energetic particles forming the halo were likely produced by either supermassive black holes or cosmic particle collisions, suggesting these powerful cosmic processes were shaping galaxies much earlier than previously thought.</p>

          <p>Despite the Los Angeles Dodgers losing 9-5 to the Kansas City Royals, Shohei Ohtani showcased his most impressive pitching outing of the season. In two sharp innings, he demonstrated dominant form, throwing his hardest-ever MLB pitch at 101.7 mph to escape a first-inning jam. Ohtani threw 20 strikes out of 27 pitches and retired the side in the second, flashing the powerful potential of his arm as he continues his recovery from Tommy John surgery. While the Dodgers' bullpen struggled after he left the mound, Ohtani's strong performance was a significant positive development for the team.</p>

          <p>A new study of the ancient city of Ã‡atalhÃ¶yÃ¼k in Turkey suggests it may have been a matriarchal society ruled by females over 9,000 years ago. After analyzing DNA from over 130 skeletons buried under the city's houses, researchers found that genetic connections within households were primarily traced through the female line. This indicates that men likely relocated to their wives' households after marriage, a practice known as matrilocality. The findings, which also show preferential treatment for females in burials, challenge the Western bias that assumes ancient societies were universally patrilineal and point to a system where women held social power.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has sentenced two men to life in prison for their roles in the 2022 deaths of 53 migrants found in an abandoned tractor-trailer in Texas. Felipe Orduna-Torres and Armando Gonzales-Garcia were convicted for the smuggling operation, which involved transporting 64 people in a truck with no water or working air conditioning during the summer heat. Only 11 people survived the ordeal. Prosecutors stated the men were aware the air conditioning was broken and left the migrants to die. The sentences conclude a tragic case that highlighted the extreme dangers migrants face.</p>
