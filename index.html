        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. airstrikes targeting Yemen's capital have reportedly killed at least eight people, according to Houthi rebels, amidst an ongoing American military campaign that has conducted over 800 strikes in a month. The U.S. military claims these strikes, part of "Operation Roughrider," have killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and leaders involved in missile and drone programs, though specific details remain limited for operational security reasons. The U.S. asserts its actions are aimed at restoring freedom of navigation and deterring Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping and Israel, which they claim are backed by Iran. The Houthis have tightened control over information, restricting access to Starlink satellite internet, which has been crucial for communication in conflict zones like Ukraine. </p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-27 22:11:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's efforts to hinder the wind energy sector by halting permits for new projects on federal land, the industry is finding new opportunities through "repowering" aging wind farms. This involves upgrading or replacing old turbines with more efficient models, increasing electricity output by up to 50%. Companies like GE Vernova, Vestas, and Siemens Gamesa are benefiting from this trend, reporting revenue increases and stock gains. The U.S. currently has over 75,600 turbines across 45 states, and repowering allows operators to increase capacity without acquiring new property or facing extensive permitting processes.</p>

          <p>While some data center projects are being reconsidered by major tech companies like Microsoft and Amazon, the AI data center market remains strong overall. Experts suggest this is not a bust, but a strategic pause and reallocation of resources due to factors like evolving AI technology, geopolitical concerns, and scarcity of resources such as power, fiber, water, and land. Major players like Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon are still planning significant capital expenditures on AI infrastructure. The long-term demand for AI and data centers is expected to continue growing, driven by enterprise adoption and the need for low-latency, high-efficiency facilities.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney, former central banker, became Canada's new prime minister and called a snap general election for April 28. The election was triggered by former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's resignation and growing calls for a vote after US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs, sparking a trade war. Voters do not directly cast a ballot for prime minister; instead, they elect members of parliament (MPs), and the leader of the party with the majority of MPs becomes PM. Key issues for voters include responding to Trump's economic threats, the cost of living, the economy, and the housing affordability crisis.</p>

The video, recorded in 1999, features Omar al-Bayoumi, a suspected Saudi intelligence operative, filming entrances, exits, and security posts at the Capitol.
