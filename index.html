          <p>Two Delta Connection aircraft were involved in a low-speed collision on a taxiway at New York's LaGuardia Airport. The incident occurred when an arriving flight struck a stationary plane preparing for departure, resulting in damage to both aircraft. A flight attendant sustained a minor injury and was hospitalized, but no passengers were seriously harmed. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the collision, which caused no significant disruptions to airport operations.</p>

          <p>President Trump has framed the ongoing government shutdown as a strategic chance to eliminate federal spending on programs he considers Democratic priorities. He announced plans to meet with his budget director to identify agencies for potential cuts, which he stated could be temporary or permanent. This move follows the administration's recent freezing of billions in funding for infrastructure and climate projects in Democratic-leaning states, signaling an intent to leverage the shutdown for political and fiscal objectives.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report by the conservative fiscal watchdog OpenTheBooks argues that the Trump administration's celebrated cuts to discretionary spending are insignificant compared to the vast, mandatory expenditures on Medicare and Social Security. The analysis highlights that spending on these entitlement programs in 2024, totaling over $2.4 trillion, dwarfs the savings from recent rescissions and other program cuts. The group suggests that meaningful fiscal reform requires addressing the scale and inefficiencies within these large-scale safety net programs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has publicly stated his belief that Jeffrey Epstein engaged in blackmail to secure a lenient sentence in his 2008 case. Lutnick, Epstein's former neighbor, suggested that Epstein videotaped high-profile associates participating in illicit activities and traded this compromising material for his "sweetheart deal." This theory contradicts official statements from the FBI, which has maintained there is no credible information that Epstein trafficked individuals to others.</p>

          <p>Todd Arrington, the director of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, has resigned under pressure after a conflict with the Trump administration over a gift for King Charles III. Arrington reportedly resisted a request to give an original Eisenhower sword from the museum's collection to the monarch, arguing it was the property of the American people. He instead helped procure a replica, but the disagreement appears to have led to his forced departure, which he claims was presented as an ultimatum to either resign or be fired.</p>

          <p>As the government shutdown continues, President Donald Trump has engaged in a prolific social media campaign to blame Democrats and frame the situation to his advantage. His posts have included attacks on his political opponents, false claims about healthcare funding, and announcements of plans to cut federal programs. This online strategy mirrors his approach during past crises, using his platform to directly communicate his narrative and rally his supporters, while his administration echoes the confrontational tone on official government websites.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially designated drug cartels operating in the Caribbean as "unlawful combatants," declaring the U.S. to be in a "non-international armed conflict" with these groups. This legal framing, detailed in a memo to Congress, follows recent U.S. military strikes on boats in the Caribbean that resulted in 17 deaths. The move represents a significant escalation in the U.S. approach to counter-narcotics, potentially justifying further military action against groups the administration has also labeled as "non-state armed groups."</p>

          <p>A decline in average 30-year fixed mortgage rates to 6.34% has made large home loans more affordable compared to earlier in the year. For a $700,000 mortgage, the current monthly principal and interest payment is approximately $4,351, about $273 less than it would have been at January's average rate of 6.93%. This drop in rates can result in nearly $100,000 of interest savings over the life of the loan, providing significant financial relief for homebuyers. (not investment advice)</p>
