          <p>An Ontario judge acquitted five former members of Canada's world junior hockey team of sexually assaulting a woman in a hotel room in 2018. Justice Maria Carroccia ruled that the accuser's testimony was not "credible or reliable," pointing to inconsistencies and an uncertain memory. The case, which centered on the issue of consent, had drawn significant national attention and followed a multi-million dollar civil settlement between the woman and Hockey Canada in 2022. The judge stated the Crown failed to meet its burden of proof on any of the charges.</p>

          <p>A viral social media claim that "The Simpsons" predicted a kiss cam incident at a Coldplay concert has been determined to be false. DW Fact Check found that the image circulating online, allegedly from a 2015 episode, does not appear in the show and was likely generated by AI. The article notes this is one of many fabricated or misattributed predictions credited to the long-running animated series. Show creator Matt Groening has stated that with thousands of jokes over the decades, some are bound to coincidentally resemble real events, but they are not intentional predictions.</p>

          <p>The latest round of Gaza ceasefire negotiations in Doha has stalled, as both Israeli and U.S. negotiating teams have departed. A U.S. special envoy stated the decision was made after Hamas's latest response showed a "lack of desire" to reach an agreement, accusing the group of not acting in good faith. An unnamed senior Israeli official insisted the talks had not collapsed but criticized Hamas's "rejectionist" approach. The breakdown in talks occurs amid worsening humanitarian conditions in Gaza, with aid organizations warning of mass starvation and ongoing difficulties in delivering supplies.</p>

          <p>Industrial conglomerate Honeywell saw its share price fall despite reporting second-quarter revenue and earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations. The company's organic sales grew by 5%, and it raised its full-year outlook for sales, growth, and earnings per share. The stock decline is attributed to disappointing segment margin figures, partly due to increased R&D spending in its aerospace division. Analysts suggest the market reaction was overly negative, viewing the underlying results as strong and the company's planned three-part breakup as a positive future catalyst.

          <p>A growing number of lawmakers in Congress are pressuring the Trump administration to release more material related to Jeffrey Epstein than the White House has requested. A bipartisan bill, the Epstein Files Transparency Act, seeks a comprehensive release of documents, including flight logs and internal DOJ communications, going beyond the grand jury transcripts the administration sought to unseal. House Speaker Mike Johnson has expressed concerns about protecting victims' privacy, while Democrats accuse the GOP of attempting to hide information.

Nadella framed the changes as part of a necessary evolution, shifting the company's mission "from a software factory to an intelligence engine" in the new era of AI.

While practical realities have historically constrained these goals, the article contends that President Trump's proposal to relocate Gazans and redevelop the area has dangerously reinforced them. The author suggests this vision was seized upon by Israel's far-right, prolonging the conflict and obstructing a ceasefire by making the prospect of removing the Gazan population seem plausible.

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick asserted that CEOs of major U.S. auto companies are "cool with" a new trade deal that imposes a 15% tariff on Japanese auto imports. This is lower than the 25% tariff their own companies face on vehicles imported from manufacturing plants in Canada and Mexico. The American Automotive Policy Council, which represents GM, Ford, and Stellantis, has publicly called it a "bad deal" that disadvantages U.S. automakers. Lutnick dismissed these complaints as being "ginned up" by PR staff and suggested U.S. companies could avoid the tariffs by moving production back to America. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 2026 U.S. Senate race in North Carolina is taking shape, with high-profile candidates from both parties expected to enter. Sources indicate that Republican National Committee chairman Michael Whatley is preparing to run for the open seat, a plan reportedly approved by the White House. This follows an announcement from Lara Trump that she will not seek the nomination. On the Democratic side, popular former North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper is expected to announce his candidacy next week. The race is for the seat being vacated by Republican Senator Thom Tillis and is anticipated to be a major battleground contest.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that California's law requiring background checks for all ammunition purchases is unconstitutional. In a 2-1 decision, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found the law infringes on the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. The majority opinion stated that the state failed to prove the law was consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation, a standard set by the Supreme Court's 2022 Bruen decision. The law, which took effect in 2019, was approved by voters and required background checks for every ammunition purchase in the state.</p>

          <p>Hulk Hogan, the iconic professional wrestler who propelled the sport into a global mainstream phenomenon, has died at the age of 71. Born Terry Bollea, he died after a cardiac arrest at his home in Clearwater, Florida. As the quintessential "good guy" of the 1980s WWF, his "Hulkamania" persona and signature catchphrases made him a pop culture superstar. He later reinvented himself as the villainous "Hollywood Hogan" in the 1990s and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame twice. Hogan's career was also marked by controversies, including a steroid trial and the release of a tape containing racist remarks.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explains Why Sweeping Tariffs Have Not Yet Caused Major Inflation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 14:15:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite initial predictions of runaway inflation, President Trump's sweeping tariffs have not yet caused a dramatic spike in consumer prices. Economists suggest this is due to several mitigating factors, including the delayed rollout of tariffs against key trading partners and businesses stockpiling inventory to absorb initial costs. However, this analysis from Vox argues the declarations of success are premature, as the upward pressure on prices is still expected to materialize. As companies' inventories run out, they will face increasing pressure to pass the higher costs of imported goods on to consumers later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

The fatal Air India flight, which killed 260 people in total, has been the subject of an intense investigation focused on the fuel control switches. FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford stated with a "high level of confidence" that the incident was not caused by a mechanical problem or inadvertent switch movement.

Over the past 15 years, AI-related job postings have grown at an average annual rate of nearly 29%, far outpacing general job growth. This trend has accelerated as more companies integrate AI into their operations, with the number of firms using AI more than doubling since early 2023. While still a small fraction of the overall labor market, these jobs, which range from specialized AI engineers to AI-proficient software developers, typically offer higher salaries than comparable non-AI roles.</p>

          <p>For savers deciding where to place a large sum like $25,000, the choice between a certificate of deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account involves a trade-off between rate security and liquidity. Based on current rates, a 6-month CD at 4.45% would earn slightly more than a high-yield savings account at 4.30%. The key advantage of the CD is that its rate is locked in, guaranteeing the return and protecting it from potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. A savings account's rate is variable and could decrease, but it offers the flexibility to withdraw funds at any time without penalty. (not investment advice)</p>

In an apparent pre-emptive move, Fed officials conducted a media tour to explain that renovation cost overruns were due to factors like tariffs and rising material costs.
