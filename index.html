          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi appeared with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth at a Justice Department meeting concerning alleged anti-Christian bias during the Biden administration. The meeting occurred amidst revelations about Hegseth's use of Signal chats to share potentially sensitive information. Bondi dismissed suggestions of a DOJ investigation into the Signal chat controversy, while Hegseth indicated the DOJ might pursue criminal charges against former aides accused of leaking information. Bondi asserted the Justice Department is aggressively investigating events during the Biden administration that conservatives say showed "anti-Christian" bias by senior law enforcement officials.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a plan to phase out eight artificial food dyes from the US food supply by the end of next year. The FDA will work with food companies to remove the dyes, citing studies linking them to health conditions like ADHD, obesity, and cancer. The FDA is also seeking to eliminate six remaining synthetic dyes used in cereal, ice cream, snacks, yogurts and more. The International Association of Color Manufacturers questioned the proposed timeline, citing potential supply disruptions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FDA is urging the food industry to voluntarily discontinue the use of synthetic food dyes, aligning with HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s goal of replacing them with natural alternatives. This move stops short of an outright ban, relying instead on industry cooperation to transition away from synthetic dyes. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary expressed optimism about working with the food industry, while industry representatives cited concerns about potential supply disruptions and the lack of safety concerns. The FDA says it will be "working with industry to eliminate six remaining synthetic food dyes" and will also be accelerating the review and approval of some new natural color additives.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers visited Mahmoud Khalil and Rümeysa Öztürk, two students detained in Louisiana for participating in pro-Palestinian protests. The students were arrested by immigration officers as part of the White House's crackdown on antisemitism on US college campuses. The lawmakers accuse the Trump administration of intentionally targeting the students and moving them to a conservative court. They demand answers from Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and acting director of Ice, Todd Lyons.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece suggests that Donald Trump can draw inspiration from China's approach to restoring harmony in its society. It claims American society is plagued with serious imbalances and Trump can learn from China's model. The article posits that Chinese leaders balance philosophy, power, and pragmatism in policymaking, and Trump should prioritize stabilizing America. The MAGA vision failed to resonate with university-educated voters, while it attracted working-class voters disillusioned by income inequality.</p>

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that Trump's tariffs have unleashed a "major negative shock" into the world economy.
