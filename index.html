            <p>A Delta Air Lines flight was evacuated at Orlando International Airport after an engine caught fire on the tarmac, prompting a swift response from the Aircraft Rescue & Fire Fighting team. The Airbus A330, carrying over 200 passengers, 10 flight attendants, and two pilots, was preparing for departure to Atlanta when the incident occurred. Crews evacuated the cabin after flames were observed in one of the plane's engines, and passengers exited using inflatable emergency slides. The Federal Aviation Administration will investigate the incident, with Delta apologizing for the disruption and emphasizing that safety is the airline's top priority.</p>

            <p>The Federal Trade Commission has filed a lawsuit against Uber, alleging deceptive billing and cancellation practices related to its Uber One subscription service. The FTC claims Uber misled consumers about the subscription's benefits, made cancellation difficult, and charged users without consent, violating the FTC Act and the Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act. Uber disputes the allegations, stating that its sign-up and cancellation processes are clear and compliant with the law. The lawsuit marks the first FTC action against a major tech company since President Trump began his second term, signaling continued scrutiny of Big Tech firms. </p>

Schwab, who is entering his 88th year, did not provide a specific reason for his departure. Peter Brabeck-Letmathe will serve as interim chairman while a search for a permanent replacement is conducted. Schwab established the WEF in 1971 to provide a platform for global leaders to address critical issues, but the organization has faced criticism for being elitist and detached from the concerns of ordinary people.</p>

            <p>Patrick Crusius, the gunman responsible for the 2019 mass shooting at an El Paso Walmart that killed 23 people, has pleaded guilty to capital murder in a state district court. The change of plea came after local prosecutors took the death penalty off the table, driven by the wishes of a majority of victims' relatives who wanted the case to be concluded. Crusius, who has been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, will be automatically sentenced to life in prison without parole. He had previously been sentenced to 90 consecutive life terms at the federal level after pleading guilty to hate crimes and weapons charges.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is threatening New York with "serious consequences" if it does not halt its congestion pricing program in Manhattan, which charges a $9 toll on most passenger vehicles entering south of 60th Street during peak hours. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy sent a letter to Governor Kathy Hochul demanding the cessation of toll collection, claiming it violates federal law and prices working-class Americans out of accessing New York City. The administration could withhold federal funding and approvals for future transportation projects if the tolls remain in place, though New York leaders defend the program as a means to reduce traffic, lower pollution, and generate revenue for public transit.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump has intensified his criticism of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, labeling him a "major loser" and warning of a potential economic slowdown if interest rates are not lowered immediately. Trump claims there is virtually no inflation and that energy costs are declining, thus justifying preemptive rate cuts. This latest attack comes as Trump's team explores the possibility of legally removing Powell before his term expires in May 2026, a move that analysts predict would trigger a significant sell-off in U.S. equity markets due to concerns about Federal Reserve independence.</p>

The vehicle appears to be a military jeep, possibly a 1940-41 Ford Super Deluxe "Woody", and researchers are considering theories as to why it was aboard the ship, including the possibility that it was Rear Admiral Frank Fletcher's flag car or was brought aboard for repairs.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump's economic approval rating has declined to its lowest point during his presidency, driven by widespread discontent over his handling of tariffs, inflation, and government spending, according to a recent CNBC survey. The survey indicates that the economic optimism that initially accompanied Trump's reelection has waned, with more Americans expressing pessimism about the economy and the stock market. While Trump's Republican base remains supportive, Democrats and independents have become increasingly negative about his economic policies, particularly regarding tariffs, which are largely disapproved of by the public.</p>

He remembered meeting Pope Francis on several occasions, including a state visit to Italy earlier this month, with "particular affection." The King highlighted the Pope's concern for the unity of the Church and his belief that care for Creation is an existential expression of faith in God.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Kennedy v. Braidwood Management, a case challenging the authority of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (PSTF) to mandate coverage of preventative care under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Justices Kavanaugh and Barrett seemed inclined to vote against the challenge, suggesting that there may be at least five votes to preserve health insurers’ obligations under Obamacare. The case turns on whether PSTF members are validly classified as inferior officers whose work is supervised by a Senate-confirmed principal officer, with most justices appearing skeptical of the challenger's interpretation of the word “independent.”</p>

            <p>As major tech companies enter first-quarter earnings season, uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariff policies is a key concern.

Companies like Tesla, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and Nvidia face questions about managing increased costs, supply chain adjustments, and inventory management.

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The Supreme Court is considering a case that could affect access to preventive-care services under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The dispute centers on the structure of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and whether its members are properly appointed under the Constitution. A decision against the ACA could limit access to life-saving medical care for millions, while supporters of the challenge argue that the task force is insulated from political accountability. A decision from the Supreme Court is expected by the end of June or early July.</p>

            <p>Elon Musk is reportedly considering leaving his government role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) due to what he perceives as a barrage of vicious attacks from the left.

            <p>Boeing investors are preparing for the full impact of Donald Trump's trade war, with concerns rising after jets intended for a Chinese airline were returned to the US. The aviation industry has been caught up in the trade war, with tariffs causing disruption between the US and China. Boeing's share price fell, reflecting investor uncertainty, and analysts anticipate questions about the effect of tariffs on the business when the company releases its first-quarter financial results. The long-term impact on Boeing's market share in China, a key market for aircraft sales, is also a concern.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump has voiced his support for US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, following reports that military attack details were shared in a Signal group chat that included Hegseth's wife and brother.
