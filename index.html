          <p>Retail chain Claire's, known for its affordable accessories and ear-piercing services, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time since 2018. The company is struggling with a significant debt load of nearly $500 million, declining sales due to inflation, and increased costs from tariffs on Chinese imports. Facing intense competition from online retailers like Amazon, Shein, and Temu, which have captured the attention of its young customer base, Claire's is seeking to reorganize its business while keeping its North American stores operational during the process.</p>

          <p>White House envoy Steve Witkoff held a three-hour meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow as part of a final diplomatic push by the Trump administration. The meeting precedes a U.S.-imposed Friday deadline for Russia to agree to end its war in Ukraine or face severe new economic penalties. As a sign of this pressure, President Trump recently imposed additional tariffs on India for its purchase of Russian oil. While the Kremlin described the talks as "constructive," the outcome remains uncertain amid Trump's growing frustration with ongoing civilian casualties in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Shares for chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) experienced a significant slump after the company's quarterly earnings failed to meet analyst expectations. CEO Lisa Su attributed part of the decline to U.S. export controls on artificial intelligence chips, which have halted sales of its MI308 chip to China. The company's guidance for the next quarter did not include potential revenue from these chips, creating uncertainty among investors about when shipments might resume. This has led to concerns on Wall Street about the company's ability to maintain its growth trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the U.S. imposition of new tariffs on India, this analysis examines the significant repercussions if India and China were to cease buying Russian oil. These two nations became Russia's largest oil customers after Western sanctions were imposed, providing Moscow with crucial revenue for its war in Ukraine while saving billions on discounted energy. Experts warn that removing Russia's five million daily barrels from the market could cause a dramatic spike in global oil prices, stoking inflation worldwide. The article also notes that China may be better positioned than India to withstand U.S. pressure due to its larger economic leverage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A psychologist and mother-to-be critiques what she terms "therapy culture," which promotes the idea that a mother's every action can have lasting psychological consequences for her child. The article challenges the scientific basis of this pressure, citing research that suggests parenting has less deterministic influence on a child's adult traits compared to genetics and peer groups. It argues that this focus on achieving psychological perfection creates immense guilt and anxiety for mothers, diverting attention from the lack of structural supports like affordable childcare and paid leave. The author advocates for a shift away from obsessive self-scrutiny toward addressing these larger societal issues.</p>

The author describes how these sprawling trees serve as central gathering places, offering shade and a space for rest, prayer, and play in both Hindu and Muslim communities. Accompanied by a photograph from a village in Gujarat, the piece highlights a scene of men resting in the heat near a banyan tree, contrasting their stillness with the labor of women carrying water nearby.

          <p>As potential homebuyers face high mortgage rates and inflation, lending experts are weighing in on whether housing will become more affordable this fall. Most analysts predict that mortgage rates will remain relatively stable, hovering in the mid-to-high 6% range, which could prevent significant price drops. National housing inventory is rising, which may ease prices in some markets, but the situation is highly regional. Experts suggest that if rates stay high, prices could see a slight decline, but a significant drop in rates below 6% would likely reignite buyer competition and drive prices up again.

A revenue shortfall in June, attributed to a lack of working capital and changes from a major customer, also contributed to the poor results. The guidance fell short of Wall Street estimates, signaling a slowdown from the company's recent surge driven by AI server demand. (not investment advice)</p>

While talks have eased the immediate conflict, sources indicate Brentford will only consider a sale for a price significantly higher than Newcastle's current offer of £25 million plus add-ons.

          <p>President Donald Trump has characterized multibillion-dollar investment pledges from trade partners like the EU and Japan as personal victories, calling them "gifts" and a "signing bonus." However, this framing starkly contrasts with how these partners view the arrangements, which they describe as aspirational goals for private sector investment, not government-enforced payments. For example, an EU fact sheet notes only an "interest" from companies in investing, which the European Commission has limited power to direct. This disconnect highlights a fundamental difference in interpreting the framework agreements, with the White House warning that tariff rates could be adjusted if commitments are not met.

The CDC recommends preventing mosquito bites by using insect repellent and wearing protective clothing, and notes that a vaccine is available for those visiting affected areas.</p>

          <h2>New Research Links Excessive Screen Time in Children and Teens to Heart Health Risks</h2>

          <p>A study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association has found a link between excessive screen time and increased risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases in young people. The research, which analyzed data from over 1,000 Danish youths, showed that 10- and 18-year-olds who spent more time on devices had higher risks for conditions like high blood pressure and insulin resistance. Researchers found that each additional hour of screen time correlated with a higher overall risk score, and the effect was amplified by insufficient sleep. The findings suggest that limiting discretionary screen time is important for long-term heart and metabolic health.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is auctioning the Amadea, a 348-foot superyacht seized from a sanctioned Russian billionaire as part of a task force targeting oligarchs after the invasion of Ukraine. The vessel, valued at over $300 million, features a helipad, pool, and cinema. To place a bid in the September 10 auction, potential buyers must have a net worth of at least $500 million and provide a $10 million deposit. A holding company tied to the yacht disputes its ownership by the sanctioned individual, claiming it belongs to another non-sanctioned Russian, but this claim has been rejected by the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren has sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, urging them to closely examine the proposed $2.4 billion merger of Dick's Sporting Goods and Foot Locker. Warren argues the deal could harm consumers by raising prices, cutting jobs, and reducing competition in the athletic footwear market. She expressed concern that the acquisition could create a duopoly alongside rival JD Sports, which has also been rapidly acquiring smaller competitors. The letter asks the agencies to block the deal if it is found to violate antitrust laws, putting a spotlight on the Trump administration's approach to large retail mergers.

          <p>U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has canceled $500 million in funding for 22 research projects involving mRNA vaccines, claiming the technology fails to protect against respiratory infections like COVID and flu. This move by the prominent vaccine skeptic is being questioned by health experts, who call it a potentially "catastrophic error." Scientists argue that while mRNA vaccines were not perfect, they saved millions of lives during the pandemic and remain a critical tool for rapidly responding to future outbreaks, such as a potential bird flu pandemic. They worry the decision could undermine confidence in vaccines and put the world at risk.</p>

Castleton, who was bankrupted by the original legal costs, is the first individual to take legal action against both organizations. His legal team alleges that the Post Office and Fujitsu conspired to pervert the course of justice by deliberately withholding evidence about the faulty software.</p>
