          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers' Shohei Ohtani made his pitching return against the San Diego Padres, allowing a single run in one inning. Ohtani gave up singles to the first two batters before a sacrifice fly scored a run. His fastball reached 100 mph during the outing, which came earlier than initially expected due to the Dodgers' pitching injuries. Ohtani last pitched on August 23, 2023, and underwent elbow surgery a month later, making this a significant step in his recovery and return to his two-way role. The outing marked a milestone in Ohtani's career as he continues to balance hitting and pitching for the Dodgers. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump cut short his attendance at the G7 summit in Canada, citing the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel as the reason for his early return to Washington. The White House emphasized that Trump had a productive day at the summit, including a trade deal with the UK, but his focus shifted to addressing the situation in the Middle East. Trump also posted on social media about Iran's nuclear ambitions and urged Iranians to evacuate Tehran, followed by reports of explosions in the Iranian capital. The departure meant Trump missed scheduled meetings with the Ukrainian and Mexican presidents, highlighting the gravity of the situation. </p>

A military commentator suggests the ship is preparing for commissioning and will undergo trial service to test adaptability and coordination. It is anticipated that the Fujian may formally enter service by the end of the year following further sea trials and exercises. </p>

          <p>Salt Lake City police are investigating two self-described "peacekeepers" following a fatal shooting at a "No Kings Day" protest that resulted in one death and another injury. The two men, wearing yellow vests, confronted 24-year-old Arturo Roberto Gamboa, who allegedly brandished a rifle near the crowd. One of the peacekeepers opened fire, killing Arthur Folasa "Afa" Ah Loo, 39, and wounding Gamboa, who was later arrested. The incident raises questions about unauthorized security at public demonstrations, as the event permit did not indicate organized or armed security. </p>

Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stressed the need for a free, fair, and rules-based economic order, but the summit is expected to conclude with action-oriented statements rather than a detailed joint statement. </p>

One amendment seeks to prevent investigations and prosecutions of women terminating their own pregnancies, while maintaining penalties for medical professionals and violent partners.

          <p>President Trump departed the G7 summit early due to the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, raising concerns about potential U.S. involvement. Trump's departure follows a series of developments, including a warning to Tehran residents to evacuate. G7 organizers had hoped to discuss the conflict and issue a statement calling for de-escalation, but Trump's early exit disrupted those plans. Trump indicated he was under pressure to mediate in the conflict, emphasizing the need for in-person talks. </p>

Key senators are raising concerns about the bill, particularly regarding Medicaid changes and state and local tax (SALT) deductions. The Senate legislation would keep the SALT deduction cap at $10,000, while the House bill offers deductions up to $40,000 for those making less than $500,000 annually. Disagreements over Medicaid provider taxes, tax cuts, and the debt limit also pose challenges to passing the bill by the July Fourth deadline (not investment advice).</p>
