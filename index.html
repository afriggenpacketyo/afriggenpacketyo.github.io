        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump has initiated a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, its CEO, and two reporters from The Wall Street Journal. The suit alleges the newspaper published a false and malicious article claiming Trump sent a "bawdy" birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003, which included a hand-drawn naked woman. Trump vehemently denies authoring the letter, calling the story "FAKE NEWS" and a failure of journalistic ethics. A spokesperson for Dow Jones, the Journal's publisher, stated they have full confidence in their reporting and will vigorously defend against the lawsuit.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Justice has formally moved to unseal the grand jury transcripts from the cases of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Citing intense public interest and a commitment to transparency, the motion filed in Manhattan federal court argues that the case's notoriety constitutes a special circumstance justifying the release of the normally secret records. The DOJ assures that all victim names and personal identifying information will be redacted to protect their privacy. This action follows an internal review that found no new evidence to charge additional individuals but aims to provide the public with greater insight into the investigation.</p>

          <p>An explosion at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department training facility in East L.A. resulted in the deaths of three deputies. The incident, which occurred at the Biscailuz Center Training Academy, represents the largest single loss of life for the department since 1857. Officials reported that the deputies were members of the elite Arson Explosives Detail and were working to render safe a grenade that had been recovered from a Santa Monica garage the previous day. The investigation is ongoing, with federal agencies like the ATF and FBI assisting local law enforcement to determine the exact cause of the tragic blast.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died after being pulled into an MRI machine at a facility in Westbury, New York. The man was reportedly wearing a large metallic chain and entered the MRI room against staff orders while a scan was in progress for his relative. The powerful magnetic force of the machine pulled the chain, causing the man to be drawn in and suffer severe injuries from which he later died at the hospital. Medical experts emphasize the strict safety protocols surrounding MRI machines, which can turn metallic objects into dangerous projectiles, though such fatal incidents are considered rare.</p>

The bipartisan legislation primarily targets the $250 billion stablecoin market, creating consumer protections and clear legal definitions for these digital assets, which are pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar. The act allows banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins, a move hailed by supporters as a way to facilitate faster, lower-cost transactions and strengthen the dollar's role in digital finance.

          <p>President Trump was recently diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after experiencing mild swelling in his lower legs, a condition his physician described as "benign and common." CVI occurs when veins, particularly in the legs, struggle to return blood to the heart, causing it to pool and lead to swelling, aching, or heaviness. The condition affects about one in three U.S. adults and is more common with age and in those who sit or stand for long periods. Treatment typically involves lifestyle changes like compression stockings, leg elevation, and exercise, with minimally invasive procedures available for more serious cases.</p>

The case has drawn attention to Gaddis's legal history, as he had avoided a trial for a previous carjacking charge and had a bench warrant issued for his arrest in a separate domestic violence case just months before the slaying. The district attorney called the case "truly heartbreaking and horrific."</p>

          <h2>Large Wasp Populations Expected in the UK This Summer</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a warm and dry spring, the UK is reportedly experiencing a significant increase in its wasp population this summer. Pest control experts have noted a rise in callouts for large nests appearing earlier than usual. While many dislike the insects, experts from University College London and the charity Buglife emphasize the vital ecological role of wasps as apex predators and natural pest controllers. Although scientific data on this year's numbers is not yet available, the weather patterns suggest a strong year for social wasps. The public is advised to avoid agitating the insects and can distract them with a small amount of a sugary substance placed away from picnic areas.</p>

          <p>The popular cooking competition MasterChef is in turmoil after both of its long-time presenters, Gregg Wallace and John Torode, were sacked following investigations into their conduct. An inquiry upheld over 40 claims against Wallace, including one of unwelcome physical contact. Subsequently, it was revealed that an allegation against Torode for using an extremely offensive racist term on set was also upheld, leading to his dismissal. The BBC and production company Banijay are now facing questions over the handling of the crisis, while the future of already-filmed series remains uncertain, leaving contestants and crew in limbo.</p>

          <p>The Jeffrey Epstein case has become a focal point for many in the MAGA movement, symbolizing a perceived rot within the so-called "deep state." This article explains that for these supporters, the case is less about Epstein himself and more about the belief that a shadowy, powerful elite controls government and other institutions. Conspiracy theories, including the existence of a "client list," have been fueled by years of online discourse and were previously amplified by Donald Trump. The administration's recent statements dampening expectations of major revelations have created a difficult situation for Trump, as he now struggles to satisfy the conspiratorial elements of his base.</p>

          <p>A new theatrical comedy in Liverpool, "The Legend of Rooney's Ring," reimagines the life of football star Wayne Rooney and his wife Coleen as a fantasy epic inspired by "The Lord of the Rings." Written by Helen Serafinowicz, a co-creator of the sitcom "Motherland," the show is a tongue-in-cheek homage to the famous couple. The plot is loosely based on a tabloid myth from 2004 about Coleen allegedly throwing away her engagement ring. The creators insist the spoof is an affectionate tribute to the Rooneys, celebrating them as strong characters who have endured immense public scrutiny since they were childhood sweethearts.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland is extending its RSV vaccination program to include premature babies, who are highly vulnerable to the respiratory virus. Starting this autumn, a long-acting injection, Nirsevimab, will be offered to eligible infants born too early to benefit from the maternal vaccine given during pregnancy. RSV is a leading cause of hospitalization in a child's first year, and this new vaccine offers about 80% protection with a single dose. Health officials stated the move will strengthen the health service's winter preparedness and reduce pressure on hospitals, while also urging parents to keep up with all childhood immunizations.</p>

          <p>This article revisits a remarkable event from 2005, when a 12-year-old Ethiopian girl was rescued from kidnappers by a pride of lions. The girl had been abducted by men intending to force her into marriage and was missing for a week. According to police reports at the time, three lions chased off her captors and then stood guard over her until she was found. A wildlife expert speculated that the girl's crying may have been mistaken for the mewing of a lion cub, preventing the lions from attacking her. The incident was widely regarded as a miracle, especially given that lions are Ethiopia's national symbol.</p>

          <p>The recent cancellation of “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” by CBS has intensified questions about the viability of the traditional late-night talk show format. While the network cited financial pressures amid shrinking audiences and ad revenue, the timing has drawn scrutiny, coming days after Colbert criticized a settlement between parent company Paramount and President Trump. Analysts note that the entire format is struggling as younger viewers turn to social media clips and streaming, making the nightly appointment viewing model obsolete. The move is seen by some as a sign of massive programming cuts to come across legacy media.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have discovered a specific interaction between a gut microbe and a genetic variant that can trigger the inflammatory response seen in ulcerative colitis. The research found that a molecule produced by certain gut bacteria over-activates an immune protein called STING in individuals who have a less effective version of a regulatory gene, OTUD3. This unchecked immune response leads to chronic inflammation in the colon. The study, which used tissue and bacteria from over 100 patients, helps explain why the disease varies so much and why treatments are inconsistent, paving the way for more precise, personalized therapies targeting this specific pathway.</p>

Station managers, particularly in rural areas, warn of creating "news deserts," as they may be forced to cut staff, programming, and essential services like emergency alerts.
