          <p>The Trump administration alleges that Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil misrepresented information on his green card application, claiming he omitted details about his employment and organizational affiliations.  This accusation is part of the administration's justification for Khalil's detention and denial of release, which his legal team contests as a violation of his First Amendment rights.
