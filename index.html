          <p>Bitcoin achieved a new all-time high, surpassing $111,000, driven by positive market momentum, increased optimism surrounding crypto regulation in the U.S., and sustained interest from institutional investors. Despite a recent dip in U.S. stock markets, Bitcoin's price has continued to climb, diverging from its typical correlation with equity markets. Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt and pro-crypto initiatives from President Trump and David Sacks, his AI and crypto czar, also contributed to Bitcoin's rise. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon's announcement that the bank will allow clients to buy Bitcoin further boosted market confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government's planned agreement to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius has been temporarily suspended due to a last-minute injunction issued by a High Court judge. Two Chagossian women filed a case against the Foreign Office, leading to the court's order to prevent the government from finalizing negotiations. The agreement would have allowed the UK and US to continue using a military base on the archipelago for 99 years, with the UK expected to make substantial payments to Mauritius. The court will reconvene to hear the case, with the judge emphasizing the UK's continued jurisdiction over the territory until further notice.</p>

          <p>An independent sentencing review in the UK suggests releasing violent prisoners, including those convicted of sexual assault and domestic abuse, after serving just a third of their sentence to alleviate prison overcrowding. The review also recommends expanding a chemical castration pilot program for sexual offenders and managing more offenders in the community. Former Lord Chancellor David Gauke emphasized the need for major reforms to address the dangerous cycle of emergency releases, highlighting the overcrowded prisons and high reoffending rates. The government is expected to consider the recommendations, with further details to be outlined in a future sentencing bill.</p>

          <p>UK government borrowing was higher than anticipated in April, reaching Â£20.2bn, an increase of Â£1bn compared to April of the previous year. This figure marks the fourth-highest April borrowing since records began in 1993, according to the Office for National Statistics. While tax receipts increased due to higher National Insurance contributions, government expenditure also rose due to pay increases, inflation-related costs, and pension and benefit increases. Borrowing for the financial year ending in March is now estimated at Â£148.3bn, slightly less than initially projected but still above the government's independent forecast.</p>

          <p>A South African lobbyist for white rights, Ernst Roets, appeared on Tucker Carlson's YouTube channel, perpetuating the myth that white people in South Africa are facing genocide. This narrative has gained traction within the MAGA movement, leading President Trump to offer refugee status to "ethnic minority Afrikaners." However, there is no evidence of systematic civil rights violations or disproportionate violence against white South Africans, who still own a significant portion of the country's land. The article argues that this narrative is an attempt to flip the script on apartheid and cast former oppressors as victims.</p>

While Russia is expected to intensify offensive operations, its ability to sustain pressure is limited by its capacity to replace losses.

          <p>Shares in Xpeng, a Chinese electric-vehicle maker, are experiencing a significant rally, with analysts predicting further gains due to new models and a move toward profitability. The company's Hong Kong shares surged after upbeat earnings and a stronger-than-expected revenue forecast for the second quarter. Xpeng's first-quarter revenue more than doubled, driven by robust sales, which helped narrow its net loss and improve its gross margin. Analysts expect Xpeng to turn profitable in the fourth quarter of this year, citing strong sales momentum and a pipeline of new models. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that wildfire smoke, exacerbated by climate change, contributes to thousands of deaths and billions of dollars in economic costs annually in the United States. From 2006 to 2020, climate change contributed to approximately 15,000 deaths due to exposure to fine particulate matter from wildfires, costing around $160 billion. The study highlights that PM2.5 from wildfire smoke may be more toxic than other sources of pollution, with children, pregnant individuals, the elderly, and outdoor workers being the most vulnerable. Researchers emphasize the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate the increasing problem of wildfire smoke-related deaths.</p>

          <p>The Senate is expected to vote on revoking three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a move Democrats are calling "the nuclear option." These waivers allow California to set stricter emissions standards than federal regulations, including phasing out gas-powered cars by 2035. Republicans argue the Congressional Review Act allows them to overturn these waivers, but Democrats contend the vote is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. The outcome is expected to impact cities and states that have adopted California's vehicle standards.</p>
