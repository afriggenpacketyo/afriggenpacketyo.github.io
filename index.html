          <p>Elon Musk plans to reduce his involvement with the Donald Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) initiative after Tesla reported a significant drop in profits and revenue for the first quarter of 2025. The decline is attributed to slumping sales and a backlash against Musk's prominent political role. Musk acknowledged that his focus had shifted away from Tesla due to his contributions to Trump's re-election and leadership of Doge, which aims to cut federal spending. He intends to dedicate only one to two days per week to government matters going forward, as Tesla faces challenges from changing political sentiment and trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Singapore's inflation remained at a four-year low in March, with the consumer price index increasing by 0.9% year-on-year. The Monetary Authority of Singapore attributed the inflation to rising costs of food and private transport. This data comes as Singapore prepares for a general election on May 3, with Prime Minister Lawrence Wong acknowledging cost-of-living pressures as a significant concern. Singapore recently eased its monetary policy for the second consecutive time in April, amidst projections of potential zero growth this year following a lower-than-expected GDP expansion in the first quarter.</p>

Trump also conveyed optimism regarding improved trade relations with China, suggesting tariffs could be reduced if a deal is reached, although not eliminated entirely, indicating a nuanced approach to trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>Six leading policy groups representing the U.S. automotive industry are joining forces to lobby the Trump administration against imposing 25% tariffs on auto parts, set to take effect by May 3. These groups, representing dealers, suppliers, and major automakers, argue that the tariffs could jeopardize U.S. automotive production and harm already struggling auto suppliers. The joint letter to administration officials highlights the potential for production stoppages, layoffs, and bankruptcies due to increased costs, warning of a ripple effect throughout the global supply chain.</p>
