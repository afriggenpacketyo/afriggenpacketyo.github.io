            <p>The Supreme Court issued an overnight order temporarily blocking the removal of alleged Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang members to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA). Solicitor General John Sauer criticized the order as "unprecedented" and argued that the detainee plaintiffs lack standing to seek an injunction. He urged the justices to limit the order to only a pause on AEA removals, not any removals of Venezuelan alleged gang members. The government had already paused pending deportations and is allowing the legal process to play out.</p>

He promised to determine the cause of autism and launch new studies to identify environmental toxins, despite existing research showing no link between vaccines and autism.

            <p>Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee warned that President Trump's tariffs could cause a summer drop-off in economic activity after an "artificially high" start. Businesses are stockpiling inventory and consumers are accelerating purchases in anticipation of the tariffs, potentially inflating economic activity in the short term. Goolsbee expressed optimism about the longer-term economic outlook but cautioned about the uncertainty surrounding the tariffs. He noted that sectors like the auto industry are likely to heavily stock up on inventory before import levies rise further. (not investment advice)</p>
