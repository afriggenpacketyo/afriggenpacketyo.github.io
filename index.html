          <p>Northern China, particularly Beijing, has been struck by deadly floods again, marking the fifth major flooding event in the region since 2012. The recent storms in late July were unusual as they primarily impacted the northern areas of the capital, in contrast to previous severe floods in 2016 and 2023 that were concentrated in the south. This pattern highlights the recurring and intensifying challenge of extreme weather events facing the city during its traditional rainy season of July and August. The situation underscores a growing concern over the city's climate resilience.</p>

Despite the off-pitch chaos, Rashford has made a promising start in pre-season, impressing with his performance and scoring his first goal for the club.</p>

Starting with a goal of being in 10 local shops, the company is now forecasting £2 million in revenue and has a three-year plan to reach £7 million. As a B-Corp, the business emphasizes balancing profit with purpose, donating 2% of its revenue to charities like BBC Children in Need.</p>

          <h2>Analyst Warns of Escalating Nuclear Threat as Arms Control Treaties Collapse</h2>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the world is facing a renewed and heightened risk of nuclear conflict, driven by the collapse of key arms control agreements like the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty. Russia's formal withdrawal from the treaty, coupled with its repeated nuclear threats during the Ukraine war and the development of hypersonic missiles, has accelerated a new arms race. The author notes that the US also contributed to this by reneging on the treaty in 2018, leading to a significant buildup of NATO's nuclear capabilities in Europe, which has largely occurred without the widespread public opposition seen during the Cold War.</p>

          <p>A BBC News reporter has provided a first-person account of a year-long undercover investigation into a violent migrant-smuggling operation in northern France.

The high-risk operation involved using a hidden camera, maintaining a detailed cover story, and navigating a world ruled by power and silence.

This media push aligns with President Xi Jinping's goal of "forging a strong sense of community for the Chinese nation."

          <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance participated in crucial diplomatic talks in the United Kingdom with European allies and Ukrainian officials. The meeting occurred just a day after President Donald Trump announced a direct summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. The UK talks, described by a U.S. official as producing "significant progress," aimed to address concerns from allies about Trump meeting Putin without Ukraine at the table. Ukrainian officials emphasized that a lasting peace is only possible with their full participation and respect for their sovereignty.</p>

          <h2>Kentucky Bourbon Industry Faces Downturn After Post-Recession Boom</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-09 20:41:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Kentucky bourbon industry, which experienced a major renaissance after the 2008 recession, is now facing a significant downturn. A combination of factors, including post-pandemic inflation, changing drinking habits among younger generations, and global tariffs, has slowed sales growth dramatically. The recent boom led to an oversupply as distilleries ramped up production, and now economic pressures are causing prices to fall and smaller distilleries to face bankruptcy. This shift from a booming market to a bust has created a list of casualties, including distillery closures and receiverships. (not investment advice)</p>
