          <p>This article provides detailed profiles of twenty Israeli and foreign hostages, believed to be alive and expected to be released under a newly brokered ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. Abducted during the October 7th attacks, these individuals, including musician Alon Ohel, the Cunio brothers, and engineer Avinatan Or, have endured over two years in captivity. Their families, like Idit Ohel and Matan Zangauker's mother, have become leading voices in advocacy, sharing poignant stories of their loved ones' lives and the psychological toll of their prolonged absence. The article highlights the personal struggles and public efforts, with some families receiving recent signs of life, underscoring the immense human stakes involved in the anticipated exchange and the fragile hope it brings for their reunion.</p>

          <p>Swimming Australia has issued a statement to counter "fake news" and "fabricated quotes" falsely attributed to Olympic champion Mollie O’Callaghan concerning transgender swimmer Lia Thomas. Posts on social media platforms, including Facebook and X, suggested O’Callaghan would boycott the 2028 LA Games if a transgender athlete competed, with a quote calling it "an insult and a disgrace." Swimming Australia confirmed O’Callaghan never made such comments and has requested the posts be removed from Meta platforms. This incident highlights the persistent challenges of misinformation and the sensitive ongoing debates surrounding transgender participation in elite sports, particularly given World Aquatics' current guidelines that prohibit athletes who have undergone male puberty from competing in the female category.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump indicated he might authorize sending "incredible" Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine if Russia's war continues, following discussions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump, who spoke aboard Air Force One, described Tomahawks as a "new step of aggression" and suggested he might first discuss this with Russian President Vladimir Putin. He contrasted his approach with the Biden administration's aid, emphasizing the need for Ukraine to have strong defense capabilities, particularly Patriots and Tomahawks. This potential move signals a significant escalation in military support and a shift in US foreign policy regarding the conflict, aimed at pressuring Moscow towards a settlement.</p>

          <p>Remnants of Typhoon Halong brought hurricane-force winds and catastrophic flooding to western Alaska, pushing entire houses off their foundations in communities like Kipnuk and Kwigillingok. Rescue aircraft were dispatched amid reports of up to 20 people potentially unaccounted for, as water levels rose significantly above high tide, displacing over 170 people to shelters. The disaster has caused widespread damage, inundating roads, boardwalks, and power lines, particularly in isolated areas where infrastructure is limited. Governor Mike Dunleavy has expanded the state's disaster declaration, assuring residents that help is on the way as multiple agencies, including the Alaska National Guard, mobilize for urgent response and recovery efforts in the hardest-hit regions.</p>

Zucker also claimed retaliation, such as pay decreases and her character being written off the show, after she voiced her concerns. While Alarr's attorney denied the allegations, stating the settlement was solely to end the dispute, Corday Productions previously affirmed that complaints about Alarr were promptly investigated, leading to his termination.</p>

          <p>A CNN experiment, involving reporters wearing chemical-tracking wristbands in Hong Kong, London, and New York, revealed alarming levels of plastic-associated chemicals in their environments. The wristbands detected high concentrations of phthalates and bisphenols like BPA, known for various negative health impacts, underscoring plastic's pervasive presence in food, water, and air. Scientists like Martin Wagner and Leonardo Trasande emphasize the "toxic stew" of contaminants and the unknown long-term effects of many complex chemical compounds on human health, from "cradle to grave." This report highlights the urgent need for global action on plastic pollution, as efforts for a UN Global Plastics Treaty have thus far been unsuccessful.</p>

Sorkin highlights the historical shift from credit aversion to widespread debt-fueled speculation, and current pushes to "democratize" access to riskier private investments, including crypto, for ordinary Americans.

          <p>Psychologists from the University of Sussex are utilizing thermal cameras to study stress, revealing that a drop in nose temperature can serve as an objective measure of stress levels and recovery. During an experimental stress test, a reporter experienced a two-degree drop in nose temperature, indicating blood flow shifts away from the nose as a physical reaction to perceived danger. Lead researcher Professor Gillian Forrester suggests this "nasal dip" is a robust marker of changing stress states, with recovery time potentially indicating risks for anxiety or depression. This non-invasive technique could be a "game changer" for monitoring stress in humans and non-human apes, offering new avenues for managing harmful stress levels.</p>

          <p>Paramount, backed by billionaire Larry Ellison and his family, has officially opened bidding for Warner Bros. Discovery, aiming for a massive merger that could reshape Hollywood. Warner Bros. Discovery's board rejected Paramount's initial $20-a-share bid, but discussions are ongoing, with a second bid anticipated. David Ellison, leading Paramount's acquisition efforts, seeks to expand content offerings to better compete with tech giants like Netflix and Amazon in the streaming landscape. The potential merger, which could consolidate CNN with CBS News, comes as Warner Bros. Discovery plans to divide its assets and carries substantial debt, despite recent box office successes, highlighting the strategic maneuvers in a consolidating media industry.</p>

          <p>Following a ceasefire, hundreds of thousands of Gazans are returning northward to find their homes and communities reduced to rubble, as depicted through the poignant journey of Mohammad Abu Warda and his family. With over 90% of homes damaged and parts of the enclave experiencing famine, residents face immense challenges, including devastated infrastructure, booby-trapped areas, and a severe lack of essential services. Despite the grim reality, the return signifies a desperate "chase for what's left of life" and a fragile hope for rebuilding, as neighbors share resources and children draw new homes in the dust. The article underscores the catastrophic human cost of the two-year conflict, which has displaced 2.1 million people and killed over 67,000, as international aid efforts begin.</p>

          <p>This opinion article explores India's strategic balancing act between the US and China, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping recently agreed to be "partners" rather than "rivals" on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit. Modi emphasized the need for "strategic autonomy" and not viewing bilateral relations through a "third country lens," subtly pushing back against US President Donald Trump's tough stance on India. The resumption of direct flights between the nations, after a five-year hiatus, signals a shared commitment to improving ties. Both leaders envision Sino-Indian relations as an anchor for a multipolar world and a new Asian century, focusing on cooperation within the Global South and promoting developing countries' solidarity.</p>

          <p>Indianapolis Colts backup quarterback Anthony Richardson was hospitalized with an orbital fracture after an unusual accident during pre-game warmups for Sunday’s game against the Arizona Cardinals. An elastic exercise band, whose containment equipment failed, whipped into his face, causing the injury. The 23-year-old, a highly-touted 2023 draft pick, has faced inconsistency and injuries in his NFL career, with Daniel Jones currently serving as the Colts' starter. This mishap adds another setback to Richardson's development and highlights the unpredictable nature of sports-related incidents, especially as the team also lost their No. 1 cornerback, Charvarius Ward, to a concussion during warmups for the same game.</p>

          <p>UK Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has written to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, demanding answers regarding the collapsed case against two men accused of spying for China. The charges were dropped because the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) could not obtain evidence from the government referring to China as a national security threat. Badenoch criticized the government's shifting account and perceived weakness against Beijing, questioning who was responsible for the failure to provide necessary material. The opposition claims the government sought to "appease China," putting national security at risk, and has called for a parliamentary explanation. This article highlights the political controversy and calls for accountability, with some suggesting a senior advisor should resign over the handling of the case.</p>
