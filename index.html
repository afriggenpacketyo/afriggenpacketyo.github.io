          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stressed the central bank's dedication to preventing an ongoing inflation problem, despite criticism from President Trump. Powell indicated that policymakers would likely maintain their current stance until the impact of tariffs on prices becomes clearer. He acknowledged strong economic growth and a robust labor market but noted that inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target. Powell's cautious approach could intensify Trump's disapproval, who has publicly criticized Powell's handling of monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump claimed that there are "numerous definitions" of Article 5, raising concerns among other nations about the U.S.'s dedication to the alliance. While he expressed his commitment to being friends with NATO leaders and helping them, he deferred providing a specific definition of his commitment to mutual defense until he arrived at the summit.

The operation occurred after the administration reduced the size of the NSC and appointed Secretary of State Marco Rubio as acting national security advisor.

          <p>A new book, "Toni at Random: The Iconic Writerâ€™s Legendary Editorship," explores Toni Morrison's influential role as an editor at Random House. Morrison, the first Black woman to hold a senior editor position at the publishing house, played a significant role in transforming the relationship between Black writers and white publishers. As an editor, she championed Black voices and ideas, editing works by figures such as Angela Davis and Muhammad Ali. Her work at Random House had a lasting impact on American literary culture, though the number of Black authors published by the company declined after her departure.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has lifted a lower court order, enabling the Trump administration to resume deportations of migrants to third countries without prior notice or the opportunity to raise concerns about torture or persecution. Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson dissented, with Sotomayor accusing the government of unlawful conduct. The Department of Homeland Security hailed the ruling as a victory for American safety. The decision allows the administration to continue its efforts to deport migrants to countries other than their origin, approaching nations like Costa Rica, Panama, and Rwanda.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece compares the analysis of President Trump's actions to the self-help books of the 1990s, suggesting that leaders are trying to decode his behavior as if he is sending hidden messages. The author argues that Trump's actions are primarily self-serving and that other world leaders should recognize this pattern. The piece draws a parallel to the "He's Just Not That Into You" concept, advising leaders to stop overanalyzing Trump's behavior and acknowledge his lack of genuine interest in their concerns.</p>
