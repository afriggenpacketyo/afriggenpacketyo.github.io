          <p>Despite reporting another quarter of shrinking same-store sales and missing earnings expectations, Starbucks is showing early signs of a turnaround. Executives highlighted that customer traffic improved sequentially each month during the quarter, with notable growth from customers outside its loyalty program. Analysts are pointing to these "green shoots," such as an accelerated rollout of new service programs and menu innovations, as reasons for cautious optimism. However, the stock's modest rise suggests some investors remain unconvinced about the pace of the recovery.</p>

          <p>Following a stock drop after Palo Alto Networks announced its $25 billion acquisition of CyberArk, Jim Cramer's Investing Club upgraded its rating on the company. The club views the market's negative reaction as a mistake, arguing the deal strategically strengthens Palo Alto's cybersecurity platform by adding a crucial identity security component. They express confidence in CEO Nikesh Arora's vision, comparing the current situation to a previous successful buying opportunity when the market initially doubted the company's strategy.

          <p>Following a powerful earthquake near Russia, widespread tsunami warnings for Hawaii and the U.S. West Coast have been downgraded to advisories. While Hawaii recorded waves nearly six feet high, the threat of catastrophic flooding has diminished, allowing many evacuees to return home. Authorities still urge caution, advising people to stay away from the water due to the continued risk of strong and unpredictable currents. The downgrades brought relief to coastal communities that had prepared for a potentially devastating event.</p>

          <p>Countries along the Pacific coast of South America, including Chile and Peru, have issued high-level tsunami warnings and evacuation orders after a major earthquake off Russia. Chile declared a red alert for its entire coastal region and began evacuating areas on Easter Island. This development occurred as the immediate tsunami threat was receding in other parts of the Pacific, such as Japan and the United States, highlighting the quake's far-reaching and long-lasting impact across the entire ocean basin.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a significant rebound in the second quarter of 2025, with GDP growing at a 3% annual rate after shrinking in the first quarter. This growth was largely driven by a sharp decrease in imports, a volatile factor influenced by the Trump administration's trade policies, rather than a fundamental surge in domestic demand. While consumer spending saw a modest increase, underlying indicators suggest that economic activity is slowing to a more moderate pace. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A concerning economic trend shows that even high-income American households are falling behind on credit card and auto loan payments at an accelerating rate. Delinquencies for those earning over $150,000 have more than doubled since 2023, a faster increase than for lower and middle-income groups. Economists attribute this shift to a weaker job market for white-collar workers and higher housing costs, indicating that financial stress is spreading across all economic strata and is no longer confined to lower earners.</p>
