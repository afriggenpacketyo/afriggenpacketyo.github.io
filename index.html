          <p>As stock prices and futures plummeted due to trade tensions spurred by President Trump's tariffs, exchanges implemented trading halts to stabilize the market. During non-U.S. trading hours, a 7% drop in S&P futures triggers a halt until buyers emerge. The NYSE also employs circuit breakers that halt trading for 15 minutes if the S&P 500 falls by 7% or 13% before 3:25 PM ET.

          <p>Newly qualified medical students are facing uncertainty as they are being informed of their job locations just weeks before starting, causing logistical challenges. Hundreds of students have been given "placeholder jobs," only knowing the general area they will be working in. This is the second year of a new system that assigns jobs randomly, leading to more students not getting their preferred locations. The BMA has criticized the government for failing to plan for the increase in resident doctors, potentially leading to students moving abroad.</p>

          <p>President Trump has implemented a 10% universal tariff on all U.S. imports, triggering collections at ports of entry across the country. Trump urged Americans to "hang tough," calling the tariffs an "economic revolution" aimed at bringing back jobs and businesses. The move has sent global markets plummeting, with major indexes experiencing their worst week since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. China has retaliated by imposing a 34% tariff on U.S. imports.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs has lowered its 2025 growth forecast for Chinese stocks due to the impact of President Trump's tariffs. The firm cut its 12-month growth estimate for the MSCI China Index and the CSI 300 Index, citing a "high degree of uncertainty" as a new trade war unfolds. The revisions were tempered from a more bullish position in February, after DeepSeek released powerful but cost-effective large language models. China quickly retaliated to US tariffs by applying 34 per cent tariffs on all US imports.
