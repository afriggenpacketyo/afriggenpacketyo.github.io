          <p>Fifteen people required hospital treatment after a double-decker bus struck a bridge in Eccles, Salford, which sheared its roof off entirely. The vehicle was an active 100 service bus, and the collision prompted a large-scale emergency response, including ten ambulances and an air ambulance. This incident occurred at the same location where another bus had its roof torn off in a similar crash in April 2023. Authorities have closed surrounding roads and are currently conducting a thorough investigation into the cause of the accident.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has called for a wide-ranging review of the Federal Reserve, suggesting its entire mission and effectiveness should be examined, not just recent controversies over building renovations. His comments arise amid escalating tension between the White House and the central bank, with President Trump having previously considered firing Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Bessent, who has been floated as a potential successor to Powell, also criticized the Fed's handling of interest rates and inflation, questioning the effectiveness of its economic strategies. Market analysis currently suggests another interest rate cut is likely to occur in September.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 25 countries, including the U.K., Canada, and Japan, has released a joint statement demanding an immediate end to the war in Gaza and condemning Israel's conduct. The statement criticizes the "drip feeding of aid and the inhumane killing of civilians," highlighting that over 800 Palestinians have reportedly been killed while seeking humanitarian assistance. Israel has dismissed the statement as disconnected from reality, blaming Hamas for prolonging the conflict. The international pressure coincides with Israel expanding its ground operations into Deir al-Balah, a central Gaza city, displacing tens of thousands more people.</p>

          <p>Design software company Figma is preparing for its initial public offering, with plans to sell approximately 37 million shares at a price between $25 and $28 each. This could result in a fully diluted valuation for the company of up to $16.4 billion and generate as much as $1 billion in proceeds. The move comes after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was terminated in 2022 due to regulatory opposition. The company reported strong preliminary revenue growth for the second quarter and has added notable figures like Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger to its board.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has issued a warning about active cyberattacks exploiting a significant vulnerability in its on-premises SharePoint collaboration software, which could affect businesses and governments worldwide. According to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the flaw allows unauthenticated attackers to gain full access to SharePoint content and execute malicious code remotely. Researchers at Palo Alto Networks believe thousands of organizations are at risk, as attackers are already stealing data and establishing backdoors. Microsoft has released patches for some versions of the software and is working on a fix for the remaining vulnerable version.</p>

Ofcom's report suggests broadcasters must urgently collaborate with YouTube to ensure their material is easily discoverable.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While filing a tax extension grants an additional six months to submit tax returns, it does not postpone the deadline for paying the taxes owed to the IRS. Taxpayers must still estimate their tax liability and pay it by the original April 15 deadline to avoid penalties and interest. The late payment penalty is typically 0.5% of the unpaid amount per month, and interest accrues daily on the outstanding balance. For those unable to pay their full bill, the IRS offers options such as installment agreements and, in cases of severe financial hardship, an Offer in Compromise.</p>

Thirty-eight crew members were killed when the ship was torpedoed on August 19, 1916, but its final resting place remained a mystery despite numerous search attempts.
