          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the United States and China have a significant opportunity to reach a substantial trade agreement. Bessent suggested a collaborative rebalancing of trade relations and urged China to assume a global economic role commensurate with its importance. He also criticized the World Bank for continuing to lend to advanced economies like China, arguing it diverts resources from higher priorities and hinders private market development. Bessent emphasized the need for the World Bank to set graduation timelines for countries that have long met the criteria to exit borrowing. (not investment advice)</p>

He contrasts the current situation with the era of Ellis Island, when immigrants did not receive federal benefits, and suggests that without support, those unable to become self-sufficient should return home.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has accused the Trump administration of "bad faith" in the Kilmar Ábrego García case, citing obstruction of the legal process and ignoring court orders. The judge gave the administration a deadline to provide details supporting its claims of privilege. This case involves the wrongful deportation of a Salvadorian man despite a court order against it, and is one of several instances where courts are pushing back against the Trump administration's defiance of judicial orders. Other federal judges have also extended temporary blocks on deportations and scrutinized the administration's use of a 1798 law to expedite removals.</p>

          <p>Several corporations have announced plans to expand their production capabilities in the U.S. since the start of President Trump's second term, coinciding with the implementation of new tariffs. While not all companies explicitly cite tariffs as the reason, the White House promotes these moves as supporting job creation. Companies like Apple, Chobani, Johnson & Johnson, and Nvidia are making significant investments in U.S. manufacturing facilities. However, some experts remain skeptical about the overall impact of tariffs on job growth, citing factors like labor costs and the regulatory environment as more influential.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration asked a judge to pause discovery in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant who was wrongfully deported. This request came a day after the judge ordered the government to more fully answer questions about the deportation. The Justice Department attorneys were previously criticized for their inaction in Abrego Garcia's wrongful detention. The Trump administration claims Abrego Garcia's alleged MS-13 affiliation makes him ineligible to return, despite a court order barring his deportation.</p>

          <p>The pro-natalism movement, gaining influence in the Trump administration, aims to encourage American women to have more babies, with a focus on enforcing right-wing social values and transforming women's roles. Proposals include fertility awareness classes and "baby bonuses," while neglecting the needs of actual mothers, such as paid family leave and affordable childcare. The movement is seen as promoting primarily white births and pushing women out of the public sphere. Some liberals have joined the pro-natalist chorus, but critics argue that it dictates what kind of life American women should want.</p>

          <p>Refugees from Myanmar living in camps in Thailand are facing significant cuts in food aid due to a foreign aid shortfall, rising demand, and inflation. These cuts will affect over 80% of the 100,000-plus refugees living in nine camps along the Thai-Myanmar border. The cutbacks stem from a decision by the US State Department to reduce funding. At the same time, a nutrition survey shows malnutrition on the rise in the camps.</p>
