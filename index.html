          <p>The White House has confirmed an unusual agreement where Nvidia and AMD will give the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from specific AI chip sales to China. In return, the companies receive export licenses for their H20 and MI308 chips, which were previously restricted under tighter controls. While analysts find the deal unconventional, investors view it as a net positive, as it restores access to the lucrative Chinese market, with 85% of revenue being preferable to none. The long-term implications remain uncertain, as this arrangement sets a new precedent for U.S. tech companies operating in China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cannabis company stocks saw a significant rally after President Trump announced he is considering reclassifying marijuana from a Schedule I to a less restrictive category, such as Schedule III. Such a change would place cannabis in the same class as steroids and Tylenol with codeine, offering substantial benefits like revised tax regulations and increased investment appeal. While the president cannot unilaterally make this change, his public support has generated industry optimism for what could be a game-changing development for the estimated $80 billion market. Industry leaders believe the process could take about a year to complete if initiated. (not investment advice)</p>

Dohmke will remain until the end of the year to ensure a smooth transition, with GitHub continuing its mission under Microsoft's CoreAI division. Despite the competitive pressure, GitHub's AI-powered Copilot tool continues to grow, with 20 million users reported as of last month.</p>

          <p>President Trump provided his account of the negotiations with Nvidia, stating he initially demanded a 20% cut of the company's China-bound chip sales before settling on 15% after a direct talk with CEO Jensen Huang. He characterized the approved H20 chip as "obsolete," suggesting that China already possesses similar technology and that it poses no national security risk. Trump contrasted this with Nvidia's more advanced Blackwell chips, which he said he would not approve for export without significant performance reductions. This provides direct insight into the administration's rationale and transactional approach to the export controls. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to delay the reimposition of high tariffs on Chinese goods for another 90 days, a White House official confirmed. The order was signed just hours before the previous pause on the tariffs was set to expire, preventing duties from reverting to their peak levels from April. This extension was the anticipated result of the most recent trade negotiations between U.S. and Chinese officials held in Stockholm. The two nations initially agreed to a tariff pause in May, providing a temporary reprieve in the ongoing trade dispute between the world's two largest economies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sports commentator Skip Bayless has accused NFL teams of being "racist fools" for allowing quarterback Shedeur Sanders to fall to the fifth round of the draft before being selected by the Cleveland Browns. Following an impressive preseason debut, Bayless claimed that the league intentionally passed on Sanders to teach him and his father, Deion Sanders, a lesson. He described the draft fall as the "biggest disgrace" in NFL history, attributing it to prejudice against the quarterback's confident demeanor and his high earnings from NIL deals in college. Bayless did not provide specific evidence for his claims of racism.</p>

          <p>President Trump has invoked Section 740 of the D.C. Home Rule Act to place the city's Metropolitan Police Department under direct federal control, with Attorney General Pam Bondi taking command. This law permits the president to assume control of the local police for federal purposes for up to 30 days, an action Trump justified as necessary to combat violent crime. The move has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats and D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, who called it an "egregious assault on D.C. home rule." Conversely, prominent Republicans have praised the decision as a necessary step to restore safety in the nation's capital.</p>

The fee, while substantial, is considered manageable for a company of Nvidia's scale, which projects revenues in the hundreds of billions, making the payment a calculated cost of doing business.

          <p>More than two years after filing for bankruptcy, Bed Bath & Beyond is relaunching as a brick-and-mortar retailer with its first 'Bed Bath & Beyond Home' store opening in Nashville. The new iteration, managed by The Brand House Collective, will have a tighter focus on home decor, bedroom, bath, and laundry products. In a strategic move to re-engage its former customer base, the company announced it will honor the iconic blue and white legacy coupons from the original stores. This opening marks a significant step in the brand's turnaround effort after its previous store closures and transition to an online-only model.</p>

          <p>Movie theater chain AMC Entertainment reported better-than-expected second-quarter financial results, signaling a potential recovery for the company. Revenue grew 35% year-over-year to nearly $1.4 billion, and the company significantly narrowed its net loss to just $4.7 million, or 1 cent per share, compared to a $32.8 million loss in the same period last year. CEO Adam Aron attributed the strong performance to a recovering industry-wide box office and a 26% increase in attendance. The company also made progress on its significant debt load, pushing all 2026 maturities out to 2029. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With rising living costs, some seniors may find a reverse mortgage to be a useful financial tool this August, according to a recent article. This option is particularly relevant for three groups: those on fixed incomes needing to supplement their budget, homeowners with significant equity but limited cash, and those who wish to age in place but need funds for home modifications. A reverse mortgage allows homeowners aged 62 and older to borrow against their home equity without making monthly payments. The funds received are tax-free and can provide a crucial financial cushion during retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Nations human rights office has condemned a targeted Israeli airstrike in Gaza that killed six people, including five journalists from Al Jazeera. Israel's military claimed it targeted correspondent Anas al-Sharif, alleging he was a Hamas operative, a claim he had denied and for which Israel has provided little evidence. The attack has drawn strong condemnation from media rights groups and the international community, with the UK calling for an independent investigation. The Committee to Protect Journalists reports that at least 186 journalists have been killed in the conflict since October 2023, marking the deadliest period on record.</p>

          <p>The upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for July is anticipated to show an annual inflation rate of 2.8%, a slight increase from June's 2.7%. Economists predict that this acceleration is partly due to President Trump's tariffs, with recent price hikes in goods like apparel and furniture signaling that these costs are reaching consumers. The core inflation rate, which excludes food and energy, is also expected to rise to 3.0%. Despite signs of rising inflation, markets are still anticipating a potential interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September due to concerns about the labor market's health.
