          <p>Gunmen killed at least nine people at a bar in a tourist city in Ecuador, continuing a wave of violence plaguing the nation. Authorities are investigating the attack, which is part of a larger trend of rising homicide rates linked to powerful drug trafficking organizations. This incident highlights the country's ongoing security crisis, which has worsened despite the recent recapture and extradition of a major drug lord. The violence persists as transnational cartels use Ecuador for shipping drugs to the US and Europe.</p>

          <p>A SkyWest pilot executed an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a collision with a military aircraft, reportedly a B-52, during its landing approach in Minot, North Dakota. The pilot informed passengers that the other aircraft was not announced by the control tower, which lacks radar capabilities. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the incident, which involved a flight with 76 passengers and four crew members. Passengers applauded the pilot for his quick action in the startling near-miss event.</p>

          <p>Following deadly floods that killed over 130 people in central Texas, Governor Greg Abbott has called a special legislative session to address the state's emergency response. The session will focus on improving future preparedness, including enhancing flood warning systems, emergency communications, and disaster relief funding. The historic flash flooding over the Fourth of July weekend left a devastating impact, with several people still reported as missing. This legislative action aims to prevent a recurrence of such a large-scale tragedy through better planning.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the one-year anniversary of former President Joe Biden's decision to suspend his re-election campaign in July 2024.

The piece notes that Democrats are still grappling with the fallout from the subsequent election loss to Trump.

          <p>Harvard University is in federal court arguing that the Trump administration illegally cut $2.6 billion in federal funding in retaliation for the university's refusal to comply with certain demands.

Harvard contends the funding cuts jeopardize vital scientific and medical research and represent government overreach into academic freedom.

The shortfall is particularly acute among the self-employed, low earners, women, and some ethnic minorities.

This move is seen by critics as a strategic "denial by erasure," aimed at weakening the scientific basis for climate regulations. The administration has also cut funding for climate modeling and ended the tracking of billion-dollar weather disasters. Experts argue this unprecedented suppression of information makes it harder to create and defend environmental policies and combat climate change.</p>

          <p>José Adolfo Macías Villamar, the notorious gang leader known as "Fito," has been extradited from Ecuador to the United States, a first for the country. Macías, who leads the powerful "Los Choneros" gang, faces a seven-count indictment in New York for international cocaine distribution and smuggling firearms from the U.S. into Ecuador. He was recaptured in June after escaping from prison last year, where he was serving a 34-year sentence for murder and other crimes. The extradition marks a significant step in combating the cartels destabilizing Ecuador.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has increasingly favored tariffs as its primary tool for economic leverage, a shift from the traditional reliance on sanctions used by previous governments. This approach aligns with the "America First" agenda, allowing for direct, unilateral action to address trade deficits and protect domestic industries. The article notes that Trump has blurred the lines between the two tools, using tariffs to pressure countries on non-trade issues like immigration and foreign policy. While this strategy offers flexibility, critics warn of its potential to destabilize global trade and create long-term economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>China is on the verge of achieving its goal of having 50,000 kilometers of operational high-speed rail, with its network already reaching 48,000km, according to the Minister of Transport. This vast network now accounts for over 70% of the world's total high-speed rail mileage and connects most of the country's major cities. In the first half of 2025, China's national railway recorded a record 2.24 billion passenger trips. Officials attribute the growth to a recovering economy, rising travel demand, and improved service quality across the expanding network.</p>

          <p>China's Central Military Commission has released new political guidelines for the People's Liberation Army (PLA) aimed at strengthening loyalty to the Communist Party and combating corruption. The move follows a significant anti-corruption campaign that has seen over a dozen generals and defense industry executives investigated. According to the PLA Daily, the new rules establish "clear political red lines" and require officials to lead by example with integrity. This initiative underscores President Xi Jinping's ongoing efforts to assert ideological control and ensure the military's absolute loyalty to the party.</p>

          <p>Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary has stated the airline is considering an increase to the bonus paid to staff for intercepting passengers with oversized carry-on bags. Currently, staff receive about €1.50 per bag, a practice intended to enforce the airline's baggage rules and reduce boarding delays. The airline says over 99% of passengers comply with the rules, and the fee-sharing incentive is aimed at the small minority who do not. The discussion comes as the European Parliament pushes for standardized free carry-on allowances, a proposal O'Leary predicts will not pass.</p>

          <p>Stellantis, the parent company of brands like Vauxhall, Jeep, and Fiat, announced that tariffs imposed by the Trump administration have cost it €300 million. The financial impact stems from the 25% tariff on imported cars, which has disrupted trade and reduced the company's production plans. The company's shipments to North America dropped by 25% in the second quarter compared to the previous year, contributing to a 10% decline in total sales.

          <p>A comprehensive independent review of England and Wales' water sector has recommended a major regulatory overhaul, including the dissolution of the economic regulator Ofwat. The Water Commission's report blames government, companies, and regulators for the sector's current problems of sewage spills and rising bills. It proposes creating a single, unified water regulator in both England and Wales to better hold companies accountable. The review also calls for reforming "operator self-monitoring" and introducing more controls over company ownership, though it stops short of recommending nationalization.</p>

          <p>Kraft Heinz is reportedly considering a major strategic shift by spinning off a significant portion of its grocery business, including legacy brands like Velveeta and Oscar Mayer. The potential move would effectively reverse the 2015 mega-merger, creating a new entity that could be valued at up to $20 billion. This strategy aims to separate the faster-growing condiments division from slower-moving grocery products. The company's shares have struggled for years as consumers shift away from traditional packaged foods, prompting a search for ways to unlock shareholder value. (not investment advice)</p>
