          <p>The Justice Department announced charges against New Jersey Congresswoman LaMonica McIver for allegedly assaulting federal agents during a clash outside a Newark immigration detention center. Simultaneously, a misdemeanor trespass charge against Newark Mayor Ras J. Baraka, stemming from the same incident, was dropped. The charges and dismissal come after a contentious visit by McIver and other Democratic lawmakers to the detention center, during which they clashed with ICE agents. Republicans have criticized the lawmakers' actions, while Democrats have defended them, claiming the charges are politically motivated. </p>

          <p>An inquest concluded that the death of 11-year-old Kyra Hill, who drowned at Liquid Leisure water park in Berkshire, was an unlawful killing caused by gross health and safety breaches. The breaches included the absence of an emergency plan, risk assessment, and adequate warning signs regarding water depth. The coroner noted that parents were not informed about the risks, which likely contributed to Kyra's death. The park owner was previously fined Â£80,000. </p>
