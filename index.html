        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article delves into the intriguing concept of a 'reverse convergence' potentially reshaping US-China relations if Donald Trump returns to power. It posits that the US might increasingly adopt a pragmatic approach to political legitimacy and global stability, mirroring China's methods rather than continuing to champion liberal democratic values. The article critiques traditional convergence theory for oversimplifying complex social changes and underestimating power dynamics. Instead, it suggests a future where both nations, despite their differing systems, could find common ground in their operational approaches to governance and international peace, moving beyond entrenched ideological confrontations to foster a new form of geopolitical interaction.</p>

          <p>Heavy rainfall has caused severe flooding in Arizona, leading to at least four confirmed deaths, with two people found in a vehicle in Globe and another in floodwaters, plus one near Phoenix. The city of Globe, an old mining town, also faces a hazardous situation due to approximately 1,000 dislodged residential-sized propane tanks scattered across the downtown area, though fortunately none have ignited. Authorities have launched a massive search and rescue operation and urged residents to stay away from floodwaters, as the region experienced its highest one-day rainfall total in nearly seven years. Local officials have declared an emergency, noting the unprecedented intensity of the downpour and the extensive damage to downtown buildings.</p>

          <p>Widespread UN sanctions against Iran have officially come back into force, freezing overseas assets, banning arms deals, and penalizing ballistic missile development after last-ditch nuclear talks with Western powers failed. Germany, France, and the UK triggered these 'snapback' sanctions, asserting Iran violated the 2015 deal, a claim Iran denies. This comprehensive article also reports on Iran recalling its ambassadors in protest, Lebanon's Hezbollah commemorating its leader's death amidst regional tensions, an arrest warrant issued for ousted Syrian leader Bashar Assad, and Iraq resuming Kurdish oil exports to Turkey. These interconnected events highlight a complex and volatile geopolitical landscape across the wider Middle East.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Israeli airstrikes and gunfire have resulted in at least 91 deaths across Gaza, according to hospital sources, as international pressure mounts for a ceasefire and a growing list of countries recognize Palestinian statehood. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, affirmed Israel's resolve to continue operations against Hamas during a UN address, prompting a walkout by dozens of delegates. The ongoing conflict has led to severe humanitarian conditions, with hospitals on the brink of collapse and widespread food shortages, particularly in northern Gaza, where aid deliveries have been halted. This article notes that the Hamas-run Health Ministry's casualty figures, exceeding 65,000 deaths, are considered the most reliable by UN agencies and independent experts.</p>

Beyond producing a new food source, growing rice on flooded peat soils could help lock in greenhouse gases, addressing a significant environmental concern by preventing carbon release. While still a risky crop for commercial farmers, researchers believe rice could become widely viable in the UK within a decade if temperatures continue to rise, offering a radical approach to sustainable agriculture and land management.</p>

          <p>American golfer Keegan Bradley defended US Ryder Cup fans as 'passionate' despite reports of unacceptable and personal insults directed at European players, particularly Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry, contrasting sharply with European captain Luke Donald's criticism. Donald deemed the crowd's conduct, including making sounds during backswings, as crossing the line. The article also details a neck injury sustained by European player Viktor Hovland, which could potentially reduce Sunday's singles matches to 11 if he is unable to play. Europe currently holds a commanding 11½-4½ lead, requiring only 2½ points to retain the cup, while the US faces a significant challenge to mount a comeback amidst the fan controversy.</p>

The article highlights the dire economic consequences for ordinary Iranians, with food prices soaring, the rial currency at a record low, and essential staples becoming unaffordable. Concerns are also rising about potential renewed conflict with Israel or the US, and a surge in internal repression, with a reported increase in executions making it the highest in three decades, further exacerbating societal exhaustion and unmotivation.</p>

          <p>Tech billionaire Larry Ellison and his son David are rapidly expanding their influence in US media, with significant deals involving major companies like TikTok and Paramount, and a potential bid for Warner Brothers Discovery. Their ascent is notably aided by Larry Ellison's close relationship with President Donald Trump, who has publicly endorsed their business ventures and even called the elder Ellison 'CEO of everything.' David Ellison's Skydance recently acquired Paramount, gaining control over CBS, and has already implemented changes at the news outlet, including appointing a conservative watchdog and altering interview policies.

          <p>Two Indian researchers, Vikash Kumar and Sarthak Mittal, have been awarded an Ig Nobel Prize for their delightfully inventive study on foul-smelling shoes and the design of a UVC light-equipped shoe rack. Their research, initially prompted by observations of shoe odors in university hostels, identified the bacterium Kytococcus sedentarius as the primary culprit. Experiments rigorously demonstrated that a short blast of UVC light, specifically targeting the toe area, effectively kills these microbes, eliminating the pungent smell without damaging the footwear. This innovative work, which reimagines the traditional shoe rack for a better user experience, highlights a practical and humorous solution to a common domestic problem, earning well-deserved recognition for its blend of scientific ingenuity and everyday relevance.</p>

The US does not recognize Maduro's re-election and has accused him of ties to drug cartels, doubling the reward for his capture.

From international summits to public health, he projects an image of being above normal consequences, exemplified by his reaction to James Comey's indictment, which he views as vindication rather than a liability.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the effectiveness of collagen supplements in reducing signs of skin aging, noting that while some users report benefits, consultant dermatologists remain skeptical about their substantial impact. Collagen, the body's most abundant protein, naturally declines with age, prompting interest in supplements. However, the challenge lies in whether ingested collagen peptides can survive digestion and reach the skin to stimulate new collagen formation, with some theories suggesting skin's faster cell turnover might favor this. Experts suggest marine collagen is more effective than vegan options due to its Type 1 collagen content, but caution that robust, unbiased evidence is lacking, and lifestyle factors like sun protection, a healthy diet, and avoiding smoking have a far greater impact on skin health.</p>

          <p>St Helens snatched a sensational Super League play-off eliminator win against Leeds Rhinos, with Shane Wright scoring a try on the final play of the game to secure a dramatic 16-14 victory at Headingley. The stunning come-from-behind turnaround saw Saints, playing without forward Matty Lees for the second half due to his wife going into labor, score late to keep their hopes alive in the final tackle. Leeds had led 12-6 at halftime and wasted several opportunities to extend their lead in the second half, only managing a single penalty. Wright's match-winning score, following a mesmerising 16-pass move that criss-crossed the pitch, sets up a semi-final trip to Hull KR, marking one of the season's most frantic and decisive moments.</p>

          <p>This article examines whether China has surpassed Europe in the race for a high-tech future, commemorating 50 years of formal diplomatic relations between China and the European Union. Fifty years ago, Chinese officials observed their country was decades behind Europe in science, technology, and industry, prompting a national policy of reform and opening up. The piece suggests a dramatic reversal, with China now potentially leading in various technological sectors, having flipped the technology script with Europe. This significant shift challenges traditional perceptions and underscores China's rapid modernization and growing global economic influence, prompting a re-evaluation of its competitive and collaborative relationship with Europe in the coming decades.</p>

          <p>Britain's Labour party has pledged to commence construction on three new towns—Tempsford in Bedfordshire, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill in north London—before the next general election, aiming to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029. This ambitious initiative, central to Labour's vision for economic growth and tackling the housing crisis, follows recommendations from a New Towns Taskforce that identified 12 promising sites across England. The plan includes establishing a New Towns Unit to secure millions in public and private funding for essential services like GP surgeries, schools, and green spaces, and utilizing development corporations with special planning powers. The party draws inspiration from post-war Labour governments that successfully built new towns to address housing shortages, promising 'homes fit for families of all shapes and sizes.'</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of US troops to Portland, Oregon, authorizing 'full force' if necessary, to suppress protests targeting immigration detention centers. Trump stated the move aims to protect ICE facilities from 'Antifa' and other domestic terrorists, a designation criticized by legal experts as lacking formal mechanism and facing First Amendment challenges. Oregon Governor Tina Kotek condemned the deployment as an 'abuse of power,' coordinating with the attorney general for a response and warning residents 'not to take the bait.' The article notes ongoing protests at the Portland ICE facility since early June, leading to federal charges against 26 individuals, and concerns from Democratic lawmakers about federal agents targeting individuals not posing a danger to society.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto, now a powerful Category 5 storm, is swirling north of the Caribbean and might interact with a developing tropical depression, potentially creating the rare Fujiwhara effect. This phenomenon occurs when two storms merge or spin around a common center, though a weaker system is typically absorbed by a stronger one. Forecasters expect Humberto to move northwest through Sunday and pass west of Bermuda, likely remaining a powerful hurricane for several days. Meanwhile, the second system, named Imelda, is forecast to strengthen into a tropical storm and approach the southeastern US coastline early next week, bringing the threat of heavy rainfall. South Carolina has declared a state of emergency, urging residents to prepare for potential impacts from these systems.</p>

The article suggests that while traditional Western powers embody these inconsistencies, China's approach to international relations, focusing on shared development and global governance, may offer a more effective and pragmatic model for crisis resolution and multilateral cooperation, moving beyond current stalemates and power dynamics within the organization.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump posted an AI-generated image on Truth Social depicting himself firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, labeling him 'YOU'RE FIRED!' This action follows Trump's repeated criticisms of Powell's cautious approach to interest rate cuts, despite a recent reduction earlier this month. While no US president has ever successfully fired a Fed chair, and a recent Supreme Court decision indicated limits on such authority, Trump has previously attempted to remove other Fed officials. Economists and investors fear that removing Powell before his term ends could undermine the Fed's independence, potentially causing longer-term interest rates to rise if the central bank is perceived to act in Trump's political interests rather than its dual mandate of stable inflation and low unemployment.

          <p>The Justice Department's indictment of former FBI Director James Comey is seen as a dramatic escalation in President Trump's campaign of political retribution, despite his campaign promises to end the 'weaponization' of the department. This article highlights that Trump's actions are perceived by his allies as targeting those who 'deserve it,' fulfilling his 'I am your retribution' pledge. The indictment, concerning alleged false statements to Congress about a Clinton Foundation investigation, appears to be a thin case, as the inspector general's office had previously investigated the matter without finding wrongdoing by Comey. This move is part of a broader effort by Trump to assert total control over various aspects of society, from media to federal agencies, with Republicans in Congress largely supporting his agenda.</p>
