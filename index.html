Despite their benefits, financial experts warn investors about critical mistakes, such as failing to understand underlying assets or chasing past performance. Frequent trading, often treating ETFs like short-term vehicles, can also erode long-term returns. Investors are advised to align ETF choices with their risk tolerance and financial goals, rather than falling prey to market buzz. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mohamad Bazzi, a Guardian columnist, contends that Israel's airstrike in Doha, targeting Hamas leaders, demonstrates the hollowness of former President Trump's promises to protect Qatar. Despite Qatar's significant investments in US military bases and weapons, and a substantial donation to Trump, the attack proceeded, killing six people. Bazzi argues that under Prime Minister Netanyahu, Israel has become a rogue state, obstructing ceasefire talks and acting with impunity due to unconditional US support. The incident has reportedly collapsed current negotiations and severely undermined Qatar's role as a mediator. This article offers a critical analysis of geopolitical dynamics in the Middle East.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 08:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American universities face a growing crisis of grade inflation and declining academic rigor, largely exacerbated by the prevalence of teacher evaluations. Professors, whose pay, hiring, and tenure are often tied to student ratings, feel pressured to lighten workloads and award higher grades. Research indicates that students are poor judges of teaching quality, often rewarding less challenging instructors and demonstrating no correlation between high evaluations and objective learning outcomes. This creates a 'doom loop' where faculty prioritize popularity over rigorous instruction, leading to a system that undermines educational standards. Some institutions are exploring alternative evaluation methods to address these systemic flaws.</p>

          <p>Recent incidents involving Princess Kate, Nelly Furtado, and Annalena Baerbock highlight how women in the public eye disproportionately face sexist trolling and body-shaming online. Media studies professors confirm this as sexism, noting women experience more aggressive hostility and appearance-focused criticism than men. This constant online scrutiny fuels self-optimization trends and surgical procedures, driven by archaic beauty standards that demand women appear eternally young and fertile. Experts argue that media and algorithms amplify these ideals, creating a power structure that negatively impacts girls and women globally. This article emphasizes the need for more public figures to defy these pressures.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has reportedly endorsed the Trump administration's aggressive anti-drug mission in the Caribbean, which involves deploying US Navy ships to the Venezuelan coastline. Machado, who maintains close ties with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, framed the operation as 'law enforcement' against the Maduro regime, which she claims leads the Tren de Aragua gang. This Atlantic article questions the scale of Venezuela's drug operations justifying such a military deployment, noting the country's modest cocaine production. The strategy, while welcomed by some Venezuelan exiles, carries risks of US military intervention and has been criticized for potentially misrepresenting the situation.
