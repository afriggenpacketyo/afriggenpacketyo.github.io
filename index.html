          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has outlined plans to reduce the number of senior military officers and restructure the Army to focus on homeland defense and deter China. While directing the Pentagon to cut four-star admirals and generals by 20%, Hegseth aims to streamline leadership and eliminate redundant military structures, however details remain scarce. The Army's transformation involves fielding long-range missiles and drones while divesting outdated formations, with some officials expressing concern over the lack of specifics and potential for partisan motivations behind the cuts. Sen. Jack Reed has voiced skepticism about the rationale behind these plans, emphasizing the need for personnel decisions to be based on facts and analysis rather than arbitrary percentages.</p>

Martin's term as interim U.S. attorney expires on May 20, and his confirmation is now uncertain, potentially leading to the chief judge of the D.C. District Court picking the next nominee. Critics have also pointed to Martin's firing or demotion of top career attorneys who investigated the Capitol attack and his past praise of a January 6th rioter with a history of antisemitic statements.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport is experiencing ongoing delays and cancellations, primarily due to an air traffic controller shortage and recent equipment failures. The union representing air traffic controllers reports that multiple members are on trauma leave after a communication outage caused a temporary loss of radar and communication with pilots. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy plans to announce an overhaul of the nation's aging air traffic control system to address these issues. While the FAA assures that Newark's airspace is safe, the staffing and equipment problems are expected to persist for several more days, prompting calls for investigations and modernization efforts.</p>

          <p>A fencing match in Maryland has ignited a national debate after a fencer refused to compete against a transgender opponent, leading to a congressional hearing and increased scrutiny of transgender athletes in sports.

The incident has been politicized, with some conservative figures claiming it threatens fair competition and puts female athletes at risk. U.S.A.

          <p>Electronic Arts (EA) shares rose after the company topped fiscal fourth-quarter bookings estimates and issued upbeat guidance. The video game maker said it expects bookings to range between $7.60 billion and $8 billion for fiscal 2026, ahead of estimates. CEO Andrew Wilson attributed the strong year of bookings to the company's FC and College Football games. First-quarter bookings guidance came up short of analysts' expectations, however EA expects the figure to range between $1.175 billion and $1.275 billion, versus a $1.275 billion projection from analysts.

          <p>Media mogul Barry Diller publicly addressed being gay for the first time in an excerpt from his forthcoming memoir, “Who Knew,” while also celebrating his marriage to Diane von Furstenberg. Diller writes of a quiet suffering he felt by hiding his sexuality, and a fear of exposure that “stunted any chance of my having a fulfilling personal life.” Diller characterizes his relationship with Ms. von Furstenberg as one of “romantic love and deep respect, companionship and world adventuring,” including periods of separation and subsequent reunion, saying they “have spent 50 years intertwined with each other in a unique and complete love.” The memoir, which is being released May 20, speaks for itself.</p>

Despite tensions between the two nations due to tariffs and trade disputes, the meeting was largely cordial, with both leaders exchanging praise. Carney emphasized Canada's independence and the importance of distinguishing between "wish and reality," while Trump reiterated his concerns about trade imbalances and border security.

          <p>An opinion article in the New York Times discusses the ethical and potential legal issues surrounding President Trump's involvement in cryptocurrency ventures. The article highlights concerns about conflicts of interest, potential violations of the emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution, and the influence of foreign investments on Trump's policies. Experts and senators have expressed concerns about the propriety of the President profiting from a cryptocurrency bearing his name while in office, and the potential for corruption. The growing controversy over Trump's attempts at crypto profiteering has, in turn, put passage of the cybercurrency industry’s key legislation pending before the Senate in jeopardy.</p>

          <p>Restaurants across the country are embracing whole-leaf salads, presenting diners with architectural marvels of uncut lettuce. While chefs cite visual appeal, textural integrity, and dressing adhesion as reasons for the trend, some diners find the inelegance of disassembling and eating them challenging. Some chefs believe it should be socially acceptable to eat this type of salad with your hands. The trend has sparked debate about the practicality and social acceptance of consuming salads with whole leaves.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Department has launched internal investigations into officers' responses at two San Fernando Valley homes where they investigated reports of violent assaults but did not find the victims because they did not go inside. In both incidents, callers reported hearing or witnessing a violent, active assault to 911 dispatchers, and later a body was found at each location. LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell acknowledged officers did not immediately enter either home and said he’s opened administrative investigations in connection with their responses. The investigations aim to determine whether the calls were possible fake calls, often known as a “swatting” call, meant to trigger a large police response to the victim’s address, or legitimately one where “someone who may need your help” is inside the premises.</p>

These fake accounts use feel-good messages, dance to trending songs, and thank their followers for supporting their journeys. For people with Down syndrome, these fake accounts can feel like a new level of discrimination — one where their lived experiences are copied, exaggerated and monetized.</p>

Despite rescuing thousands of people over the past decade, these organizations feel abandoned and overwhelmed by the ongoing crisis.

The organizations are calling for a collective European sea rescue program and an end to cooperation agreements with countries where migrants face abuse.</p>

Miami had the 33-year-old on their 'discovery list', meaning they were the only MLS team able to negotiate with him in the United States. They had until mid-July to decide whether to hold talks but sources have told BBC Sport they will not pursue his signing meaning De Bruyne will not link up with Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Sergio Busquets. Sources say De Bruyne's representatives are to meet with Chicago, who are currently 11th in the Eastern Conference.</p>

          <p>Tesla sales in Germany and Britain fell to their lowest point in more than two years in April, cementing a wider trend of Europeans shunning the U.S. automaker, despite growing demand for battery-powered vehicles in Europe. Registrations of new Tesla vehicles dropped nearly 46 percent in Germany and 62 percent in Britain from a year earlier, although both countries reported increases in the number of electric vehicles sold in the same period, according to statistics released on Tuesday. The numbers are proof that the backlash against President Trump’s tariffs, which is fueling a European push to shun U.S. products, and anger at Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, for supporting far-right parties, are taking their toll.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to enforce its policy barring transgender people from serving in the military while legal proceedings continue. The high court agreed to pause a lower court order that had blocked the administration from implementing its ban nationwide. The policy stems from an executive order Mr. Trump signed in January that targeted active-duty and prospective service members with gender dysphoria. Lawyers for the transgender service members said that allowing the Trump administration to enforce the ban would upend the status quo because it would clear the way for the government to start discharging thousands of transgender service members, ending their careers and hollowing out military units.</p>
