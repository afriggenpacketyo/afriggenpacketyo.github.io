          <p>Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft has stepped down from her role as a government whip due to her opposition to the government's plans to cut disability benefits, specifically personal independence payments (Pips) and universal credit. Foxcroft expressed understanding of the need to address the increasing welfare bill but argued that these particular cuts were not the right approach. In response, a government spokesman stated that the reforms aim to fix a broken welfare system and ensure that those who can work are supported, while those with severe disabilities are protected. The government extended the transition period for those losing their personal independence payments from four weeks to 13. </p>

          <p>Former Massachusetts State Police Trooper Michael Proctor, who was the lead investigator in the Karen Read case, maintains his innocence against allegations of corruption and framing Read. In a television interview, Proctor dismissed the accusations as ridiculous and stated that no evidence supports the claim that he deliberately tried to frame Read in the death of John O'Keefe. Proctor acknowledged sending inappropriate text messages about Read but argued that they were private and should not define him as a person. Following the verdict, Massachusetts State Police Colonel Geoffrey Noble announced new policies to improve investigative training and accountability within the department. </p>

          <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China, has maintained its benchmark lending rates following recent monetary easing measures and a trade agreement with the U.S., holding the 1-year loan prime rate at 3.0% and the 5-year LPR at 3.5%. This decision comes after authorities cut lending rates last month for the first time since October to mitigate the impact of trade tensions. The trade truce between the U.S. and China has alleviated some economic concerns, allowing Beijing to support its currency. Chinese policymakers are increasingly inclined to use interest rate cuts in a more restrained role, exploring alternative avenues to stimulate economic growth. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that President Trump can maintain control of the California National Guard in Los Angeles, pending the outcome of California's legal challenge.

Legal scholars suggest the decision was expected, especially given the 9th Circuit's shift towards a more balanced composition. The ruling returns the issue to U.S. District Judge Charles R.

He emphasized the importance of Juneteenth and his role in making it a federal holiday, while chiding attempts to remove historical events from textbooks and classrooms. Biden also referenced his administration's efforts to rename military bases named after Confederate officers, contrasting it with the current administration's reported push to restore the old names.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump Administration cannot withhold billions of dollars in transportation grant funding from states refusing to cooperate with immigration enforcement. Chief U.S. District Judge John McConnell granted a preliminary injunction in a case filed by 20 states, stating that "large-scale irreparable harm would occur without the preliminary injunction." The ruling challenges the Department of Transportation's imposition of an Immigration Enforcement Condition on grant applications, which required adherence to federal immigration laws and the cessation of anti-American DEI policies. The judge agreed with the states that the conditions lacked a plausible connection to the congressionally approved purposes of transportation funding. </p>

          <p>Rice prices in Japan have more than doubled in May, marking the largest increase in over half a century, contributing to a surge in the country's core inflation rate to 3.7%, its highest level since January 2023. The government has released emergency stockpiles to moderate rice prices, which have been in the spotlight recently. The rise in core inflation, which excludes fresh food costs, exceeded economists' expectations and remains above the Bank of Japan's 2% target. The so-called "core-core" inflation rate, excluding both fresh food and energy, also climbed to 3.3%. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>Japan's core consumer prices in May increased by 3.7 percent from the previous year, marking the largest increase in over two years, primarily due to surging rice and food costs. The rise in the nationwide consumer price index, excluding fresh food, has remained at or above the Bank of Japan's 2 percent target since April 2022. Food prices, excluding fresh items, increased significantly, with rice prices jumping by 101.7 percent due to a supply shortage. Service prices, closely monitored by the BOJ for monetary policy decisions, also climbed, driven by higher dining out and travel costs. </p>
