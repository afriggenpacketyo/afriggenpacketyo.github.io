        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Over 300 South Korean workers, detained during a large-scale immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia, have returned home, with their departure reportedly delayed by the White House to assess their willingness to stay. This incident has sparked significant concern from South Korea's president and Hyundai's CEO regarding its impact on future US investments and factory operations, potentially causing two to three months of delay. Seoul is actively negotiating with Washington for improved visa options for its nationals, emphasizing the need for clarity on foreign firm operations. The raid underscores growing tensions between strict US immigration enforcement and the desire to attract international business.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy experienced zero growth in July, following a 0.4% expansion in June, primarily due to the largest contraction in manufacturing output for a year. This stagnation places significant pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead of the Autumn Budget on November 26, as the government aims to boost economic growth. Economists anticipate a slowdown in the second half of 2025, with concerns about potential tax hikes and the Bank of England's efforts to balance fiscal uncertainty with persistent inflation. The Office for National Statistics noted a general slowing trend in economic activity. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scottish Secretary Douglas Alexander described Labour MPs as "despondent" after a chaotic week saw Lord Mandelson dismissed as UK ambassador to the US and Angela Rayner resign. Mandelson's sacking followed new information about his links to Jeffrey Epstein, raising serious questions about the government's vetting process for high-profile appointments. This creates an urgent need for a new ambassador just before a US presidential visit, adding to internal party anger over the handling of the situation. Critics argue the delay in action further erodes public trust in government and politics generally.</p>

          <h2>China Warns Mexico Against Imposing Higher Tariffs on Asia-Made Cars</h2>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has cautioned Mexico against its proposed plan to increase tariffs on Asia-made cars to 50%, threatening "necessary countermeasures." Mexico's Secretary of Economy Marcelo Ebrard announced the tariff hike, targeting vehicles from Asia, particularly China, as part of a broader federal budget proposal. China argues that such moves, influenced by US trade tensions, sacrifice third-party interests and contradict free trade principles. This escalating trade dispute highlights global economic friction and the complex interplay of national interests and alliances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's third and most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, has sailed through the Taiwan Strait into the South China Sea for scientific research and training missions. The vessel, still undergoing sea trials and not formally in service, signifies China's expanding naval power and ambition to project force in the Pacific. While China's navy stated the transit was routine and not directed at any specific target, Taiwan's Defense Ministry is monitoring the situation, as Beijing claims the Strait as its territory.

          <p>The California Assembly has passed Senate Bill 79, a controversial housing bill designed to override local zoning laws and significantly expand high-density housing near public transit stops. The legislation, championed by Sen. Scott Wiener, aims to address the state's severe housing shortage by allowing taller buildings and denser developments, even in single-family neighborhoods. Critics argue it's a state overreach that strips local authorities of control and could displace residents. However, the bill gained momentum after securing labor union support through amendments for union hiring.</p>

Brazilian President Lula da Silva denounced US interference as an infringement on national sovereignty and vowed retaliation against tariffs.
