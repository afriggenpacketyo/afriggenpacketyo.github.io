          <p>The threat of flash flooding persists in the U.S. Southwest, where recent downpours have already proven deadly after a two-year-old was swept away by floodwaters in California. Forecasters warn that more monsoonal moisture could bring additional flooding to parts of Arizona and New Mexico. Meanwhile, in the Atlantic, Tropical Storm Gabrielle is expected to strengthen into the second hurricane of the season. While Gabrielle is not projected to make direct landfall in the U.S., it will generate dangerous surf and rip currents along the East Coast.</p>

          <p>A public memorial for assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk is expected to draw over 100,000 people in Glendale, Arizona, with President Trump and Vice President JD Vance scheduled to speak. Security for the event has been elevated to the highest level, equivalent to the Super Bowl, following the arrest of an armed man who was impersonating law enforcement at the venue. The memorial has also become a focal point for political discourse, with various public figures commenting on the event and calling for national unity in the wake of the killing.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a law that prohibits on-duty law enforcement officers, including federal agents, from wearing masks that obscure their identity. The legislation, known as the "No Secret Police Act," is a direct response to recent immigration enforcement raids where federal agents were masked. While supporters argue the law increases transparency and accountability, law enforcement groups have opposed it, citing officer safety. The new law is expected to face legal challenges regarding the state's authority to regulate federal officers.</p>

          <p>The article details the ongoing challenges in establishing trilateral nuclear disarmament talks involving the United States, Russia, and China. Beijing has consistently rejected proposals to join negotiations, maintaining that its nuclear arsenal is purely for self-defense and is kept at the minimum level necessary for national security. This refusal complicates international efforts to extend or replace existing arms control treaties like the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), fueling concerns about a potential new global arms race.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order imposing a substantial $100,000 fee on new H-1B visas, a program heavily utilized by the technology sector to hire high-skilled foreign workers. This move is seen as a significant disruption for major tech companies like Amazon and Microsoft, which have been actively trying to foster a positive relationship with the administration. The H-1B program has long faced bipartisan criticism for its potential to undercut American wages, and this new fee represents a dramatic overhaul of the system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Southern Inyo Healthcare District, a vital hospital in the remote Eastern Sierra community of Lone Pine, California, is facing imminent closure due to a severe financial crisis. With only a few days of cash on hand, local and state officials have made an urgent appeal to the governor for a $3 million emergency bailout. If the hospital closes, it would create a 136-mile gap between medical facilities, reflecting a troubling national trend of rural hospitals struggling with rising costs and insufficient revenue.</p>
