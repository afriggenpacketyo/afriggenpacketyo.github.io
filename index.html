          <p>President Trump is scheduled to attend the NATO summit in The Hague shortly after ordering strikes on Iranian nuclear sites and declaring a ceasefire in the Israel-Iran conflict. This marks his first encounter with European allies since his return to the White House in January. Trump aims to increase defense spending among NATO members to 5% of their GDP, a contentious issue given some nations like Spain are seeking exemptions. The summit will also address the ongoing war in Ukraine, though Ukrainian President Zelenskyy's involvement is expected to be limited, and Trump's commitment to allies amidst the Middle East conflict will be closely scrutinized. Optimism regarding the alliance's future remains uncertain given Trump's past criticisms. </p>

          <p>Iran launched missiles at the Al-Udeid US military base in Qatar, claiming it was retaliation for American strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. The US reported that most missiles were intercepted, with minimal damage and no casualties, as Iran had provided early warning of the attack. President Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran following the exchange, signaling a potential de-escalation. Qatar, while acknowledging the attack, deemed it a violation of its sovereignty, while Iran's supreme leader stated that his country would not submit to anyone's violation, though Israel warned of a forceful response to any ceasefire violation. </p>

          <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is investigating Google for potentially holding too much power in the online search market and is considering changes to give consumers more choice. Google accounts for over 90% of UK searches, and the CMA is exploring options such as choice screens for users to select different search providers and increased transparency for publishers. Google argues that the proposed changes could negatively impact its business and innovation in the UK. The CMA's investigation follows similar actions in the EU, raising concerns about unintended consequences for businesses and consumers. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' defense team's decision not to call any witnesses in his federal trial for sexual assault is viewed by legal experts as a calculated risk. The defense appears to be relying on the prosecution's burden of proof and highlighting reasonable doubt, as calling witnesses could expose them to potentially damaging testimony. Experts suggest that Diddy's decision not to testify himself aims to prevent the prosecution from reiterating their case and subjecting him to a potentially humiliating cross-examination. Closing arguments are expected to begin soon, with the defense emphasizing the complexity of the relationships and the absence of a clear criminal enterprise. </p>

          <p>The 2025 NBA playoffs highlighted the importance of depth, with teams needing strong benches to compete in the increasingly fast and physical postseason. The Oklahoma City Thunder, led by MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, won the championship, showcasing the rise of young talent in the league. Injuries played a significant role, with Tyrese Haliburton's injury impacting the Indiana Pacers' chances in the finals. The playoffs also emphasized the need for adaptability, as teams relying solely on three-point shooting struggled, and the playoffs underscored the fleeting nature of championship windows, with the Thunder's dynasty hopes now in focus. </p>

          <p>New Yorkers are voting in a mayoral primary election that could have significant implications for the Democratic party. The race features a contest between progressive democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani and former governor Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani has gained momentum, especially among young voters, with a progressive platform including rent freezes and free buses. Cuomo, who resigned in 2021 following sexual harassment accusations, has relied on attacks against Mamdani, and the winner of the primary will likely become the next mayor given the city's Democratic lean. </p>

          <p>Two European brown bears named Mish and Lucy escaped their enclosure at Wildwood Devon, a wildlife park near Exeter, leading to the park's evacuation. The bears headed straight for the honey store, consuming a week's worth of honey before being secured. The park's emergency team, including trained firearms staff, and police were deployed, but the bears remained calm and did not breach any public areas. An investigation has been launched to determine how the bears escaped, as there were no signs of enclosure damage, and the park reopened the following day. </p>

Experts note that such content is correlated with a higher risk of disordered eating, particularly among young women and girls.

An executive order calls for "unfettered access" to state program data, raising legal questions under the Privacy Act of 1974.

          <p>The US Air Force's B-2 stealth bomber played a crucial role in recent strikes against Iranian nuclear sites, requiring pilots to endure 18-hour missions from Missouri to Iran. These intercontinental flights demand exceptional endurance, with careful consideration given to diet and sleep patterns. Pilots often rely on bland foods like turkey sandwiches and sunflower seeds to stay alert during multi-day flights. Mid-air refueling, a dangerous aspect of these missions, is performed blind, requiring pilots to rely on visual cues and memorized reference points. </p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to involve the US in the Israel-Iran conflict through airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities may prove successful if the announced ceasefire holds. The ceasefire, brokered by Trump, aims to de-escalate tensions in the region, but its fragility was evident when Israel accused Iran of violating the agreement shortly after it took effect. If the ceasefire is respected by both sides, it would represent a significant step back from the brink of a wider conflict, with the potential for a lasting peace. </p>
