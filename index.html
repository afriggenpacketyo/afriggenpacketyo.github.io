            <p>A US judge ruled that the Trump administration can deport Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate, due to his involvement in pro-Palestinian protests. Khalil, a legal US resident, faces deportation under a Cold War-era immigration law, with the government arguing his presence is adverse to American foreign policy interests. The ACLU criticized the decision as "pre-written," citing a letter from Secretary of State Marco Rubio as the primary evidence. Khalil's legal team plans to appeal, arguing that evidence of antisemitism has not been presented and that his right to free speech is being violated. </p>

            <p>South Carolina executed Mikal Mahdi by firing squad, marking the second time the state has used this method in five weeks. Mahdi was convicted of killing an off-duty police officer in 2004, having chosen the firing squad over lethal injection or the electric chair. This execution is the fifth in South Carolina in less than eight months, ending a 13-year pause on executions in the state. Mahdi also admitted to killing a convenience store clerk in North Carolina three days before killing the police officer, for which he was sentenced to life in prison.</p>

            <p>A Los Angeles County judge ruled that the resentencing hearing for Erik and Lyle Menendez can move forward, despite the current District Attorney's attempt to withdraw a previous motion in favor of reducing their sentences. The brothers, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, have spent over 30 years in prison. The current DA argued that the previous motion did not thoroughly consider whether the brothers have taken full responsibility for their crimes. In addition to the resentencing hearing, the Menendez brothers are also seeking clemency from the Governor.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the Trump administration must "facilitate" the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man mistakenly deported to a mega-jail in El Salvador. Despite the ruling, the justices also indicated that the lower court may have overstepped its authority. Garcia, alleged to be a gang member, was deported under an arrangement between the US and El Salvador. A lower court judge demanded daily updates from the Justice Department regarding Garcia's location and the steps being taken to bring him back to the US, a demand the Trump administration has resisted.</p>

He stated that the full report would be released soon but did not share many other specific details from the exam.

            <p>The UK government is considering taking control of a major British Steel plant in Scunthorpe, owned by Chinese firm Jingye, to prevent its closure. MPs are being recalled from their Easter break to pass emergency legislation that would allow the government to keep the site operational. The plant, which employs 2,700 people, is the last in the UK capable of producing virgin steel. Jingye claims the plant is losing Â£700,000 a day despite significant investment, citing challenging market conditions and high costs associated with transitioning to lower-carbon production techniques.</p>

            <p>Analysts suggest that the record American tariffs imposed on Beijing could serve as a stress test for China's ability to withstand Western economic pressure during a crisis in the Taiwan Strait. While tariffs may boost Beijing's confidence, experts caution that any decision regarding Taiwan remains a complex political and military calculation for China. The United States has imposed tariffs of 145 per cent on Chinese imports, increasing the effective tariff rate to about 156 per cent.</p>
