          <p>A new tax bill proposes 'Trump Accounts,' similar to 529 college savings plans, offering tax incentives for early savings. Earnings grow tax-deferred, and qualified withdrawals are taxed at the long-term capital-gains rate. While custodial brokerage accounts may incur a 'kiddie tax,' 529 plans offer tax-free growth for qualified education expenses. Experts suggest 529 plans are superior for higher education savings due to federal tax-free growth and the option to roll unused funds into a Roth IRA. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Republican-led House passed President Trump's tax bill, a victory for the GOP but sparking concerns over its economic impact. The bill includes tax cuts and spending adjustments, with Democrats opposing its effects on the social safety net. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill would disproportionately benefit higher-income households. While the bill advances to the Senate, its path is uncertain as several Republican senators have expressed the need for significant changes. On Wall Street, major indexes fell as analysts worried about the bill's potential to increase federal deficits.</p>

          <p>The government in England and Wales is moving forward with reforms that would allow prisoners, including some serious offenders, to be eligible for release after serving a third of their sentence. This proposal, inspired by reforms in Texas, aims to address prison overcrowding by incentivizing good behavior. While the Justice Secretary has ruled out early release for the most serious offenders and those jailed for terror offenses, critics argue that the plan is a 'recipe for carnage' and endangers victims. The government insists that reducing sentences is necessary to manage the rising prison population and that the reforms will reduce reoffending and protect victims.</p>

Almost all of Nike's goods are manufactured in Asia, a region targeted by President Trump's tariffs. The price increases will affect most Nike shoes costing over $100 and clothing and equipment, with exemptions for certain products like Air Force 1 trainers and children's items.</p>

The bill now heads to the Senate, where its future is uncertain.

          <p>Solar stocks experienced a significant drop after the House Republicans passed a tax bill that terminates key clean energy credits.

Analysts describe the bill as a "worse than feared" scenario for clean energy, impacting companies like Enphase and SolarEdge. While the bill is detrimental to the solar industry, Jefferies analysts expect the Senate to make changes to the legislation. First Solar, a major U.S. solar panel producer, was less affected due to the manufacturing tax credit remaining relatively untouched.</p>

Consumers can expect lower inventory and higher prices, with the freight business impacted by ongoing trade pressures. Retailers are being cautious about discussing price increases after President Trump's criticism of Amazon and Walmart, while small businesses struggle to absorb cost increases.</p>

          <p>During a tense meeting with President Cyril Ramaphosa, Donald Trump made several contested claims about the killings of white farmers in South Africa. BBC Verify investigated these claims, finding that footage of rows of crosses did not mark graves of murdered farmers but was from a protest. They also found that while South Africa has a high murder rate, figures do not support claims of "white genocide". Additionally, Trump played footage of people singing "Kill the Boer" at political rallies, but those leading the singing were not government officials.</p>

          <p>Seniors may benefit from investing in gold to protect their portfolio during times of inflation and economic uncertainty, though it may not be suitable for those seeking aggressive growth. Gold's stability can be especially important for retirees with shorter investment timelines, but its lack of income generation may not suit all needs. Alternative ways to invest in gold include fractional gold investing and gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs). (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Millions of public sector workers in the UK, including nurses, doctors, and teachers, have been offered pay rises of between 3.6% and 4.5%. The government accepted recommendations from pay review bodies higher than the 2.8% it previously budgeted for. While unions had threatened action if pay awards were not increased, the Treasury has said rises above this will have to be funded through savings from existing budgets. The education department has announced additional funding to cover the rises, but schools will be asked to partially fund the awards through improved productivity and smarter spending.</p>
