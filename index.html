          <h2>Strategic Certificate of Deposit Actions Recommended for Savers Before July Fed Meeting</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 16:31:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article advises savers to consider strategic moves with certificates of deposit (CDs) ahead of the Federal Reserve's late July meeting, amid speculation about potential interest rate cuts. It suggests savers should first calculate the precise deposit amount and term length they can commit to, avoiding costly early withdrawal penalties. The piece also recommends shopping for higher rates at online banks, which often have lower overhead costs, and locking in a high rate as soon as possible to safeguard earnings against future rate decreases. These steps are presented as crucial for maximizing returns in the current economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has lifted a lower court's injunction, permitting the Trump administration to move forward with plans for large-scale layoffs of federal workers. In its unsigned order, the court stated the administration was likely to succeed in arguing its executive order was lawful but expressed no opinion on the legality of the specific agency reorganization plans themselves. Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor issued separate opinions, with Jackson dissenting strongly against the decision, while Sotomayor concurred but noted the specific reduction plans were not yet before the court for review. This ruling clears the way for significant restructuring across numerous federal agencies while legal challenges continue.</p>

          <p>Amber Rose Howard, a rapper known as Amy Luciani, has filed for divorce from former NBA star Dwight Howard just six months after their marriage. According to court documents filed in Georgia, Howard cited the marriage as "irretrievably broken" and is seeking alimony and an equal division of marital assets. The couple had made their engagement public in December, and Howard has since removed photos of the former basketball player from her social media accounts. Dwight Howard, an NBA champion and eight-time All-Star, has not yet publicly commented on the divorce filing.</p>

          <p>In a display of cross-border solidarity, a team of firefighters and first responders from Acuña, Mexico, has joined search and rescue operations in Texas following devastating floods along the Guadalupe River. The group, Fundación 911, is working under the direction of U.S. authorities, bringing expertise from their experiences with flood zones along the Rio Grande. This act of cooperation comes amid ongoing political tensions over immigration but has been praised by officials, including the U.S. ambassador to Mexico, as a sign of unity. The firefighters emphasized that their duty to help transcends national borders.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans to impose tariffs of up to 200% on pharmaceuticals imported into the United States, stating the details would be finalized by the end of the month. However, he suggested that the implementation could be delayed by a year to a year and a half, giving drugmakers time to move manufacturing operations back to the U.S. The pharmaceutical industry has pushed back, warning that such tariffs could increase costs, disrupt supply chains, and deter investment. The announcement follows a Section 232 national security investigation into pharmaceutical imports initiated by the administration in April.</p>

          <p>An Ohio mother, Angelina Williams, has been sentenced to a minimum of 19 years in prison after her six-year-old son was severely mauled by a pit bull.

The judge condemned the mother's actions, stating she allowed her son to be treated like a "chew toy." The boy suffered severe lacerations to his throat but has since made a full recovery and is now in the care of a legal custodian with his sister.</p>

          <p>The California School for the Deaf has agreed to a $14 million settlement with a former student who was subjected to years of sexual abuse by a dorm attendant. The lawsuit claimed the staffer, Ricardo Rose, engaged in repeated sexual assaults against the student, identified as John Doe, from 2009 to 2011. The victim's attorneys argued that the school ignored numerous red flags and complaints about Rose's misconduct over his 30-year tenure. Rose was later convicted of a felony, and the investigation uncovered three other victims. The settlement aims to provide the victim with resources to address the lifelong impact of the abuse.</p>

During a search, authorities seized 16 explosive devices, dozens of firearms, and thousands of rounds of ammunition.

          <p>The UK's Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecasts that the annual cost of the state pension triple lock policy will reach £15.5 billion by 2030, three times its initial estimate. The triple lock ensures the state pension rises annually by the highest of inflation, wage growth, or 2.5%. The OBR report states this rising cost, combined with recent government spending decisions, has left the UK's public finances in a "relatively vulnerable position."

          <p>This opinion article examines the debate over whether Democrats should prioritize universal social programs over means-tested ones, particularly in light of recent Republican cuts to Medicaid. The author argues against the common progressive belief that universality guarantees political protection, pointing out that some universal programs like unemployment insurance have faced significant cuts. The piece suggests that the resilience of programs like Social Security and Medicare may be due more to their beneficiaries being elderly and perceived as "deserving" rather than their universal nature. It concludes that while universal programs have policy advantages, they are not inherently more politically safe or easier to establish.</p>

Despite the availability of cheaper alternatives like pork and poultry, American demand for beef has remained remarkably strong.

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a new 50% tariff on all copper imported into the United States, a move intended to bolster domestic production. The announcement, which follows a national security probe into copper imports, caused U.S. copper prices to jump to a record high. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated he expects the tariff to be officially implemented by the end of July. This sector-specific duty is part of a broader trade strategy that includes recently announced tariffs on goods from 14 countries and a threatened 200% tariff on pharmaceuticals.

          <p>President Donald Trump voiced his displeasure with Russian President Vladimir Putin regarding the ongoing war in Ukraine, accusing the Russian leader of responding to peace efforts with "bulls---". During a Cabinet meeting, Trump highlighted the high casualty rate, stating up to 7,000 soldiers are dying per week, and said he is "very unhappy" with Putin. His comments came shortly after the Pentagon paused a weapons shipment to Ukraine, a decision Trump claimed to have no knowledge of.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that he cannot block the Trump administration's decision to rescind hundreds of millions of dollars in grants to non-profit anti-violence organizations. While Judge Amit P. Mehta described the funding cuts as "shameful" and likely to harm vulnerable communities, he concluded that he lacked the legal authority to issue an injunction to restore the funds. The lawsuit was filed by five organizations that lost their grants after the Department of Justice redirected the money to support law enforcement operations, stating the original grants no longer aligned with agency priorities.</p>

          <p>This review of the new James Gunn-directed "Superman" movie praises its departure from the grim tone of recent DC films, embracing a sincere and lighthearted sensibility. The film presents Superman not as a lone god but as one of many super-powered individuals, a choice that helps define his unique, altruistic character. The article notes the film's whimsical energy, comparing it to a large-scale Saturday-morning cartoon, and highlights how it builds modern skepticism about pure goodness directly into the narrative. The performance of David Corenswet is described as emphasizing the hero's relatable, regular-guy sensibility, making for a refreshing take on the iconic character.</p>

          <p>British Members of Parliament have voted to pass the Football Governance Bill, which will establish an independent regulator for the top five divisions of men's football in England.

The new regulatory body will operate independently of both the government and existing football authorities. An amendment to make more Premier League matches available on free-to-air television was voted down during the proceedings, maintaining the current broadcasting balance.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes whether a $20,000 deposit earns more in a certificate of deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account (HYSA) in the current interest rate environment. It calculates that for shorter terms (3, 6, and 12 months), a CD currently offers a slightly higher return due to fixed rates. However, for longer terms (9, 18, and 24 months), a HYSA with a competitive variable rate could potentially earn more, assuming rates remain stable. The piece emphasizes the trade-off between the fixed, secure return of a CD and the flexible, but variable, earnings of a HYSA. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article argues that the debate surrounding artificial intelligence is becoming dangerously radicalized, splitting into two opposing camps of zealots and skeptics. One side, represented by figures like OpenAI's Sam Altman, evangelizes the inevitable and utopian rise of superintelligence, dismissing job losses as a minor consequence of progress. The other side, composed of critics like Emily Bender, dismisses AI as an overhyped, biased, and fundamentally flawed technology. The author contends this polarization obscures a more nuanced reality, where AI is both powerful and problematic, and prevents meaningful discussion about its real-world effects on employment, society, and the environment.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced plans to further escalate his trade wars, threatening a 50% tariff on imported copper and up to 200% on foreign pharmaceuticals. The announcement comes amid confusion over his administration's tariff strategy, as a deadline for a previous wave of duties was extended just a day before. Trump has since stated that the new August 1 deadline is firm and that no further extensions will be granted for tariffs on goods from 14 countries. Economists have warned that the aggressive trade strategy risks worsening inflation, though global markets have remained largely stable.</p>
