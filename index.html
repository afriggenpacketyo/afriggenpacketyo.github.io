          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has issued a memo requiring formal approval for nearly all Department of Defense correspondence and interactions with Congress, including from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and combatant commanders. This new policy, obtained by CBS News, aims to centralize legislative affairs activities and prevent "unauthorized engagements" from potentially undermining departmental objectives. Democratic Senator Jack Reed, ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, strongly criticized the move, raising serious questions about transparency and the timely flow of crucial information lawmakers need for effective oversight. The memo directs almost all communication, including requests for information, to be channeled through the assistant secretary for legislative affairs, sparking concerns about potential obstacles to democratic accountability.</p>

          <p>An Australian Member of Parliament has used parliamentary privilege to publicly name a person of interest, previously protected by law, in the 50-year-old disappearance of three-year-old Cheryl Grimmer. This individual, known as "Mercury," was charged with abduction and murder in 2017 after a 1971 confession was found, but the case was ultimately dropped due to an inadmissible ruling. Cheryl's family, who attended the parliamentary session, has been tirelessly pushing for a fresh inquiry, having recently presented authorities with a document detailing alleged missteps in the initial investigation. Despite a recent review finding no new evidence for conviction, a new parliamentary inquiry into long-term missing persons cases, including Cheryl's, offers a renewed hope for answers.</p>

          <p>The US State Department has controversially removed the Human Rights Reporting Gateway, an online portal designed for individuals and organizations to report alleged human rights violations by foreign military units supplied with American weapons. This deletion has drawn strong condemnation from human rights campaigners and a senior congressional aide, who argue it directly contravenes the law mandating information gathering and severely undermines the department's human rights oversight architecture. Critics fear this move will drastically reduce accountability for potential abuses by US-backed forces, leaving fewer incentives for foreign governments to pursue justice for heinous crimes. The State Department, however, insists it continues to fulfill its legal requirements by engaging with "credible organizations" on human rights concerns, despite widespread criticism of its recent restructuring.</p>

          <p>US forces have carried out their eighth strike on an alleged drug boat, this time in the Pacific Ocean, resulting in the deaths of two individuals onboard a vessel identified by intelligence as carrying illicit narcotics along a known trafficking route. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth confirmed the strike, emphasizing that no US forces were harmed, and President Trump affirmed his legal authority for these operations in international waters. Trump indicated a readiness to expand anti-drug measures to land targets, potentially seeking congressional approval for such an escalation, framing these actions as vital for national security. This aggressive campaign has already claimed at least 34 lives and has led to rising tensions with governments in the region, particularly Colombia.</p>

          <p>A coalition of prominent civil rights organizations has submitted a letter to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Senate committees, detailing alarming reports of medical neglect experienced by pregnant women in US immigration custody. The allegations include delayed and substandard prenatal care, denial of prenatal vitamins, lack of interpretation services, and instances of miscarriages following inadequate medical attention, with some women also reporting being shackled. The groups assert that ICE has violated its own guidance by detaining pregnant individuals, particularly domestic violence survivors, and placing them in solitary confinement. ICE, through a Homeland Security assistant secretary, has dismissed the claims as "anonymous, unsubstantiated, and unverifiable," stating pregnant women in custody receive comprehensive care and elevated oversight.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to demolish the entire East Wing of the White House as early as this weekend to construct a new ballroom, with the project's estimated cost now soaring to $300 million, up from an initial $200 million. President Trump states the project will be funded entirely by private donors, but it has drawn significant pushback from historic preservation groups who argue the massive addition will "overwhelm the White House itself." Officials cite security and technology modernization as reasons for the extensive overhaul, but the extensive demolition marks a reversal from earlier assurances that the ballroom would not interfere with the current building. This controversial undertaking has temporarily suspended public tours and ignited a debate about preserving national heritage versus presidential modifications.</p>

          <p>President Trump and his legal team have reportedly requested approximately $230 million from the Justice Department to settle federal damage claims stemming from investigations during his first administration and the Biden administration. These claims relate to inquiries into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election and the FBI's search of his Mar-a-Lago estate for classified documents. The request raises significant conflict of interest concerns, as top Justice Department officials, including Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and Associate Attorney General Stanley Woodward, previously served as Trump's defense attorneys in these very cases. Legal experts describe the situation as "unparalleled" and "unimaginable," questioning the ethics of such a settlement being approved by officials who owe their positions to the president.</p>

Christina described her daughter's rapid deterioration and the immense challenges of extricating her from the group's psychological grip, feeling "scared, helpless, and hopeless."

          <p>Sophisticated cargo theft rings are costing the US economy up to $35 billion annually by employing elaborate online schemes to impersonate legitimate trucking companies and steal entire container loads of valuable goods. These thieves often steal a business's identity, then trick shippers into handing over shipments, with many heists occurring while cargo is in transit. For instance, Ari Bikes lost 350 new bicycles through such a scam, and celebrity chef Guy Fieri's Santo Tequila lost over $1 million worth of bottles when criminals remotely redirected unsuspecting drivers. Authorities warn that if a deal appears too good to be true, it likely is, advising consumers to thoroughly research sellers before purchasing high-value items online to protect themselves from these prevalent schemes.</p>

Speaking from the Oval Office, Trump asserted his legal authority for these actions, framing them as a national security issue that saves "25,000 American lives" annually. He vowed that land-based smugglers would be "hit very hard" in a manner equivalent to the maritime strikes, noting the administration is "totally prepared" for this escalation.

          <p>Beginning in 2026, NHS health checks in England, offered to adults aged 40 to 74 every five years, will officially incorporate questions about menopause and its potential symptoms. This new measure aims to identify women who could benefit from essential advice and support, including treatments like hormone replacement therapy (HRT), drugs for hot flushes, and counselling, ultimately working to reduce stigma and improve care. Health Secretary Wes Streeting emphasized that women have "suffered in silence for far too long" regarding often debilitating menopausal symptoms. While campaigners welcome the move to mainstream menopause discussions, concerns remain about the historically low uptake of general health checks in some communities, potentially limiting the reach of this important change.</p>

This policy creates significant challenges for affected owners, making long-distance travel much harder, and is notably more restrictive than those of other EV manufacturers.

          <p>New port fees enacted by the Trump administration's U.S. Trade Representative have imposed an estimated $34 million annual tariff bill on Atlantic Container Line (ACL), a US-based ocean carrier. The company was unexpectedly reclassified under new Section 301 terms, leading to fees based on the vessel's net tonnage capacity rather than its primary cargo type, despite only 1% of its roll-on/roll-off freight being passenger cars. ACL's CEO, Andrew Abbott, warns that these unforeseen and substantial tariffs could force the unique hybrid carrier out of the US market, potentially impacting American manufacturers and exporters who rely on its specialized service. The USTR has indicated no change in the application of these rules, asserting they are based on vessel construction characteristics, leaving ACL facing an existential threat.

          <p>A new report from the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) asserts that England's support system for children with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) is fundamentally flawed and requires a major overhaul. The report advocates for more comprehensive and easily accessible support within mainstream schools, aiming to reduce the current reliance on lengthy assessment processes for Education Health and Care Plans (EHCPs). Personal accounts from students like Evie and Betsey powerfully highlight the struggles of navigating the current system, including difficulties in finding suitable specialist placements and the impact of late diagnoses on academic support. The Department for Education acknowledges the "vicious cycle" in the inherited SEND system and states that reforms are actively underway, including increased funding and improved teacher training.</p>

Nick Lai, head of auto research in Asia-Pacific at JPMorgan, suggests a more cautious scenario could see sales decline by 3-5% next year, as a significant portion of demand may have been brought forward by the existing incentives. China's automotive sector last experienced a contraction in 2020, and the expiration of these governmental incentives is cited as the primary reason for this pessimistic outlook.
