          <p>Moody's has downgraded the US credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing concerns over the increasing federal debt and interest costs, marking the last of the major ratings firms to remove the US's triple-A status. The agency noted that successive administrations have failed to reverse ballooning deficits and interest costs, leading to a diminished capacity to repay debts. This downgrade could potentially lead to higher borrowing costs for consumers and impact financial markets, although past downgrades have had limited long-term effects. The agency expressed concern that the 2017 tax cuts, if extended, would add trillions to the federal deficit. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An internal review indicates that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is "not ready" for the upcoming hurricane season due to staff cuts and a refocusing of its core mission, despite the Department of Homeland Security's claims to the contrary. The review cites culture issues, staffing shortages, and coordination challenges with other federal agencies as contributing factors. The report also references President Trump's plan to shift more emergency response duties to the states, leading to concerns about states passing responsibilities to FEMA. FEMA's acting head, David Richardson, has expressed support for shrinking the agency and increasing cost-sharing with states.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm warning was issued for the Chicago area as a fast-moving wall of dust reduced visibility to near zero, causing travel disruptions and power outages. The National Weather Service reported significantly reduced visibility on major interstates, and ground stops were briefly implemented at O'Hare and Midway airports. Showers and thunderstorms combined with the dust storm resulted in reports of "mud rain" in some areas. Some schools closed due to power outages following severe weather events. Cooler, dry weather is expected to settle in for the weekend, followed by a rainy pattern next week.</p>

          <p>President Trump's domestic policy bill faced a setback as conservative Republicans blocked it from advancing out of the House Budget Committee due to disagreements over federal spending cuts. The conservatives are pushing for earlier implementation of work requirements for Medicaid recipients, while blue-state Republicans are demanding an increase in the cap on state and local tax deductions. House Speaker Mike Johnson remains committed to bringing the legislation to a floor vote before Memorial Day, despite the divisions within his party. The bill seeks to extend tax cuts from Mr. Trump's first term while enacting new ones, offset by cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, and clean energy subsidies.</p>

          <p>The US Department of Homeland Security is reportedly considering a pitch for a television gameshow where immigrants would compete for US citizenship, described as a "celebration of being an American." The proposal, pitched by a producer who worked on Duck Dynasty, would involve challenges based on American traditions and historical events, with the winner being sworn in as a US citizen. The idea has surfaced amid Donald Trump's immigration crackdown and is overseen by Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, who has faced criticism for her "made-for-TV" approach to immigration enforcement.</p>

Sheriff Susan Hutson indicated that the escapees may have received help from individuals within the department, and three Sheriff‚Äôs Office employees have been suspended without pay.

          <p>Donald Trump's "big, beautiful" package of tax breaks and spending cuts has stalled in the House of Representatives, exposing deep budgetary divisions within the Republican Party. The bill failed to advance through the House Budget Committee due to disagreements over the extent of budget cuts, Medicaid reductions, and state and local tax deductions. Conservative congressmen are demanding steeper cuts to avoid swelling the public debt, while lawmakers from high-tax states are objecting to the proposed cap on local tax deductions. The bill's tax breaks total about $4.9 trillion, partly paid for by cuts to Medicaid and green energy tax breaks.</p>

          <p>Teachers at Westbourne Academy in Ipswich, UK, are on strike due to concerns about pupil behavior, including reports of students throwing chairs and scissors. The teachers claim disruption is not consistently addressed and that there is a lack of support from the senior leadership team. Some teachers have resigned due to being pushed and sworn at by students, while others are considering quitting the profession altogether. Parents have voiced concerns about bullying and a lack of accountability, while others support the strike and hope it leads to improved behavior. A trust that runs the school acknowledges there is a "small but significant minority whose behaviour does not yet meet our high expectations" and says it is "actively addressing" this.</p>

          <p>Tesla has amended its corporate bylaws to restrict shareholders' ability to sue the company for breaches of fiduciary duty, requiring a minimum ownership of 3% of outstanding shares to initiate a derivative proceeding. This change leverages a Texas state law, where Tesla is incorporated, making it significantly more difficult for individual shareholders to bring lawsuits against insiders. The move follows a Delaware court decision that rescinded Elon Musk's 2018 CEO compensation package, prompting Tesla to relocate its incorporation to Texas. Tesla is appealing the Delaware court's decision.</p>

          <p>Two British men accused of robbing a luxury jewellery store in Tokyo can be extradited to Japan following a landmark ruling. For almost a decade, Japanese authorities have pursued the extradition of Kaine Wright, 28, Joe Chappell, 38, and a third man over allegations they posed as customers to steal items worth ¬£679,000 (¬•106m) from a Harry Winston store. On Friday, chief magistrate Judge Goldspring rejected Wright and Chappell's challenges against extradition. Their case now passes to the home secretary to decide whether they should be sent to Japan. No extradition treaty exists between the UK and Japan, meaning it would be the first time Japan have successfully received fugitives.</p>
