          <p>Snap's stock price experienced a significant drop of 14% after the company released its first-quarter earnings report. While the company's revenue of $1.36 billion slightly exceeded expectations, Snap declined to provide guidance for the upcoming quarter due to macroeconomic uncertainties and potential impacts on advertising demand. Snap anticipates daily active users to be around 468 million, near the midpoint of its range. The company cited headwinds at the start of the current quarter as a reason for balancing investment with revenue growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is marking 100 days of his second term, characterized by numerous executive actions, legal challenges, and significant policy shifts on immigration, foreign affairs, and environmental deregulation. He has signed 142 executive orders, more than any president in history during their first 100 days. However, only five bills have been signed into law, and the administration faces 307 legal challenges. The administration claims 119,659 jobs have been cut by the Department of Government Efficiency, and tariffs on China have risen to 147%.</p>

          <p>Matt Petgrave, the hockey player involved in the tragic death of Adam Johnson, will not face charges, according to British prosecutors.

The nearly three-hour show, held at SoFi Stadium, blends elements of her new album with tracks from her extensive catalog. The show underscores the idea that the music on “Cowboy Carter” wasn’t just American roots music, but also Beyoncé roots music, dating all the way back to Destiny’s Child. Beyoncé's performance explores the mutability of American iconography, utilizing wardrobe and visual elements to challenge and redefine perceptions.</p>

          <p>Gilead Sciences has agreed to pay $202 million to settle claims that it used speaker programs to provide kickbacks to doctors for prescribing its HIV drugs. The U.S. Attorney's Office stated that Gilead gave money to doctors in the form of honoraria, meals, and travel expenses between 2011 and 2017, violating the Anti-Kickback Statute. The arrangement caused false claims to be made for Gilead's drugs to be paid for by federal health-care programs. Gilead stated it entered the agreement to avoid potential litigation.</p>

The Ducks' owners are privately funding the renovation, contrasting with the stalled negotiations between the city and the Angels over Angel Stadium.</p>

          <p>President Trump has made several inaccurate claims about grocery prices and gas costs. He falsely stated that gas prices hit $1.98 a gallon in some states and that grocery prices have declined since he took office. While crude oil prices have dropped, Trump exaggerated the price at the time he assumed office. Wholesale egg prices have declined, but retail prices remain high. These claims are made as tariffs begin to impact the prices of everyday items.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments in a case concerning efforts to create the nation's first religious charter school in Oklahoma.
