          <p>Harvard University and the University of Toronto have established a program allowing certain international graduate students to study in Canada if they are barred from the U.S. due to visa restrictions. This plan addresses uncertainty stemming from the U.S. government's recent actions against Harvard's ability to enroll international students, which included requests for extensive student records. The contingency, for students who have completed one year at Harvard's Kennedy School, will only be activated if there is sufficient demand from those unable to enter the United States.</p>

          <p>Large crowds gathered in Tehran for the funeral of high-ranking Revolutionary Guard commanders and nuclear scientists, including Gen.

The public ceremony for 60 individuals, including civilians, took place amidst chants against the U.S. and Israel, with Iran's Supreme Leader notably absent from the live broadcast.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced plans to scrap 201 National Health Service (NHS) organizations in England as part of a new 10-year health strategy. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the move aims to simplify a complex system, focusing resources on "more doers and fewer checkers." Among the bodies to be abolished are Healthwatch England, an advocate for patients, and the National Guardian's Office, which supports whistleblowers. The strategy also includes a trial to link hospital funding to patient satisfaction ratings.</p>

This situation highlights the significant power held by anonymous wealthy landowners in rural England, sparking a debate about community rights and land ownership transparency.

          <p>The NHL implemented a new, decentralized draft format where teams made selections from their home cities, a departure from the traditional single-venue event. The semi-remote setup, held at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles, was marked by technical issues like audio failures and awkward virtual interactions between players and team management. Some general managers, like the Kings' Ken Holland, expressed a preference for the old system's atmosphere, though top pick Matthew Schaefer said the experience was still an honor. The event saw the Ducks select Roger McQueen and the Kings pick Henry Brzustewicz.</p>

Japan remains concerned about the steep tariffs imposed on its vehicles and auto parts, which the Trump administration has justified on national security grounds and shown no sign of removing.

          <p>All four giant pandas housed at the Adventure World amusement park in Wakayama, Japan, have been sent back to China ahead of their loan agreement's expiration. The departure of 24-year-old Rauhin and her three offspring leaves only two giant pandas remaining in Japan, both at Tokyo's Ueno Zoo, who are also scheduled to return to China next year. A farewell ceremony drew thousands of visitors, marking a temporary end to the Wakayama zoo's successful joint breeding program, which has raised 17 cubs since 1994.</p>

          <p>A new study from Tulane University reveals that parts of New Orleans' concrete flood wall system, reinforced after Hurricane Katrina, are sinking at an alarming rate. Some sections are subsiding by nearly two inches per year, faster than the rise in sea levels, which could degrade the city's flood protection. The research, which used satellite data to track elevation changes, identified sinking hotspots around industrial sites and new developments. The findings serve as a "wake-up call" for ongoing monitoring and maintenance to protect the low-lying city from future storm surges.</p>

          <p>In a major 6-3 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court has limited the ability of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions that block government policies. The ruling, authored by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, stemmed from challenges to President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship but did not address the order's constitutionality. The court argued that such broad orders likely exceed the authority granted to federal courts, a move hailed by the Trump administration as a "monumental victory" that will allow it to proceed with previously blocked policies.</p>

          <p>The prickly pear cactus is gaining recognition in Japan as a nutrient-rich "superfood," with farmers and restaurants developing new recipes from tempura to quiche. Rich in minerals and fiber, the plant is being studied by Chubu University for its potential health benefits, including enhanced immune function. As climate change and population growth pose challenges to global food supplies, experts see the resilient, drought-tolerant cactus as a promising and sustainable food source for the future, with its cultivation now spreading to new regions within Japan.</p>

          <p>Tesla's sales in Europe experienced a sharp 27.9% decline in May compared to the previous year, even as the overall market for fully-electric vehicles grew by 27.2%. This sustained slump is attributed to increased competition, particularly from more affordable Chinese EV makers like BYD, as well as controversies surrounding CEO Elon Musk. The data indicates a significant shift in consumer attitudes, as Tesla, once the dominant name in the EV space, struggles to maintain its market share against a growing number of competitors.
