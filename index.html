          <p>The Federal Reserve is approaching its policy decision amidst uncertainty stemming from President Trump's tariffs and an economy exhibiting both strengths and weaknesses. With futures markets indicating a low probability of interest rate cuts in the near term, Fed Chair Jerome Powell faces the challenge of explaining the central bank's stance on future policy directions. Recent economic data presents a mixed picture, with GDP falling but hiring remaining solid, while manufacturing and service sectors express concerns about tariffs' impact. Powell's task is to balance these conflicting signals while keeping all options on the table for the June meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The CEO of Diamondback Energy warns that U.S. onshore oil production has likely peaked and will decline due to falling crude prices, potentially impacting the nation's energy security. Recession fears linked to President Trump's tariffs and increased OPEC+ production are driving the price plunge. With current oil prices near levels seen only during the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, the article suggests that reduced activity levels will lead to a production decrease. U.S. crude oil prices saw a rise following the prediction, indicating potential market adjustments.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk's shares experienced a surge following the announcement that sales of its weight loss drug, Wegovy, are expected to improve in the latter half of 2025 as competition from copycat compounded drugs diminishes.

However, the end of an FDA drug shortage ruling is expected to curb the availability of compounded alternatives. Novo Nordisk is also launching a direct-to-consumer online pharmacy and partnering with telehealth providers to enhance access to Wegovy.</p>

          <p>Voice of America (VOA) journalists are speaking out against the Trump administration's decision to shut down their newsroom, with some comparing it to censorship by authoritarian regimes. The VOA, which broadcasts pro-democracy programming in 47 languages to audiences worldwide, has been accused of producing "propaganda" by the administration. The shutdown has left hundreds of journalists locked out of their newsroom and has disrupted broadcasts, raising concerns about the spread of disinformation in countries where press freedom is restricted.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Unlock Gene Secret for Drought-Tolerant Rice</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 07:00:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists have identified a gene in upland rice roots that contributes to drought resistance, potentially enabling the transformation of widely cultivated irrigated rice into drought-tolerant varieties. The researchers identified a gene called HMGB1, which obstructs the development of deeper, thicker roots crucial for drought resistance. By removing this gene, irrigated rice developed longer roots and greater drought tolerance, similar to upland rice, allowing it to thrive in water-scarce environments. This breakthrough could enhance food security in regions facing water scarcity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a federal court overturning a CFPB rule that banks blamed for higher credit card rates, major credit card issuers like Synchrony and Bread Financial are maintaining those elevated rates. These companies had previously raised interest rates and added new fees in response to the CFPB's proposed regulation on late fees. Executives have stated they do not plan to roll back these changes, even though the rule has been vacated. Retail card interest rates remain near record highs, leading to increased profits for the companies at the expense of consumers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pro-tariff liberals are struggling to reconcile their support for targeted trade restrictions with President Trump's broad and often chaotic approach to tariffs. They fear that Trump's policies will discredit tariffs entirely, leading to a resurgence of the free-trade consensus. These liberals argue that tariffs can be a valuable tool when applied rationally to specific countries and sectors, but they must navigate the challenge of opposing Trump without undermining their own policy goals. The shift towards skepticism of free trade has gained momentum in recent years, but Trump's actions threaten to reverse this progress.</p>

          <p>A federal court is set to hear a lawsuit challenging the legality of President Trump's tariffs, with a decision that could have significant economic and political implications. Small businesses are arguing that the tariffs, expected to reduce average household income, exceed presidential authority. Former Republican officials have filed a brief urging the court to strike down the tariffs. The court could either uphold the tariffs, strike them down completely, or narrowly restrict their application, but the case is likely to reach the Supreme Court.</p>

The IRS could forego $323 billion in tax revenue over the next decade due to lower tax compliance and a decline in audits, according to an estimate from the Yale Budget Lab.</p>
