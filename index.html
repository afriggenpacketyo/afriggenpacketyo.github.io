          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed over the central Atlantic. Forecasters anticipate it will strengthen into a hurricane by the weekend but will remain over open waters, posing no immediate threat to land. The storm's projected path shows it moving north of the Caribbean and potentially passing east of Bermuda next week. This development occurs in what has so far been a quieter hurricane season than initially predicted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article offers a guide on buying refurbished electronics, emphasizing that the term lacks a uniform standard and quality can vary significantly. It advises consumers to scrutinize the seller's refurbishment process, check for at least a 90-day warranty, and research the seller's reputation on platforms like Amazon Renewed or Apple Certified Refurbished. Other key tips include verifying included accessories, inquiring about battery health, ensuring the device still receives software updates, and thoroughly testing the product upon arrival to avoid potential issues.</p>

          <p>A cyberattack targeting Collins Aerospace's check-in and baggage software has caused significant disruptions at major European airports, including London Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin. The attack on the 'Muse' software forced airports to revert to manual processing, resulting in long queues, widespread delays, and flight cancellations. The company, a subsidiary of RTX, confirmed the cyber-related disruption and is working to resolve the issue. The incident highlights the vulnerability of the highly interconnected and digitized global aviation industry to technological failures.</p>

          <p>Russia has conducted a large-scale missile and drone attack across nine Ukrainian regions, resulting in at least three deaths and dozens of injuries. Officials reported that civilian infrastructure and residential areas were targeted, including an apartment building in Dnipro that was hit by a missile with cluster munitions. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described the strikes as a deliberate Russian strategy to intimidate civilians. In a separate development, Russia's Defense Ministry denied its fighter jets had violated Estonian airspace earlier in the week.</p>

          <p>A homeowner in Hermosa Beach, California, shares insights from remodeling his family's home into a "Green Idea House" that generates more energy than it consumes.

The owner emphasizes the importance of extensive research, meticulous planning, and persistence with contractors to achieve environmental goals. Despite challenges like a warming climate requiring new adaptations, the home has eliminated utility bills for over a decade.</p>

Following the shooting, President Trump and his allies have escalated rhetoric against the "radical left," threatening to classify some groups as domestic terrorists despite no evidence linking them to the crime.

          <p>A review of Kamala Harris's new book, "107 Days," describes it as a taut but rancorous account of her short-lived presidential campaign following President Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 race. The memoir reveals that Pete Buttigieg was her initial choice for running mate and details a persistent bitterness toward Biden's inner circle, whom she felt never fully supported her. While the book provides an inside look at a historic political moment, the reviewer finds it functions more as an obligatory postmortem, lacking the inspirational or forward-looking vision needed to rally supporters for a future run.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order imposing a new $100,000 annual fee for companies applying for H-1B visas, which are used to hire skilled foreign workers. The administration cited a need to prevent "abuse" of the program and encourage the hiring of American workers. The move has been criticized by immigration lawyers and business groups, who argue the exorbitant fee will price out small businesses and startups, harming U.S. competitiveness. Major tech companies like Amazon have advised employees on H-1B visas to return to the U.S. before the order takes effect.</p>

          <p>A large-scale memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was fatally shot last week, is scheduled for Sunday in Arizona. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance are among the high-profile speakers expected to address tens of thousands of mourners. Kirk, the 31-year-old founder of Turning Point USA, was a key Trump ally and influential figure among young conservatives. His killing has intensified political rhetoric, with the administration vowing to crack down on groups it blames for political violence, a move critics call a threat to free speech.</p>

          <p>Major German cities, including Berlin and Cologne, are bracing for demonstrations this weekend, featuring both anti-abortion "March for Life" rallies and climate protests organized by "Fridays for Future." The anti-abortion marches, supported by some Catholic bishops, are expected to draw thousands, along with significant counterprotests. Simultaneously, climate activists are holding rallies in 70 cities, calling for an end to fossil fuels and criticizing the government's energy policies. These events coincide with the opening of Munich's world-famous Oktoberfest, creating a busy weekend of public gatherings across the country.</p>

          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has highlighted a deep schism in how Americans interpret major news events, a divide largely driven by social media. Immediately after the shooting, different political communities online began framing the event to fit their existing narratives, with some blaming far-right infighting and others alleging a broader left-wing extremist movement. Experts note that while official charging documents paint a more complex picture of a lone actor with mixed motivations, the social media ecosystem rewards speed and sensationalism over nuance, further fragmenting public understanding and fueling polarization.</p>

          <p>U.S. water treatment facilities are facing a growing number of cyberattacks from foreign adversaries, including Iran, Russia, and China. Recent incidents include hackers disrupting a plant in Pennsylvania and causing an overflow in Texas, while Chinese hackers are suspected of embedding malware in critical infrastructure for potential future conflicts. In response, a new pilot program called Project Franklin is connecting volunteer cybersecurity experts with under-resourced rural water operators. The initiative aims to improve digital defenses for the nation's 50,000 public water systems, which are often vulnerable due to outdated technology and limited staff.</p>

          <p>Neuroscientist Tom Bellamy's book "Smitten" explores limerence, a state of intense romantic infatuation characterized by intrusive thoughts and emotional highs and lows. Bellamy explains that while it's a natural part of early love, it can become a harmful "person addiction" if the object of affection is unavailable or sends mixed signals, which escalates desire. To break the cycle, he recommends strategies like limiting contact, consciously turning positive daydreams into negative "daymares" to spoil the mental reward, and focusing on new personal goals to create a sense of purpose outside the obsession.</p>

          <p>As the UK's Liberal Democrats gather for their party conference, they face the challenge of defining their path forward after a successful general election. Leader Sir Ed Davey's stunt-heavy campaign grabbed attention and helped the party win seats, but polling suggests voters now want to see more seriousness. The party's next strategic move is debated: should they continue targeting traditional Conservative voters in southern England, or expand their focus? Insiders acknowledge the need to broaden their policy platform beyond care issues and find ways to make moderate positions exciting in a polarized political landscape.</p>

          <p>The German government is facing a diplomatic challenge as close allies like France, Canada, and the UK move toward recognizing Palestine as a state. Berlin maintains that recognition should be the final step of a peace process, a position critics call unrealistic given the stalled two-state solution. This stance is rooted in Germany's historical responsibility for Israel's security, which Chancellor Friedrich Merz has called a matter of "reason of state." However, the government is under growing pressure, both internationally from EU partners and domestically from coalition members and the public, to take a stronger stance.</p>

          <p>Israel has intensified its military campaign in Gaza City by demolishing numerous high-rise residential towers, a tactic that has made hundreds of families homeless and heightened fears of permanent displacement. Palestinian residents and the UN Human Rights Office suggest the destruction could be aimed at permanently clearing the population, which would constitute ethnic cleansing. The Israeli military states the demolished buildings were used by Hamas for observation and attacks, a claim Hamas denies. The campaign is part of a broader ground assault that has flattened large areas of several neighborhoods.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence is being increasingly adopted in workplaces to combat employee burnout by automating repetitive tasks and reducing cognitive load. Tools like ChatGPT can assist with summarizing information and managing projects, with some studies showing a drop in emotional exhaustion in teams that use them. However, other research suggests that frequent AI users may experience higher rates of burnout, as the technology can create pressure to take on more work and requires time to learn. Experts caution that while AI can be a helpful companion, companies must manage its implementation to avoid simply replacing one form of stress with another.</p>
