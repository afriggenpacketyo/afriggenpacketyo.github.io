          <p>This article explores the internal dynamics at OpenAI that led to the brief ouster and subsequent reinstatement of CEO Sam Altman, highlighting the tension between AI safety concerns and the drive for commercial success. It details how co-founder Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati raised concerns about Altman's leadership, leading to his initial firing. The article reveals that Altman's behavior, including circumventing safety processes and creating internal mistrust, fueled the board's decision. Ultimately, Altman's return solidified a shift away from OpenAI's original altruistic mission towards aggressive commercialization, raising questions about the future governance and ethical implications of AI development.</p>

          <p>Frank Bruni's New York Times opinion piece discusses how internal conflicts within the MAGA movement, exemplified by figures like Laura Loomer, could create problems for Donald Trump. Loomer's criticisms of other prominent Republicans and her demands on Trump highlight the fractious nature of his base. Bruni suggests that Trump's tendency to align with provocative figures, rather than those with sound policy ideas, could undermine his ability to govern effectively. The article also touches on the broader theme of resentment driving political conversations in America, as explored in Bruni's book, 'The Age of Grievance'.</p>

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed a bill banning the addition of fluoride to drinking water, making it the second state after Utah to do so. This decision goes against the advice of public health experts and medical professionals, who warn it will increase tooth decay. The law aligns with controversial viewpoints that fluoride affects intellectual abilities. DeSantis defended the ban as protecting against "forced medication," arguing individuals can choose to use fluoride through toothpaste and mouthwash.</p>

Galaxy Digital, a digital asset investing giant, is headquartered in New York but listed in Canada due to regulatory hurdles in the U.S. JPMorgan and Ondo Finance also announced a significant blockchain initiative in Toronto, underscoring Canada's growing influence in the crypto space.</p>

          <p>Republican-backed legislation in the House does not include a tax break on Social Security benefits, despite President Trump's previous suggestion. The bill, aimed at making the 2017 tax cuts permanent, cannot alter Social Security through the reconciliation process due to the Byrd rule. Instead, the bill offers an extra $4,000 deduction for filers 65 and older. Eliminating taxes on Social Security would negatively impact the program's long-term outlook, potentially depleting the trust fund earlier, according to the Peter G. Peterson Institute.</p>

Some argue that children's books should impart moral lessons, while others believe that children should be allowed to read anything they want, without the need for characters to learn and grow.
