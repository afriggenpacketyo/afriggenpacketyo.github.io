          <h2>Polls Indicate Decline in Trump's Approval as First 100 Days Approach</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's approval ratings are declining as he nears his 100th day in office, with recent polls indicating that a majority of Americans disapprove of his performance. The polls show approval ratings hovering between 39% and 45%, marking the lowest approval for a newly elected president at this point in their term in over seven decades. This represents a shift from the initial uptick in favorability Trump experienced upon returning to the White House in January, as Americans express skepticism regarding his policy actions. Optimism scores are reasonably lower because a significant drop in approval rating can create instability, especially in the early stages of a presidency.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senator Cory Booker staged a sit-in protest on the Capitol steps to voice their opposition to the Republican budget plan, which is critical for enacting President Trump's agenda. They livestreamed their conversation, emphasizing a "moment of moral urgency" and urging lawmakers to choose the side of the American people rather than supporting the budget. The Republican plan aims to advance Trump's priorities on border security, defense, energy, and taxes, while Democrats are concerned about potential cuts to Medicaid.

          <p>Two 18th-century shipwrecks discovered off the coast of Costa Rica have been identified as Danish slave ships, Fridericus Quartus and Christianus Quintus, which were wrecked in 1710.

The discovery provides historical insight into Denmark's role in the transatlantic slave trade, which was banned in 1792 but not abolished until 1847.
