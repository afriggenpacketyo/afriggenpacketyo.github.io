          <p>Alaska Airlines and its regional carrier, Horizon Air, initiated a temporary, system-wide ground stop on Sunday evening following a significant IT outage. The airline publicly apologized for the inconvenience, warning travelers of residual impacts and advising them to check their flight status before heading to the airport. The cause of the IT failure and the full extent of its impact on airport operations were not immediately disclosed as the company worked to resolve the widespread technical issue.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Singapore dollar is increasingly viewed as a "quasi safe-haven" currency, particularly within Asia, due to Singapore's strong institutional framework, economic resilience, and stable monetary policy. While it has strengthened against a weakening U.S. dollar, its potential to become a global safe haven like the yen or Swiss franc is limited by the smaller size of its market and a managed exchange rate policy that caps liquidity. Experts believe it could eventually achieve a status similar to the Swiss franc in Asia, serving as a key asset for currency diversification. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a week of deadly clashes in Syria's Druze-majority city of Sweida, armed Bedouin clans have withdrawn under a U.S.-brokered ceasefire. The conflict, which killed hundreds and displaced over 128,000 people, was marked by sectarian violence and targeted attacks between Druze militias and Sunni Muslim clans. While the withdrawal allows for the entry of humanitarian aid convoys to the battered region, tensions persist, with some Bedouin fighters remaining on the city's outskirts and demanding accountability from Druze faction leaders.</p>

          <p>Two apartment blocks in Kirkby, Merseyside, are set to be closed due to severe fire safety deficiencies, forcing residents to abandon their homes. Leaseholders describe spending years and up to £1 million of their own money on escalating service charges and failed repairs while the buildings deteriorated under a series of management companies. The situation, described by a local MP as a "failure of the broken leasehold system," has left residents with worthless properties and highlights systemic issues with property management and accountability.</p>

          <p>A 158-year-old Northamptonshire transport company, KNP, was forced into liquidation after a ransomware attack believed to have originated from a single compromised employee password. The hacking gang, known as Akira, encrypted the company's data and locked its systems, rendering the business inoperable. Unable to pay the estimated £5 million ransom, the company, which operated 500 lorries and employed 700 people, ultimately failed, highlighting the devastating impact of cybercrime on UK businesses and the critical need for robust security measures.</p>

          <p>Former UFC champion Ronda Rousey has maintained her political stances without apology over the years, generally leaning left and having supported Bernie Sanders in 2015. In a recent interview, she revealed she had promised UFC president Dana White not to speak negatively about Donald Trump, out of respect for Trump's historical support for the UFC. While not outspoken, Rousey encourages people to get informed and participate in democracy, emphasizing that the right to vote is a personal and private decision.</p>

          <p>President Trump is threatening to obstruct the Washington Commanders' plans for a new stadium in D.C. unless the NFL team changes its name back to the "Redskins." In a series of social media posts, Trump claimed there is a "big clamoring" for the name change and that he might impose restrictions on the stadium deal if the team does not comply. The team dropped its controversial former name in 2020 after years of criticism that it was a racist slur against Indigenous people.</p>

          <p>A SkyWest flight operating as a Delta Connection service to Minot, North Dakota, was forced to take evasive action to avoid a mid-air collision with a B-52 bomber. The pilot described making an "aggressive maneuver" after the military aircraft, which was flying much faster, unexpectedly appeared in their flight path during approach. The pilot apologized to passengers for the abrupt turn, noting the situation was highly unusual, and both SkyWest and the Air Force are now investigating the incident.</p>

          <p>Canada is experiencing its worst measles outbreak since the disease was declared eliminated in 1998, with over 3,800 cases reported in 2025, making it the only Western nation in the top 10 for outbreaks. The spread, most severe in Alberta and Ontario, is linked to low vaccination rates, particularly within some Low German-speaking Mennonite communities, and a general rise in vaccine hesitancy following the COVID-19 pandemic. Health officials believe the reported numbers are just the "tip of the iceberg," highlighting a significant public health challenge.</p>

          <p>Despite conventional wisdom suggesting market turmoil ahead of tariff deadlines, several underlying factors are providing strong support for the stock market. Key drivers include excellent corporate earnings, extensive tax relief for consumers and businesses from the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," and massive investment in data centers and the electrical grid. Additionally, relaxed bank stress tests, a renaissance in the U.S. energy sector, and a renewed M&A environment are creating conditions for continued economic strength. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is reviving the Pensions Commission to tackle a looming retirement savings crisis, warning that people retiring in 2050 will be worse off than today's pensioners. New analysis reveals that nearly half of working-age adults, particularly the self-employed, low earners, and certain ethnic groups, are not saving into a private pension. The commission will aim to build a national consensus on how to boost private pension savings and address the significant gaps in retirement wealth.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that after six months of his second term, President Trump's support is increasingly confined to his political base, with growing doubt among the broader public. Support for his mass deportation program has fallen to a net-negative rating, as most Americans now believe it is not focused on dangerous criminals. Meanwhile, seven in ten people say the administration is not doing enough to lower prices, and a majority disapproves of the recently passed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." (not investment advice)</p>
