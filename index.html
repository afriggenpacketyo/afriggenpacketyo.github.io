          <p>Singapore's inflation remained at a four-year low in March, with the consumer price index rising 0.9% year-on-year, primarily driven by increases in food and private transport costs. Core inflation slowed to 0.5%, prompting the Monetary Authority of Singapore to ease monetary policy for the second consecutive time in April, amidst concerns over cost-of-living pressures and a potential zero-growth scenario for 2025. The inflation reading arrives as Singapore prepares for a general election on May 3, with Prime Minister Lawrence Wong acknowledging cost-of-living as a key concern due to global conflicts and supply chain disruptions.</p>

Trump expressed his desire for Powell to be "a little more active" in cutting interest rates, signaling his continued dissatisfaction with the Fed's approach. These remarks follow intensified criticism from Trump, who last week labeled Powell "a major loser," causing market volatility. The president also expressed optimism about improving trade relations with China, indicating potential for tariff reductions if a deal is reached.</p>

BNPL plans are particularly popular among Gen Z and millennial travelers, including for live events, with some festivals seeing over half of ticket buyers opting for payment plans. While BNPL can be a useful tool for spreading out costs, experts caution against overspending and 'stacking' multiple loans, which can lead to debt and credit score damage. Travel agents advise using BNPL only if the funds for the trip are already available, or when a good deal arises that needs immediate booking.</p>

          <p>Country music star Jelly Roll, formerly a rapper named Jason DeFord, is seeking a pardon to clear his criminal record from his teenage years, which includes a robbery at age 17 and drug charges at 23. The pardon would allow him to travel internationally to perform, which is currently difficult due to his past convictions. Jelly Roll has spoken openly about his past and now wants to inspire others to change their lives, as he says songwriting did for him while he was incarcerated. The Tennessee Board of Parole has recommended a pardon, with the final decision resting with the state's governor.</p>

          <p>Six major policy groups representing the US automotive industry are jointly lobbying the Trump administration to reconsider the 25% tariffs on auto parts scheduled to take effect by May 3.

The letter, addressed to key Trump administration officials, emphasizes the potential for production stoppages, layoffs, and bankruptcies throughout the industry.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that President Donald Trump's recent comments indicating a potential easing of tariffs on Chinese goods may reflect US anxiety and could give China leverage in trade negotiations. While Trump stated that tariffs on Chinese goods "will not be as high as 145 per cent" and "won't be zero," experts believe there has been no substantial progress in US-China tariff negotiations. The comments could signal the US side's eagerness to reach a deal, potentially allowing China to secure more favorable terms.</p>
