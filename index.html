The incident occurred on a Friday morning, with a bartender and three patrons confirmed as the victims. Authorities have identified a suspect, 45-year-old Michael Paul Brown, who lived next door to the bar and is believed to have fled the scene. The event prompted a lockdown in a nearby area as law enforcement conducted a search for the armed suspect.</p>

          <p>Cambodia's government has announced its intention to nominate former U.S. President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. The nomination is in recognition of his role in brokering a ceasefire agreement that ended a deadly border conflict between Cambodia and Thailand. Deputy Prime Minister Sun Chanthol credited Trump's intervention, which included threats of trade repercussions, for successfully halting the fighting. This follows similar Nobel nomination suggestions from officials in Israel and Pakistan for Trump's other diplomatic efforts.</p>

The ruling affirms a temporary restraining order that prevents agents from stopping individuals based solely on factors like race or location. The court rejected the government's claim that the injunction would irreparably harm its enforcement efforts.

          <p>As wildfires affect popular holiday destinations in Greece, Turkey, and other parts of Europe, travel experts are offering advice to concerned tourists. Currently, the UK Foreign Office deems it safe to travel to these areas, which means standard travel insurance may not cover cancellations for those who simply prefer not to go. However, policies often cover disruptions if official advice changes or if a trip is directly curtailed by events like evacuations. Experts recommend travelers check their specific insurance coverage and communicate directly with airlines and hotels for potential bespoke solutions.</p>

The case centers on Louisiana's new congressional map, which includes a second majority-Black district. This map was challenged by a group of "non-African-American voters" as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The court's decision will have significant implications for the Voting Rights Act and how states balance racial representation with constitutional equal protection requirements when drawing political boundaries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has attributed the pattern of increased summer flooding in northern China to the sun's decadal magnetic cycle. Researchers found that changes in solar activity influence the positioning of the monsoon rain belt, leading to a "south drought and north flooding" pattern across the country. The findings, published in the Journal of Climate, provide a new perspective on long-term climate patterns in the region. This understanding is crucial for improving climate predictions and managing flood risks in one of China's most populous areas.</p>

          <p>A National Transportation Safety Board hearing has provided new insights into the fatal midair collision between a regional jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter near Washington, D.C., which killed 67 people. Key revelations include the possibility that the helicopter's altimeter was inaccurate, a known issue that was not considered alarming. Investigators also heard that air traffic controllers at the busy airport were under pressure to "make it work," potentially compromising safety. The FAA was also criticized for not acting on prior warnings about the helicopter route's proximity to commercial flights.</p>

          <p>Lifeguards in Seal Beach, California, are reporting a significant uptick in stingray-related injuries, rising from one per day to an average of ten. The increase is attributed to calm, warm waters drawing the rays closer to shore, combined with hot weather bringing more people to the beach. The area near the San Gabriel River, known as "ray bay," is a particular hotspot. To avoid being stung, officials advise beachgoers to shuffle their feet in the sand to alert the camouflaged fish, allowing them to swim away.</p>

While the EPA claimed the move would save consumers money, data from the U.S. Energy Information Agency cited in the report shows that disincentivizing electric and fuel-efficient vehicles would increase demand for gasoline, thus raising prices for all drivers. The analysis also projected the loss of nearly half a million jobs by 2035 under the proposed deregulation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's executive order to hike tariffs on imports is expected to drive up consumer prices and create prolonged uncertainty for businesses, according to trade experts. The new policy sets a baseline tariff of at least 15% for most countries, pushing the average U.S. tariff rate to a multi-decade high of 17%. Economists warn this could lead to pricier consumer goods, from clothing and toys to cars and furniture, potentially costing the average American household over $2,000 annually.
