        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Taiwan's coast guard has requested special funding to enhance coastal surveillance following a series of undetected landings by individuals from mainland China using inflatable boats. The request was prompted by two incidents: one involving a father and son seeking freedom in Taiwan, and another involving a man who allegedly crossed the Taiwan Strait, raised a Chinese flag, and returned to the mainland, the authenticity of which is still under investigation. Taiwanese authorities are assessing the feasibility of such crossings and considering measures to prevent future breaches of coastal defenses, including increased funding and manpower. Taiwan must prepare for potential breaches in security.</p>

          <p>Peter Green Chilled, a UK distributor supplying major supermarkets like Tesco and Sainsbury's, has been hit by a ransomware attack. The logistics firm reported that its clients are receiving regular updates and workarounds to maintain deliveries, but the cyber attack has disrupted order processing. Wilfred Emmanuel-Jones, founder of Black Farmer, estimates that thousands of his meat products are at risk of spoilage if deliveries are not promptly resumed. This incident follows recent cyber-attacks on Marks & Spencer and Co-op, highlighting the increasing vulnerability of supply chains to cyber threats. The attack highlights the need for increased cybersecurity measures for supply chain distributors.</p>

The charges relate to three incidents: a vehicle fire in Kentish Town, a fire at the prime minister's private home on the same street, and a fire at an address he previously lived at in north-west London.

          <p>William Goodge, a British ultra-endurance athlete, claims to have broken the world record for the fastest run across Australia, completing the 3,800km journey in 35 days. Goodge ran from Cottesloe Beach in Perth to Bondi Beach, averaging about 100km per day, to raise money for cancer charities in memory of his mother. The record is yet to be verified by Guinness World Records, but Goodge says he endured a dust storm, injuries, and hallucinations during the run. Some in the running community have questioned the accuracy of data tracking his speed and heart rate over the course of the run.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping's announcement of a $9.1 billion credit line, infrastructure investments, and visa waivers for several Latin American countries underscores China's increasing influence in the region. This move is contrasted with President Trump's policies, such as tariff increases, foreign aid cuts, and immigration restrictions, which are perceived negatively in Latin America. Xi Jinping is positioning China as a more reliable partner for the region, advocating for free trade and multilateralism, while Trump's administration focuses on issues like crime, drugs, and illegal immigration. The article notes that China's approach is seen as a more positive and cooperative strategy compared to Trump's perceived disregard for the region.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has defended farm minister Taku Eto despite criticism over his remarks about receiving plenty of rice from supporters and not needing to buy any, amidst rising rice prices. Eto apologized for the insensitive comments, which were made at a fundraising event, but Ishiba stated that Eto should continue working to address agricultural challenges. Opposition parties have called for Eto's resignation, arguing that he is out of touch with the public's concerns regarding the high cost of the staple food. The controversy comes as the ruling coalition considers measures to mitigate the impact of inflation and higher U.S. tariffs.</p>

          <p>Japan's animation industry is increasingly adopting AI technology despite concerns among artists about copyright infringement and job losses. Japan's copyright act is more permissive than those in the EU or the US, allowing the use of copyrighted materials to train AI tools without the copyright holder's consent. The anime industry faces a labor shortage due to unattractive working conditions, making AI a potential solution to fill the gap. While some artists worry about losing their jobs, others view AI as a supporting tool that can save time and effort in the production process. Japan has been promoting its unique cultural productions — and anime is part of those noteworthy soft power exports.</p>

          <p>The reported success of Chinese-made J-10C fighter jets and PL-15 air-to-air missiles used by Pakistan in its conflict with India has fueled nationalist pride in China and renewed warnings to Taiwan. Chinese commentators have declared that the performance of these jets demonstrates the advancements of China's defense industry, suggesting that Taiwanese forces would have little chance against them. While the Chinese government has been more reserved in its confirmation, the incident has raised concerns in Taiwan about the effectiveness of its own air force. The conflict is seen by some analysts as a proxy showdown between Western and Chinese arms capabilities.</p>

          <p>Israel has acquired a trove of documents and personal effects belonging to Eli Cohen, a famous Israeli spy who was executed in Syria in 1965. The collection includes 2,500 items, such as photographs, letters, and information about his final moments, retrieved from Syria in a joint operation with an allied foreign government. Cohen's intelligence gathering in Syria in the early 1960s is credited with helping Israel win the Arab-Israeli War of 1967. The announcement comes as Syria attempts to reintegrate into the international community. Israel hopes to eventually recover Cohen's remains for proper burial.</p>

Red Bull has introduced upgrades to its car recently, and McLaren has not, which has contributed to the shifting performance. The track layout is also a contributing factor.

          <p>The Japanese government is set to initiate offshore "blue carbon" research aimed at capturing carbon dioxide through cultivated sea plants and storing it in the deep sea. The initiative hopes these plants will play a key role in mitigating climate change, as CO2 is highly soluble in water, and marine vegetation grows by absorbing dissolved CO2. The study will involve the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, Eneos Corp., and others, assessing the behavior of seaweed at significant depths and the environmental impact of such projects. Japan aims to capture 1 million tons of CO2 by fiscal 2035 and 2 million tons by fiscal 2040 through blue carbon, compared with some 34 tons absorbed by coastal plants in fiscal 2023.</p>

Since taking office, President Trump has made sweeping changes to federal agencies that work on climate change. He lifted regulations on fossil fuels, allowing new coal projects on federal land and ending what he called "woke policies" that support renewable energy. He slashed the budgets and shifted the directives of key government agencies – especially when it comes to funding research, regulating pollution and responding to climate-related disasters.

          <p>Yuri Grigorovich, a celebrated Russian ballet choreographer and former artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet, has passed away at the age of 98. Described as one of the greatest choreographers of the 20th century, Grigorovich led the Bolshoi Ballet from 1964 to 1995, known for his revitalizing of male dance and creating demanding roles. His productions, such as "The Stone Flower" and "Ivan the Terrible," redefined Soviet ballet. His departure from the Bolshoi in 1995 led to the first dancers' strike in the theatre's history.</p>

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, jumped over 18% in their Hong Kong trading debut on Tuesday. Investors are optimistic about the company's ability to capitalize on the growing electric vehicle market. CATL's IPO raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion), reportedly making it the largest offering globally this year. The funds raised will primarily be used to build a new factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive clients. The company's expansion into Europe coincides with increased scrutiny from the U.S. and EU regarding Chinese EV trade practices.</p>

          <p>The parole hearing for Lyle and Erik Menendez, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, has been rescheduled for August. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation confirmed that the hearing, originally set for June, will now take place on August 21 and 22. Earlier this month, California Gov. Gavin Newsom's office converted the brothers' clemency hearing into a parole hearing, opening the door for their potential release. The parole board will recommend whether they should be granted parole, with Newsom retaining the final decision. The brothers have argued that they carried out the killings in self-defense after years of abuse from their father.</p>

Ritchie had been on death row for over two decades and apologized for his actions, expressing remorse for the pain he caused. His attorneys argued that his trial counsel was ineffective and failed to present evidence of his fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and childhood lead exposure, but the clemency bid was rejected. The execution faced criticism due to Indiana's secretive death penalty proceedings and ban on media witnesses.</p>

          <p>Honda Motor Co. announced it will cut its investment plan for electric vehicle technology through fiscal 2030 to around 7 trillion yen ($48 billion) from the previous 10 trillion yen. This revision reflects lower-than-expected growth in the EV market. The company also postponed a 1.5 trillion-yen investment plan to start operations of new EV facilities in Canada by two years from the initially planned 2028. Despite the adjustment, Honda maintains its target of increasing the ratio of electric vehicles to fuel-cell vehicles to 100 percent of its overall new car sales in 2040.</p>

          <p>The Japanese parliament has enacted a revised law targeting male host clubs that coerce female customers into prostitution and other sex work to pay off debts. The amended law prohibits hosts from using emotional leverage, such as threatening to deny contact or impose penalties, to encourage customers to purchase drinks and food. It also bans clubs from threatening to force indebted customers into prostitution, both domestically and internationally. The law strengthens penalties against managers and operators of illicit host clubs, increasing imprisonment terms and fines. This law is intended to protect vulnerable women from exploitation.</p>

          <p>The US Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Venezuelans, potentially subjecting them to deportation. This decision reverses a lower court's injunction and allows the administration to proceed with its plan to revoke protections, which were initially granted due to unsafe conditions in Venezuela. Activists have condemned the decision, stating it will force families into impossible choices, while US Homeland Security praised the ruling as a win for American safety.
