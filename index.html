          <p>Tensions have escalated as Iran launched dozens of ballistic missiles toward Israel, retaliating for what Israeli officials described as a preemptive strike targeting Iran's nuclear program and military leadership. According to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the operation aimed to degrade Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities. U.S. officials stated they did not provide military assistance or have any involvement in the Israeli strike, but Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Iran against targeting U.S. interests in the region. The situation remains volatile, with potential implications for regional stability. </p>

          <p>Oil prices experienced a significant jump following Israel's airstrikes against Iran, raising concerns about potential disruptions to oil supplies in the Middle East. The attack, described as a "targeted military operation" by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, aimed to dismantle Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile program. While the U.S. stated it was not involved in the strikes, Secretary of State Marco Rubio cautioned Iran against targeting U.S. interests. This geopolitical tension has driven crude prices to their highest levels since March 2022. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ford CEO Jim Farley revealed that a shortage of rare earth minerals, largely sourced from China, forced the company to temporarily shut down a factory. China's export controls on these materials, essential for automobile production, have created challenges for U.S. automakers. Recent trade discussions led to an agreement where Beijing would resume regular exports, but Ford is still awaiting approval for pending applications. The situation underscores the criticality of rare earth minerals to the U.S. economy and the potential vulnerabilities in global supply chains.</p>

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has taken steps to regulate BNPL companies, but recent changes may affect consumer protections.
