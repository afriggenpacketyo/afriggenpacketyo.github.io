          <p>Reddit's stock price experienced a significant jump after the company announced second-quarter financial results that surpassed analyst expectations for both sales and future guidance. The social media platform's revenue grew 78% year-over-year, and it reported a net income of $89 million, a strong turnaround from a net loss in the same period last year. The company also saw a 21% increase in global daily active users, reaching 110.4 million. This positive performance is part of a broader trend of strong earnings from major tech companies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amazon's shares declined in extended trading despite the company reporting second-quarter results that exceeded analyst expectations on both earnings and revenue. The dip was attributed to a cautious operating income forecast for the upcoming quarter, which fell short of Wall Street predictions. However, the company's sales grew by 13% year-over-year, with its online stores and advertising divisions showing robust performance. Amazon also noted that potential impacts from 'tariff and trade policies' could affect its future financial results, reflecting ongoing economic uncertainties.</p>

The initiative is part of the 'Make America Healthy Again' movement and will be administered by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

          <p>A plush monster doll named Labubu, created by the Chinese company Pop Mart, has become a major fashion trend and collectible item in the United States. Initially popular in China, the accessory is now frequently seen on purses and belts, driven by social media trends and celebrity endorsements from figures like Lisa of Blackpink and Rihanna. This surge in popularity has led to astronomical growth for Pop Mart, with its North American revenue surging over 550% between 2023 and 2024. The dolls are being described by analysts as a 'gateway drug' to the company's broader range of collectible toys.</p>

Despite the competitive pressure, AWS remains a significant profit driver for Amazon, generating $10.2 billion in operating income for the quarter. The growth is fueled by the booming demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure and major corporate partnerships, such as a new multi-year agreement with PepsiCo.</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has revealed plans to expand its platform into an 'everything exchange' by introducing tokenized stocks, derivatives, and prediction markets for its U.S. customers in the coming months. This move positions Coinbase to compete more directly with platforms like Robinhood by allowing users to trade traditional assets on the blockchain. The announcement coincides with the SEC's new 'Project Crypto' initiative, which aims to modernize financial regulations to accommodate such innovations. The expansion reflects a broader trend of tokenizing real-world assets, a development supported by the current administration's pro-crypto stance.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have discovered that the potato, a staple starchy vegetable, evolved from a tomato ancestor approximately 9 million years ago through an ancient interbreeding event. A study published in the journal Cell explains that the modern potato inherited a key gene from the ancient tomato that enables the formation of its starchy tubers. This hybridization event combined the tomato's tuber-forming gene with a growth-control gene from a non-tuber-producing wild potato species from Chile. The comprehensive genomic analysis of hundreds of potato species has finally solved the long-standing puzzle of the vegetable's origins.</p>

Trump stated that Epstein had 'stolen' Giuffre and other employees from his Mar-a-Lago club, a remark the family found startling. In a statement, they questioned whether this implied Trump was aware of the criminal activities of Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell at the time. The White House responded that the president was answering a reporter's question and had previously banned Epstein from his club for inappropriate behavior toward female employees.</p>

          <p>An essay in The Atlantic traces the roots of today's attention economy back to the rise of the cheap, daily newspaper in the 19th century. This new form of media created an endless cycle of spectacle and sensation, fundamentally changing how people engaged with information and sparking anxieties about its effect on the public's intellect and discourse. The article draws parallels between 19th-century critics' fears of 'newspaper-ification' and modern concerns about social media and AI. It reflects on the long history of technological change and the persistent worry that each new innovation might be the one that ultimately diminishes human thought.</p>

          <h2>United States Imposes Sanctions on Palestinian Authority and PLO</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. State Department has announced it is imposing sanctions, including visa denials, on officials from the Palestinian Authority (PA) and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The U.S. cited actions that 'undermine the prospects for peace,' such as pursuing cases against Israel in international courts and what it termed 'support for terrorism.' This move is seen by many as a response to the growing international movement to recognize Palestinian statehood, with countries like France, the UK, and Canada recently committing to the step. Palestinian leaders described the sanctions as 'revenge' and proof of U.S. bias in the conflict.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh defended the court's management of a rising number of emergency appeals, particularly from the Trump administration. Speaking at a judicial conference, he argued that as presidents increasingly use executive orders to bypass Congress, it inevitably leads to more legal challenges that require the court's intervention. Kavanaugh acknowledged criticism about the lack of detailed reasoning in some emergency orders but stated the court has improved its process. He emphasized the importance of collegiality among the justices, stating that even in disagreement, they are all 'patriots and good people' thoughtfully engaging with difficult issues.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court intensely questioned the Trump administration's legal authority to impose widespread tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners using an emergency powers law. During arguments, judges probed whether the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which has never before been used for this purpose, grants the president such broad tariff authority. The case, brought by several states and small businesses, is a major test of a key component of the president's economic agenda. The court's decision will likely be appealed to the Supreme Court and could have significant consequences for U.S. trade policy.</p>

          <p>In a rare public appearance, three federal judges detailed the 'daunting' and 'frightening' threats they have received after issuing rulings against the Trump administration. The judges described receiving death threats, being targeted by 'pizza doxxing' in the name of a murdered judge's son, and being 'swatted' at their homes. They linked the rise in harassment to inflammatory rhetoric from political leaders who have called judges 'deranged' and 'corrupt.' The judges urged leaders to tone down personal attacks and called for greater support for the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law.</p>

          <p>During a visit to Jerusalem, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul stated that Israel is in danger of isolating itself internationally and that Germany has a responsibility to prevent this. Describing the humanitarian situation in Gaza as 'beyond imagination,' he urged Israel to allow sufficient aid into the territory to avert mass deaths and to show it is not pursuing a policy of expulsion. The visit comes as the U.S. sends a special envoy to the region and as Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir accused Germany of 'returning to support Nazism' in a social media post.</p>

          <p>Tata Steel has been ordered to pay a £1.5 million fine after a contractor, Justin Day, was crushed to death at its Port Talbot facility in 2019. The court found that after completing his initial work, Mr. Day re-entered an area that had been partially re-energized, leading to the fatal incident when a steel beam was activated. The judge noted that the company's safety systems were not sufficiently adhered to, contributing to the tragedy. The victim's family expressed their devastation and criticized the company for a perceived lack of support following his death.</p>

The project aims to support President Trump's vision of making America a global crypto capital by creating an efficient licensing structure for innovative financial products, such as tokenized assets and 'super apps.'
