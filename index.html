        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's efforts to convince House Republicans from blue states to support a major tax bill have failed, as the 'SALT Caucus' remains opposed due to insufficient increases in state and local tax deductions. The 2017 tax bill capped the deduction at $10,000, disproportionately affecting residents in Democratic-leaning states with higher state and local taxes. The current proposal raises the deduction to $30,000, but this is not enough for some GOP lawmakers from those states. Trump reportedly told the SALT Caucus to 'Let it go' during his visit to Capitol Hill, but the opposition threatens to derail the tax legislation.</p>

          <p>A new book titled 'Original Sin' alleges that former President Joe Biden hid the severity of his son Beau Biden's cancer diagnosis from the public, even as Beau continued to serve as Delaware's attorney general. The authors, Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, claim this demonstrates a pattern of denial and a lack of transparency regarding health issues within the Biden family. The book further suggests that Beau's wife, Hallie Biden, questioned the secrecy surrounding his illness. A Biden spokesman refuted the allegations, asserting that the book fails to prove any wrongdoing or conspiracy on Joe Biden's part. This comes shortly after Joe Biden's aggressive prostate cancer diagnosis was announced.</p>

Democrats have criticized this as a 'pay-to-play' scheme, with concerns raised about foreign influence and potential conflicts of interest.

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has secured trade agreements with the European Union and the United States, demonstrating Britain's ability to engage with its two largest trade partners post-Brexit. However, these deals required concessions and reflect Britain's weakened position in the global market. While the agreement with the EU will generate nearly 9 billion pounds annually by 2040, it only adds 0.2% to Britain's GDP, while Brexit cost the country 5.5% of its GDP. The UK had to allow European trawlers to fish in British waters for 12 years in return for reduced trade barriers for British food entering the single market. The article suggests that Britain is being squeezed between a mercantilist EU and a predatory U.S.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump cautioned House Republicans against making cuts to Medicaid during a closed-door meeting. The warning came as some Republicans seek to reduce the Medicaid program, which provides healthcare coverage to low-income individuals, and add work requirements for eligibility. Critics argue that work requirements would create bureaucratic challenges in verifying and tracking the employment status of millions of people. Medicaid, jointly funded by the federal government and states, covers nearly 80 million Americans.</p>

The legal case, brought forward by a former financial ombudsman, argued that shoppers were charged higher prices due to fees wrongly levied on transactions between 1992 and 2008. Consumers are eligible if they lived in the specified regions for at least three months during that period and purchased goods or services from UK businesses that accepted Mastercard credit cards. The entire settlement is for Â£200m, with Â£100m ringfenced for consumers who have until the end of this year to claim.</p>

          <p>The diagnosis of advanced prostate cancer in former President Joseph Biden has raised questions about the effectiveness of prostate cancer screening and the current guidelines that advise against screening men over 70. Medical experts note that even men who undergo regular screening can develop aggressive cancers between checkups or have cancers that do not elevate PSA levels. The article also discusses the potential harms of over-screening, including unnecessary treatments that can lead to side effects like impotence and incontinence. Medical guidelines recommend that men ages 55 to 69 discuss the risks and benefits of screening with their physicians, and call for ending screening around age 70.</p>

Analysts suggest that the call focused on bilateral economic relations, potentially undermining support for Ukraine and its European allies.

A study from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act led to a 21% reduction in mortality among low-income adults, saving an estimated 27,400 lives between 2010 and 2022. Another study in the New England Journal of Medicine demonstrated that Medicaid beneficiaries who lost prescription drug subsidies were more likely to die, highlighting the importance of medication access.

          <p>The possibility of UK passport holders utilizing e-gates at EU airports this summer remains uncertain due to the impending implementation of the new European Entry/Exit Scheme (EES) in October 2025. While a recent deal between the UK and the EU removes legal barriers for British nationals' e-gate use after the EES introduction, individual countries will ultimately decide. The EU Commission indicates that the EES, which gathers biometric data, will open e-gate access to non-EU citizens, including Brits. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer expressed optimism about the potential for shorter queues for travelers.</p>

He suggests detaching, unplugging, and being kinder to oneself and others as possible solutions.
