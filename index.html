          <p>The FDA has announced a plan to phase out petroleum-based synthetic food dyes from the U.S. food supply by the end of next year, impacting companies like PepsiCo, General Mills, and WK Kellogg. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary cited concerns about the increasing exposure of American children to synthetic chemicals over the past 50 years. The agency is setting a national standard and timeline for the transition to natural alternatives and plans to revoke authorization of synthetic food colorings, including red dye 40, yellow dye 5, and blue dye 1. The FDA suggests using watermelon juice, beet juice, or carrot juice as natural alternatives to petroleum-based dyes.</p>

Oklo co-founder Caroline Cochran expressed excitement about continuing to work with Altman to provide scalable, clean energy to the AI sector.

          <p>Tesla is facing scrutiny as first-quarter results reveal a drop in sales and profits, leading investors to question Elon Musk's dedication to the company amid his involvement with the Trump administration's cost-cutting efforts. Investors are concerned about Musk's role with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and its potential impact on Tesla's performance. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives suggests Musk should step back from government duties to focus on Tesla, as his political activities have alienated some consumers. Tesla's earnings call is highly anticipated for updates on Musk's plans and strategic initiatives, including a cheaper Model Y and a robotaxi service.</p>

The company faces growing competition, especially from Chinese firms, and is vulnerable to auto tariffs. Tesla's shares have dropped in value by roughly half since December, with much of the losses occurring since President Trump took office and Musk began his controversial governmental cost-cutting efforts.</p>

          <p>The US army plans to require a fitness test with identical physical standards for men and women in combat positions, following an order from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to eliminate gender-based fitness requirements. The revamped fitness test will be "sex-neutral" and will likely reduce the number of women qualifying for combat positions. The new standards include deadlifts, push-ups, planks, a two-mile run, and a sprint-drag-carry exercise. Soldiers who fail to meet the new standards twice consecutively may be removed from the army or transferred to non-combat roles.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has a history of ambitious promises and often delivering late, with many of his biggest ideas still in the works. Musk's most famous unfulfilled promise is Tesla's effort to create self-driving software, with Musk initially speaking about self-driving capabilities in 2015, saying autonomous cars would be available within three years. Musk also announced plans for a mass market, roughly $25,000 car in 2020 but offered no specifics about the vehicle at the time. Tesla has said the more-affordable models would start production in the first half of 2025, although Reuters reported exclusively last week that plans for an affordable Tesla, which include a stripped-down version of its best-selling Model Y SUV made in the U.S., would be delayed by months.</p>

The International Monetary Fund's World Economic Outlook cited the escalating trade war and "high levels of policy uncertainty" as factors in its reduced U.S. growth forecast.

The Times corrected the article within 14 hours of publication, and its former editorial page editor apologized to Palin.
