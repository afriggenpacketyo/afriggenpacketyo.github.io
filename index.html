          <p>A massive explosion and fire at the Shaid Rajaei port in southern Iran, reportedly linked to missile propellant chemicals, resulted in at least 40 deaths and around 1,000 injuries.

          <p>A senior figure from South Africa's ruling ANC party has defended his country's sovereignty amid growing tensions with the US over race relations and a new land law. The ANC National Chair Gwede Mantashe stated that South Africa is not a province of the United States and its sovereignty will be defended, criticizing South Africans who have called on Trump to "punish" the country. The tensions stem from the expropriation law which allows the government to seize land without compensation in certain circumstances, and Trump's order which opened the door for Afrikaners to be admitted to the US as refugees, describing them as "victims of unjust racial discrimination".</p>

          <p>Eighty years after its liberation, survivors and families gathered at Bergen Belsen to remember the horrors of the Nazi concentration camp. The camp, notorious for its appalling conditions and high death toll, witnessed unimaginable suffering and cruelty.

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of a Venezuelan couple, who are legally in the U.S. under Temporary Protected Status (TPS), after they were accused of gang membership. Judge David Briones criticized the government's lack of evidence, accusing them of declaring the couple gang members "without providing this Court with a single piece of meaningful evidence." The couple had fled Venezuela and entered the U.S. in 2022 and were granted TPS status in 2024, which was later withdrawn due to the gang allegations.</p>

Yunice Abbas, one of the accused, confessed that he didn't realize who Kardashian was until after the heist.

          <p>President Donald Trump's approval rating is declining as he approaches his first 100 days in office, with polls indicating growing skepticism about his administration's actions. Recent surveys show that a majority of Americans disapprove of Trump's handling of the presidency. His approval ratings, hovering between 39% and 45%, are the lowest for any newly elected president at this point in their term in more than seven decades.

          <p>President Trump's recent meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has provided a glimmer of hope for Ukrainians concerned about the United States pushing for a peace plan that favors Russia. Trump questioned why President Putin would continue the war if the US is trying to broker peace. The meeting and Trump's subsequent comments have been viewed as a potential shift in his approach to the conflict and a possible sign that he may not force Ukraine into a lopsided peace agreement.</p>
