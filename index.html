He also failed to disclose over $100,000 in income from the AIDS Healthcare Foundation. De León's spokesperson stated the matter centers on disclosure, not personal gain, and that the decisions in question provided homeless housing and health services.</p>

            <p>The Tren de Aragua, a notorious gang, originated within the Tocorón prison in Venezuela, gaining international attention after being mentioned in President Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric. Operating from within the prison walls, the gang engaged in kidnappings, extortion, and other crimes, expanding its influence throughout Venezuela and into neighboring countries. As Venezuela's economy collapsed, the gang exploited the situation, recruiting members and controlling resources within the prison. The gang's activities have led to increased fear and migration from Venezuela, with victims of extortion and violence seeking refuge in other countries.</p>

            <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a temporary "Easter truce" in Ukraine, effective from 6 p.m. Saturday to midnight Sunday, ordering a halt to all fighting. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy criticized the announcement, calling it "Putin's next attempt to play with people's lives," citing ongoing Russian drone strikes. Despite the ceasefire announcement, fighting continued in the Kursk and Belgorod regions, and both sides exchanged accusations of violating the truce. The announcement followed frustrations from the Trump administration regarding the pace of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court temporarily halted the deportations of Venezuelans held in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, directing the Trump administration to cease removals pending further order. The court's decision followed an emergency appeal from the ACLU, arguing that immigration authorities were attempting to restart deportations under the wartime law without providing detainees a chance to argue their case in court. The ACLU cited concerns about the brutal conditions in El Salvador's prisons, where other Venezuelans had been sent under the Act. The Trump administration defended its actions, claiming the detainees were "foreign terrorists."</p>

While some locals welcome the job opportunities, others worry about the impact on the area's character and rising costs of living. The development has also faced scrutiny over environmental issues, including a fine for water pollution violations by The Boring Company.

            <p>Property owners affected by the January wildfires in California are suing major insurance companies, including State Farm, alleging antitrust violations and unfair competition. The lawsuits claim insurers conspired to force homeowners into the California FAIR Plan, which provides limited coverage at higher premiums. The FAIR Plan has become overwhelmed due to insurers canceling policies in fire-risk zones, leading to concerns about underinsurance. The plaintiffs are seeking three times the damages sustained, arguing the insurers engaged in cartel-like behavior. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A woman in Spain, identified as Lina, was killed by her ex-partner despite reporting him to the police and her case being assessed by VioGén, a digital tool that assesses the risk of domestic violence. Lina was deemed at "medium" risk, but the algorithm failed to accurately predict the threat she faced, raising questions about the effectiveness of VioGén and its influence on court decisions regarding restraining orders. Critics suggest police are over-relying on the algorithm, potentially abdicating decision-making about women's safety.

            <p>The US Supreme Court has ordered the Trump administration to pause the deportation of a group of alleged Venezuelan gang members. The Venezuelans are detained in Texas and were due to be deported under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, which gives the president power to detain and deport natives or citizens of "enemy" nations without usual processes. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued to stop the removal of the men, saying they had not been able to contest their cases in court. The White House has called challenges to using the law for mass deportations "meritless litigation".</p>
