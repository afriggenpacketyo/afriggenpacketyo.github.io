        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced a new 10-year industrial strategy aimed at boosting economic growth by lowering energy costs for businesses and improving workers' skills. The plan includes exempting over 7,000 UK businesses from some green energy levies, potentially cutting their energy bills by up to 25%. Other measures include investing an extra £1.2 billion annually in skills training, attracting global talent through visa reforms, streamlining planning processes, and increasing research and development spending, particularly in sectors like advanced manufacturing, clean energy, and digital technologies. While some business groups welcomed the strategy, others, like the hospitality sector, expressed disappointment at being excluded from the plan. Optimism in the sector may depend on whether these efforts will truly boost the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, President Donald Trump has called on "everyone" to keep oil prices down, warning that high prices would play "into the hands of the enemy." Trump also urged the Department of Energy to increase domestic drilling. His message followed U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and heightened concerns about potential disruptions to Middle East energy supplies, though the oil market has remained relatively stable. While U.S. crude oil prices decreased slightly after Trump's post, it remains to be seen if his influence will have a lasting effect on the global market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman indicated she would favor an interest rate cut at the next policy meeting in July if inflation pressures remain contained. Bowman's remarks align with fellow Governor Christopher Waller, who also suggested the Fed could consider cutting rates in July. Bowman believes that President Trump's tariffs are likely to have a temporary and muted impact on prices, paving the way for lower rates to sustain a healthy labor market. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is scheduled to meet July 29-30, with futures market pricing currently assigning a 23% probability to a rate cut at that meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has signaled support for the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, framing the action as a demonstration of Washington's resolve to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya emphasized the importance of de-escalating the situation and expressed hope for a resumption of dialogue between the United States and Iran. Japan, which relies heavily on the Middle East for crude oil, continues to monitor the impact of the conflict on its energy supply, particularly concerning potential closures of the Strait of Hormuz. The government is also assessing the legal basis of the U.S. military attacks in terms of international law.</p>

          <p>A severe heat wave is forecast to impact a large portion of the eastern United States, bringing several days of record-high temperatures and posing a significant risk to those without adequate cooling or hydration. The National Weather Service has issued extreme heat alerts affecting over 150 million Americans, with heat indices expected to reach triple digits in many areas. Meteorologists attribute the heat wave to a heat dome, which traps heat and humidity. Residents are urged to stay indoors, use air conditioning, and stay hydrated to avoid heat-related illnesses, as climate change is making extreme temperatures and heat waves more frequent and longer-lasting.</p>

          <p>Details are emerging about the U.S. military operation, codenamed Midnight Hammer, which targeted three Iranian nuclear facilities using precision-guided weapons, including GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators. Initial assessments indicate "extremely severe damage and destruction" at all three sites, with satellite images showing craters around the Fordo nuclear site. While Iran has condemned the strikes as a "barbaric violation" of international law, the potential for retaliation remains uncertain, with analysts speculating about possible attacks on American military bases or a blockade of the Strait of Hormuz. The international community is urging de-escalation and a return to negotiations, while the conflict between Iran and Israel continues.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Embassy in Qatar has advised American citizens to shelter in place until further notice following recent attacks on Iran and subsequent threats against U.S. interests. This advisory, issued "out of an abundance of caution," comes after the State Department issued a worldwide caution for U.S. travelers due to potential demonstrations against U.S. citizens and interests abroad. Iran has vowed to retaliate after American airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites, prompting concerns about the safety of the approximately 40,000 U.S. troops stationed across the Middle East.

The summit, designed to flatter Trump with increased defense spending commitments, faces uncertainty due to Middle East tensions and disagreements over spending targets. Europe's leaders aim to reassure Trump of their commitment to security, but Trump's unpredictable approach and demands for increased spending have strained relations. The summit's success hinges on navigating these challenges and maintaining U.S. support for the alliance.</p>

          <p>Major U.S. health insurers, including UnitedHealthcare and Kaiser Permanente, have announced commitments to streamline the prior authorization process, aiming to expedite patient care. The initiative involves creating a standardized online system for submitting prior authorization requests, reducing the number of claims subject to prior authorization, and improving response times. These changes are scheduled to take effect in 2026 and 2027 and could benefit over 250 million Americans. While industry leaders tout the changes as a step in the right direction, the true impact will depend on the experiences of patients and physicians.</p>

          <p>Analysts believe that China is unlikely to directly intervene following U.S. airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, despite the strategic importance of the region. Instead, Beijing is expected to focus on diplomatic support for Tehran as the U.S. becomes more involved in the Israel-Iran conflict. The strikes have heightened tensions in the Middle East, and Iran has approved plans to close the Strait of Hormuz, potentially impacting global energy markets. China's approach will likely prioritize its own interests and stability in the region.</p>
