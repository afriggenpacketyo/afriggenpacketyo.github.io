          <p>Exit polls in Poland's presidential election suggest a close race between conservative historian Karol Nawrocki and Warsaw's liberal mayor, Rafal Trzaskowski. Initial exit polls gave Trzaskowski a narrow lead, but a second poll indicated Nawrocki ahead, leading both candidates to claim potential victory. The official result is expected on Monday morning, with the outcome potentially impacting Poland's relationship with the EU and domestic policies. The president's role is largely ceremonial but includes veto power over legislation, making the election significant for the country's political direction.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to announce a major defense review, including plans to build up to 12 new attack submarines. These conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered submarines will replace the current fleet from the late 2030s. The review also commits £15 billion to the nuclear warhead program, and aims to move the armed forces to "warfighting readiness" amid growing global threats. The new submarines will support 30,000 jobs into the 2030s, along with apprenticeships and graduate roles, as the UK aims to bolster its defense capabilities and deter Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>Pamela Hemphill, a former Trump supporter, is refusing and returning her pardon for her involvement in the January 6 Capitol riot. Hemphill, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge, believes the pardons contribute to a false narrative and undermine Americans' views of the federal government. She sought assistance from Senator James Risch to formally refuse the pardon, stating that she couldn't live with herself accepting it knowing she was guilty. Her actions contrast with other Jan. 6 defendants who sought copies of their pardons, and she anticipates potential backlash from Trump.</p>
