            <p>The United States is experiencing a significant measles outbreak in 2025, with cases reaching levels not seen since 2019.

            <p>The Trump administration announced new fees on Chinese-built vessels entering U.S. ports, responding to findings that China's shipbuilding practices unfairly disadvantage U.S. companies. The fees, which will increase incrementally over several years, aim to address Chinese dominance in the shipbuilding industry. China has condemned the move as protectionist, while the World Shipping Council expressed concerns about potential harm to U.S. consumers and businesses. The policy includes provisions for remissions if vessel owners order U.S.-built ships, aiming to incentivize domestic shipbuilding.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The Trump administration is considering revoking Harvard University's tax-exempt status, sparking debate over the criteria for educational institutions' exemptions. The administration may be using the precedent of Bob Jones University v. United States, which held that tax-exempt organizations must not act contrary to settled public policy. Critics argue that this approach could lead to political reprisals and infringe on free association and religious liberty. Conservatives should be wary of expanding administrative authority in this domain, as it could lead to future administrations targeting organizations based on differing political views.</p>

The government states the program is to euthanize koalas suffering from burns and starvation following a bushfire that destroyed their food source. However, critics argue that habitat loss due to logging and development are the underlying issues. Experts suggest that aerial culling is an indiscriminate method and that rescue efforts should be prioritized when feasible, but the government claims that rescue operations are not safe or practical in the remote, fire-affected area.</p>

            <h2>FDA Considers Outsourcing Routine Food Safety Inspections to States</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-18 11:55:23 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is reportedly considering plans to shift the responsibility for routine food safety inspections to state and local authorities. This move could free up FDA resources to focus on higher-priority and foreign inspections. While the FDA denies suspending routine inspections, officials indicate that plans are underway to potentially outsource this oversight to states. The plan is similar to the FDA's Grade A Milk Safety Program, where states fund the majority of oversight work themselves and have agreements with the agency to standardize how the industry is regulated.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has released thousands of pages of classified documents related to the 1968 assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy. The move is supported by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who believes there may have been a second gunman involved. The released files are available online and will be followed by additional documents discovered in CIA and FBI warehouses. The release is part of Trump's pledge to declassify records related to the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.</p>

Patients are urged to check their medication and contact their GP, pharmacist, or NHS 111 if they have the wrongly-labeled product.

            <p>Nintendo has announced that retail preorders for the Nintendo Switch 2 gaming system will begin on April 24, starting at $449.99. The preorder date was initially delayed due to the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs on electronics manufactured in Asia. Nintendo manufactures their products in China and Vietnam, which are subject to tariff rates of 145% and 10%, respectively. Accessories for the Nintendo Switch 2 will experience price adjustments, and other future changes in costs are possible for any Nintendo product.</p>

However, scientists caution that the detection is not definitive and that other chemicals could be responsible for the signal.
