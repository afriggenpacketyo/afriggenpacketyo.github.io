          <p>Tech billionaire Elon Musk has announced the creation of the "America Party," positioning it as an alternative to the established Republican and Democratic parties. The announcement follows a public falling out with President Donald Trump, under whom Musk briefly served in an efficiency-focused government role. While Musk cited a poll on his social media platform X as the impetus, it remains unclear if the party has been officially registered with federal election authorities or who its leaders will be. The move marks a significant political turn for Musk, who previously spent heavily to support Trump's 2024 campaign.</p>

          <p>An Alvarado, Texas police officer was shot in the neck and hospitalized after responding to a call at an ICE detention facility on July 4th. The officer, who was later released, was reportedly lured to the scene with fireworks before multiple armed suspects opened fire. Authorities have taken eight people into custody, some of whom were wearing body armor, following a coordinated attack that also involved vandalism. The Justice Department is monitoring the situation, describing it as an assault on federal property and vowing a strong response.</p>

          <p>Central Texas has been struck by catastrophic flash floods, resulting in what officials are calling a "mass casualty event" with at least 32 fatalities, including 14 children. The Guadalupe River rose an unprecedented 26 feet in 45 minutes, catching communities and a children's summer camp by surprise. Over two dozen people, primarily from Camp Mystic, remain missing, prompting extensive air and ground search and rescue operations that have saved hundreds. Governor Greg Abbott has signed a federal disaster declaration as authorities grapple with the aftermath of the unpredicted and ferocious deluge.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security announced the deportation of eight individuals to South Sudan, describing them as having extensive and violent criminal records. The action occurred on July 4th after the Supreme Court overturned lower court rulings that had blocked the removals, which DHS stated had put ICE officers at risk. The deported men, nationals of Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Burma, and Vietnam, had convictions for severe crimes including murder, sexual assault, and kidnapping. DHS framed the successful deportation as a victory for the rule of law and the safety of American communities.</p>

          <p>Lifeguards in Newport Beach, California, performed 350 rescues on July 4th as swimmers were caught in unexpectedly dangerous surf and strong rip currents. One notable incident involved a "monster rip current" that pulled over a dozen people far from shore, requiring a significant rescue effort captured on video. The National Weather Service had issued warnings for elevated surf and hazardous swimming conditions for much of Southern California's coastline through the holiday weekend. Officials cautioned that the powerful currents can easily pull people out to sea and capsize small boats near the shore.</p>

          <p>This article examines two distinct exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for dividend-focused investors: the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG) and the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD). VIG is tailored for growth investors, focusing on companies with a long history of increasing dividends, offering a lower current yield but strong capital appreciation potential. In contrast, SCHD targets investors seeking higher immediate income, using a quality-based screening process to select stocks, resulting in a more generous yield. The analysis suggests both are strong options depending on an investor's time horizon and income needs. (not investment advice)</p>

This potential shift in tactics represents a significant test for the philosophy championed by coach Brendon McCullum.

Traveling incognito to gather material for "Life on the Mississippi," Twain found a river landscape dramatically altered by time and the rise of railroads, which were eclipsing the steamboat era he cherished. Despite the changes and the squalor of the boats, being back in a pilot house evoked a powerful sense of nostalgia and freedom.

          <p>Hamas has reportedly issued a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-mediated proposal for a 60-day ceasefire in its war with Israel. While details are still being negotiated, the group stated it is prepared to enter talks on implementing the framework. President Trump expressed optimism about the development, suggesting a deal could be reached within the next week. Israel is expected to send a delegation to Qatar for further discussions, though it has not yet fully committed to the terms, and Prime Minister Netanyahu is scheduled to meet with Trump in Washington.</p>

          <p>Following a severe heatwave, two large wildfires are burning in the eastern German states of Saxony and Thuringia, requiring the deployment of around 1,000 emergency personnel. The fire in the Gohrischheide region, on the border of Saxony and Brandenburg, remains particularly challenging, affecting an estimated 1,000 hectares. While the situation in Thuringia has reportedly stabilized, crews continue to fight the blaze in Saxony. These fires are among several recent climate and safety-related incidents in Germany, including a boating accident and protests in eastern Germany.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is facing backlash from Jewish groups after using the antisemitic term "Shylock" during a rally in Iowa. While celebrating his budget bill, Trump referred to some bankers as "Shylocks," a term derived from a villainous Jewish moneylender in Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice." The president later claimed he was unaware of the term's offensive connotations. The Anti-Defamation League called the remark "very troubling and irresponsible," stating it evokes centuries-old stereotypes about Jewish people and greed, which is considered dangerous and deeply offensive.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as the most important event in world history since the birth of Christ, as it introduced the new concept of a "citizen." He emphasized that the nation's founding was a messy, violent civil war, and understanding this complexity makes the emergence of its ideals even more inspiring. Burns argued that patriotism requires engaging with the nation's flaws, like slavery, to have a fuller, more powerful understanding of its story. He believes history is the best teacher for navigating current divisions, reminding us that the U.S. has always been a work in progress.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An inquiry to ChatGPT about tax fairness revealed that while the wealthiest Americans pay a similar or higher federal income tax rate than the middle class, the system fundamentally favors wealth over work. Billionaires benefit from lower tax rates on capital gains and can use strategies like "buy-borrow-die," where they live off tax-free loans secured against their appreciating assets. This allows wealth to grow largely untaxed, a privilege not available to wage earners whose income is taxed immediately. The AI concluded the core issue is not the tax rates themselves, but how different forms of income are treated. (not investment advice)</p>

Chávez Jr. is the son of Julio César Chávez, a boxing legend and national hero in Mexico. The allegations have cast a shadow over the revered family name in a city where open discussion of the cartel has become dangerous due to recent internal feuds.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is facing criticism for sending an email that critics call misleading political propaganda. The email claimed President Trump's new spending bill "eliminates federal income taxes on social security benefits for most beneficiaries." However, the bill does not eliminate the tax but instead provides a temporary, modest tax deduction for seniors that phases out for higher earners. Former SSA officials and Democratic lawmakers have condemned the communication as a "lie" and an unprecedented, unconscionable use of a historically apolitical agency for partisan purposes.

          <p>One year after a sweeping election victory, the UK Labour party is grappling with significant voter disillusionment, as revealed by a focus group of its 2024 voters in Kent. Participants expressed disappointment over a perceived lack of progress, particularly on immigration, and felt the party had not been transparent about its plans. Recent policy U-turns have reinforced a view that the government lacks direction, with some voters now considering switching their support to the surging Reform UK party. While some believe the government needs more time, the sentiment reflects the party's precarious position in national polls.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent threats of retribution against political opponents, including Elon Musk, a New York mayoral candidate, and a former cabinet secretary, represent a significant escalation in his assault on democratic norms. In the past week, Trump has suggested revoking Musk's citizenship, arresting prospective NYC mayor Zohran Mamdani, and investigating former DHS head Alejandro Mayorkas. Pro-democracy groups warn that these actions are designed to chill free speech and create a climate of fear. The threats make it clear that anyone who criticizes the president risks being targeted by the state, fundamentally attacking the American concept of freedom.</p>

Growing up in a home with alcoholism and a tumultuous parental relationship made her want to avoid repeating those cycles for her own family. Theron also recognized her tendency to "lose herself" in relationships, often placating narcissistic partners rather than engaging in healthy conflict. Relationship experts praise her choice as a sign of strength and alignment, reflecting a modern reality where partnership is a preference, not a necessity for women.</p>
