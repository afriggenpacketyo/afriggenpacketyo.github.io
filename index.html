          <p>The UN secretary-general is urging an independent investigation into the deaths and injuries of Palestinians near a Gaza aid distribution center, amidst conflicting reports about whether Israeli forces opened fire. Witnesses claim they were shot at while waiting for food, while the Israeli military denies targeting civilians and accuses Hamas of spreading rumors. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, backed by the US and Israel, refuted the reports of an attack near its facility, further complicating the situation. The UN human rights chief criticized the dehumanizing nature of aid delivery in Gaza, emphasizing the desperation of civilians and the disregard for their well-being. Optimism surrounding the situation remains low given the conflicting reports and ongoing investigation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's new official portrait has been unveiled and posted to the White House website, depicting him in a blue suit, white shirt, and red tie. The portrait's release coincides with Trump's termination of Kim Sajet, the director of the National Portrait Gallery, citing her support for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Sajet's firing and the White House's criticism of the gallery's caption for Trump's photo, which references his impeachments, suggest a focus on loyalty and ideological alignment within the administration. The unveiling of the portrait and the controversy surrounding Sajet's firing underscore the administration's stance on DEI and its approach to historical representation.</p>

          <p>The UK government is threatening to sue Roman Abramovich, the former owner of Chelsea Football Club, to ensure that the Â£2.5 billion from the club's sale is directed to Ukrainian humanitarian aid. The funds have been frozen in a UK bank account since the sale, following sanctions imposed on Abramovich after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. A disagreement exists between the UK government and Abramovich's lawyers regarding the allocation of the funds, with Abramovich initially wanting the money to benefit all victims of the war, including those in Russia. The UK government insists the funds should be used solely for humanitarian efforts within Ukraine.</p>

          <p>China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly shrank in May, marking its worst drop since 2022, according to a private survey. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing purchasing managers' index fell below 50, indicating contraction for the first time since September of last year. The decline was driven by a decrease in foreign demand, with new export orders falling to their lowest level since July 2023, and the job market also experienced contraction. These results suggest increasing economic headwinds and uncertainty in the external trade environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dodgers shortstop Mookie Betts is expected to return to the lineup soon after recovering from a fractured toe, while pitcher Tyler Glasnow is experiencing body discomfort after throwing a bullpen session, delaying his return from shoulder inflammation. Glasnow's setback is not surprising given his injury history, but the Dodgers are hopeful he will recover soon. Blake Snell is making progress in his throwing progression, and Shohei Ohtani remains on track to return after the All-Star break. The Dodgers anticipate bullpen reinforcements with the potential activation of Michael Kopech and Kirby Yates.</p>
