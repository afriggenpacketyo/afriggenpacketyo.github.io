          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported conducting a series of airstrikes targeting "dozens" of military sites in Iran, including an inactive nuclear reactor located in the Arak area. According to the IDF, the Arak heavy water reactor was struck after an evacuation order was issued for the surrounding area, with the strike aiming to disable the reactor's ability to produce plutonium. The IDF also claimed to have targeted a "nuclear weapons development" site near Natanz, alleging it contained specialized equipment used to advance nuclear weapons development. These actions are part of a broader conflict between Israel and Iran. </p>

          <p>An Iranian missile directly struck Israel's main southern hospital in Beer Sheba, causing "extensive damage" and injuries, as President Trump considers direct U.S. involvement in the conflict. Separate Iranian strikes also hit a high-rise in Tel Aviv and other locations in central Israel, with one Tel Aviv hospital reporting 16 wounded individuals, including three with serious injuries. The Soroka Medical Center in Beer Sheba suffered significant damage, prompting a request for people not to seek treatment there; however, the affected part of the hospital had been evacuated prior to the strike. In response, Israel attacked Iran's Arak heavy water reactor, with Iranian state television reporting no radiation danger, adding that the facility had been evacuated and there was no damage to civilian areas. </p>

          <p>Nippon Steel Corp.'s top executive Eiji Hashimoto expressed confidence that the U.S. government's role in its $14.1 billion buyout of U.S. Steel will not hinder the U.S. unit's business operations. Hashimoto highlighted the $11 billion investment in U.S. Steel operations and a golden share issued to the U.S. government as rational conditions, emphasizing that restricting their activities would prevent the revival of U.S. Steel. Under the national security agreement, a U.S. president or designated official can approve management decisions, including facility closures; Hashimoto believes this deal will benefit both companies and help revive the U.S. steel industry. Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel makes it the world's fourth-largest steelmaker, increasing its global capacity and aiming for expansion in overseas markets.</p>

          <p>Despite China's repeated condemnations of Israel's recent attacks on Iran, Israel's ambassador to Beijing, Eli Belotserkovsky, stated that Israel wishes to "continue talking" with China. Belotserkovsky did not dismiss the possibility of China acting as a mediator in the conflict, emphasizing the importance of open communication channels between the two countries. He acknowledged that Israel's primary concern is its ongoing military operation but reiterated that relations with China are "very important". The ambassador's remarks suggest that Israel is seeking to maintain diplomatic ties with China even amid disagreements over the conflict with Iran.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have reconstructed remarkable frescoes from thousands of fragments of 2,000-year-old wall plaster discovered in Central London in 2021. The frescoes, originating from at least 20 walls of a luxurious Roman villa, feature detailed paintings of musical instruments, birds, flowers, and fruit. The artwork provides insights into the affluence of the area, described as the "Beverly Hills of Roman London," and suggests the villa may have been home to a wealthy family or a hotel for rich travelers. The team hopes to find the missing piece with the artist's name, as they believe the frescoes were created by skilled painters who traveled the Roman empire.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has resumed processing student visa applications but now requires foreign applicants to grant access to their social media accounts for review. Consular officers will monitor posts and messages for content deemed hostile to the United States, its government, culture, or founding principles, potentially rejecting applicants who refuse to make their accounts public. The decision follows a temporary suspension of visa interviews and aims to enhance screening processes. Critics argue that the policy evokes Cold War-era ideological vetting and may chill legitimate political speech; however, the State Department maintains that the measure will ensure proper screening of individuals attempting to enter the country.</p>

          <p>New Zealand has halted NZ$18.2 million in funding to the Cook Islands due to concerns over wide-ranging deals the Cook Islands made with China covering infrastructure, tourism, technology, and deep-sea mineral exploration. Wellington stated that the funding relies on a high-trust bilateral relationship and expressed being blindsided by the deals struck in February. The Cook Islands responded by committing to address the issue urgently, acknowledging the value of New Zealand's assistance; this move comes as New Zealand's Prime Minister visits China. The deals with the Cook Islands are part of China's broader campaign to engage with strategic Pacific nations, though Cook Islands' Prime Minister has reassured neighbors that these deals do not replace longstanding relationships.</p>

He points to historical examples like Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya to illustrate the enduring troubles and miseries that often follow regime destruction. While acknowledging the benefits of removing an international threat and disrupting terrorist activities, Kettle cautions that a defeated Iran could lead to civic instability and prolonged conflict. He emphasizes that history suggests regime change for revolutionary regimes is particularly messy, and the outcome is uncertain.</p>

          <p>The Buss family has agreed to sell a controlling interest in the Los Angeles Lakers to Mark Walter, the owner of the L.A. Dodgers, at an estimated valuation of $10 billion.

He warned that the U.S. goods deficit would persist as long as export controls, visa denials, and barriers to Chinese firms remain in place. Xie emphasized China's willingness to buy more from America but noted restrictions on exports of competitive products like semiconductors and barriers to Chinese investors, buyers, tourists, and students. The ambassador's remarks come as a recently agreed framework to ease trade tensions hangs in limbo.</p>

          <p>Dongchoon Circus Troupe, South Koreaâ€™s last circus and the country's oldest, is celebrating its centennial anniversary. Founded in 1925, Dongchoon once thrived during the golden age of circuses in South Korea, but later faced declining audiences due to the rise of television, movies, and other forms of entertainment. Today, Dongchoon continues to perform acrobatic shows, drawing hundreds of spectators on weekdays and up to 2,000 on weekends, but faces challenges in finding local talent and maintaining its legacy. The circus hopes to build a circus school to nurture South Korean circus artists and ensure its survival for another 100 years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With U.S. President Donald Trump imposing tariffs, businesses are increasingly employing "tariff engineering" to legally reduce their duty liabilities. This practice involves modifying an item's materials, dimensions, or composition to fit into a different harmonized system code with lower tariff rates. Examples include manufacturers bundling steel and aluminum, or hoodie makers switching to cotton to save on duty costs. The practice can be traced back to 1882, and has been ruled legal as long as goods are honestly exposed to customs officers; however, some sectors face challenges due to extensive regulations and the need for certifications and validation.</p>
