          <h2>Hamas Announces Release of US-Israeli Hostage as Part of Ceasefire Efforts</h2>

          <p>Hamas has stated it will release US-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander, a 21-year-old soldier, as a goodwill gesture in ongoing negotiations for a Gaza ceasefire. Alexander was captured during the October 7 attack and is the last living US citizen hostage held in Gaza. This move comes before President Trump's planned visit to the Middle East, with hopes it will lead to further negotiations for the release of remaining hostages. The article notes that Hamas seeks a final agreement to end the war, a condition previously rejected by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Optimism surrounding this news is tempered by the complexities of the ongoing conflict and the uncertain future of negotiations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump implored Ukraine to engage in direct talks with Russia, diverging from a European plan that insisted on a cease-fire first. This stance undercuts efforts by France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Poland, who had set a Monday deadline for Russia to accept a 30-day cease-fire or face additional sanctions. Trump's call for immediate talks in Turkey contrasts with Zelensky's initial insistence on a halt in fighting, adding complexity to diplomatic efforts. The article highlights the Trump administration's alignment with Russia on a UN vote related to the war and its resumption of broader diplomatic ties with Moscow. The situation remains fluid, with European leaders supporting Zelensky's demand for a cease-fire before talks can begin.</p>

          <p>The first group of White South Africans, known as Afrikaners, who were granted refugee status by the U.S., departed from Johannesburg en route to Washington, D.C., and Texas.

The article highlights a case in Oklahoma where a school district allegedly placed students with disabilities in segregated classrooms, violating IDEA.

          <p>Democrats are attempting to tap into parents' anxieties by linking rising prices of baby gear and the spread of vaccine misinformation to President Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The article explores whether Democrats can persuade voters that the White House is making their lives harder, particularly concerning issues like measles outbreaks and the safety of baby products. While Republicans have been successful in mobilizing parents in the past, Democrats see an opening to channel parents' anger and fears by addressing issues such as vaccine hesitancy and rising costs.</p>
