            <p>China is retaliating against U.S. tariffs by targeting the American services sector and implementing non-tariff measures. These actions include widening export controls on rare-earth minerals and initiating antitrust probes into American companies like DuPont and Google. Beijing is also reportedly urging Chinese airlines to halt further deliveries of Boeing jets, escalating tensions in the trade war. Wendy Cutler of the Asia Society Policy Institute notes that the decoupling of the two economies is accelerating due to these restrictions. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom announced that the state will file a lawsuit challenging President Trump's authority to impose sweeping tariffs. The lawsuit argues that enacting such tariffs requires congressional approval and that the state will be disproportionately impacted. California is the first U.S. state to sue the Trump administration over tariffs, seeking to block the tariffs immediately. The move follows rapidly changing tariff plans by the Trump administration.</p>

            <p>A bereaved mother, Patty Morin, shared her story at the White House, highlighting the impact of violent crime and prompting a debate on immigration policy. Her daughter's murder was used to support the Trump administration's policy of mass deportations, drawing a direct connection between crime and immigration. However, the administration's stance on deportations, including the case of Kimar Albrega Garcia, has faced criticism for disregarding due process and defying court orders.</p>

            <p>Clayton Kershaw made his first rehab start in triple-A Oklahoma City, throwing three scoreless innings as he recovers from offseason surgery. The Dodgers pitcher is working his way back from left-knee and left-foot surgery, with his return expected in mid-to-late May. Manager Dave Roberts said that Kershaw's progress is more about how he feels than arm health, noting that the training staff reports the toe is in good shape.

            <p>U.S. consumers are reportedly "panic-buying" Korean beauty products due to concerns about potential tariffs imposed by President Trump. Retailers specializing in Korean skincare are seeing increased demand as consumers anticipate higher prices.

Michelle Ranavat, CEO of Ranavat, says the cosmetic industry relies on a "pretty complex ecosystem," and tariffs create uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

Assault rifles and pistols arrived in Haiti stashed in cardboard boxes on a cargo ship from Florida. The investigation highlights how the US is a "supermarket" feeding an arms race among gangs that have brought chaos to the Caribbean island nation. The UN says that US searches of containers heading to Haiti have increased, but the vast majority are not inspected.</p>
