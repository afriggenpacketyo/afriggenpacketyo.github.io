          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has conveyed to U.S. President Donald Trump his desire for 'productive' discussions regarding U.S. tariffs. With a parliamentary election looming and his approval ratings at record lows following a series of slush fund scandals, Ishiba dismissed his agriculture minister Wednesday after an off-the-cuff remark about gifted rice angered a public that is already questioning the Japanese leader's handling of soaring prices. Ishiba hopes to mitigate potential negative repercussions for his administration and prevent emboldening the opposition. The discussions aim to address trade tensions between the two countries. </p>

          <p>Ximena Arias Cristobal, a Georgia teenager detained by ICE following a mistaken traffic stop, has been released from immigration custody after an immigration judge granted her bond. The 19-year-old, who came to the U.S. from Mexico when she was four, had been held by ICE after local police stopped her for an improper turn. Despite her release from detention, Arias Cristobal still faces deportation proceedings. Community members and a Republican lawmaker have expressed support for her release, citing her lack of a criminal record.</p>
