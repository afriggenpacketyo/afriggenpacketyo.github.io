          <p>A U.S. federal judge has accused the Trump administration of attempting to circumvent legal protections for individuals fleeing persecution by deporting them to third countries like Ghana. The case involves African migrants who hold U.S. court orders preventing their removal to their home countries due to fears of torture, but were instead sent to Ghana, which now plans to return them to their nations of origin. Judge Tanya Chutkan questioned whether the U.S. government knew this would happen, describing the move as a potential "end-run" around its legal obligations. The administration denies any violation of immigration law, citing a recent Supreme Court order on third-country removals.</p>

          <p>Federal investigators report that the suspect in the fatal shooting of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, Tyler Robinson, had an apparent obsession with him based on his digital footprint. Evidence suggests Robinson was tracking Kirk's public appearances and had become increasingly political, with DNA from the crime scene also linked to him. The 22-year-old suspect was arrested after his father recognized him in photos released by authorities and persuaded him to surrender. The investigation continues to assess the suspect's motives and determine if a larger network was involved in the assassination.</p>

          <p>Financial analysts are reporting positive early signs for Apple's new iPhone 17 lineup, with pre-order lead times tracking modestly ahead of last year's models. Longer lead times, which measure the wait between ordering and delivery, typically suggest strong consumer demand, particularly for the Pro versions. In China, Apple's second-largest market, the less expensive base model has seen significant interest, potentially driven by a price cut and government subsidies. These trends are being closely watched by investors as an indicator of the company's performance in the upcoming fiscal quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prosecutors in Utah are preparing to file formal charges against Tyler James Robinson, the suspect in the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk. The charges, particularly one of aggravated murder, will determine if the state can seek the death penalty, a course of action publicly supported by Utah Governor Spencer Cox. For a death penalty case, prosecutors must prove an aggravating factor, such as creating a "grave risk" to bystanders, which legal experts suggest is a plausible argument given the context of the shooting. Robinson is currently being held without bail as the investigation continues.</p>

          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials have established a framework for a deal concerning the ownership of the social media app TikTok, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The agreement, which follows extended negotiations in Spain, aims to resolve national security concerns raised by the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance. President Trump is expected to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping to finalize the commercial terms, which have reportedly been agreed upon by the private parties involved. This development could prevent a potential ban of the popular app in the United States.</p>

          <p>President Trump has advocated for publicly traded companies to report their earnings every six months instead of the current quarterly requirement. He argued that a semiannual system would save money and encourage corporate managers to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term profits. However, many financial experts and investor advocates expressed concern, warning that less frequent disclosures could reduce transparency and increase market volatility. Critics also suggest it could create more opportunities for accounting fraud, arguing that greater transparency is ultimately more beneficial for capital markets.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) indicates that renewable sources like onshore wind and utility-scale solar are the cheapest forms of energy to produce, even without government subsidies. The report by investment bank Lazard shows these renewables are more cost-effective than fossil fuels like coal and natural gas, as well as nuclear power. While the initial capital investment for renewables is high, their operational costs are very low. Experts caution that LCOE doesn't capture the full picture, as factors like tax incentives, tariffs, and the need for backup power sources also influence the overall cost.</p>

          <p>Annuities, designed for long-term retirement income, can feel restrictive when immediate cash is needed, but several strategies exist for accessing funds. The most straightforward method is waiting for scheduled payments to begin, though this does not provide a lump sum. Many contracts permit penalty-free partial withdrawals, typically up to 10% of the account value annually, though taxes and potential early withdrawal penalties apply. Other options include taking a loan, surrendering the contract for its cash value despite high fees, or executing a tax-free 1035 exchange to a new contract with better terms.

          <p>Paul Ovenden, a senior political strategy director for UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, has resigned after explicit and offensive messages he wrote about Member of Parliament Diane Abbott eight years ago were made public. In the private conversation, Ovenden recounted graphic sexual comments made by colleagues about Abbott. A spokesperson for the Prime Minister called the messages "appalling and unacceptable," highlighting the abuse Abbott has faced as the first Black woman elected to Parliament. Ovenden apologized for the messages and said he resigned to avoid becoming a distraction for the government.</p>

          <p>Activists who deny the results of the 2020 presidential election are increasingly being appointed to local election boards in key states like Georgia and Arizona, raising concerns about partisan interference in future elections. In Fulton County, Georgia, commissioners are legally fighting the appointment of two Republican nominees linked to election denialism. Similar situations are unfolding in other states where new laws have shifted appointment powers, leading to Republican majorities on boards in heavily Democratic areas. Voting rights advocates worry this trend is part of a strategy to disrupt election administration and certification processes.</p>

          <p>Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Trymaine Lee reflects on the profound personal toll of covering gun violence in his new memoir, "A Thousand Ways to Die." After suffering a near-fatal heart attack, Lee re-evaluated the stress from over a decade of reporting on Black death and survival, where he often saw himself in the young victims. The book traces the history of Black Americans' relationship with firearms and serves as a call for the nation to recognize the humanity of those lost. Lee argues that until America addresses its "lust for these guns," meaningful change will remain elusive.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police have charged eight individuals with offenses including assault and public order violations following disorder at weekend protests. The charges stem from clashes during a 'Unite the Kingdom' rally organized by right-wing activist Tommy Robinson, which drew between 110,000 and 150,000 people, and a counter-demonstration of about 5,000 anti-racism protesters. Police made a total of 24 arrests during the events, which were policed by approximately 1,500 officers. The force has also released photos of 11 other individuals they are seeking to identify in connection with the violence.</p>

          <p>China's market regulator has announced that a preliminary investigation found U.S. chipmaker Nvidia to be in violation of the country's anti-monopoly law. The probe relates to Nvidia's 2020 acquisition of Israeli tech company Mellanox and certain conditions attached to that deal's approval. The State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) did not specify the nature of the alleged violation but confirmed it would continue its investigation. The announcement comes amid rising technological tensions between Beijing and Washington and could complicate ongoing trade talks between the two nations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis piece frames the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk as a defining moment in the era of influencer culture and political entertainment. The article argues that Kirk, much like his leftist counterpart Hasan Piker, functioned as an entertainer who made politics feel accessible and game-like, blurring the lines between debate and performance. Piker's live-streamed, visceral reaction to witnessing the shooting highlighted the personal risks for content creators in a hyper-polarized environment they helped shape. The event may have a chilling effect on in-person political dialogue, pushing discourse further into a virtual realm where dehumanization can fester.</p>

          <p>Recent surveys suggest that many Americans are saving less for emergencies than they were a year ago, with one-third reporting they have no emergency fund at all. A June survey from Empower found the median amount saved for emergencies is just $500, down from $600 in the previous year. Even higher earners are seeing a decline, with a BlackRock survey showing a $5,000 drop in median savings among full-time employees with retirement accounts. Financial advisors typically recommend having three to six months of living expenses saved for unexpected events. (not investment advice)</p>

Court records show a backlog of over a million pending IDR applications and more than 72,000 PSLF applications.
