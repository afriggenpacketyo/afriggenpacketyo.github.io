        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and the European Union have officially reached a significant trade agreement, narrowly avoiding an impending tariff deadline that threatened to escalate economic tensions. The deal, announced following discussions between President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, establishes a new 15% tariff on most European goods imported into the U.S. This rate represents a compromise, as it is lower than the 30% previously threatened by the U.S. but higher than the EU's initial goal. As part of the comprehensive agreement, the EU has also committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy and investing an additional $600 billion in the American economy, aiming to create stability and rebalance the transatlantic trade relationship.

This victory marks a successful defense of the title for the Lionesses, who also won the tournament in 2022. According to a fan poll conducted by BBC Sport after the match, Kelly received the highest player rating for her impactful performance coming off the bench.

          <h2>New Humanoid Robot Can Autonomously Swap Its Own Battery for Continuous Operation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 15:00:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Technology company UBTech has developed a new humanoid robot, the Walker S2, capable of swapping its own battery without human assistance, enabling nearly 24/7 operation. When its power runs low, the robot navigates to a charging station, removes the depleted battery, and inserts a fully charged one in a process that takes about three minutes. This innovation is designed to significantly enhance productivity in manufacturing environments, with the robot already being tested in car factories. The development is part of China's broader investment in robotics and AI, aiming to lead the next era of automated manufacturing and change the dynamics of the global workplace.</p>

          <p>A significant fire has broken out in the West Midlands, involving four factory units and approximately 20 tonnes of tires, sending a large plume of smoke into the sky. More than 70 firefighters and 17 fire engines were dispatched to the scene on Great Bridge Street, between Tipton and West Bromwich, to combat the blaze. As a precautionary measure, several nearby homes on Elwell Street have been evacuated, with residents being relocated by local authorities. While no casualties have been reported, the public has been advised to avoid the area and keep doors and windows closed due to the heavy smoke. Investigations into the cause of the fire are expected to continue once the site is deemed safe.</p>

          <p>The American Medical Association (AMA) has expressed deep concern over reports that the Trump administration plans to overhaul the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. This independent panel of experts provides evidence-based recommendations on clinical preventive services, such as cancer and depression screenings, which insurance companies are typically required to cover. The AMA's letter to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. defended the task force's critical, non-partisan role and urged the administration to retain its current members to avoid disrupting its important work. This development follows the recent removal of all members from a CDC vaccine advisory panel, raising fears of increased political influence over public health institutions.</p>

          <p>A BBC News investigation has uncovered an elaborate scheme by a convicted fraudster, James Kenny, who fabricated a large-scale music festival called Monmouth Rising. The event promised a star-studded lineup including The Killers and Pulp, but was built on a foundation of lies, with no licenses secured or artists officially booked. Kenny deceived employees and suppliers, using what are alleged to be forged documents to create the illusion of financial backing and legitimacy. Many individuals and businesses have been left with unpaid invoices and lost wages after the festival was inevitably canceled, exposing the vulnerabilities within the events industry to such sophisticated deceptions.</p>

          <p>India's cricket team achieved a remarkable draw in the fourth Test against England at Old Trafford, batting for over five sessions to keep the series alive. After being in a precarious position, India's batsmen, led by centuries from Shubman Gill and Ravindra Jadeja, showed immense determination to frustrate the English bowlers. A crucial dropped catch by Joe Root proved to be a turning point, allowing India to build an unbreakable partnership. The result means England maintains a 2-1 series lead heading into the final Test, with both teams facing fatigue and potential player changes after the grueling match.</p>

          <p>Leaders from Thailand and Cambodia are scheduled to meet in Malaysia for talks aimed at ending recent border hostilities that have resulted in at least 34 deaths and displaced over 168,000 people. The meeting follows diplomatic pressure from the United States, with President Trump urging both nations to agree to a ceasefire. Despite the planned talks, fighting reportedly continued along the contested border over the weekend, with both sides accusing each other of initiating new attacks. The discussions, hosted by Malaysia as the current ASEAN chair, represent a critical effort to find a peaceful resolution to the long-disputed border issue.</p>

          <p>An attack by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), an affiliate of the Islamic State, has resulted in the deaths of dozens of people in the town of Komanda in northeastern DR Congo. Local officials report that many of the victims were worshippers attending a night vigil at a church when the militants struck, looting and burning nearby businesses as well. The ADF, which originated in Uganda but is now primarily based in DR Congo, frequently targets civilians in the region. This brutal attack highlights the continued and expanding threat of IS-affiliated groups across Africa, which now account for the vast majority of the organization's global operations.</p>

For Apple, the strong performance of "F1," which the tech company produced and Warner Bros. distributed, marks its most successful theatrical release to date. The achievements of both films demonstrate that well-received blockbusters can still draw large audiences to cinemas worldwide.</p>

The film's success is a positive sign for Marvel Studios, which has experienced some box office and critical inconsistencies with its post-"Endgame" releases. The positive fan and critic reception, including an 88% "Fresh" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, indicates that the studio's focus on quality over quantity may be paying off.</p>

His comments highlight a division within the Republican party, as other members, like Rep. Thomas Massie, have suggested a pardon could be considered if it compelled her to provide more information about Jeffrey Epstein's crimes. The debate comes amid increased pressure on the Trump administration to release more files related to the Epstein case. Johnson defended his decision to adjourn the House early, which prevented a vote on releasing the files, citing the need to protect victims' identities.</p>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has announced that her party will seek to ban all NHS doctors from taking strike action if they win the next election. The proposal would place doctors under the same legal restrictions as police and military personnel by introducing legislation for minimum service levels during industrial disputes. This announcement comes as resident doctors are in the midst of a five-day strike over pay, which the British Medical Association (BMA) argues has not kept pace with inflation. The BMA condemned the proposal as a "desperate intervention," asserting that the right to strike is a fundamental last resort for doctors.</p>
