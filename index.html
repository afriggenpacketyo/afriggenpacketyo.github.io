          <p>The once-strong relationship between U.S. President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has reportedly soured, reflecting broader strains in U.S.-India ties. The article suggests that punishing U.S. tariffs on Indian goods and Trump's diplomatic overtures to India's rival, Pakistan, have caused the rift. This breakdown is significant as a strong U.S.-India partnership has been a cornerstone of American strategy in the Indo-Pacific for decades, serving as a counterbalance to China's influence. The deteriorating relationship has pushed India to urgently mend its own ties with China, altering the strategic landscape of the region.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board is seeking shareholder approval for a new compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk, which could grant him over 423 million additional shares and significantly increase his voting power. The plan is structured in 12 tranches, contingent on the company reaching ambitious milestones, including a market capitalization of $8.5 trillion. This proposal follows a Delaware court's decision last year to rescind his 2018 pay package, which was deemed excessive and improperly granted. The new plan aims to keep Musk motivated and focused on Tesla's future growth in electric vehicles and robotics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The resignation of Angela Rayner as Deputy Prime Minister and Housing Secretary is characterized as a devastating blow to both her career and Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government. The departure, occurring just 14 months into the Labour government's term, raises numerous questions about the party's future direction and stability. Key uncertainties include who will replace her, whether the government will shift its political stance, and how the public will react. The event forces an immediate and potentially wide-ranging cabinet reshuffle as the Prime Minister attempts to regain momentum.</p>

          <p>The South Korean government has formally expressed "concern and regret" following a major U.S. immigration raid at a Hyundai electric vehicle manufacturing site in Georgia. The operation, conducted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), reportedly led to the detainment of a large number of individuals, including around 30 South Korean nationals. Seoul has emphasized that the rights of its nationals and the business activities of its investors must not be unjustly infringed upon. The raid targeted the construction site of an adjacent battery plant, a project touted as one of the largest economic developments in Georgia's history.</p>

          <p>Katharine, the Duchess of Kent, has passed away at the age of 92, remembered for her quiet compassion and for carving an individual path within the Royal Family. She was a familiar figure presenting trophies at Wimbledon, famously consoling a distraught Jana Novotná in 1993. In a surprising move, she largely withdrew from royal life to work as a music teacher at a primary school in Hull, where she was known simply as "Mrs Kent."

          <p>The US Open is facing criticism for fostering an atmosphere that caters more to socialites and influencers than to tennis enthusiasts, resulting in a constant, distracting hum of conversation during matches. The article argues that the event has become a place to be seen, with a focus on expensive cocktails, celebrity sightings, and photo opportunities rather than the sport itself. While this strategy has made the tournament a massive commercial success, it has alienated die-hard tennis fans who find the noise and lack of etiquette disruptive. The phenomenon is seen as part of a broader post-pandemic trend of poor public behavior.</p>

For example, an AI achieved a gold medal in the International Mathematical Olympiad a decade earlier than experts had predicted.

          <p>The Trump administration is escalating its war on drugs by applying military tactics typically used against terrorist groups to Latin American criminal organizations. This new approach was demonstrated by a deadly strike on an alleged Venezuelan drug boat, which President Trump announced killed 11 "narcoterrorists." The administration has designated several gangs, including Venezuela's Tren de Aragua, as foreign terrorist organizations, providing a legal framework for military action. This policy shift, which includes threats of regime change against governments accused of backing these groups, marks a significant militarization of U.S. drug policy and its relationship with Latin America.</p>

          <p>A catastrophic funicular crash in Lisbon has resulted in the deaths of 16 people, with victims identified from multiple countries including the United States, United Kingdom, South Korea, and Switzerland. The popular Glória funicular, a 140-year-old tourist attraction, derailed and crashed into a building, causing what Portugal's Prime Minister called a major human tragedy. More than 20 others were injured in the incident, prompting an investigation into the cause, which is suspected to be a snapped cable. The city has declared three days of mourning as recovery efforts continue.</p>

          <p>Manchester City defender John Stones has been withdrawn from the England squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and Serbia due to a muscular injury. England manager Thomas Tuchel confirmed that Stones arrived at the training camp with a minor issue that did not improve as expected. The decision was made to not take any risks with the player's fitness. His absence leaves Marc Guehi, Dan Burn, Ezri Konsa, and Jarell Quansah as the remaining centre-back options for the national team's crucial matches.</p>

          <p>A French couple has received suspended jail sentences and fines for illegally keeping a black panther named Louise in their apartment. The case gained public attention in 2019 when the young feline escaped onto the rooftops of a northern French town, prompting a major rescue operation. The owners claimed they viewed the animal as an affectionate baby, but the court ruled that keeping the wild animal in captivity constituted mistreatment and species trafficking. After its recapture, the panther, now named Akilla, was relocated to a big cat sanctuary in the Netherlands where it is reportedly doing well.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has challenged President Donald Trump to a debate, bypassing his opponent Andrew Cuomo. The move came after Cuomo, running as an independent, called for Mamdani to debate him and for the other candidates to drop out of the race. Mamdani framed Cuomo as Trump's "puppet" and suggested a direct debate with the president would be more productive. The exchange highlights the unusual dynamics of the four-way race, where the White House has reportedly explored ways to consolidate the field to prevent a Mamdani victory.</p>

          <p>A new survey indicates that while a majority of Chinese citizens do not view the United States as a friend, they are divided on whether China should seek global dominance or share leadership. The poll, conducted by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, found that U.S. economic competition and potential conflict over Taiwan are perceived as the top two threats to China. Despite these tensions, 61% of respondents favor a balanced approach to Washington. The study also showed strong public support for international trade and active participation in world affairs, reflecting a high degree of confidence in the country's direction.</p>

          <p>A detailed analysis argues that the U.S. Supreme Court's Republican-appointed majority consistently favors former President Donald Trump and related political interests, often by manipulating procedural rules. The article cites numerous examples, including the fast-tracking of Trump administration requests on the "shadow docket" while delaying cases that challenged his policies. It also points to the invention of the "major questions doctrine," which was used to strike down several Biden administration policies but is now being tailored to exempt Trump's tariffs. This pattern of behavior, the article contends, suggests the justices are acting as partisans rather than impartial arbiters of the law.</p>

          <p>UK retail sales volumes rose by 0.6% in July, exceeding analysts' expectations, largely driven by sunny weather and the UEFA Women's Euro 2025 football tournament. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), clothing, footwear, and online stores experienced particularly strong growth. The data release was delayed by two weeks due to concerns over statistical quality, for which the ONS apologized. While the monthly figures were positive, sales over the three months to July were down 0.6% compared to the previous quarter, indicating underlying weakness in consumer spending.</p>

This aggressive stance follows a recent U.S. military strike on a boat in the Caribbean, which the White House claimed was carrying drug traffickers from a Venezuelan gang.

Reports suggest that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is planning an "immigration enforcement blitz" in the city. Mayor Wu has been a vocal defender of Boston's Trust Act, which limits local police cooperation with federal immigration agents, arguing it is crucial for public safety and community trust. The standoff reflects a broader national conflict between the federal government's aggressive deportation agenda and cities seeking to protect their immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee are investigating the recent firings of at least 20 Justice Department employees, including staff who worked on probes related to former President Trump. In a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi, the senators are demanding records and justification for the terminations, which they describe as a "petty but pernicious abuse of power." The fired employees reportedly include prosecutors, paralegals, and administrative staff who were involved in the January 6th and classified documents investigations led by special counsel Jack Smith. The senators allege the dismissals are antidemocratic and potentially unlawful.</p>
