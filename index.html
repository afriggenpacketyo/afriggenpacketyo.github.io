          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron is urging the European Union to prepare for a potential trade war with the United States after former President Trump threatened to impose 30% tariffs on most EU imports. Macron's call for "credible countermeasures" contrasts with leaders from Germany, Italy, and Ireland, who are advocating for a more pragmatic and calm approach to negotiate a fair agreement. The threat has caused alarm across the bloc, particularly in Germany's automotive industry, which is already struggling with existing US tariffs. This division highlights the strategic challenge the EU faces in confronting protectionist US trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) has announced the first successful extraction of uranium from its "National No 1 Uranium" project in Inner Mongolia. This demonstration project utilizes a new mining approach described as "green, safe, intelligent and efficient," which avoids tunnels and toxic waste. Located in the Ordos basin, home to China's largest uranium deposits, this development marks a shift from traditional mining sites in Jiangxi province. The new method could significantly enhance China's competitiveness and self-sufficiency in the global nuclear energy sector.</p>

          <p>A landmark 2023 civil rights settlement to address a decades-old raw sewage crisis in Lowndes County, Alabama, has been terminated by the Trump administration. The administration labeled the agreement an "illegal" diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiative, stripping federal funding and oversight intended to help the majority-Black, high-poverty community. For generations, residents have lived with failing or nonexistent sanitation systems, exposing them to parasites and disease. The termination of the deal, which had been a major environmental justice victory, leaves impoverished families in a state of uncertainty and puts the responsibility back on state lawmakers.</p>

          <p>Immigrant communities in Los Angeles are experiencing significant fear and economic disruption due to a sustained increase in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids. A recent show of force at MacArthur Park, a predominantly immigrant neighborhood, was condemned by city leaders as a "political stunt" meant to terrorize residents. Local business owners report that commerce has slowed drastically as people stay home out of fear of random arrests, which advocates claim are based on racial profiling. A federal judge recently issued a temporary restraining order against these aggressive tactics, which could disrupt the government's ongoing enforcement operations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being the most disaster-prone state in the US, Texas exhibits a recurring pattern of failing to adequately prepare for future catastrophes, as seen with recent floods and the 2021 winter storm. Experts attribute this to a political culture, heavily influenced by the fossil fuel industry, that prioritizes small government and deregulation while being skeptical of climate change science. This ideology leads to the rejection of preventative measures, such as a statewide emergency siren network that was voted down just months before the deadly Hill Country floods. The state's resistance to proactive planning leaves its growing population increasingly vulnerable to extreme weather events.</p>

          <p>While the NFL has committed its players to flag football for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, Major League Baseball has yet to agree to allow its stars to participate. Figures like LA28 chief Casey Wasserman argue that having top players like Shohei Ohtani and Aaron Judge compete would be an incredible marketing opportunity to elevate the sport globally. However, MLB's reluctance stems from logistical challenges, including interrupting its season and navigating media contracts, as it prefers to control its own international event, the World Baseball Classic. The delay puts baseball at risk of being overshadowed by other major sports on the world's biggest stage.</p>

          <p>The current season of "Love Island USA" has featured a notable increase in racial diversity, with Black contestants being central to the show's narrative. The article explores how dark-skinned Black women on the show navigate stereotypes, often feeling pressure to maintain composure to avoid being villainized. However, the series has been criticized for its vague handling of off-screen issues, quietly removing two contestants for past use of racial slurs without directly addressing the reasons with the audience. This highlights a disconnect between the show's surface-level diversity and its willingness to confront the reality of racism.</p>

The incident has drawn attention to severe overcrowding at the facility, which reportedly holds nearly double its intended capacity of 678 inmates.

The event created a stark contrast with then-President Biden, who dropped out of the race eight days later, a move many Democrats feel came too late.

          <p>The class of 2025 is struggling to find employment in a surprisingly difficult job market, with an unemployment rate for recent graduates nearing 6%. Economists from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York note that cautious employers, skittish about uncertain economic policies, have slowed hiring, creating fewer entry-level opportunities. Major sectors like technology, consulting, and even the federal government are scaling back after periods of growth. Consequently, many graduates are forced to accept jobs outside their field of study or settle for lower salaries than they had anticipated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The death toll from the devastating flash floods in Texas Hill Country has climbed to 129, with search and recovery operations ongoing for those still missing. In response to the tragedy, more than 30 active duty and former Navy SEALs have volunteered to assist, using their expertise to navigate the difficult, debris-filled terrain along the Guadalupe River. President Donald Trump, when questioned about the timeliness of warning alerts, praised the heroic response efforts and stated that state officials would work on improving the alert system. The National Weather Service continues to issue flash flood warnings for surrounding areas.</p>

          <p>UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting is scheduled to meet with the British Medical Association (BMA) next week in an effort to prevent a planned five-day strike by resident doctors in England. The doctors are demanding a better pay offer, arguing that their real-terms pay has fallen significantly since 2008 and that the government's 5.4% increase is insufficient. While the government insists it cannot improve the offer, it is reportedly open to discussing working conditions. The planned walkout, set to begin on July 25, has faced criticism, with recent polls showing a decline in public support for the strikes.</p>

          <p>Iranian state-affiliated media has confirmed that President Masoud Pezeshkian was injured during an Israeli airstrike in June that targeted a meeting of the Supreme National Security Council in Tehran. Pezeshkian sustained a leg injury and had to escape through an emergency hatch after six missiles struck the building. The attack, which bore similarities to the strike that killed Hezbollah's leader, has prompted an investigation into a possible insider leak due to its precision. The revelation confirms the president's earlier claims that Israel had attempted to assassinate him during the 12-day war.</p>

          <p>The final fight in the trilogy between Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano, which Taylor won by decision, represented a significant moment for women's boxing. Unlike their previous chaotic brawls, the third bout was a tactical, controlled affair, which the article argues is a form of progress. It suggests that true equality in the sport is not just the right to provide a thrilling spectacle, but the right to fight smart, win ugly, and be judged on skill rather than entertainment value. The event highlighted the contradictions within boxing, where female athletes fight for choice and glory in a sport still marked by spectacle and financial disparity.</p>

The PKK is demanding Ocalan's release and legal reforms in exchange for full disarmament. While the Turkish government has called the move an opportunity for peace, it remains cautious, stating it will take no further steps until the PKK fully dismantles.

          <p>A campaign is calling for cosmetic and skincare companies in the UK to list ingredients in English instead of Latin to prevent potentially life-threatening allergic reactions. Currently, companies use the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI), a globally harmonized system based on Latin and scientific names, which can be difficult for consumers to understand. MP Becky Gittins, who has a severe nut allergy, and other advocates argue that common allergens should be clearly identifiable, similar to food labeling.

Araujo took a plea deal for second-degree murder and testified against Abell, claiming he was the primary aggressor. Abell's defense argued Araujo was the jealous killer.
