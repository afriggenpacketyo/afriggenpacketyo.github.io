            <p>During the 30th Anniversary Remembrance Ceremony of the Oklahoma City bombing, a woman walked onto the stage and attempted to speak with officials, including possibly Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt or U.S. Senator James Lankford. The woman was escorted off stage after saying, "Help me, please. You know who I am." Officials believe there was no threat to public safety, suggesting the incident involved an individual seeking the governor's intervention on a personal matter. The woman had a clipboard and papers in hand.</p>

            <p>Superman's story resonates beyond pop culture, touching on religious and ethical themes. Gene Luen Yang, a comic writer, connects Superman's dual identity to his own experience as a Chinese-American, highlighting the theme of hiding one's true self. Some see parallels between Superman's origins and the story of Moses or the Kindertransport. Despite religious undertones, Superman's universal appeal lies in his embodiment of American civil religion and philosophical pragmatism, transcending specific religious beliefs.</p>
