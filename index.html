          <p>A San Francisco Japantown museum is marking the 80th anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki with an exhibit focused on the human cost of the events. The National Japanese American Historical Society's display features survivor accounts and a recovered relic to shift focus from the mushroom cloud image to the ground-level devastation. A new documentary, "Atomic Echoes," further explores this perspective by interviewing American medics who witnessed the aftermath. The exhibit and film both serve as a call for world peace and a reminder of the catastrophic consequences of nuclear weapons.</p>

Black women in the U.S. are significantly more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications, and the CWHA's doulas offer psychosocial support, advocacy, and guidance to empower mothers. They assist with birth plans, comfort measures, and postpartum care, ensuring patients' concerns are heard by medical staff. The organization aims to improve health outcomes by providing culturally competent care that extends well beyond the delivery room for underserved families.</p>

          <p>A recent poll in Germany indicates that a majority of voters want Chancellor Friedrich Merz to apply more pressure on Israel regarding the conflict in Gaza. This sentiment comes as the German government announced a partial suspension of military equipment exports to Israel that could be used in the strip. The survey also reflects declining confidence in Merz's domestic policies and a drop in his personal approval ratings after nearly 100 days in office. Meanwhile, concerns persist over U.S. tariffs and their potential impact on the German economy, a key issue for the populace.</p>

The image reveals a teardrop-shaped dust plume and a faint tail, offering valuable data on objects originating from beyond our solar system.</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's recent outline for developing "personal superintelligence" has drawn criticism for its perceived lack of ambition despite massive investment. Zuckerberg envisions AI-powered glasses that would act as personal assistants, a concept some observers find underwhelming for a technology with world-changing potential. This vision, focusing on enhancing social media engagement and ad targeting, contrasts with the industry's more transformative goals. Despite a massive hiring spree and billion-dollar offers for top talent, critics argue that Zuckerberg's focus on consumer products may fail to attract researchers passionate about solving humanity's larger problems.</p>

Borrowers might pay tens of thousands more in interest over the loan's lifetime due to the longer terms.

The article also explores their shared interest in model agencies and beauty pageants, suggesting a deeper connection than Trump now admits.

Friedman views the Trump administration's approach as a deconstruction of an obsolete post-WWII system, a chaotic but normal part of a recurring 50-year American cycle of crisis and reinvention.

          <p>A Vox analysis explores a counterintuitive budgetary phenomenon dubbed the "Grim Reaper effect," where policies that save lives and improve longevity can increase long-term federal spending. Because the U.S. provides more generous benefits to seniors through programs like Social Security and Medicare, people living longer means more years of collecting these benefits. This was first noted with smoking cessation and is now a factor in evaluating treatments for diseases like Hepatitis C. The article argues that while this fiscal reality is important to understand, it shouldn't deter life-saving policies, which should be valued for their intrinsic good, not just their budget score.</p>

This has threatened the ecosystem, which supports trillions of brine shrimp and alkali flies, vital food for millions of migratory birds. Although a 1994 state order aimed to raise the lake's level, it remains significantly below the target, prompting renewed calls for action to balance the water needs of both the city and the ancient lake.</p>

          <p>A 75-year-old man from Southern California is baffled after his 1958 Cessna Skyhawk has been stolen, flown on joyrides, and mysteriously returned on multiple occasions. The owner, Jason Hong, discovered his plane missing from Corona Municipal Airport, only to have it found at other local airports, sometimes with a new battery installed to replace the one he had removed. Flight tracking data shows the plane being taken on several flights, suggesting the unknown pilot is trained. Police are investigating the bizarre case, which currently has no leads, leaving both the owner and authorities perplexed by the motive.</p>

          <p>Premier League club Aston Villa has announced the signing of striker Evann Guessand from French club Nice in a deal worth £26 million, plus potential add-ons. The 24-year-old Ivory Coast international scored 12 goals last season and was named Nice's player of the season. His arrival provides much-needed reinforcement to Villa's attack, where Ollie Watkins was the only recognized senior center forward. This is Aston Villa's second major signing of the summer, as the club navigates financial rules set by both the Premier League and UEFA, for which it was recently fined.</p>

          <p>A man has been federally charged with stealing rare Chinese manuscripts, some over 600 years old, from a UCLA library and replacing them with fakes. The Department of Justice alleges that 38-year-old Jeffery Ying used multiple aliases to gain access to the classic works, which are valued at $216,000. He would allegedly check out the items, return dummy versions, and then travel to China. When law enforcement raided his hotel, they discovered blank manuscripts and pre-made asset tags designed to create the forgeries. If convicted of theft of a major artwork, he faces up to 10 years in prison.</p>

          <p>A 22-year-old Iranian man has been arrested in Birmingham on suspicion of facilitating illegal immigration as part of an organized crime group. The arrest by the National Crime Agency (NCA) directly followed a months-long undercover investigation by the BBC. The probe involved creating fake identities to expose a violent smuggling gang's operations in both France and the UK. The NCA stated that people smugglers operate for profit without regard for human safety and that their investigation is ongoing.

          <p>The share price for Crocs plummeted after the company revealed a 6.5% drop in North American sales, attributing the decline to a consumer shift towards athletic trainers. CEO Andrew Rees noted that upcoming major sporting events like the World Cup and Olympics are driving a "clear athletic trend." He also warned that lower-income consumers are being "super cautious" due to cost-of-living pressures and potential impacts from U.S. tariffs, leading to reduced store traffic and purchasing. In contrast, the brand is seeing strong growth in China, driven by digital marketing campaigns featuring major local celebrities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission has reported a dramatic increase in imposter scams targeting older Americans, with losses reaching $700 million in 2024. These scams involve criminals posing as trustworthy entities, such as banks or government agencies, to convince victims to transfer money from their financial accounts, including retirement funds. The number of adults over 60 reporting losses of at least $10,000 has surged by 362% since 2020. The FBI notes that these figures are likely an undercount, as many older victims do not report the fraud due to embarrassment or lack of awareness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California is facing a significant challenge from a large and destructive population of invasive wild pigs, now present in 56 of the state's 58 counties. These animals, numbering between 200,000 and 400,000, cause extensive ecological damage by uprooting vegetation and disrupting native ecosystems and agriculture. Wildlife officials also warn that the pigs can be highly aggressive and dangerous to humans, with several encounters reported this year. Despite efforts like trapping and deterrents, containing the population has proven difficult, leading to new state legislation in 2022 that eased hunting restrictions to better manage their numbers.</p>
