          <p>The Florida Gators secured their spot in the national championship game for the first time since 2007 with a 79-73 victory over Auburn in the Final Four. Walter Clayton Jr.'s impressive 34-point performance led Florida, highlighted by a crucial layup late in the game. The Gators capitalized on Auburn's Johni Broome's injury and Condon drawing a charge to swing momentum. Florida now carries an 11-game winning streak into the title game, where they will face either Duke or Houston for the SECâ€™s first title since 2012.</p>

          <p>The United States is revoking all visas for South Sudanese passport holders and preventing new entries due to South Sudan's failure to accept its nationals being deported from the US. Secretary of State Marco Rubio accused the South Sudanese government of taking advantage of the United States. This action marks the first time the Trump administration has singled out an entire country's passport holders since returning to the White House. The US has granted 'temporary protected status' to South Sudanese nationals in the past, but the Trump White House has begun overturning TPS designations.</p>

          <p>Parts of the Midwest and South are bracing for more flash flooding after days of severe storms and tornadoes that have already caused significant damage and loss of life. At least 16 people have died due to tornadoes, and two more in Kentucky due to flooding, as heavy rains continue to swell waterways. The National Weather Service anticipates major flooding at 45 river locations across multiple states, potentially impacting infrastructure and causing supply chain delays.

          <p>A consultation for England's men's health strategy is launching to address the fact that men are more likely to die prematurely than women. Men are more prone to unhealthy habits, and biological reasons make them less able to fight off infection. Machismo and societal expectations also play a role, making it difficult for men to seek healthcare. Experts suggest solutions such as offering health checks in blue-collar workplaces and granting paid time off for medical appointments to improve men's health outcomes.</p>

          <p>A mother's death from cervical cancer was attributed to misreported NHS screening results, leading to an undisclosed damages payout to her family. Two cervical screening tests were incorrectly reported as negative, depriving her of the opportunity for early treatment. An internal review found the samples were inadequate, but the family was not informed until after her death. The NHS Trust has apologized for the mistakes and has since strengthened its processes for sharing audit findings to ensure open communication.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to impose sweeping tariffs on imports is a move towards protectionism, reversing decades of US-led globalization.

          <p>Sarah Boardman, the artist behind an official portrait of Donald Trump that the president publicly criticized, says her business is now 'in danger of not recovering.' Trump called the portrait 'truly the worst,' claiming it was 'purposefully distorted,' while praising her portrait of Barack Obama. Boardman, who has painted other presidential portraits, says Trump's comments have negatively impacted her business of over 41 years. The portrait has since been removed from Colorado's State Capitol.</p>

          <p>The Israeli army has admitted its soldiers made mistakes in the killing of 15 emergency workers in southern Gaza on March 23, but claims some were linked to Hamas. Israel initially stated troops opened fire because the convoy approached 'suspiciously' in darkness without headlights, but video footage shows the vehicles had lights on. The army says soldiers had earlier fired on a car containing three Hamas members, and assumed they were under threat when the ambulances approached. An IDF official stated the soldiers buried the bodies to protect them from wild animals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has unveiled a novel approach to enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), as anticipation grows for the release of its next-generation model. The technique, developed with Tsinghua University, combines generative reward modeling (GRM) and self-principled critique tuning. The resulting DeepSeek-GRM models outperformed existing methods in delivering better and faster results. The announcement comes amid speculation about the release of DeepSeek-R2, the successor to the firm's R1 reasoning model.</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Roki Sasaki demonstrated glimpses of his future star potential in a 3-1 win over the Philadelphia Phillies, holding them to one run over four-plus innings. After two shaky starts to his rookie season, Sasaki displayed improved command and attacked the strike zone, setting up his signature splitter. He focused on his fastball command in his between-starts bullpen, and it paid off. Sasaki's performance was a confidence booster for both him and the team, providing a potential blueprint for his development this season.</p>

          <p>As the world becomes increasingly turbulent, the European Union is contemplating its role in a post-American West, particularly after the return of President Donald Trump. The European Commission has urged citizens to stockpile a three-day survival kit, highlighting the uncertainty felt by many Europeans. A debate has begun in Europe's capitals regarding the EU's position in a multipolar world after decades of benefiting from the Western order established by the United States. The shift reflects a growing sense that the post-war era is coming to an end.</p>
