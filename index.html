          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a new trade deal with Vietnam that imposes a 20% tariff on all Vietnamese goods imported into the United States. The agreement also includes a 40% tariff on products that originate in other countries and are transshipped through Vietnam, a measure aimed at preventing circumvention of trade barriers. In exchange, the deal reportedly grants U.S. products tariff-free access to Vietnam's markets, a move that could impact various sectors, including apparel companies reliant on Vietnamese manufacturing.

          <p>Constellation Brands, the parent company of Corona and Modelo, reported quarterly earnings and revenue that fell short of analysts' expectations. The company attributed the weaker performance to a slide in beer demand and the increased cost of aluminum due to tariffs. Executives noted that consumers, concerned about inflation and economic uncertainty, are reducing social outings, which has directly impacted beer consumption and sales volumes for its key brands.

          <p>The Trump administration has frozen more than $6 billion in federal grants for after-school, summer, and other educational programs, creating widespread uncertainty for schools and families across the country. The funds, which were due to be distributed on July 1, are being held pending a review to ensure they align with the president's priorities. Program providers warn that without this funding, they may be forced to shutter summer camps and cancel essential after-school care for thousands of low-income children.</p>
