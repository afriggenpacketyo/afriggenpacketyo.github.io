          <p>Credit Suisse Services AG pleaded guilty to conspiring with American taxpayers to hide over $4 billion in offshore accounts, agreeing to pay $511 million in fines. The Department of Justice revealed that between 2014 and June 2023, Credit Suisse AG Singapore held over $2 billion in undeclared accounts for U.S. persons. The DOJ stated that Credit Suisse falsified bank records and concealed U.S. ownership of accounts, processing fictitious paperwork and maintaining over 100 accounts held by a Swiss lawyer. This plea comes after a 2014 guilty plea for similar tax evasion schemes, marking a breach of their previous agreement.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is initiating a program offering $1,000 and a flight home to undocumented immigrants who willingly leave the United States. Officials stated that one migrant from Honduras has already participated in the program, flying back from Chicago. President Trump explained the program as a way to offer people a different way to leave the country, suggesting potential future return for "good people." Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem emphasized that self-deportation is the safest and most cost-effective way to avoid arrest, with payments made after travel confirmation through the CBP Home app.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has requested a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to restrict access to the abortion pill mifepristone, aligning with the Biden administration's earlier position. The Justice Department argued that the case, brought by the attorneys general of Missouri, Idaho, and Kansas, does not meet the legal standard to be heard in the Northern District of Texas. This move marks the first time the Trump administration has weighed in on the lawsuit, which challenges regulatory changes that expanded access to mifepristone, including telemedicine prescriptions and mail delivery, and seeks to outlaw the medication for anyone under 18.</p>

          <p>Over 150 former state and federal judges have signed a letter condemning the Trump administration’s escalating battles with the judiciary, specifically citing the arrest of Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah C. Dugan. Judge Dugan was arrested by F.B.I. agents on charges of obstructing immigration agents by allegedly directing an undocumented immigrant to leave through a side door while agents waited to arrest him. The letter accuses the administration of attempting to intimidate the judiciary, undermining the rule of law and eroding public trust in judges. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has suspended Judge Dugan while the case proceeds, with a preliminary hearing scheduled for May 15.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposal to impose steep tariffs on movies produced outside the United States has caused confusion and concern in Hollywood, which has already seen a decline in local film and television production. The idea followed a meeting with actor Jon Voight, now a "special ambassador" to Hollywood, where plans to increase domestic film production were discussed. While some worried that tariffs could cause more harm than good, the industry has been desperate for federal help in the form of tax credits instead. The White House clarified that no final decisions have been made, but the administration is exploring all options to support the domestic film industry.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is engaging in diplomatic efforts with countries like Angola, Benin, Equatorial Guinea, and others to deport migrants who are not citizens of those nations. These talks are part of a broader strategy to deport migrants whose home countries won't accept them back. The administration has already brokered agreements with Latin American countries to accept third-country deportees, and is now looking to expand these arrangements to Africa and Europe. One idea under consideration involves using these agreements to deport suspected members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.</p>

The decision is linked to concerns about antisemitism on campus, policies considering a student’s race, and a perceived lack of conservative faculty members.

          <p>Senator Chuck Schumer is demanding a full inspector general investigation into the FAA due to ongoing disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport, which have resulted in numerous delays and cancellations. Schumer cited a nationwide air traffic controller shortage, budget cuts, outdated technology, and unfilled leadership positions as contributing factors. He also questioned why Newark was excluded from a recent bonus offered to air traffic controllers, despite facing significant shortages. United Airlines is cutting 35 roundtrip flights daily at Newark, and the FAA has instituted a "flow constrained area" to manage the situation.</p>

The working conditions of delivery couriers, with insufficient social security and excessively long hours, are also a matter of concern.</p>

Cuomo is under scrutiny for potentially violating New York City campaign finance rules by using his campaign website to coordinate with a super PAC supporting his mayoral bid.

Cuomo's website featured polling data and pre-edited video clips, similar to content in a Fix the City super PAC ad.
