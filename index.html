          <p>Max Verstappen claimed victory for Red Bull at the Italian Grand Prix, returning to dominant form after several races without a win. The event was marked by controversy within the McLaren team, which ordered Oscar Piastri to let his teammate Lando Norris pass for second place. The decision came after a slow pit stop, caused by a wheel gun fault, cost Norris the position he had held for most of the race. While Piastri expressed disagreement, he complied with the order, narrowing his championship lead over Norris and sparking debate about fairness in team racing strategy.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asserted that a summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska primarily benefited the Russian leader. In an interview, Zelenskyy stated that Putin achieved his goal of meeting with a U.S. president, which serves as a powerful visual for his domestic and international audience. This statement comes as Russia launched a record aerial assault on Ukraine, killing civilians and damaging Kyiv's cabinet building. Zelenskyy reiterated his belief that ending the war requires increased pressure and sanctions from Western allies, particularly targeting Russia's energy sector, which he described as Putin's weapon.</p>

          <p>Representatives Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna are leading a bipartisan effort to compel a House vote on the release of government files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Massie suggested that President Trump may be resisting the full release to avoid embarrassment for politically connected donors and potential ties to intelligence agencies. Both congressmen emphasized that justice for survivors must outweigh the reputational harm to powerful individuals. Khanna expressed confidence they have secured the necessary 218 votes for a discharge petition, which would force a vote on the matter by the end of September.</p>

          <p>After multiple sightings since 2019, police in the Czech Republic have arrested the 51-year-old driver of a red, Ferrari-liveried racing car seen on public motorways. The vehicle, identified as a Dallara GP2/08, was tracked to a property where the driver was taken into custody while still in his racing suit and helmet. In previous encounters, police were unable to press charges because the driver's helmet obscured their identity. The owner now faces a fine for operating a vehicle on the motorway without essential features like headlights, indicators, or number plates.</p>

          <p>In her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court, Justice Amy Coney Barrett addressed criticisms that the court has enabled an expansion of presidential power under Donald Trump. Barrett maintained that the court's role is to decide legal questions, not to form political views on the president's actions. She also defended the Dobbs decision, which overturned Roe v. Wade, stating it returned the question of abortion to the democratic process in the states and did not render it illegal. Barrett emphasized her judicial philosophy of approaching cases with an open mind, refusing to comment on pending legal issues like tariffs.</p>

          <p>A Black man in South Carolina is advocating for the state to pass a hate crime law after he was the victim of a racist attack. The man, Jarvis McKenzie, reported that a white man fired a rifle over his head and shouted racial slurs at him while he was waiting to go to work. The alleged attacker was arrested and charged under a local county ordinance, as South Carolina is one of only two states without a statewide hate crime statute. This incident has renewed calls from activists and business leaders for the state senate to pass legislation that would impose more severe penalties for crimes motivated by prejudice.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's recent decision to eliminate the "de minimis" loophole, which allowed tariff-free imports under $800, is causing concern among some small business owners who rely on international goods. While some experts predict a "whiplash effect" of uncertainty and rising costs for a subset of businesses, the article argues against widespread panic, noting that most small businesses are service-based and will not be directly affected. The author suggests that as long as consumer income and wealth remain strong, the economy can likely absorb the price increases resulting from the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

Known as "sleep hygiene," these practices are crucial for a baby's physical, cognitive, and emotional development, and they lay the groundwork for concentration and resilience later in life. Dr. Golshevsky advises creating a soothing environment that mimics the womb with warmth, darkness, and white noise. He also stresses the importance of a flexible routine, ensuring the baby is well-fed and burped, and involving both parents in the settling process.</p>

          <h2>Op-Ed Argues Solar Power's Self-Sufficiency Aligns with Conservative Prepper Ideals</h2>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that right-wing survivalists, or "preppers," should logically embrace solar power as the ideal energy source for societal collapse scenarios. While politically aligned with fossil fuels, prepping with diesel or gasoline requires complex, failure-prone systems for storage and replenishment. In contrast, solar panels offer a hyper-individualistic and resilient solution, providing energy for decades with minimal maintenance and no reliance on external supply chains. The author suggests that despite political rhetoric against renewables, solar energy's capacity for true self-sufficiency makes it a perfect fit for anyone concerned with long-term independence.</p>

          <p>Arizona State Senator Analise Ortiz is facing an ethics complaint from Republican colleagues seeking her expulsion after she reshared an Instagram post warning of ICE activity near an elementary school. The complaint, led by State Senator Jake Hoffman, accuses Ortiz of dangerous behavior that could impede federal law enforcement. Ortiz defends her action as protected speech under the First Amendment, stating she was informing her community about government activity in a sensitive location. Free speech experts and Arizona's Democratic attorney general have condemned the complaint as a politically motivated attempt to intimidate and silence a legislator.</p>

          <p>An analysis of President Donald Trump's rhetoric reveals a significant and increasing use of phrases like "never seen anything like it" to describe events, policies, and outcomes. This verbal tic, which appears far more in his spontaneous remarks than prepared speeches, reflects a worldview where everything is framed in extreme, black-and-white terms. According to communication experts, this pattern of hyperbole is not just a messaging strategy but also translates into his governance, where situations are often presented as unprecedented crises demanding drastic action. The use of such language has escalated in his second term, reinforcing his narrative of historic successes and unparalleled challenges.</p>

Families of the hostages expressed anger and frustration, arguing that intensifying the military offensive further endangers their loved ones. Despite growing domestic and international pressure, the Israeli government has shown no signs of halting its campaign, vowing to achieve total victory over Hamas. The protests highlight a deepening divide within Israel over the direction and objectives of the nearly two-year-long conflict.</p>

Transport for London (TfL) has called the demand for a shorter week unaffordable but remains open to further talks on its 3.4% pay rise offer. The strike, which is the first to shut down the entire network since March 2023, is causing severe crowding on other services like the Elizabeth line and Overground.</p>

          <p>Despite being a world leader in exporting and installing green technology, China is also ramping up its coal power capacity. This seemingly contradictory strategy is framed as a necessary measure to ensure grid stability while integrating record amounts of renewable energy. With solar and wind power generation increasing rapidly, existing transmission infrastructure can become overloaded, leading to energy "curtailment." New coal plants are intended to act as a reliable backup power source, or "shock absorber," to prevent blackouts during peak demand or when renewable output fluctuates, giving the grid time to modernize.</p>

The initial site was launched in just two weeks and quickly gained popularity through word of mouth, eventually expanding internationally.

          <p>A new study of dinosaur fossils from Brazil reveals that multiple large, long-necked sauropods were afflicted with osteomyelitis, a destructive bone infection. Researchers analyzed the 80-million-year-old skeletons of six dinosaurs from the same paleontological site and found lesions characteristic of the disease, which can be caused by bacteria, fungi, or parasites. The lack of healing in the bones suggests the infections were active at the time of death and may have been a contributing factor. The ancient swampy environment of the region likely provided ideal conditions for pathogens to thrive and infect numerous individuals.</p>
