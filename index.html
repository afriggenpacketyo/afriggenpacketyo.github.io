          <p>At Chester Zoo in the United Kingdom, a same-sex pair of male Humboldt penguins named Scampi and Flounder are successfully raising a chick. The chick is one of ten born this year in a vital breeding program for the species, which is listed as vulnerable to extinction. Zoo experts distributed eggs among different nests to improve the chances of survival, and the male couple has stepped up to share incubation and feeding duties, contributing to important conservation efforts.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in downtown Los Angeles on the Fourth of July to protest the Trump administration's immigration policies and the recent passage of a budget bill that increases funding for enforcement. The march, which went from City Hall to the federal building housing immigration courts, was a response to weeks of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids across the Southland. Protesters voiced their opposition to what they described as the terrorizing of communities and the separation of families.</p>

          <p>This report clarifies the effects of the new tax and spending bill on Social Security beneficiaries, explaining that it does not eliminate taxes on their benefits as some have claimed. Instead, the legislation introduces a new, temporary tax deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors with incomes below a certain threshold, which is set to expire in 2028. The analysis notes that this deduction will not benefit many low-income seniors who already have no federal tax liability, with the largest benefits going to higher-income recipients.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated that a 60-day ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas could be imminent, stating that it is now up to Hamas to accept the deal. His optimistic comments come as Israeli military operations have intensified across Gaza, killing at least 138 Palestinians over a 24-hour period.

          <p>President Trump faced criticism after using the term "shylocks" during a speech in Iowa to refer to some moneylenders, a word the Anti-Defamation League called a "centuries-old antisemitic trope."

The deduction, which expires in 2028, aims to increase the take-home pay for service industry employees like waiters and bartenders by reducing their federal income tax liability on tips. However, critics argue the measure offers limited relief, as many low-wage tipped workers already have no federal tax liability to begin with.</p>
