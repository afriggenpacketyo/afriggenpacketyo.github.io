          <p>A recent Ipsos poll reveals widespread negative sentiment across Europe, with majorities in Great Britain, Germany, France, and Italy believing their societies are broken and economies rigged to favor the wealthy. This has fueled populist and anti-establishment sentiments. Britons are particularly inclined to support a "strong leader who breaks the rules" to address economic problems, while economic concerns appear to be adding to populist sentiment across the continent, with voters protesting against mainstream parties who they feel have failed them socially and economically. The UK government faces challenges due to limited fiscal space, making it difficult to implement long-term investments to improve the situation. Optimism regarding the state of society and the potential for improvement remains low.</p>

          <p>The Tokyo High Court has overturned a previous ruling that held former executives of Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc. liable for damages related to the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant crisis. The court determined that the massive tsunami that caused the disaster was not foreseeable by TEPCO's management at the time, thus overturning the 2022 decision that ordered the executives to pay approximately 13 trillion yen in compensation. The lawyer for the shareholders criticized the ruling and expressed intentions to appeal the decision. The trial centered on whether the management's inaction regarding tsunami countermeasures was acceptable after a 2008 TEPCO unit estimated the potential for a 15.7-meter tsunami based on a 2002 government assessment.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-06 04:26:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists have developed a new radar technology that allows aircraft to track moving targets without emitting radar signals, maintaining radio silence. The innovation, detailed in China’s Journal of Radars, involves a "space-time decoupling two-channel clutter cancellation method" that enables a silent aircraft to detect moving vehicles with high clarity. Traditional methods struggle with clutter from reflections off land, sea, or buildings, making it difficult to detect moving targets, but the new technology clears the screen of noise, enabling clear detection of vehicles. This advancement marks a significant step in bistatic airborne radar technology.</p>

          <p>The UK government, led by Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, is set to require builders to install solar panels on the "vast majority" of new build homes in England, aiming to reduce carbon emissions and lower energy bills for households. The new regulations, to be included in the Future Homes Standard, will mandate solar panels unless buildings fall under specific exemptions. The government anticipates that solar panels could save the typical household £500 annually on energy bills. While the Home Builders Federation supports the move, they caution against overly burdensome paperwork that could hinder efforts to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029.</p>

          <p>A recent large-scale Russian attack involving drones and missiles across Ukraine has resulted in at least three deaths and numerous injuries, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The aerial raids targeted Kyiv, Lutsk, and the Ternopil region, causing damage to homes, schools, and government facilities. Russia's defense ministry claimed to have shot down 174 Ukrainian drones and intercepted Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles. This attack follows Ukraine's largest long-range drone strike on Russian warplanes at military bases. The situation remains tense with ongoing air raid alerts in multiple cities.</p>

          <p>India's central bank has implemented a larger-than-expected interest rate cut, lowering the benchmark policy rate to 5.5%, the lowest level since August 2022. This marks the third consecutive rate cut since February, driven by softened inflation and slower-than-expected growth amid global uncertainty. While the central bank maintained its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%, it acknowledged concerns about potential tariffs from the United States. The decision also comes as India's inflation is largely on a downtrend, which also affords the RBI room to cut rates. Given the outsized cut in the policy rate, the RBI said that there is limited room for monetary policy to support growth, and will change its monetary policy stance to "neutral" from "accommodative."

This measure comes amid growing public concern about sewage spills and rising bills, while water companies have paid out significant rewards to executives over the past decade. The ban, backdated to April 2024, allows regulator Ofwat to claw back bonuses or take enforcement action. Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized that the era of profiting from pollution is over, though concerns remain about companies potentially circumventing the ban by raising base salaries.</p>

          <p>Despite a recent call between U.S. and Chinese presidents, a global shortage of rare earth exports persists, potentially halting production of cars and other industrial parts this summer. China's restrictions on rare earth elements, used in weapons, cars, and high-tech products, continue despite a breakthrough trade agreement. While some Chinese suppliers have received export licenses, many U.S. companies anticipate running out of supplies within three months. The situation extends beyond the U.S., with European auto parts companies already halting production. Further trade talks may lead to some easing of restrictions in exchange for the U.S. easing tech export restrictions to China.</p>
