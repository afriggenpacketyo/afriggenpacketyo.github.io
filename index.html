          <p>SoFi CEO Anthony Noto announced that the fintech bank will re-enter the cryptocurrency investment business this year, reversing its 2023 exit due to stricter federal oversight. This decision follows new guidance from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, allowing OCC-regulated banks to operate in crypto businesses. SoFi plans a comprehensive push into cryptocurrency, integrating blockchain capabilities across its product lines, including potential crypto-backed lending and payments. The company anticipates offering crypto investing by year-end, aiming to leverage crypto technology across lending, savings, spending, and investing services. Optimism score: 75</p>

          <p>General Motors exceeded Wall Street's first-quarter earnings expectations but is reassessing its full-year financial guidance and suspending stock buybacks due to potential cost increases from ongoing auto tariffs imposed by President Trump. CFO Paul Jacobson stated that the impacts of the tariffs could be significant, rendering the previous guidance unreliable. While GM believes it can offset some tariff costs, the company is deferring major manufacturing changes until there is more clarity on the economic and regulatory environment. GM's first-quarter results showed a decrease in profit margins compared to the previous year, citing negative impacts from foreign exchange and increased labor and warranty expenses.

          <p>Economists are raising concerns about President Trump's economic policies after his first 100 days in office, noting that his trade, immigration, and spending measures have not stimulated growth and may reignite inflation. Business surveys suggest a slowing economy, with potential for recession due to tariffs, which are disrupting supply chains and raising consumer prices. While the White House defends its "America First" policies, critics argue that tariffs are causing economic harm. Despite some businesses investing in domestic manufacturing, economists warn that tariffs could lead to empty shelves and increased consumer costs. Optimism score: 40</p>

Despite differing views on the root causes of U.S.-China tensions, there is a general agreement that Trump's unpredictable approach and "America First" doctrine have exacerbated superpower rivalry and market volatility.

          <p>Canada's Liberal Party, led by Prime Minister Mark Carney, secured a victory in the recent federal election, a turnaround attributed to President Trump's territorial threats and tariff policies. Trump's repeated suggestions of annexing Canada and imposing tariffs significantly influenced voters, overshadowing domestic issues like affordability and immigration. Carney emphasized the end of Canada's traditional relationship with the U.S. and the need for self-reliance. The Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, lost his parliamentary seat, and Trump's continued interference in the election through social media posts further fueled the Liberal win.

          <p>Brendan Cox, the husband of murdered MP Jo Cox, is urging the rap group Kneecap to issue a "real apology" after footage emerged of the band allegedly calling for MPs to be killed. Cox criticized the band's initial apology, stating that it didn't adequately address the gravity of their words. Kneecap has defended themselves, claiming the footage was taken out of context and asserting they would never incite violence against any MP or individual. The footage is currently being assessed by counter-terrorism police, and Cox expressed willingness to meet with the band if they genuinely reflect on the implications of their statements.

          <p>Fifty years after the end of the Vietnam War, former American buildings in Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City, serve as a window into the nation's evolution. These structures, once occupied by U.S. agencies, now house Vietnamese families and businesses, reflecting the transition from postwar deprivation to economic growth. However, lingering distrust from the war and regional divisions persist. Buildings like the Pittman, formerly used by the CIA, and the U.S. Information Service office now blend into the modern metropolis, revealing the complexities of Vietnam's past and present.
