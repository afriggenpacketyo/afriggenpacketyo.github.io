          <p>Dan Evans, ranked 199th in the world, secured a straight-set victory against Frances Tiafoe at Queen's Club, marking one of his best performances in years. Evans, who received a wildcard entry, capitalized on Tiafoe's struggles on grass, playing aggressively and effectively throughout the match. He attributed his improved play to not overthinking, a problem he has faced recently, and expressed gratitude for the supportive home crowd. Evans also reflected on his recent experience partnering with Andy Murray at the Paris Olympics, calling it one of the best experiences of his career, adding to the significance of his win at the arena named after Murray, as this win is a testament to his enduring career and the inspiration he draws from Murray and the British tennis community.

          <p>Following the fatal shootings of Minnesota state Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, and the wounding of state Senator John Hoffman and his wife, House Republicans held a "tense" conference call to discuss security concerns. Many members expressed feeling unsafe in their districts and requested increased protection, specifically requesting police presence outside their homes at all times. Law enforcement officials responded that providing such extensive security would require additional funding from Congress. Vance Boelter, the suspect, faces multiple federal charges in what is being described as a planned campaign of violence against Minnesota legislators, prompting increased security measures and a postponement of a town hall event by a Michigan representative.</p>

          <p>Israel attacked Iranian state television and warned hundreds of thousands of Tehran residents to evacuate following another wave of Iranian missile strikes that killed at least eight Israeli civilians. The Israeli military claimed Iran deliberately targeted civilians, while Israel focused on military targets and capabilities designed to destroy Israel. Israel's defense minister stated Tehran residents would "pay the price" for Iranian strikes on Israeli civilians, and the U.S. State Department raised its travel advisory for Israel to the highest level, advising citizens not to travel there. The fighting has also led to the cancellation of nuclear program talks between the U.S. and Iran, with both sides trading accusations and warnings amid escalating violence.</p>

          <p>Vance Luther Boelter has been charged with murder following targeted shootings that killed Minnesota State Representative Melissa Hortman and injured State Senator John Hoffman and their spouses. Boelter, who was dressed as a police officer, allegedly went to the homes of the lawmakers, where he shot the victims; he also visited the residences of two other Minnesota state legislators on the night of the shootings but did not enter. Investigators found a document in Boelter's vehicle listing other lawmakers and officials, with sources saying the list included more than 50 individuals, including abortion rights advocates and facilities. Authorities are investigating whether Boelter knew Hoffman or Hortman personally, and the incident has sparked widespread condemnation of political violence.</p>

          <p>United Launch Alliance (ULA) delayed the second flight carrying Amazon's Project Kuiper internet satellites due to an issue with the rocket booster. The launch was scrubbed with roughly 30 minutes left in the countdown due to an elevated purge temperature within the Atlas V rocket's booster engine. ULA CEO Tory Bruno indicated the issue involved a GN2 purge line that could not be resolved quickly, necessitating a stand-down for the day; a new launch date will be provided later. This launch from Florida's Space Coast was originally scheduled for the previous Friday but was rescheduled due to inclement weather, adding to the setbacks for Amazon's satellite internet project.</p>

He reiterated that Iran had a 60-day window to negotiate a new nuclear deal, which he believes could have prevented the current fighting. Trump emphasized the U.S.'s continued support for Israel but declined to specify what military support the U.S. is providing. Reports indicate that Iran has been sending messages through Arab intermediaries expressing a willingness to return to negotiations if the U.S. does not join Israel in its attacks, as the situation remains tense between the two nations.</p>

AMD recently unveiled its next-generation artificial intelligence chips, the Instinct MI400 series, and a full-server rack called Helios, which analysts believe will be pivotal for AMD Instinct growth.

          <p>This article explores the potential monthly payments from a $400,000 annuity purchased at age 65, noting that payouts can range from approximately $2,246 to $2,590 based on factors such as gender, interest rates, and annuity type. Higher interest rates make annuities more attractive now, but monthly checks are influenced by life expectancy, the choice between single or joint life annuities, and optional features like cost-of-living adjustments. While annuities offer guaranteed income and financial security, they also come with trade-offs, including illiquidity and potentially lower returns compared to other investments, thus requiring careful consideration of individual financial circumstances and retirement goals.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Google issued an apology and incident report for a major cloud outage that affected over 70 Google cloud services and numerous third-party services, including Cloudflare, OpenAI, and Shopify. The outage was attributed to multiple layers of flawed recent updates, specifically a new feature in its "quota policy checks" that was not adequately tested in real-world situations. The company acknowledged that it did not use feature flags, an industry best practice that could have prevented the widespread impact. Google plans to change its architecture to improve system resilience and enhance communication with customers during incidents.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump reiterated his intention to conduct mass deportations in major U.S. cities, particularly those run by Democrats, citing the presence of "sanctuary cities." He directed Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to focus on cities like New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles, accusing Democrats of using illegal immigration to influence elections and expand the welfare state. This announcement follows protests against his administration's immigration policies, though Trump recently shifted his stance on undocumented workers in the farming and hospitality sectors. Trump's stance underscores his commitment to an aggressive deportation strategy despite pushback from various communities and sectors.</p>
