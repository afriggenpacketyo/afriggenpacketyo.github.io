          <p>The head of Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) warned that some young people are forming groups to commit serious crimes after being radicalized by far-right ideologies. This follows a police crackdown on a far-right extremist cell with members as young as 14. Additionally, train services at Hamburg's main station have returned to normal after a knife attack by a female suspect injured 18 people. The police are investigating the suspect's motives for the attack.</p>

NHS England believes the new units will reduce hospital overcrowding and relieve pressure on emergency services, including the police.

          <p>South Africa has downgraded Taiwan’s representative office as it deepens ties with Beijing. The office has been relocated from Pretoria to Johannesburg, signaling a shift in diplomatic relations. Meanwhile, Somalia has banned Taiwanese passport holders in response to Taiwan's growing ties with Somaliland.

This contradiction highlights a broader reluctance to confront societal entanglement with state violence and genocide, with some of Germany’s wealthiest families having built their empires on Nazi collaboration.</p>
