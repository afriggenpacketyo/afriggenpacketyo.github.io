          <p>SoFi CEO Anthony Noto announced that the fintech bank plans to re-enter the cryptocurrency investing business this year, reversing its 2023 exit that was a condition of receiving a bank charter. This decision follows new guidance from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) allowing OCC-regulated banks to operate in crypto businesses. SoFi aims to integrate crypto and blockchain capabilities across its product areas, potentially including borrowing against crypto holdings and using crypto for payments. Noto anticipates offering crypto investing by year-end and is considering acquisitions to accelerate this expansion.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's second term has been marked by a torrent of executive actions aimed at overhauling the federal government and pushing his cultural agenda. However, his economic promises have not materialized, with polls indicating broad economic anxiety among Americans. Trump's approval rating is the lowest of any president in the past 80 years, and his attempts to bend institutions into submission have faced pushback from the courts. Meanwhile, the Democratic Party is undergoing soul-searching amid intraparty tensions and debates over messaging and leadership.</p>

          <p>Despite overall disapproval of President Trump's handling of the economy, tariffs, and stock market, his 2024 voters express strong confidence in his economic policies. Many believe Trump will turn things around and strengthen the economy, although some acknowledge concerns about potential short-term challenges. While some voters have mixed feelings about Trump's stances on LGBTQ issues and abortion, they generally support his border crackdown and believe tariffs will ultimately bring jobs back to America.

While Trump defends his actions as fulfilling his campaign promises, critics argue that he is pushing the limits of presidential power and undermining the system of checks and balances.

          <p>Canada's Liberal Party, led by Mark Carney, has won the recent election, marking a significant turnaround amid threats and tariffs from US President Donald Trump.

          <p>Canadian Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre has lost his seat in the House of Commons, a significant blow as Mark Carney's Liberal Party secures a victory. Poilievre's defeat comes after his party failed to win the election, with voters seemingly swayed by President Trump's trade tariffs and threats against Canada. Poilievre, who had held his seat since 2005, faced challenges from local advocates seeking electoral reform and struggled to distance himself from Trump's policies. Despite the personal setback, the Conservatives are set to remain in opposition as the second-largest party.</p>

Businesses express concerns about the impact of tariffs, and consumers are skeptical about Trump's ability to tackle inflation.

          <p>A fire at an electricity substation in Maida Vale, London, led to the evacuation of a nearby block of flats. Approximately 80 residents were safely evacuated after the roof of the building caught alight. No injuries were reported, and the fire brigade urged local residents to keep their doors and windows closed. UK Power Networks stated that the fire was caused by a fault on a piece of equipment in its substation, which remained operational, and there was no interruption to the electricity supply.</p>

The incident, described as a 50- to 100-year event, affected traffic lights, trains, businesses, and communications.</p>

          <p>Shipments of goods from China to the U.S. are dropping sharply due to the Trump administration's high tariffs, leading U.S. retailers to warn of potential supply shortages. U.S. import duties on Chinese products now stand at 145%, causing a significant decrease in cargo flow. Retailers had previously rushed to import goods ahead of the tariffs, but now face the prospect of empty shelves and higher prices for consumers. Logistics groups report sharp declines in cargo shipments from China, with some importers pausing shipments until there is more clarity on the tariff plans.</p>

          <p>PayPal reported better-than-expected earnings for the first quarter, but missed on revenue and reaffirmed its guidance for 2025 due to macro uncertainty. While sales increased just 1%, PayPal said the results reflect a strategy to prioritize profitability over volume, rolling off lower-margin revenue streams. The company's key measure of profitability, transaction margin dollars, grew 7% to $3.7 billion, marking the company's fifth consecutive quarter of profitable growth under CEO Alex Chriss. Total payment volume missed estimates, coming in at $417.2 billion, versus the nearly $418 billion analysts projected.</p>
