          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth refuted claims that he shared classified war plans regarding imminent U.S. airstrikes against Houthi militants in Yemen via the Signal messaging app. Hegseth accused former staffers, recently fired as part of a leak investigation, of intentionally leaking information to sabotage President Trump's agenda. He insisted the information shared was unclassified coordination for media purposes and that he looks at war plans every single day. Hegseth stated that the evidence would be handed over to the DOJ, and those responsible would be prosecuted if necessary. The controversy has led to calls for Hegseth's resignation, but Trump has expressed confidence in him. </p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced plans to phase out petroleum-based synthetic dyes from the U.S. food supply by the end of next year. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary cited concerns about the increasing exposure of American children to synthetic chemicals over the past 50 years. The changes will affect major food companies like PepsiCo, General Mills, Mars, and WK Kellogg, impacting products such as Flamin' Hot Cheetos and Skittles. The FDA is also initiating a process to revoke authorization of synthetic food colorings and requesting food companies to phase out red dye 3 by the end of next year, sooner than previously announced. </p>

Critics argue that these policies promote the "safe" use of drugs, while Newsom emphasizes the importance of accessible life-saving medications.

          <p>A jury concluded that The New York Times did not libel former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin in a 2017 editorial. Palin sued the Times for unspecified damages, claiming the editorial damaged her reputation after it incorrectly linked her political action committee to political rhetoric that enabled an atmosphere of violence. The Times corrected the article within 14 hours of publication. The jury found that the newspaper did not act with "actual malice," a necessary condition for a public figure to win a libel case. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration's plan to resume collecting defaulted college loan payments from millions of borrowers could contribute to an economic slowdown. Roughly 5 million borrowers will have their loans sent for collections beginning on May 5, with wage garnishments potentially reducing consumer spending. Experts warn that this policy could damage borrowers' credit scores and hinder their ability to make large purchases. While the policy will increase government revenue, it also adds financial strain to borrowers amid economic uncertainty. </p>

Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch accused the government of a U-turn, highlighting the need for the Supreme Court to provide clarity on the issue.

U.S. ETFs tracking the price of spot bitcoin logged significant inflows. Bitcoin's decoupling from risk assets has become more apparent, surpassing gold's gains in April. Analysts note that while bitcoin's correlation with equities historically approaches 1.0 during macro sell-offs, its current correlation with the S&P is lower. This shift suggests a growing perception of bitcoin as a safe-haven asset. (not investment advice)</p>

These creators, often not lawyers themselves, have amassed large followings by offering a populist message of transparency and accessibility to legal information. The fascination with lawsuits, particularly celebrity cases like the one between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, stems from a desire for unfiltered information and a rejection of traditional media's perceived gatekeeping.
