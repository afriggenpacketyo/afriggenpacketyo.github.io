        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In conflict and refugee areas worldwide, such as Gaza, Ukraine, and Rohingya camps in Bangladesh, children are using play as a vital tool for emotional survival. Psychologists emphasize that activities like creating makeshift toys or playing traditional games help them process trauma, manage stress, and reclaim a sense of normalcy amid instability. Organizations like BRAC and Save the Children facilitate these activities, observing how play transforms withdrawn children, allowing them to express themselves and find joy despite harsh circumstances. This therapeutic power of play is a historical constant, providing resilience and a sense of belonging for young people affected by war and displacement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two years after the October 7 attacks, assessments indicate that while Israel's military campaign has significantly degraded Hamas's senior leadership and heavy weaponry, the group remains operational. Despite Israeli claims of high casualty counts, independent and intelligence estimates suggest lower numbers, with Hamas possibly having recruited thousands of new fighters. The group has adapted its strategy, shifting from direct confrontation to decentralized guerrilla warfare and hit-and-run tactics, occasionally re-emerging in areas previously cleared by the Israeli military. While its capacity for civilian governance in Gaza has been severely crippled, Hamas's survival is viewed by the group itself as a form of victory.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The fire brigade in Wiesbaden, Germany, was dispatched four times in a single day to investigate reported gas leaks that were ultimately caused by the potent odor of durian fruit. In one instance, the smell from the exotic fruit in an Asian supermarket was circulated by a shopping center's ventilation system, causing alarm among visitors. Later that evening, residents of an apartment building also reported a gas smell, only to discover a neighbor had brought home a durian. Fire officials confirmed no gas was detected in any of the incidents, highlighting the fruit's notoriously strong and deceptive aroma.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has authorized the deployment of 300 National Guard troops to Chicago to address crime and protect federal assets, a move criticized by state and local leaders as an abuse of power. The decision followed a confrontation where immigration authorities reported being rammed by vehicles and shooting an armed woman. This action is part of a broader strategy of sending federal forces to Democrat-led cities, which has sparked legal and constitutional challenges, including a temporary block on a similar deployment in Portland, Oregon. The White House maintains the deployment is necessary to quell "violent riots and lawlessness," despite data showing a decrease in Chicago's homicide rate.</p>

          <p>Hopes for a ceasefire are focused on talks in Egypt, where delegations from Israel and Hamas have arrived to negotiate a US-proposed peace plan aimed at ending the war and securing a hostage release. The diplomatic efforts, supported by the US, Egypt, and Germany, proceed even as Israeli strikes continue in Gaza and the Israel Defense Forces intercepted a missile launched by Houthi rebels from Yemen. While both sides have expressed some optimism, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insists Hamas will be disarmed either diplomatically or militarily. The talks represent a critical juncture in the prolonged conflict, with significant international pressure for a resolution.</p>

          <p>As part of its 15th and largest-ever Arctic Ocean scientific expedition, China has successfully completed its first manned deep dive beneath the polar ice. The operation was also the world's first coordinated mission involving both crewed and uncrewed submersibles in the polar region. A fleet including the icebreakers Xue Long 2 and Jidi supported the Jiaolong manned submersible. Researchers utilized this advanced capability to collect hundreds of deep-sea samples and gather extensive data on biodiversity, ocean conditions, and water chemistry, advancing China's scientific presence and understanding of the strategically important region.</p>

          <p>A terror attack at a Manchester synagogue on Yom Kippur resulted in the deaths of two worshippers, Melvin Cravitz and Adrian Daulby, and left three others seriously injured. The suspect, 35-year-old Jihad Al-Shamie, was shot and killed by police after ramming a car into people and attempting to enter the building with a knife. One of the deceased, Mr. Daulby, was tragically hit by police gunfire as he helped secure the synagogue's doors against the attacker. Police believe the attacker, a British citizen of Syrian descent, may have been influenced by extremist ideology and was on bail for an alleged sexual assault at the time of the incident.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece suggests that anti-Trump "blue states" should engage in their own form of political theater by declaring a national emergency and forming an interstate compact. This body, modeled on historical American acts of resistance like the Continental Congress, would draft a declaration of rights and obligations for its member states. The proposed compact would outline a budget and specific programs, effectively creating a prototype for a post-Trump American government that prioritizes social welfare, healthcare, and scientific advancement. The author argues that such a bold, norm-breaking act would shift the political focus away from Trump and demonstrate a proactive vision for the country's future.</p>

          <p>Despite co-signing a 2009 letter urging action on climate change, President Donald Trump has become a fervent advocate for fossil fuels, actively working to dismantle the clean energy sector. His administration has halted approved offshore wind projects, banned renewables on federal land, and eliminated subsidies, causing the cancellation of over $22 billion in clean energy investments. This stance contrasts sharply with global trends, where investment in renewables now doubles that of fossil fuels, and puts the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage, particularly against China.

To secure a majority, they must also defend seats and flip at least one Republican-held seat in increasingly red states like Ohio, Iowa, or Texas. This steep electoral challenge is why much of the political focus remains on the more fluid battle for control of the House of Representatives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A contributor reflects on the release of Raquel Reyes, the 2026 American Girl of the Year, and her connection to the historical character Samantha Parkington. The author praises how Raquel's story explores Mexican American heritage and intergenerational legacy, continuing Samantha's theme of compassion. However, the article criticizes Mattel for making Raquel physically resemble a previous Latina doll, Maritza Ochoa, thereby failing to represent the diverse appearances within the Latino community. The piece also argues that Maritza's own story missed an opportunity to more deeply explore the plight of Dreamers, urging American Girl to continue telling bold stories of underrepresented girls.</p>

          <p>A pirate flag from the popular Japanese anime series "One Piece" has become a unifying symbol for Gen Z-led protests across the globe, from Nepal and Indonesia to Madagascar and Morocco. The flag, featuring a skull and crossbones in a straw hat, represents the show's protagonists, a group of rebels fighting an oppressive world government. Young protesters who feel unheard by their own governments identify with the anime's core themes of freedom, justice, and challenging corrupt authority. This adoption of a pop culture icon serves as a powerful, non-verbal signal of solidarity among different youth movements fighting for local causes under a shared global narrative.</p>

          <p>The UK Conservative Party has unveiled an aggressive immigration plan, pledging to remove 750,000 people who are in the country illegally over a five-year period. The proposal, announced at the party's annual conference, includes banning anyone who enters the UK without permission from ever claiming asylum and replacing court appeals with an internal Home Office process. A rebranded "Removals Force" would be tasked with deporting at least 150,000 people annually to their home countries or "safe" third countries. This policy shift, which includes leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, is seen as an effort to counter the challenge from the right-wing Reform UK party.</p>

Germany is working to enhance its drone defense capabilities, with Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt proposing a joint defense unit. The incidents, which have caused airport shutdowns in Munich, are fueling a debate about national security and the responsibilities of federal police versus the military in handling this new form of potential hybrid warfare.</p>

          <p>Severe monsoon rains in Nepal have triggered deadly landslides, flash floods, and lightning strikes, resulting in at least 22 deaths and leaving 12 people missing. The eastern Ilam district was hit hardest, with multiple villages swept away and 18 fatalities reported, including six members of a single family whose home was buried. The heavy rainfall has disrupted domestic flights and blocked major highways, cutting off the capital, Kathmandu, and hampering rescue and relief efforts.

          <p>Syria is conducting its first parliamentary elections since the fall of longtime leader Bashar Assad, though the process is not a direct popular vote. Instead, two-thirds of the 210-seat assembly are being chosen by electoral colleges in each district, with the remaining third appointed directly by the interim president. The interim government cited the massive displacement of citizens from the civil war as a barrier to creating an accurate voter registry for a popular election. The results are being watched as an indicator of the new authorities' commitment to inclusivity, particularly regarding women and minorities, in a still-fragile post-conflict environment.</p>

          <p>Despite a recent surge in sales, the U.S. is lagging behind other major markets like China and Europe in the transition to electric vehicles. While battery and hybrid cars accounted for a record 10% of U.S. sales in August, this was largely driven by a government subsidy that has now expired, with automakers expecting a sharp decline in demand. Analysts attribute the slower adoption in the U.S. to weaker government support, higher average vehicle costs, and the absence of affordable Chinese brands due to high tariffs. The policy shift under the Trump administration away from EV incentives is expected to further widen the gap with global competitors. (not investment advice)</p>

The club's growth has been tempered by the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules, forcing a more gradual build than that of previous disruptors like Manchester City.
