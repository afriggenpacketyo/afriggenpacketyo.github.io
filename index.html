          <p>Ukraine's military reported a successful strike on a key Russian chemical plant in Bryansk using UK-made Storm Shadow missiles, assessing the outcome of the "massive" attack. This facility is crucial to Moscow's military-industrial complex, producing explosives and rocket fuel. Hours later, Russia launched extensive drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian regions, causing six deaths, including children, and damaging thermal power plants. The strike coincided with European leaders vowing to increase economic pressure on Russia until peace is achieved.</p>

Despite pre-tax profit slightly missing expectations, investment banking income increased by 8% year-on-year. This move reflects a trend of strong investment banking returns boosting European financial stocks this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time, a study has ranked the physical side effects of various antidepressants, highlighting substantial differences in their impact on patients during the initial eight weeks of treatment. Researchers found some drugs could cause up to 2kg weight gain or alter heart rates by 21 beats per minute. This critical research, published in The Lancet, emphasizes the importance of matching antidepressants to individual patient needs and health conditions. Experts advise against stopping medication but encourage informed discussions with practitioners about personalized treatment options.</p>

          <p>Experts at the Cyber Monitoring Centre (CMC) estimate the cyber attack on Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) will cost approximately £1.9 billion, making it the UK's most economically damaging cyber event. The hack, which began in September, halted JLR's production for five weeks and affected around 5,000 businesses in its supply chain. A full recovery is not anticipated until January 2026, with over half the costs borne by JLR. The CMC, an independent non-profit, urges organizations to bolster network protection and contingency plans.</p>

          <p>The UK's annual inflation rate unexpectedly held steady at 3.8% in September for the third consecutive month, contrary to Bank of England (BOE) predictions. Core inflation slightly decreased to 3.5%. Rising petrol prices and airfares were offset by lower costs for recreational items and a drop in food prices. Economists suggest the BOE is unlikely to cut interest rates from 4% soon, with some forecasting a potential upward move due to persistent inflation and sticky wage growth.

          <p>US Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley stated he may "never get over" his team's defeat to Europe at Bethpage in September, describing the aftermath as one of the toughest times in his life. Bradley, the youngest captain since 1963, acknowledged making "wrong calls" regarding pairings and course setup. Despite a dramatic final-day comeback, the USA faced an insurmountable deficit after Europe's dominant first two days. Bradley, who has now lost three Ryder Cups as player or captain, remains committed to future participation despite his profound disappointment.</p>

This year, Iceland experienced unusually high temperatures, exceeding 20C for ten consecutive days in some areas.

          <p>Demolition has commenced on a portion of the White House's East Wing to make way for President Trump's proposed ballroom addition, despite his earlier assurances it wouldn't interfere with the existing structure. Trump stated the project, which he claims is privately funded at $250 million, aims to provide a larger venue for state functions and dignitaries. The ballroom is intended to accommodate 999 people. This development comes amidst concerns from historic preservation groups that the addition's size could overwhelm the White House's classical design.</p>

          <p>Israel's military identified the bodies of two hostages, Arie Zalmanowicz and Master Sergeant Tamir Adar, returned by Hamas under a US-brokered ceasefire. Zalmanowicz, 85, was abducted and died in captivity, while Adar, 38, was killed fighting during the October 7 attack. This brings the total identified deceased hostages returned to 15 out of 28. Outrage persists in Israel over Hamas's failure to return all remains, which the group attributes to difficulties locating bodies. The ceasefire has also seen increased aid and some troop withdrawal, despite recent flare-ups.</p>

          <p>Paul Ingrassia, President Trump's nominee for the Office of Special Counsel, withdrew his consideration after offensive text messages became public, prompting a GOP Senate revolt. The texts reportedly included Ingrassia stating the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday should be "tossed into the seventh circle of hell" and describing himself as having "a Nazi streak." Senate Majority Leader John Thune urged the White House to withdraw the nomination, with several Republican senators refusing support. Democrats are now calling for Ingrassia's dismissal from his current White House liaison position.</p>

          <p>Japan's overall exports rose 4.2% year-on-year in September, snapping a four-month decline, driven by strong growth in shipments to Asia, particularly mainland China. However, exports to the U.S., Japan's second-largest trading partner, dropped by 13.3%, including a significant fall in auto shipments, despite a trade deal that lowered US tariffs. This data comes as Sanae Takaichi became Japan's first female prime minister, with her loose monetary policy stance expected to weaken the yen and potentially benefit exporters.

A hurricane watch is issued for Haiti's southern coast, and a tropical storm watch for Jamaica. While unlikely to impact the mainland U.S., its path and intensity remain uncertain, with some models suggesting a turn towards Central America or the Gulf.</p>

          <p>A new theory by NASA astrophysicist Robin Corbet suggests that extraterrestrial civilizations (ETCs) might not possess wildly advanced technology like warp drives, explaining the lack of alien encounters. Corbet's "radical mundanity" principle posits that ETCs' technology is likely only slightly more advanced than ours. This idea offers a less terrifying explanation for the Fermi Paradox, suggesting that vast distances and technological limitations might prevent large-scale interstellar travel or interference.

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned gambling advertisements from Kwiff and Betway featuring Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton and the Chelsea football club logo. The ban stems from concerns that these figures strongly appeal to individuals under 18. Kwiff's X post with Hamilton and Betway's YouTube advert with Chelsea branding were deemed problematic. The ASA highlighted Hamilton's significant youth following and appearances in child-rated media. Both companies were warned against using characters with strong appeal to minors, and Kwiff has since removed such content.</p>
