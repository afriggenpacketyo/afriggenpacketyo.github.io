        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>State Farm customers in California will face a 17% increase in homeowners insurance premiums following a judge's ruling, granting the company a $400 million cash infusion to address financial distress caused by Los Angeles wildfires. The California Insurance Commissioner adopted the decision amidst backlash from fire survivors and state senators concerned about insurance payment delays. While the increase, effective June 1, is lower than State Farm's initial 21.8% request, it aims to balance the company's financial recovery with protecting policyholders and the insurance market's integrity. State Farm has also agreed to refrain from implementing new non-renewal programs through 2025, offering some stability to its customers.</p>

          <p>Sony Group shares saw a rise of over 2% amid volatile trading following the announcement of a 250 billion yen share buyback and operating income that surpassed estimates. The company's operating income for the last three months of the financial year reached 203.6 billion yen, exceeding analyst expectations but showing an 11% decrease from the previous year. Sony also detailed a partial spinoff of its financial unit, planning to distribute over 80% of shares to shareholders through dividends. However, the outlook for the current financial year was less optimistic, with forecasted operating profit growth of only 0.3% due to the estimated impact of U.S. tariffs (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Family offices are experiencing rapid growth as the ultra-rich seek personalized wealth management services, but these offices are struggling to find qualified money managers. The demand for trusted advisors is high, with the number of family offices expected to increase significantly by 2030. However, family offices often prioritize trust and long-term relationships over other criteria, making hiring difficult. The wealthy are now offering higher compensation packages, including bonuses and co-investment opportunities, to attract and retain top talent. Young employees are often reluctant to work in family offices due to unclear corporate structures and the perception of it being a 'retirement job'.</p>

          <p>British businesses are expressing concerns that the UK government's plan to tighten immigration rules will lead to labor shortages, particularly in sectors like health and social care. The government aims to prioritize British workers by raising English-language requirements and skill levels for migrant workers. However, businesses fear that they will be unable to fill the gaps created by reduced immigration, as British workers are not readily available or willing to take on these roles. The care industry, already facing 131,000 vacancies, warns that these plans could have serious consequences and have negative impact on a sector already under immense pressure.</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez were resentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole, setting the stage for their potential release after more than three decades for killing their parents in their Beverly Hills mansion. The decision, by Judge Michael V.

They urged the court to reduce the brothers’ sentences for the 1989 killings. The brothers will appear before the board on June 13 as part of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s consideration of clemency.</p>

The proposed sale includes $1.32 billion for CH-47 F Chinook helicopters and $130 million for F-16 parts. Some Democrats have signaled potential hesitation due to concerns about the UAE's involvement in conflicts like the one in Sudan. Senator Chris Murphy has stated he will block arms sales to nations engaging in direct personal business with Trump, citing investments in Trump's crypto venture and the gift of a luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet from Qatar.</p>

This move comes after Putin undermined Zelenskyy's insistence on a full ceasefire before negotiations, and as both countries seek to gain support from President Trump. While the likelihood of Putin accepting the challenge is low, the situation underscores the intricate power dynamics at play. Both Russia and Ukraine are trying to align themselves with Trump, who has expressed interest in mediating the conflict.

However, this claim is disputed by South African officials and experts, who assert there is no persecution of white Afrikaners and that crime affects all races in South Africa. Critics argue that Trump is using the situation to position himself as a savior of white privilege and Christianity.

The proposal entails Iran enriching uranium to a low grade and then shipping it to other Arab countries for civilian use. The plan would be permanent, unlike the 2015 nuclear deal, and include on-the-ground representatives from other countries, possibly the United States, for oversight.</p>

          <p>U.S. retail egg prices experienced a slight decline in April, falling from record-high levels earlier this year, but they remain significantly higher than previous years. The average price for a dozen Grade A eggs dropped to $5.12 after reaching $6.23 in March. Despite the decrease, egg prices are still approximately 79% higher than the same month last year due to a persistent bird flu outbreak that has decimated egg-laying hen populations. Experts predict that egg prices may continue to fall in the coming months as consumer demand decreases and bird flu outbreaks subside, but the virus's unpredictable nature could cause prices to rise again.</p>

          <p>Casandra Ventura, known as Cassie, testified in the federal sexual assault and racketeering trial of Sean Combs, describing drug-fueled sexual assaults with male prostitutes that left her feeling 'disgusting' and 'humiliated'. She detailed how Combs allegedly dictated her sex acts and appearance, and how the sessions grew more elaborate over time. Ventura explained that she stayed in the relationship because she was in love with Combs and wanted to make him happy, but eventually recognized that he had become increasingly abusive. Combs's lawyers have argued that the acts were consensual, but Ventura repeatedly contended otherwise.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to significantly reduce tariffs on each other's imports and suspend some reciprocal duties for 90 days, following high-level trade talks in Switzerland. Under the agreement, the U.S. reduced tariffs imposed under President Trump's second presidency to 30 percent from 145 percent, while China lowered its retaliatory tariffs to 10 percent from 125 percent. However, both countries will retain some tariffs and nontariff measures, with further negotiations planned to address remaining issues. The discussions aim to improve the trade relationship between the world's two largest economies.</p>

          <p>Scientists have observed wild chimpanzees in Uganda using medicinal plants to treat wounds and injuries, showcasing a sophisticated understanding of natural remedies. Researchers filmed and recorded incidents of the animals applying plants to their own wounds and occasionally to those of others. This research builds on previous discoveries that chimpanzees seek out and consume certain plants for self-medication. The scientists also compiled decades of observations to create a catalogue of the various ways chimpanzees use 'forest first aid', adding to the growing body of evidence that primates use natural medicines to maintain their health in the wild.</p>

          <p>Families of victims of a Jeju Air plane crash in South Korea have filed a criminal complaint against 15 people, including the transport minister and the airline's CEO, for professional negligence. The complaint alleges that the crash, which killed 179 of the 181 people on board, was a 'major civic disaster caused by negligent management of preventable risks'. The families are calling for a more thorough investigation into the crash, questioning whether air traffic control responded appropriately and whether the reinforcement of a mound at the end of the runway violated regulations. The police had already opened a criminal investigation and barred the Jeju Air CEO from leaving the country.</p>

The case is being described as one of Britain's worst miscarriages of justice, and Mr. Sullivan may be in line for a £1 million payout. Additionally, research into new weight-loss drugs is being hailed as ushering in a 'golden age' of medicine, with potential to halve deaths from strokes and heart attacks.

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has voiced his displeasure with the UK government's decision to extend a second state visit invitation to President Trump, citing concerns about Canada's sovereignty. The invitation, extended by Sir Keir Starmer, has reportedly 'cut across clear messages' that the Canadian government was trying to convey to the White House regarding threats to Canadian statehood. In response, Carney has invited King Charles to open the Canadian parliament, a move seen as a 'clear message of sovereignty'. Despite tensions, negotiations between the US and Canada on trade and security are expected to continue.</p>

Each location was assigned names in Chinese characters, Tibetan, and pinyin, along with coordinates and a map.

On the same day that Washington and Beijing announced their truce on tariffs, a Chinese government policy-setting document warned that “external forces” posed increasing “threats to China’s frontier regions, border areas, and security in its surrounding areas.”</p>

          <p>President Trump's repeated descriptions of U.S. mediation efforts between India and Pakistan have hit sore spots in Indian politics, straining relations with a growing partner. India directly contradicted Trump's claims that he offered increased trade with India and Pakistan if they ceased hostilities, stating that the issue of trade did not come up in discussions. The Indian government's concerns stem from the Indian public's perception of their military effort and the fear of being seen as halting the confrontation under outside pressure. The overall U.S. messaging was seen as leaving India's political leaders vulnerable.</p>
