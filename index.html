          <p>Health officials have confirmed a measles case in an individual who traveled on an Amtrak train to Washington, D.C., potentially exposing other passengers. The D.C. Department of Health alerted the public about possible exposure locations, including the train, Union Station, and an urgent care center. This case arrives amid a surge in measles infections across the United States, with over 600 cases confirmed this year alone, surpassing the total for all of 2024. Officials urge individuals who may have been exposed to contact their healthcare providers, while emphasizing that vaccinated individuals are likely protected, as the measles vaccine is highly effective.</p>
