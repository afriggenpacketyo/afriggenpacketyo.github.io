After a disappointing start to the qualifiers, coach Julian Nagelsmann made several changes, with key substitutions ultimately turning the tide of the match. Florian Wirtz delivered a standout performance, scoring a crucial free kick that highlighted his world-class talent. The victory puts Germany back on track, setting up a significant final qualifying game against Slovakia.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has publicly disputed the characterization of the Trump administration's trade tariffs as a tax on American consumers. In an interview, Bessent dismissed concerns from major companies that the tariffs would cost them billions, suggesting their warnings were worst-case scenarios for earnings calls. He defended the policy by pointing to strong GDP growth and a high stock market, despite data showing a loss of manufacturing jobs since the tariffs were announced.</p>

          <p>A Guardian editorial criticizes the Trump administration's recent military strike on a boat of alleged Venezuelan drug traffickers, arguing it transforms a failed metaphorical "war on drugs" into a literal and dangerous reality. The article contends that such actions set a precedent for extrajudicial military killings without due process, congressional approval, or a UN mandate. It suggests that this approach is counterproductive and that tackling the U.S. fentanyl epidemic requires addressing domestic demand and stemming the flow of American arms to cartels.</p>

The email contained malware linked by cyber analysts to APT41, a hacker group believed to be working for Chinese intelligence. The operation was apparently aimed at gaining insight into the Trump administration's strategies and recommendations for the contentious trade negotiations currently underway with Beijing, representing a significant cybersecurity threat.</p>

          <p>Over 15,000 people demonstrated in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to secure a deal for the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas. The protesters, including families of the hostages, expressed fears that an expansion of the war in Gaza will further endanger the lives of their loved ones. The demonstration reflects growing public pressure on the government to prioritize the return of the hostages over its stated goal of total military victory.</p>

          <p>The UK's Defence Secretary, John Healey, has confirmed that the government is considering an expansion of its use of military sites to accommodate asylum seekers. This initiative is part of a broader government effort to move people out of hotels, which has become a costly and politically sensitive issue. Officials are also looking at other "non-military" locations for temporary housing as part of a plan to accelerate the process of ending the reliance on hotel accommodations.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Rand Paul sharply criticized Vice President JD Vance for his comments supporting the extrajudicial killing of alleged drug traffickers by the U.S. military. Vance had called the recent strike on a Venezuelan boat the "highest and best use of our military." In response, Paul labeled the sentiment "despicable and thoughtless," championing the legal principle of due process and trial over immediate execution, and referencing the novel "To Kill a Mockingbird."</p>
