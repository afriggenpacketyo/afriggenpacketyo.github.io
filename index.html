          <p>The Trump administration is implementing stricter social media vetting for international students, leading embassies to halt scheduling student visa appointments. Correspondents discuss the drastic measures and the potential impact on U.S. universities if international students are banned. Additionally, Trump has threatened to cut federal funding to California over a high school trans athlete. The administration's focus on social media activity raises concerns about privacy and potential discrimination, while the threat to California highlights ongoing tensions over transgender rights.</p>

          <p>Dearica Hamby and Kelsey Plum showed promising chemistry in the Sparks' recent game against the Atlanta Dream, combining for 39 points in a narrow 88-82 loss.

          <p>Japan's parliament has passed a law requiring major firms to participate in a carbon emissions trading system starting in fiscal year 2026. The law targets companies producing significant amounts of carbon dioxide annually, aiming to advance decarbonization. Under the system, companies will receive emission allowances and can trade carbon credits if they exceed or fall below their limits. While designed to lower emissions, the new law may lead to increased costs for consumers due to decarbonization efforts.</p>

The expert also conducted an experiment indicating the bumper of Read's vehicle made contact with O'Keefe, corroborating the prosecution's timeline.

          <p>PDD Holdings, the Chinese owner of Temu, reported a significant drop in profit due to U.S. trade policies and domestic competition. The Trump administration's removal of the "de minimis" exemption, which allowed parcels under $800 to enter the U.S. without import duties, has impacted the company. Additionally, PDD faces intense price wars with rivals like Alibaba and JD.com in China, contributing to its financial struggles. The company's U.S.-listed shares experienced a sharp decline following the profit announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump cited the Chrisleys' treatment as unfair, echoing his broader critique of the justice system. The pardon aligns with Trump's pattern of granting clemency to individuals convicted of white-collar crimes.</p>
