          <p>In response to the decimated healthcare system in Gaza, the United Kingdom is preparing to evacuate a group of 30 to 50 critically ill and injured Palestinian children for medical treatment. This government-led operation, coordinated by several departments, will see the children selected by the World Health Organization and brought to the UK for care under the NHS. Given the challenges of returning to Gaza, it is understood that some of the children and their accompanying family members may enter the asylum system after their treatment is complete.</p>

          <p>Protesters across Israel engaged in a "day of stoppage," blocking major highways and closing businesses to demand the government reach a ceasefire deal with Hamas. The demonstrations mark an escalation in public frustration over the 22-month-long war and the fate of the remaining hostages held in Gaza. Organizers and families of hostages argue that military pressure is failing and that a negotiated agreement is the only way to bring the captives home, a stance that puts them at odds with Prime Minister Netanyahu's government.</p>

          <p>World number one Scottie Scheffler clinched victory at the BMW Championship after Scotland's Robert MacIntyre, who held a four-shot overnight lead, faltered in the final round. MacIntyre struggled from the start, finishing with a three-over-par 73, while Scheffler remained composed and sealed his win with a remarkable chip-in on the 17th hole. A visibly frustrated MacIntyre expressed his disappointment after the round, unable to explain why his performance collapsed under the pressure of the final day.</p>

          <p>Iraqi officials have started the difficult process of excavating a large sinkhole near Mosul, believed to be a mass grave containing the remains of thousands killed by the Islamic State group. The site, known as al-Khasfa, is considered one of the largest such graves in the country's modern history, with victims thought to include Iraqi security personnel and civilians. The initial phase involves collecting surface remains and building a DNA database from victims' families before a full, internationally-supported exhumation can proceed.</p>

          <p>A court-ordered ban on feeding pigeons in public spaces in Mumbai has ignited a fierce debate, pitting public health advocates against animal lovers and religious groups. Authorities imposed the ban due to health risks from pigeon droppings, which can spread disease, but faced protests from citizens who view feeding the birds as a pious duty or cultural tradition. The conflict highlights the challenge of balancing urban hygiene with long-standing cultural practices in a city where pigeon feeding spots are iconic heritage sites.</p>

          <p>Two of China's largest drug manufacturers, Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals and Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group, are anticipated to report substantial profit increases for the first half of the year. This growth is reportedly driven by the successful rollout of new, innovative drugs and increased revenue from technology licensing agreements. Analysts note that Hengrui is successfully shifting its business model, with revenue from higher-margin innovative drugs increasingly replacing its reliance on generic medications.
