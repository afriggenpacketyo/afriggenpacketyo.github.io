          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has officially suspended his campaign for reelection, citing financial difficulties as a primary reason for his withdrawal. In a video announcement, Adams explained that media speculation and the withholding of matching funds by the New York City Campaign Finance Board due to alleged rule violations have crippled his ability to fundraise effectively. Although his name will remain on the ballot, Adams stated he will serve out the remainder of his term but will not actively seek another, leaving the race open to other candidates without offering an endorsement.</p>

          <p>A shooting at a church in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan, resulted in at least one death and nine injuries during a Sunday worship service.

Several of the injured victims are reported to be in critical condition, and federal authorities, including the FBI, are assisting local law enforcement with the investigation into the tragic event.</p>

          <p>Republican congressional leaders, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, have indicated that they are open to debating the extension of Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits but insist it must happen after the immediate threat of a government shutdown is resolved. Democrats are pushing to include the subsidy extension in the government funding bill, warning that premiums could soar for millions if the credits expire at year's end. With a Tuesday deadline looming, the disagreement over the timing of this debate remains a major obstacle to reaching a funding agreement.</p>

          <p>During the first quarter of the game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, a heated skirmish broke out involving multiple players. The confrontation notably featured Eagles defensive back Quinyon Mitchell and Buccaneers offensive lineman Tristan Wirfs, during which Mitchell appeared to remove Wirfs' helmet. Despite the intensity of the altercation, which also involved quarterback Baker Mayfield, no penalties were issued to the primary players involved, though a teammate was flagged for an unrelated penalty on the same play.</p>

          <p>Moldova held critical parliamentary elections that are seen as a referendum on the nation's future alignment with either the European Union or Russia. Pro-EU President Maia Sandu has accused Moscow of "massive Russian interference," including spreading disinformation and attempting to buy votes to sway the outcome in favor of pro-Russian parties. The election is tightly contested between Sandu's Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) and a pro-Russian bloc, with the results poised to determine the country's geopolitical direction for years to come.</p>

          <p>The United States is evaluating a request from Ukraine for long-range Tomahawk missiles to aid in its defense against Russia, according to Vice President JD Vance. The request, initially made by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, proposes selling the missiles to European allies who would then transfer them to Ukraine. This potential policy shift comes as the Trump administration expresses growing frustration with Russia's refusal to engage in peace negotiations, signaling a possible escalation in the types of military support provided to Kyiv.</p>

          <p>Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, has called for an open debate within the Labour party on how to effectively challenge the rising popularity of Reform UK. Speaking at the party conference, Burnham warned against underestimating the "peril" Labour faces in upcoming elections and criticized what he described as a "climate of fear" that stifles internal dissent and honest discussion. His comments continue a pattern of challenging Sir Keir Starmer's leadership, emphasizing the need for a clearer narrative to connect with voters who feel left behind.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has publicly stated he is open to another round of discussions with U.S. President Donald Trump, citing "good memories" and a personal bond from their previous summits. This overture comes as North Korea has continued to advance its weapons programs and strengthen ties with Russia and China. However, Kim reiterated that his country's nuclear status is non-negotiable and a prerequisite for talks is Washington abandoning its "obsession with denuclearization," a stance the U.S. State Department has already rejected.</p>

          <p>A powerful protest movement led by Nepal's Gen Z has emerged, fueled by decades of frustration with political corruption, inequality, and a lack of future prospects. The demonstrations, which turned violent and resulted in dozens of deaths, were initially sparked by a government shutdown of social media platforms. The unrest led to the resignation of the Prime Minister and the formation of an interim government, with young activists now pushing for a complete democratic overhaul and rejecting the established political parties ahead of new elections.</p>

          <p>The UK government is providing a £1.5 billion loan guarantee for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to help the automaker and its supply chain manage the fallout from a major cyberattack. The attack has forced JLR to suspend production at its UK facilities for nearly a month, raising concerns that smaller suppliers could collapse. A local MP warned that further government assistance may be necessary and called the incident a "wake-up call" for British businesses to improve their cybersecurity defenses against increasingly frequent threats.</p>

Supporters argued the devices are harmful to the environment and microorganisms, while opponents criticized the move as an example of an overreaching "culture of prohibition."</p>

This ad-hoc expansion creates significant uncertainty and adds costs for European manufacturers, who worry that items like window frames or motorcycles could be unexpectedly hit with tariffs.
