          <p>President Trump's recent actions and statements suggest he may be considering a foreign policy approach where the United States, China, and Russia each dominate their respective spheres of influence. This vision involves normalizing commerce with Russia and urging China's leader to engage in deal-making. Trump's desire to expand America’s influence in the Western Hemisphere, including acquiring Greenland and exerting control over the Panama Canal, aligns with this concept. However, challenges arise as other nations resist U.S. dominance and China seeks to maintain its stakes in the Western Hemisphere.</p>

          <p>King Charles III's visit to Canada underscores Canada's sovereignty in light of suggestions from U.S. President Donald Trump that the U.S. annex its northern neighbor. Prime Minister Mark Carney invited Charles to deliver the speech from the throne, outlining the government's agenda for the new Parliament. The king's visit is intended to highlight the differences between Canada and the United States, reaffirming Canada's constitutional monarchy and distinct national identity. Despite this, the new U.S. ambassador to Canada dismisses the need for such messages.</p>

          <p>As the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art in Los Angeles approaches completion, George Lucas has reassumed control, parting ways with the museum's director and eliminating several positions. Lucas has appointed himself head of “content direction” and named Jim Gianopulos as interim chief executive. The museum aims to explore how narrative art influences societies, but questions remain about its mission and scope. The museum's collection will include items amassed by Lucas, including illustrations, comic books, and paintings.</p>

          <p>A semi-trailer truck driver, Sukhbir Singh, has been found guilty of dangerous driving causing death in a 2020 crash at a rural Manitoba highway intersection. Singh drove through a stop sign and collided with a pickup truck, resulting in the death of the 34-year-old driver, Andrew Labossiere. While the defence argued that the Crown's case relied on functioning warning signals, the judge based his decision on the fact that a reasonable person would have been highly attentive to their surroundings while driving a semi on a dark winter morning.</p>

Sexual orientation is a matter of fate, not choice, and is influenced by sex hormones. Sexual orientation is stable for life, and is not hereditary. Pheromones may be partly responsible for the development of sexual orientation. Our sexual preference does not change as we age, and there is no scientific evidence that conversion therapy works.</p>
