          <p>Terence Crawford delivered a career-defining performance by defeating Saúl "Canelo" Álvarez, establishing himself as the new face of boxing. With the win, Crawford made history as the first male boxer in the four-belt era to become an undisputed champion in three different weight divisions. He moved up two weight classes to challenge and dismantle Álvarez, who was widely considered the sport's biggest star. Crawford's victory in Las Vegas, broadcast globally on Netflix, cements his status as one of the greatest fighters of his generation, boasting an undefeated record of 42 wins.</p>

          <p>As President Trump undertakes a state visit to the United Kingdom, the trip casts a spotlight on his own family's immigration story. His mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, was a native Gaelic speaker from the Isle of Lewis in Scotland who emigrated to the United States in the 1920s. This personal history presents a notable contrast to his administration's hardline stance on immigration, particularly its efforts to curb what it terms "chain migration," the very process that allowed his mother and her siblings to build new lives in America. Despite his deep maternal roots, Trump is not expected to visit his mother's home island during this trip.</p>

          <p>The government-run tech incubator Cyberport is testing graphics processing units (GPUs) from four different mainland Chinese chipmakers for its AI Supercomputing Centre in Hong Kong. The move is a strategic effort to decrease reliance on chips from the American company Nvidia, particularly amid escalating U.S.-China trade tensions. According to its chief executive, Cyberport has been considering this diversification since it began installing Nvidia chips last year. The center's first phase of computing power currently relies on Nvidia's H800 chips, but future procurement will likely include Chinese-made alternatives based on performance and cost.</p>

          <p>While the United States has been working to expand cooperation with Central Asian nations on critical minerals, China appears to be solidifying its dominance in the region's rare earths sector. State-owned Chinese companies are actively investing in geological exploration and mining infrastructure, particularly in Uzbekistan, which has vast resources. For instance, China National Gold Group has an agreement for exploration, and other firms are building mining complexes and processing facilities. This strategic push is seen as an effort by Beijing to secure vital resources for its industries and limit the influence of other global powers in the region.</p>

This move followed Washington adding 23 Chinese firms to an "entity list," restricting their access to U.S. technology, signaling that a major breakthrough in the talks is unlikely.</p>

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein who died by suicide, has stated that Lord Mandelson should never have been appointed as the UK's ambassador to the United States. In an interview, Giuffre's brother criticized the appointment, suggesting it reflects deep-seated corruption in political systems. Lord Mandelson was recently dismissed from his role by the Prime Minister after emails were published revealing the extent of his relationship with Epstein, including urging the disgraced financier to seek early release from prison. The family called his firing a "step in the right direction" but argued it was not enough.</p>

In a statement, a spokesman for the People's Liberation Army's Southern Theatre Command issued a stern warning to the Philippines, urging Manila to "immediately stop provocations" and cease "bringing in external forces for backing." The patrol and accompanying rhetoric come shortly after Beijing announced plans for a national nature reserve at the contested Scarborough Shoal.

          <p>A thriving, complex economy operates behind the walls of prisons worldwide, involving governments, private corporations, and inmates themselves. Governments spend billions annually on incarceration, with a growing portion of services in countries like the U.S. and UK being outsourced to for-profit companies that manage everything from food to phone calls. Inside, organized crime syndicates run lucrative contraband and extortion rackets, while individual inmates engage in an informal marketplace where items like instant noodles serve as currency. This system is further complicated by prison labor programs that often pay inmates mere cents per hour for their work.</p>

          <p>A recent study indicates that cannabis use can be detrimental to female fertility by disrupting the development and genetic stability of egg cells. Researchers at a Toronto fertility center found that women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) with detectable THC in their system had a significantly lower rate of genetically healthy embryos. Laboratory tests on human eggs also showed that THC exposure led to more errors in chromosome distribution and defects in the egg cell's structure. These findings suggest that the substance's active ingredient interferes with processes crucial for successful fertilization and pregnancy, prompting experts to advise against its use for women trying to conceive.</p>

The 1935 laws arbitrarily stripped Jewish citizens and other groups of their rights, creating a distinction between "Reich citizens" and second-class "state citizens." Historians and critics draw parallels between this ideology and the rhetoric of the modern far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which distinguishes between "real Germans" and "passport Germans."

          <h2>Opinion: Trump's Perceived Weakness Emboldens Russia and Israel, Demanding a Stronger European Response</h2>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's leadership style, which projects an image of strength while often folding against determined adversaries, has created a vacuum in global leadership. The author contends that leaders like Russia's Vladimir Putin and Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu have exploited this perceived weakness, escalating conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East without fear of significant U.S. repercussions. Recent events, such as Russian drone incursions into Poland and an Israeli airstrike in Qatar, are presented as evidence of this dynamic. The piece calls for European democracies to stop deferring to Washington and take more decisive action to counter this growing global instability.</p>

          <p>King Charles III is set to host U.S. President Donald Trump for a state visit, employing a significant display of royal pageantry in what is seen as a key diplomatic effort by the UK government. The visit is carefully orchestrated to leverage Trump's known admiration for the monarchy, potentially serving as a "diplomatic ace card" on sensitive issues like trade and the war in Ukraine. Despite their differing views on topics such as the environment, the King is expected to remain scrupulously correct and civil, sticking to a government-approved script. The visit is largely ceremonial, taking place within the secure confines of Windsor rather than through public processions.</p>

          <p>The tradition of a pre-wedding celebration has evolved from a simple night out into elaborate, multi-day destination events, placing a significant financial burden on attendees. Many young adults report spending upwards of £1,000 on a single "hen" or "stag" party, with costs covering flights, accommodation, matching outfits, and activities. This escalating expense creates social pressure, as guests often feel obligated to attend to avoid upsetting friends, even if they cannot afford it. The article explores the common pitfalls of organizing these events, from budget disputes to the awkwardness of splitting bills, reflecting a broader trend of increasingly expensive friendship milestones.</p>

          <p>The article recounts the mysterious 2005 disappearance of George Smith, a 26-year-old man who went missing from a Royal Caribbean cruise ship during his honeymoon. His body was never found, but a large bloodstain on a lifeboat canopy below his cabin's balcony indicated foul play. The investigation, which the FBI officially closed in 2015 due to insufficient evidence, focused on a group of young men last seen with an intoxicated Smith in his cabin. The case remains unresolved, marked by questions about the men's conflicting accounts, a provocative videotape they made, and the enduring quest for answers by Smith's family.</p>

          <p>Ahead of high-level trade talks in Spain, China has publicly stated that progress is contingent on the continued operation of TikTok in the United States. A commentary in the Communist Party's official newspaper, People's Daily, emphasized that Washington must ensure "open, fair, non-discriminatory conditions" for Chinese companies. The article warned that if the U.S. continues to harm the legitimate interests of Chinese enterprises, Beijing will take necessary measures to protect them. This declaration firmly links the fate of the popular short-video app to broader economic negotiations over tariffs and export controls.</p>

          <p>Despite widespread optimism and record highs for the S&P 500 Index, Wall Street strategists are acknowledging a list of potential risks that could derail the current market rally. While many firms are raising their price targets for the index, they also cite several key concerns. These include potential weaknesses in the artificial intelligence investment theme, negative impacts from the ongoing trade war, rising government debt, and signs of a weakening U.S. labor market. For now, investors seem to be treating these issues as manageable, but the rich valuations in the market mean any one of these factors could trigger a significant downturn.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers overcame an early three-run deficit to defeat the San Francisco Giants 13-7, powered by a crucial six-run rally in the fifth inning. After struggling to capitalize on scoring opportunities early in the game, the Dodgers' offense finally broke through, turning a bases-loaded situation into a decisive lead. Teoscar Hernández led the charge with a go-ahead two-run double, part of a three-hit, three-RBI performance. The victory was a much-needed offensive showcase for the team, which had been playing inconsistently, and it helped maintain their 2.5-game lead in the National League West division standings.</p>

Emergency services discovered the body of a man during a search operation following the blast on Saturday afternoon.
