          <p>The Israeli army admitted its soldiers made mistakes in the killing of 15 emergency workers in southern Gaza on March 23rd, revising their initial account that the convoy approached suspiciously without lights. Mobile phone footage revealed the ambulances were clearly marked and had their lights on, contradicting the army's original claim. While the IDF insists some medics were linked to Hamas, they admit the emergency workers were unarmed when soldiers opened fire after misinterpreting their arrival as a threat. The Red Crescent and other international organizations are calling for an independent investigation into the incident.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has promised to protect UK businesses from potential harm resulting from newly imposed tariffs, particularly those from the United States.

The Trump administration is accusing South Sudan of refusing to accept its citizens who are being deported from the US. This action is the first of its kind since Trump returned to the White House and campaigned on an anti-immigration platform. The US grants Temporary Protected Status to foreign citizens who cannot safely return home due to war, natural disasters, or other extraordinary conditions.</p>

          <p>The Miss Ivory Coast pageant has banned wigs, weaves, and hair extensions to promote natural hair and beauty. The organizers want the candidates to showcase their natural beauty, whether with braids or straightened hair. The move aims to celebrate African beauty and has sparked debate across the country, where wigs and extensions are popular. The ban could have economic implications for the country's hair industry, which is worth more than $300 million a year.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is arguing that a federal judge does not have the authority to order the return of a Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The Justice Department is seeking to appeal the judge's order, stating that it is constitutionally intolerable to force the Executive to engage with a foreign power in a certain way. The man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was deported despite a 2019 ruling that protected him from deportation.</p>

          <p>The artist behind the official portrait of Donald Trump, which the president publicly criticized, says her business is now "in danger of not recovering". Sarah Boardman, the British artist who painted the Trump portrait, said she felt her "intentions, integrity, and abilities" had been "called into question" when the president criticized the oil painting. Boardman said that for the six years that the portrait hung in the Colorado State Capitol Building Rotunda, she received overwhelmingly positive reviews and feedback but now that has changed.</p>

          <p>Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek has introduced a new method to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The technique combines generative reward modelling (GRM) and self-principled critique tuning. The resulting DeepSeek-GRM models outperformed existing methods, achieving competitive performance with strong public reward models. This comes amid speculation about the start-up’s next move following the global attention garnered by the firm’s V3 foundation model and R1 reasoning model.</p>
