        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump has revived his proposal for publicly traded companies to report earnings on a semi-annual basis, rather than quarterly, arguing the change would save money and encourage long-term strategic focus. The suggestion, which would require SEC approval, has drawn mixed reactions from financial experts, with some supporting the idea to reduce short-term pressure on executives. However, critics argue that less frequent reporting would decrease transparency for investors and could lead to market instability, noting that the U.S. system is considered among the world's most reliable. The proposal would align U.S. practices more closely with those in the U.K. and European Union. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article critiques Donald Trump's reaction to the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, arguing that instead of fostering national unity, the president is sowing fear and division. The author contrasts the current response with the shared national mourning following assassinations in the 1960s, noting that Trump and his allies immediately blamed the "radical left" for the violence. The piece contends that Kirk's death is being weaponized to undermine free speech and create a climate of fear, rather than serving as a moment to reflect on the dangers of political violence. It expresses concern that these actions are eroding American democracy.</p>

          <p>A Colorado-based mother and influencer is offering advice on how families can save money on skiing and snowboarding trips, a notoriously expensive activity. She recommends taking advantage of programs like the Epic SchoolKids Colorado Pack and the Colorado Ski Country USA pass, which offer free or heavily discounted access for elementary school students. Additional cost-saving strategies include booking packages, skiing on weekdays, visiting smaller resorts, and renting gear for children who are still growing. Planning and booking well in advance of the season is also crucial to securing the best prices.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has expressed regret over appointing Peter Mandelson as his US ambassador, stating he would "never" have made the appointment had he known the full extent of Mandelson's relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The statement follows Starmer's decision to dismiss Mandelson after leaked emails revealed supportive messages sent to Epstein following his 2008 conviction. Starmer asserted that the emails showed a relationship far different from what was understood during the due diligence process and that the content conflicted with his government's stance on violence against women. The controversy has prompted an emergency debate in Parliament.</p>

          <p>Maurene Comey, a former federal prosecutor and the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging her termination was unlawful and politically motivated. The suit claims she was fired from the Southern District of New York without cause or due process, likely due to her father's contentious relationship with President Trump or her perceived political beliefs. Comey, who prosecuted high-profile cases involving figures like Jeffrey Epstein, argues that the firing undermines the principle of an independent justice system.

          <p>A senior aide to UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Paul Ovenden, has resigned after explicit and offensive text messages he sent eight years ago regarding veteran MP Diane Abbott were made public. In the messages, Ovenden recounted a graphic conversation among colleagues about Abbott. A spokesperson for the prime minister condemned the comments as "appalling and unacceptable," emphasizing Abbott's status as a trailblazer who has faced significant abuse. In his resignation statement, Ovenden apologized for the messages and stated he was stepping down to avoid distracting from the government's work.</p>

          <p>Activists who deny the results of the 2020 election are increasingly being appointed to local election boards in key states like Georgia and Arizona, raising concerns about potential partisan interference in future elections. These appointments are part of a broader "election integrity" movement, and voting rights advocates fear they could be used to disrupt election administration, challenge legitimate voters, and refuse to certify results. While some efforts to appoint these individuals have been legally challenged, the trend represents a strategy to potentially subvert the democratic process from within. This development is creating significant tension and legal battles at the local level ahead of the midterms.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce an interest rate cut this week, which would be the first since 2024, as concerns grow about potential downside risks to the economy and the job market. While a single small cut won't drastically change the financial landscape for consumers, it signals a shift in monetary policy. Financial advisors suggest that now is a good time for individuals to pay down high-interest variable debt, such as credit card balances, and to lock in high returns on savings with products like CDs before rates fall further. The move could also provide some relief to the housing market by lowering mortgage rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Sudan's 2018 peace agreement is at risk of breaking down after Vice President Riek Machar was charged with treason, effectively ending the country's transitional government of unity. The civil war, which began in 2013, has been rooted in ethnic and political rivalries between President Salva Kiir and Machar, leading to immense human suffering and displacement. Key provisions of the peace deal, such as integrating armed forces and holding elections, were never fully implemented. Analysts warn that the current political crisis could trigger renewed power struggles and further destabilize a nation already facing severe economic and humanitarian challenges.</p>

          <p>U.S. banks borrowed $1.5 billion from the Federal Reserve's Standing Repo Facility on Monday, a move that indicates some minor, temporary tightness in funding markets. The borrowing coincided with the deadline for quarterly corporate tax payments and a large settlement of U.S. Treasury securities, both of which increase the demand for cash. The repo facility acts as a backstop to ensure the financial system has adequate liquidity and prevents disruptive funding squeezes. Analysts view this level of borrowing as a sign of normal, manageable pressure rather than a cause for significant concern about the stability of the banking system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Authorities have arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson in connection with the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at an event at Utah Valley University. The suspect was apprehended after his father recognized him in photos released by law enforcement and urged him to surrender. Investigators believe the suspect acted alone in what they have described as a targeted attack, firing a single shot from the roof of a nearby building. While a motive has not been officially established, officials have noted that Robinson's family described him as having become more political in recent years, with ideologies differing from their own.</p>

          <p>A letter from U.S. President Donald Trump urging NATO allies to stop buying Russian energy is being viewed in Brussels as a rhetorical move unlikely to shift European policy. In the letter, Trump linked the imposition of "major sanctions" on Russia to a complete cessation of Russian energy purchases by all NATO members, including reluctant EU states like Hungary and non-EU member Turkey. Analysts suggest this sets an impossibly high bar, allowing the White House to shift blame for inaction onto its allies. European officials see the letter more as potential leverage to pressure Hungary and Slovakia rather than a guarantee of coordinated U.S. action.</p>

          <p>A prospective car buyer has shared their experience of a dealership adding a $1,000 surcharge for paying with cash instead of using the dealer's financing options. This practice highlights a shift in the automotive retail industry, where dealerships often earn significant profit from arranging loans, including kickbacks from lenders and marking up interest rates. As a result, a cash purchase can be less profitable for the dealer than a financed one. While some consumers attempt to circumvent this by financing and immediately repaying the loan, they are warned to check for prepayment penalties that could negate any savings.</p>

Administrators for the company stated that while there is interest from potential buyers for some of the remaining 85 stores, it is no longer viable to operate the entire store portfolio due to stock shortages and high operating costs. The 50-year-old retailer has struggled with rising rents and other challenges facing the UK high street.</p>

The video shows Heslop and her then-boyfriend, Ryan Bane, getting into a dinghy to return to his yacht on the night she disappeared in March 2021. Bane, who remains the sole person of interest, claimed she likely fell overboard, but he has never been formally questioned and has since left the islands.

His comments came during a press conference with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, where Netanyahu asserted Israel's right to self-defense beyond its borders and claimed the Qatar strike was conducted solely by Israel. The statement comes after the White House reportedly assured Qatar, a key U.S. ally and mediator in the Gaza conflict, that such an attack on its soil would not happen again, highlighting potential friction between the U.S. and Israel.</p>

Race officials ruled that the physical contact gave him an unfair advantage, and the U.S. team's subsequent appeal was rejected.
