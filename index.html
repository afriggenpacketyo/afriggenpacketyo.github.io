          <p>Ballymena, County Antrim, witnessed a second night of disorder as petrol bombs, masonry, and fireworks were thrown at police, who responded with baton rounds and water cannon. The violence followed a peaceful protest regarding an alleged sexual assault in the town, with Monday's unrest resulting in attacks on homes and businesses. One assembly member reported a family with young children barricading themselves in their attic. North Antrim MP Jim Allister faced criticism for comments linking the violence to an "oversubscription of migrants," while other politicians condemned the violence and Allister's remarks. The police have described the actions as "racist thuggery."</p>

          <p>European Union officials presented the bloc as a stable and predictable partner at the Forte de Copacabana International Security Conference in Brazil, citing growing instability from the strategic rivalry between the United States and China. Brian Glynn of the European External Action Service emphasized the EU's focus on a green, digital, and just transition, contrasting it with China's export-led, fossil fuel-driven economy. Glynn clarified that the EU aims to build a development agenda with Latin America, focusing on cooperation rather than resource extraction. Brussels has been increasing its outreach to Latin America and the Caribbean, offering new financial pledges and political cooperation.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem asked Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to authorize military forces in Los Angeles to arrest civilians, a move that would exceed the authorities invoked by President Trump. In a letter, Noem requested that DoD forces be directed to detain or arrest lawbreakers under Title 18, which generally prohibits defense personnel from direct law enforcement activities. While defense personnel can temporarily detain individuals to protect federal property, broader arrest authority is typically limited to authorized federal law enforcement officers. Hegseth activated Marines to join National Guard troops in Los Angeles, but did not act on Noem's request.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that protesters at his upcoming military parade in Washington, D.C., commemorating the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary, would be met with "heavy force." Trump repeated this threat, asserting that the protesters "hate our country." Security officials, however, indicated they were tracking about nine protests planned for the parade, with the number of protesters expected to be smaller than the attendees. The parade is scheduled to take place on Trump's 79th birthday, adding a personal dimension to the event.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom asked a federal judge to swiftly block President Donald Trump's deployment of National Guard members and Marines to Los Angeles, arguing it threatens state sovereignty and escalates civil unrest. Attorney General Rob Bonta argued that a temporary restraining order was needed to prevent immediate and irreparable harm. Newsom stated that sending trained warfighters onto the streets is unprecedented and tyrannical. The lawsuit claims Trump broke the law by federalizing the California National Guard without Newsom's consent and that the recent unrest does not warrant such actions.</p>
