          <p>McDonald's in Japan has canceled its Happy Meal promotion featuring coveted Pokémon cards after it led to widespread issues. Adult resellers reportedly bought the meals in bulk solely for the collectible cards, leading to rapid sell-outs and depriving children of the intended product. This resulted in significant food waste, with large quantities of uneaten meals being discarded near restaurant locations, prompting public outcry and an apology from the company. McDonald's Japan has pledged to implement measures to prevent future occurrences, emphasizing its commitment to providing enjoyable experiences for families.</p>

          <p>Longtime WWE referee Charles Robinson shared on social media that he was hospitalized after being bitten by a bat in the early morning. He posted a video from the emergency room, explaining he required six shots as part of his treatment. The incident follows a rough period for the 60-year-old referee, who recently suffered a cracked rib from a spear by wrestler Goldberg and went viral after a collision with John Cena. Fans offered well-wishes, though it remains unclear if the injury will affect his appearance at upcoming WWE events.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have identified a new species of prehistoric whale, named Janjucetus dullardi, from fossils found on Victoria's Surf Coast in Australia. Living around 26 million years ago, this ancient relative of modern baleen whales was a compact, dolphin-sized predator with large eyes and razor-sharp teeth for hunting, unlike its filter-feeding descendants. The discovery, based on a juvenile skull found by a local resident, provides crucial insights into the early evolution of whales and their predatory adaptations. Scientists believe this finding reinforces the region's role as a key location for understanding the history of these marine mammals.</p>

Organizers stated the protest was a response to Vance's past criticisms of the U.K. and the administration's foreign policy stances, particularly concerning the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. The event, attended by about 80 people, aimed to exercise freedom of speech in what was described as a "joyous festival of resistance."</p>

          <p>A Catholic priest in Alabama, Robert Sullivan, is under investigation after a woman alleged he initiated a sexual relationship with her when she was 17, exchanging financial support for "private companionship." The accuser, now 33, claims Sullivan recently paid her hundreds of thousands of dollars in a non-disclosure agreement, providing bank records and emails as evidence. The Diocese of Birmingham has reported the allegations to its review board and the Vatican, and Sullivan has been placed on personal leave, prohibiting him from public ministry. The accuser stated she came forward to prevent potential exploitation of others.</p>

          <p>Demand for mortgage refinancing in the U.S. saw a significant 23% increase last week, driven by a slight dip in interest rates. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage decreased to 6.67%, prompting many homeowners, particularly those with larger loans, to seek lower payments. The data also reveals a notable rise in demand for adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which increased by 25% to their highest level since 2022 due to their more attractive initial rates. However, applications for home purchases saw only a marginal 1% rise, indicating that affordability remains a major challenge for potential buyers. (not investment advice)</p>

The couple, who had set out to sail around the world, endured starvation and illness with minimal supplies before being rescued. The article explores how their shared ordeal and contrasting personalities—Maralyn's optimism balancing Maurice's negativity—strengthened their bond.

          <p>The average interest rate for a two-year fixed-rate mortgage in the United Kingdom has dropped to 4.99%, marking the first time it has fallen below the 5% threshold since the market turmoil caused by the mini-budget in September 2022. Financial data company Moneyfacts described this as a "symbolic turning point," suggesting increased competition among lenders. Despite this positive development, rates remain significantly higher than the historic lows seen before the mini-budget. With 1.6 million fixed-rate deals expiring in 2025, this easing of rates offers some relief to homeowners facing remortgaging in a still-challenging economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists analyzing the destructive magnitude 7.7 earthquake that struck central Myanmar in March 2025 hope the data can improve future earthquake forecasting. The quake, which caused thousands of deaths, resulted from a rapid, "supershear" rupture along the Sagaing Fault. A new study used this data to create a model incorporating the fault's "memory effect" from past events, forecasting that the next major quake could occur around 2166. While precise earthquake prediction remains impossible, researchers believe that refining these forecasting models is crucial for enhancing disaster preparedness and creating more accurate long-term hazard assessments for vulnerable regions.</p>

          <p>For the first time, researchers have created a comprehensive map of the approximately 8,700 cattle feeding operations in the United States, revealing that California has more facilities and acreage than any other state. The study, from the University of Michigan and UC Santa Barbara, used satellite imagery and various data sets to locate and measure these facilities, which were previously not tracked in a national database. The research also found that these operations are associated with degraded air quality and lower socioeconomic well-being in nearby communities, providing critical data for future environmental and health policy discussions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that President Trump's demand for a $1 billion payment from UCLA is fundamentally different from pressures on private universities like Columbia because it targets California's public taxpayer money. The author, a UC Santa Barbara professor, asserts that the University of California system is a crucial engine for the state's economy and serves the people of California, making the demand an attempted seizure of public resources. The article contends that the accusations of antisemitism are a pretext for a political attack on the university and its perceived liberal leanings. It calls on Californians to resist this federal overreach and protect their public institution.</p>

          <p>On the 90th anniversary of its creation, this opinion piece argues that the Social Security program faces a significant threat not from fiscal challenges, but from partisan politics. The author contends that there is a long-standing conservative project to dismantle the program, pointing to recent plans to cut staff and close offices as a form of sabotage to weaken public trust. The article also highlights recent comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about private savings accounts being a "back door for privatizing Social Security." The author concludes that protecting the popular program requires vigilance against these political attacks. (not investment advice)</p>

The ranking by Action Network considered factors like sky visibility, elevation, and astronomical infrastructure. While experts agree that California has excellent dark sky locations like Joshua Tree and Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, they are skeptical of the website's analysis, particularly its focus on spotting asteroids, which are not visible to the naked eye. They recommend that aspiring stargazers visit local observatories or join astronomy clubs for the best viewing experiences.</p>

          <p>As the new school year begins, Los Angeles public schools are implementing unprecedented measures to protect students and their immigrant families from federal immigration raids. These protections include establishing "safe zones" patrolled by police near schools, altering bus routes, and creating a network of volunteers to alert campuses of nearby enforcement actions. The move comes in response to the Trump administration's aggressive deportation policies and recent incidents, including one where federal agents mistakenly handcuffed a 15-year-old student outside his high school. School officials have vowed to oppose any interference with the educational process for all children.</p>

However, the campaign's materials do not prominently disclose that it is backed by the short-term rental giant Airbnb. Critics, including city officials and the hotel workers' union, accuse the campaign of using deceptive tactics and argue that expanding short-term rentals would worsen the city's housing crisis by removing properties from the long-term market. Supporters claim the move could generate nearly $80 million in new annual revenue for the city.</p>

          <p>Officials in California are expressing concern over President Trump's recent deployment of the National Guard in Washington D.C. and his suggestions that he might use federal forces to address crime in cities like Los Angeles and Oakland.

With the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics approaching, local leaders are wary of the administration's security plans, viewing the potential for federal intervention as a political stunt rather than a necessary measure, and a test case for expanding presidential power over cities.</p>
