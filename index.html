          <p>At least nine individuals were killed in a shooting at a high school in Graz, Austria, with the perpetrator also deceased. Police responded to the scene after receiving reports of shots fired, and the situation is now under control with no further threat to the public. Austrian Chancellor Christian Stocker described the event as a national tragedy, announcing three days of national mourning. The incident has prompted discussion about Austria's strict gun ownership laws, which prohibit automatic weapons and require permits for certain firearms. The article also mentions European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressing sorrow over the violence in a place meant for youth and hope.

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) budget proposal for 2026 consolidates 28 divisions into 15, creating a new "Administration for a Healthy America" (AHA).

It includes significantly reducing funds for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) chronic disease and global health centers, as well as some National Institutes of Health institutes. The budget cuts the CDC's funding from $9.2 billion to $4.2 billion, shifting at least 20% of that to AHA, which aims to take a "root cause" approach to chronic disease prevention. </p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass stated that she and the LAPD are considering curfews and other measures in case violence breaks out again during immigration protests. There was some looting Monday night, but the protests were smaller and less violent than over the weekend. Bass stated that the vandalism and violence are unacceptable, believing those individuals have a different agenda than supporting immigrants. The mayor argued the National Guard is guarding federal buildings, and she is unsure what the Marines will do in LA. </p>

          <p>Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is undergoing cross-examination in Brazil's Supreme Court, accused of masterminding a coup plot after failing to be reelected in 2022.

The alleged plot included assassinating or arresting President-elect Lula da Silva and others before his inauguration. The trial has also delved into the January 8, 2023, riots when Bolsonaro supporters stormed government buildings. </p>
