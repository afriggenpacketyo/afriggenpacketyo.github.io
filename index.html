          <p>Israel has obtained approximately 2,500 documents and personal effects from Syria belonging to Eli Cohen, a renowned Israeli spy executed in 1965. The collection includes handwritten letters, photographs, and information about his undercover work and final moments. The Mossad, in collaboration with an allied foreign government, retrieved the archives, though details about the assisting country and recovery timeline remain undisclosed. Cohen's intelligence gathering in Syria during the early 1960s is credited with significantly aiding Israel's victory in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, and this announcement has been received in Israel as a moment of unity.</p>

          <p>McLaren's F1 car has demonstrated superior performance over Red Bull's in various race conditions this season, securing four pole positions compared to Red Bull's three. McLaren drivers Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris have collectively won five races, while Max Verstappen of Red Bull has won two. McLaren excels when rear-tyre degradation is a factor and in slower corners, while Red Bull is strong in high-speed corners, as evidenced by their performance at Suzuka, Jeddah, and Imola. Red Bull has introduced upgrades in recent races, closing the gap, but McLaren's overall package appears stronger in a wider range of circumstances.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is initiating offshore "blue carbon" research to capture carbon dioxide using cultivated sea plants and store it in the deep sea. This initiative aims to accelerate decarbonization efforts, leveraging the ability of marine vegetation like mangroves and kelp to absorb and store more carbon than terrestrial vegetation. The Environment Ministry will collaborate with organizations like the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology and Eneos Corp. to study seaweed behavior at considerable depths and assess the environmental impact. Japan aims to capture 1 million tons of CO2 by fiscal 2035 and 2 million tons by fiscal 2040 through blue carbon.</p>

          <p>Since taking office, President Trump has implemented significant changes to federal agencies involved in climate change, lifting regulations on fossil fuels and cutting budgets for environmental research and pollution control. These changes, presented as measures to create jobs and boost the U.S. economy, have led to concerns about the potential environmental consequences and the trade-offs for everyday Americans. The policy shifts have sparked debate about the long-term effects on public health, natural resources, and the nation's ability to address climate-related disasters.

          <p>Yuri Grigorovich, an acclaimed Russian ballet choreographer and artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet from 1964 to 1995, has died at the age of 98. Known for revitalizing male dance and staging productions like "Ivan the Terrible" and "Romeo and Juliet," Grigorovich left a lasting impact on Soviet ballet. His departure from the Bolshoi in 1995 amid contract disputes led to the theatre's first-ever dancers' strike. Grigorovich's work was steeped in the traditions of classical ballet, and he is considered one of the greatest choreographers of the 20th century.</p>

While the parole board will recommend whether the brothers should be granted an early release, Newsom may still approve or deny the decision. The brothers were resentenced to 50 years-to-life, making them eligible for parole after spending 35 years behind bars, arguing they acted in self-defense after years of abuse.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Venezuelans, a move that could lead to their deportation. The court granted the Justice Department's request to lift a federal judge's order blocking the decision. TPS allows individuals from countries deemed unsafe due to natural disasters or armed conflicts to live and work legally in the U.S. Activists have criticized the decision, while US Homeland Security said in a statement on social media platform X that the Supreme court's decision was a "win for the American people and the safety of our communities".</p>

She contends that Putin's objectives extend beyond Ukraine, aiming to undermine the post-Cold War order and diminish American influence. Abandoning Ukraine would embolden Russia, destabilize Europe, and create a more potent alliance between Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea, ultimately harming American interests. The author says the Trump administration therefore faces a choice: It can stand up to the Kremlin now, in Ukraine, or later.</p>
