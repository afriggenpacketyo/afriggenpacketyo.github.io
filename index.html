          <p>A gunman opened fire in the parking area of the Grand Sierra Resort casino in Reno, Nevada, resulting in three fatalities and three injuries. The suspect first attempted to shoot bystanders before killing three individuals, including a restaurant co-owner, in separate encounters within the parking lot. He was later confronted by police, wounded in an exchange of gunfire, and remains in critical condition. Authorities have stated there is no known connection between the shooter and the victims, and the investigation is being led by the Sparks Police Department.</p>

          <p>The Senate has confirmed Sam Brown, an Army veteran who was severely injured in Afghanistan, to serve as the Veteran's Affairs undersecretary for memorial affairs. In this role, Brown will oversee the National Cemetery Administration, which is responsible for maintaining over 150 national cemeteries and providing burials for veterans. The confirmation passed with a 54-44 vote, with two Democratic senators from Nevada joining Republicans in support. The vote occurred amid broader partisan tensions, with Republicans accusing Democrats of deliberately slowing down the confirmation process for President Trump's nominees.</p>

          <p>High-level trade negotiations between the United States and China have concluded with both nations describing the talks as "constructive" and agreeing to continue efforts to extend a 90-day tariff truce. However, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent clarified that any final decision to prolong the truce, which is set to expire in August, must be made by President Donald Trump. The discussions covered economic issues, rare earths, and China's relations with Russia and Iran. Without an extension, tariffs exchanged between the two economic powers earlier in the year could be reinstated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Singapore's central bank has maintained its current monetary policy, anticipating a moderation in economic growth for the second half of 2025. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) expressed concern over global trade uncertainties, particularly potential changes in U.S. tariff rates, which could impact the nation's heavily export-dependent economy. Despite strong GDP growth in the second quarter that helped it avoid a technical recession, the MAS cited geopolitical risks and financial volatility as significant threats. The decision follows remarks from a Singaporean official that the U.S. was "non-committal" regarding tariff levels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A sexual assault support charity in Brighton, UK, has announced it will create a new service exclusively for biological women, following a dispute over the inclusion of transgender women in its support groups. The decision comes after a woman, known as "Sarah," initiated legal action against Survivors' Network, stating she felt uncomfortable discussing her trauma in a group that included a trans woman. The charity and Sarah have reached an agreement before the case went to trial, resulting in the new 12-month pilot program. This new group will operate alongside the charity's existing, inclusive sessions that remain open to trans and non-binary individuals.</p>

The technique involves placing victims with dangerously high core temperatures into a large plastic bag filled with ice and water to cool them rapidly. This method, originally developed by the military, is reported to be three to five times faster than traditional cooling techniques, potentially preventing organ failure and brain damage. With heat-related deaths in Phoenix dropping last year despite record temperatures, the ice bag protocol is being hailed as a critical and simple tool in urban emergency response.</p>

          <p>A recent American Eagle ad featuring actress Sydney Sweeney has ignited a complex and polarized online debate, illustrating the broken nature of modern internet discourse. The ad's simple "jeans/genes" pun was interpreted by some as politically obtuse or even a nod to eugenics, while others saw this reaction as hysterical and out of touch. This article argues that such controversies follow a predictable pattern where genuine concerns are amplified, stripped of context, and used as fodder by opposing ideological groups for outrage-driven content. The incident highlights how all participants operate within an attention economy that distorts conversations rather than fostering genuine dialogue.</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old software engineer from Mountain View, Angela Lin, was killed after being struck by a falling tree limb while hiking in Yosemite National Park. The incident occurred on July 19 in Tuolumne Grove, a popular area known for its giant sequoia trees. According to her partner, they heard a loud crack before the branch fell, and she never regained consciousness. The Tuolumne County Sheriff’s Office has ruled the death accidental, caused by blunt injuries. The National Park Service is investigating the incident, which temporarily closed the area to the public.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has advised investors to be cautious regarding the upcoming initial public offering of design software company Figma. While praising the company's strong product, profitability, and growth, Cramer worries that it is already priced expensively and could become overvalued if the stock soars upon its debut. He noted that despite a hot IPO market, the enterprise software sector has shown recent weakness. Cramer also expressed concern that Figma's necessary investments in AI could negatively impact its profitability in the near term, which Wall Street may not tolerate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A five-day strike by resident doctors in England is ending, but the underlying dispute over pay and working conditions is far from over. The British Medical Association (BMA) remains in a standoff with the Labour government, after talks broke down last week. While the government insists this year's 5.4% pay rise is final, the BMA is pushing for further increases and improvements on non-pay issues like exam fees and student loan debt. With tensions high and public opinion potentially shifting, both sides have hinted at a desire to return to negotiations, though significant common ground has yet to be established.</p>

          <p>Experts are warning that air travel is becoming bumpier due to climate change, which is altering atmospheric conditions and intensifying turbulence. A warmer atmosphere creates more intense thunderstorms, a cause of convective turbulence, and strengthens the jet stream, leading to more "clear-air" turbulence. One atmospheric scientist predicts a potential doubling or tripling of severe turbulence in the coming decades. While aircraft are built to withstand these forces, the increase could lead to more injuries, particularly for unbelted passengers, and significant economic costs for airlines due to diversions and increased fuel consumption.</p>

          <p>Recent polling suggests that tax cuts, once a reliable political winner in the United States, are losing their popularity. A new Wall Street Journal poll shows a majority of Americans oppose the latest Republican tax cut bill, a sentiment consistent with the unpopularity of the 2017 Trump tax cuts. This article suggests the shift may be due to several factors, including a lower overall tax burden compared to past decades, rising income inequality, and a growing public awareness that tax cuts do not pay for themselves and contribute to the national debt. This trend presents a future challenge for politicians, as voters remain hesitant to endorse tax increases. (not investment advice)</p>

This article explores the harm in assuming CTE is the cause of mental distress, as it can foster a sense of doom and prevent individuals from seeking effective treatments.
