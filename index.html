          <p>Authorities in Honolulu, Hawaii, are searching for a male suspect who allegedly threw sulfuric acid on a 30-year-old man in an unprovoked attack. The incident occurred as the victim was crossing a street in the Chinatown area, leaving him in critical condition with severe, life-altering burns. Due to the severity of his injuries, the victim has been unable to provide information to investigators, who are now canvassing for surveillance footage and witnesses to identify the suspect and determine a motive.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Kentucky bourbon industry, which experienced a significant boom following the 2008 recession, is now facing a downturn due to a combination of economic factors. Changing consumer habits, particularly among younger generations who are drinking less, along with post-pandemic inflation have slowed sales growth considerably. Global tariffs, including retaliatory measures from the EU and Canada, have further strained the market, leading to decreased sales for major brands and bankruptcies for some smaller distilleries.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its conflict with Harvard University by threatening to strip the institution of its valuable patents derived from federally funded research. In a letter, the Commerce Department accused Harvard of breaching its contractual obligations and initiated a "march-in" process under the Bayh-Dole Act, which could allow the government to seize the patents. This action is viewed by critics as part of a broader White House pressure campaign against the university, ostensibly over its handling of pro-Palestinian campus protests.</p>

          <p>The market for "functional beverages" that promise benefits like relaxation and calm is rapidly expanding, but nutritionists and dietitians are skeptical of their efficacy. Experts point out that the quantities of active ingredients like Lion's Mane or L-theanine in these drinks are often too small to produce the advertised effects, with much of the research still in its infancy. While some consumers find them to be a good non-alcoholic alternative for unwinding, psychologists suggest the calming effect may be more of a placebo, created by the ritual of taking a moment for oneself.</p>

          <p>The village of Pampa Clemesí in Peru faces a stark paradox, as its 150 residents live without electricity despite being located next to the country's largest solar power complex. Although the nearby Rubí and Clemesí plants generate enough power for over 350,000 homes, the village remains unconnected to the national grid due to profitability-focused infrastructure planning and bureaucratic delays. Residents struggle daily for basic needs like refrigeration and lighting, highlighting a deep disconnect between large-scale renewable energy projects and local community benefits.</p>

This modern understanding of "Irishness" is multifaceted, embracing blended traditions and moving beyond historical binaries, though it still navigates the complexities of Northern Ireland's history and the cross-fertilization of cultures.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced new plans that would allow for the immediate deportation of foreign criminals as soon as they receive a custodial sentence. Under the proposal, offenders with fixed-term sentences would be deported right away and barred from re-entry, with their home country deciding if they serve any prison time. The government argues this will save taxpayer money and protect the public, but the plan has been criticized by the opposition, who warn that some countries may refuse to accept the deported individuals.</p>

          <p>A neurologist is highlighting the significant brain-boosting benefits of pomegranates, particularly for individuals over 50. The fruit is rich in polyphenols, which have powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects that can enhance learning, memory, and may help protect against age-related neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease. While the fresh fruit can be costly and seasonal, pomegranate extract is a viable year-round alternative, though consumers should choose versions without added sugar. Individuals on certain medications should consult a doctor before regularly consuming pomegranates.</p>

The government proscribed Palestine Action after its activists vandalized military aircraft to protest UK support for Israel. Human rights groups have criticized the mass arrests as a disproportionate threat to freedom of expression.</p>

          <p>The abrupt removal of IRS Commissioner Billy Long was reportedly preceded by a clash with the White House over a demand for confidential taxpayer data. The Department of Homeland Security had requested the IRS use its data to locate thousands of suspected undocumented immigrants, but the agency declined, citing taxpayer privacy laws. The incident highlights the administration's pressure on federal agencies to aid its immigration crackdown, a move that critics argue politicizes neutral government bodies and could compromise legally protected information.</p>
