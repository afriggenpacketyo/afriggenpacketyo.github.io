          <p>An Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner, en route to London Gatwick, crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad, India, carrying 242 passengers and crew. Initial reports indicate the aircraft reached a maximum altitude of 625 feet before descending rapidly. Rescue teams have been mobilized to provide medical aid and support to those affected, and flights at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport have been temporarily suspended. Shares of Boeing experienced a decline in premarket trading following the incident, highlighting the market's sensitivity to aviation accidents.

          <p>The Trump administration's crackdown on undocumented immigrants, driven by White House advisor Stephen Miller, has led to increased deportations and social unrest. ICE has deprioritized deporting immigrants implicated in crimes, instead targeting undocumented workers, leading to protests and clashes. Despite a successful deterrence of illegal immigration, the administration's radical enforcement tactics have resulted in economic harm, including labor shortages and slower economic growth. The administration's approach is economically and socially destructive, and the increased social tension and political unrest are only worsening the situation.</p>

          <p>Kilauea Volcano on Hawaii's Big Island has erupted for the 25th time since December, spewing lava fountains over 330 feet high. The latest eruptive episode was preceded by gas-pistoning, a process where gas accumulates at the top of a lava column. The USGS has set up livestream videos to monitor the eruption, which has been pausing and resuming since December 23rd. The USGS warned of high levels of volcanic gas that can cause respiratory problems, as well as the hazard of volcanic fragments falling near the eruptive vents.</p>

          <p>Poundland, a budget retail chain, has been sold for Â£1 to US investment firm Gordon Brothers by its owner, Polish firm Pepco, and the sale comes amid struggles to compete with other discount stores. Following the sale, a proposed restructure will be put to the High Court in England, potentially leading to the closure of up to 100 stores. Pepco stated that Poundland remains a well-loved brand, but retail analysts suggest its appeal has waned as consumers seek better quality and value elsewhere. The business will continue to operate under the Poundland brand in the UK and under the Dealz brand in the Isle of Man and Republic of Ireland.</p>

Kennedy Jr. has appointed eight new members to the CDC's vaccine advisory committee (ACIP), some of whom have expressed skepticism about vaccines, particularly COVID-19 vaccines. This follows Kennedy's removal of all 17 previous members, citing conflicts of interest. Some appointees have spread misinformation regarding COVID-19 vaccines and mRNA technology, with a few having co-authored the Great Barrington Declaration, advocating against COVID-19 lockdowns. The new members will attend an upcoming ACIP meeting to discuss recommendations for vaccines, including the HPV and COVID-19 vaccines, and review safety and efficacy data.</p>

          <p>The UK economy experienced a sharp contraction of 0.3% in April, driven by global trade tariffs and domestic tax increases, according to data from the Office for National Statistics. The decline was sharper than economists had anticipated and followed a period of growth in the preceding months. The implementation of global trade tariffs by U.S. President Donald Trump created business uncertainty and negatively impacted U.K. exports. The U.K. was hit with a 10% tariff from the U.S., although it has since struck a trade deal, becoming the first country to do so.</p>

These changes are already impacting credit scores and economic statistics, with millions of borrowers seeing their scores plummet.

While destructive riots and looting are unhelpful, the focus should be on the psychological toll of unrest, which can lead to increased rates of depression and PTSD. The author argues that militarization of communities is rarely received well and that efforts should be made to eliminate the need for such protests.</p>
