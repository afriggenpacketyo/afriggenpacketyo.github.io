          <p>Chinese solar photovoltaic (PV) manufacturers are actively seeking solutions to address persistent price wars and financial losses within the industry, driven by overcapacity and declining demand. Executives are gathering in Shanghai for the SNEC PV+ Photovoltaic Power Conference and Exhibition to discuss strategies for overcoming these challenges. The industry installed approximately 278 gigawatts of solar PV capacity in China last year, accounting for almost 60% of global additions, however, excess capacity has contributed to a significant drop in solar module prices. Industry leaders emphasize the need for government-business collaboration to manage supply and promote technological innovation to improve profit margins and ensure sustainable growth.

          <p>The Trump administration has significantly increased federal deployments to Los Angeles, mobilizing 700 Marines and an additional 2,000 National Guard troops.

The deployment of federal forces without the consent of local and state officials has sparked legal challenges, raising questions about federal overreach and states' rights.</p>

          <p>California consistently contributes more in federal taxes than it receives back, making it a 'donor' state, as confirmed by figures from the Rockefeller Institute of Government. Governor Newsom highlighted this imbalance after President Trump threatened to cut federal funding to California. The state contributes billions more than it receives, subsidizing states with higher poverty rates and lower incomes. While this status reflects California's economic success, it also means that the state's taxpayers are supporting programs and services in other parts of the country.</p>

          <p>Federal immigration raids in California, particularly in Los Angeles, pose a significant threat to the state's economy, which heavily relies on immigrant labor and international trade. The raids have already disrupted industries such as construction and apparel, leading to labor shortages and increased costs. Economists warn that the crackdown could have long-term negative effects, especially as California's population ages and the demand for workers increases. The raids exacerbate existing economic challenges, including declining port traffic due to tariffs, and could harm the state's brand as a global tourist destination.</p>

A near-total eradication of bullfrogs from habitats within Yosemite National Park led to the striking recovery of the Northwestern pond turtle. Researchers conducted night surveys to remove adult bullfrogs and day surveys to target egg masses, removing an estimated 16,000 bullfrogs across two sites. After several years, they observed the first small pond turtle hatchlings and juveniles, along with a comeback of certain snake and newt species, suggesting a potential tool for reversing species decline and restoring freshwater ecosystems.</p>
