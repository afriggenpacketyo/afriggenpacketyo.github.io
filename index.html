          <p>An attack in Boulder, Colorado, injured eight people at a rally organized by Run for Their Lives, an organization raising awareness for Israeli hostages. The FBI is investigating the incident as a targeted act of violence and terrorism after a suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, allegedly threw an incendiary device and used a makeshift flamethrower, while yelling "Free Palestine". The victims, aged 52 to 88, sustained burns and other injuries, with one in critical condition; the suspect is in custody and receiving medical evaluation. The attack has prompted investigations and condemnation from officials, with Run for Their Lives canceling upcoming events and the Jewish community responding with prayers and calls for unity.</p>

          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a conservative backed by President Trump, narrowly won Poland's presidential election against liberal Warsaw Mayor RafaÅ‚ Trzaskowski. The election revealed deep divisions within Poland, a country on the eastern flank of NATO and the EU. Nawrocki's victory suggests Poland will likely take a more populist and nationalist direction, potentially complicating Prime Minister Donald Tusk's efforts to reverse laws that politicized the court system and fulfill promises to the EU. Trump welcomed Nawrocki to the White House a month ago, and the conservative group CPAC held its first meeting in Poland to give Nawrocki a boost, suggesting closer ties between Poland and the Trump administration. </p>

          <p>Ukrainian and Russian delegations are scheduled to meet in Istanbul for U.S.-brokered peace talks aimed at ending Russia's invasion of Ukraine. These talks follow a surprise Ukrainian drone attack on strategic bomber bases inside Russia, with Ukraine calling for a 30-day ceasefire during negotiations, a request Russia has refused. Despite pressure from the Trump administration, both sides remain far apart, with Russia demanding annexation of Ukrainian regions and a block on Ukraine's NATO accession, while Ukraine seeks a full ceasefire and prisoner release. The talks are further complicated by ongoing long-range drone and missile attacks, with both sides claiming to have shot down numerous drones overnight.</p>

          <p>The UK is set to announce the creation of the UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) to redesign flight paths, potentially leading to quicker flights and fewer delays for passengers. The modernization plans, the largest redesign of UK airspace since the 1950s, aim to allow planes to climb quicker during takeoff and descend more smoothly, reducing aviation's climate change impacts. With UKADS expected to be fully operational by the end of the year, the changes could pave the way for new technologies like flying taxis and a more sustainable future for the aviation industry. The current flight paths were decided around 70 years ago, and last year there were about 2.7 million flights in UK airspace.</p>

          <p>Iran's foreign ministry stated that it has yet to see any changes in the U.S. position regarding sanctions, as negotiations continue to resolve the long-standing dispute over Iran's nuclear ambitions. According to the ministry spokesperson, it must be clear how sanctions against the Iranian people will be lifted to prevent a repeat of past experiences. Oman's Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr Albusaidi recently presented a U.S. proposal for a nuclear deal during a visit to Tehran, but disagreements persist, particularly on the issue of Iran's uranium enrichment. Iranian and U.S. delegations wrapped up a fifth round of talks in Rome last month.</p>

The government will adopt all 62 recommendations from a strategic defense review, aiming to counter growing threats across various domains, with defense spending projected to reach 2.5% of national income by 2027 and 3% before 2034. This initiative also signals to President Trump that Europe is responding to his call for NATO members to invest more in their own defense.</p>

          <p>The US defense sector's reliance on critical minerals, essential for advanced weapon systems, is heavily dependent on China, which dominates the global supply of rare earths and other key minerals. Beijing has leveraged its dominance in critical mineral production as a negotiating point in trade disputes, imposing export controls on gallium, germanium, and antimony. These restrictions, including export bans on certain minerals to the US, are raising concerns about the Pentagonâ€™s military readiness and supply chain security.

          <p>A new book, *The Family Dynamic*, explores how sibling relationships, including birth order and individual achievements, affect a person's life. Studies suggest eldest children may perform better on cognitive tests, but sibling influence is powerful, with individuals consciously or subconsciously shaping themselves to resemble or differ from one another. Age gaps can complicate these effects, as younger siblings may draw influences from multiple older siblings. Siblings act as vivid mirrors, reflecting both the best and worst traits, and can challenge less lovable attributes, fostering self-awareness and understanding.</p>

          <p>An Indian man was arrested at Mumbai airport for attempting to smuggle 47 venomous vipers, along with Asian leaf turtles and Indonesian pit vipers, into the country. The reptiles were found concealed in the man's checked-in luggage as he returned from Thailand. While importing animals is not illegal, India's wildlife protection law bans the import of certain species, especially those classified as endangered or protected. This incident is part of a trend of customs officials seizing banned wildlife from passengers attempting to smuggle them into India, highlighting the ongoing challenges in enforcing wildlife protection laws.</p>

          <p>Secret Syrian intelligence files confirm that missing American journalist Austin Tice was imprisoned by the regime of Bashar al-Assad after his disappearance in August 2012. The files, uncovered by the BBC, reveal that Tice was held in a detention facility in Damascus and was arrested near the suburb of Darayya by a paramilitary force loyal to Assad. A Syrian official confirmed that Tice was held until at least February 2013, during which time he developed stomach issues and received medical treatment. The fallen regime consistently denied knowing of Tice's whereabouts, but the BBC investigation proves this was false.</p>
