Groups like the American Red Cross, Salvation Army, and various local community foundations are accepting donations to support rescue operations and provide aid to affected families. The response also includes corporate partnerships and grassroots initiatives aimed at delivering essential supplies, meals, and emergency housing to the communities impacted by the disaster.</p>

          <p>A provision in President Trump's new tax legislation temporarily increases the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap but includes a phaseout for high earners that could create a tax surprise. For those with a modified adjusted gross income between $500,000 and $600,000, the benefit is reduced, effectively creating a marginal tax rate as high as 45.5% on income within that range. Tax professionals advise that individuals nearing this income threshold should carefully plan to avoid this so-called "SALT torpedo." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that COVID-19 cases are likely on the rise in 25 states, signaling the start of a summer wave. The increase is most prominent in the Southeast, Southern, and West Coast regions, with emergency room visits for the virus reaching their highest levels since February in some areas. A recent CDC analysis suggests the virus has settled into a biannual surge pattern, driven by cyclical genetic changes, which is expected to persist for the foreseeable future.</p>

          <p>For individuals with low incomes struggling with debt, several relief options can provide a path to financial stability. The article details four key strategies: credit counseling for structured debt management, debt forgiveness for negotiating lower lump-sum settlements, and creditor hardship programs for temporary relief. For those with overwhelming debt, Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy offers legal protection and the potential to discharge or restructure what is owed, making them viable solutions for severe financial distress.

          <p>Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz is through to the Wimbledon final for the third consecutive year after a hard-fought victory over American Taylor Fritz. Alcaraz won the match 6-4, 5-7, 6-3, 7-6, overcoming a strong challenge in a tense fourth-set tie-break where he saved two set points. The victory extends his winning streak at the tournament to 24 matches and keeps him on course to potentially face either Novak Djokovic or Jannik Sinner for the title.</p>

          <p>Pub landlords across the United Kingdom are struggling with a severe financial squeeze as their operating costs, particularly for electricity and supplies, continue to rise sharply. Many publicans report that their businesses are no longer profitable, forcing them to use personal savings to stay afloat and threatening the future of these vital community centers. The industry, which has seen thousands of closures in recent years, is calling for government support, such as a VAT reduction, to prevent more pubs from shutting down.</p>

The ruling, which Palace intends to appeal, prioritizes Lyon due to their higher league finish, dealing a major blow to Palace's European ambitions.</p>
