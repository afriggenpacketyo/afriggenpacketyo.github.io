          <p>Minnesota Governor Tim Walz delivered a scathing critique of President Donald Trump during a law school graduation speech, accusing him of repeatedly violating the rule of law and creating a national emergency. Walz, the vice presidential nominee in 2024, urged graduates to stand up against abuses of power, citing Trump's immigration policies and questions surrounding due process. He condemned the acquiescence of some big law firms to Trump's administration, encouraging graduates to avoid working with such firms. Walz's remarks reflect the ongoing debate within the Democratic Party about how to effectively challenge the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Federal courts are increasingly challenging the Trump administration's deportation policies, insisting on due process for immigrants facing removal. The Supreme Court recently criticized the administration for providing only a day's warning to Venezuelan immigrants facing deportation, deeming it insufficient. This decision aligns with a series of cases where courts have upheld immigrants' rights to challenge their deportations, particularly under the Alien Enemies Act. Despite the administration's efforts to expedite deportations, the judiciary is emphasizing the constitutional right to due process for all individuals, regardless of citizenship status.</p>

The election is seen as a historic decision for Romania, with potential implications for the EU given Romania's strategic importance as the sixth largest EU country and its border with Ukraine.

Trump is using the threat of military action to pressure Iran, while exploring creative solutions to bridge the divide over enrichment, including long-term freezes and phased program adjustments.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent announcement to lift all sanctions on Syria took senior officials at the Treasury Department by surprise, lacking specifics on which measures would be rolled back and at what pace. The decision follows months of lobbying from Syria's transitional government, which blames sanctions for its economic struggles and inability to rebuild. While Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was aware of the announcement, discussions are underway to determine the extent of the rollback. This move aligns with Trump's broader Middle East strategy and efforts to normalize relations with Syria's new government, despite concerns over human rights and past support for terrorist groups.</p>

          <p>Arizona Democrats are facing significant challenges as they approach the 2026 elections, particularly with Governor Katie Hobbs seeking re-election in a state that recently flipped to President Trump. The state party is grappling with internal turmoil, and Hobbs faces potential challenges from Republican candidates with endorsements from Trump. While Hobbs has taken a moderate approach, she has faced criticism from both the left and right, and her attempts to build bridges with Republicans have been largely unsuccessful, making her re-election prospects uncertain.</p>

Johnson acknowledged the argument that Congress members' salaries may not be adequate, but emphasized that stock trading activity has been abused by "a few bad actors" and that there should be zero tolerance for insider trading.

This is part of a broader plan to diversify the UAE's economy away from fossil fuels and increase its influence over global supply chains.
