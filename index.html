For decades, her presence in Cuba was a major point of diplomatic friction with the United States, which had placed her on its "most wanted terrorists" list and repeatedly demanded her extradition.</p>

While the diagnosis provides some context, officials emphasize that the science surrounding CTE's effects on behavior is still developing and under study.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government is on the brink of a shutdown as lawmakers remain deadlocked over a funding agreement ahead of the September 30 deadline. Economists are warning that a prolonged shutdown could cost the economy approximately $7 billion per week and negatively impact both investor and consumer confidence. While mandatory spending such as Social Security benefits would continue, hundreds of thousands of federal workers would be furloughed and many government services would be suspended, creating widespread disruption.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly called for Microsoft to terminate Lisa Monaco, the company's president of global affairs and a former deputy attorney general in the Biden administration. In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump described Monaco as a "menace to U.S. National Security" and made unsubstantiated claims that her security clearances had been revoked. This demand is part of a pattern of Trump using his platform to attack political opponents and call for retribution, coming just a day after the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey.</p>

          <p>President Trump's persistent public attacks on James Comey and his pressure on the Justice Department may complicate the government's ability to secure a conviction, according to former federal prosecutors. Legal experts argue that Trump's actions could provide Comey's defense team with a basis to move for dismissal on grounds of selective or vindictive prosecution. The unusual circumstances surrounding the indictment, including its brevity and the president's social media posts, cast doubt on the integrity of the process and could be problematic for prosecutors in court.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has sided with the Trump administration in a major separation-of-powers dispute, allowing it to withhold over $4 billion in foreign aid funding that Congress had appropriated.

The National Hurricane Center reported that the storm now has maximum sustained winds of 115 mph. Currently, there are no coastal watches or warnings in effect for the United States. However, officials continue to monitor its forecast path closely, as it is one of two systems that could potentially bring downstream impacts to the Southeast coast later in the week.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the City of Hope cancer center are pioneering a new immunotherapy treatment for brain tumors using a synthesized component of deathstalker scorpion venom. The innovative therapy uses engineered chlorotoxin to act as a beacon, guiding the body's own T-cells to identify and attack glioblastoma cells, one of the most aggressive and difficult-to-treat cancers. Early phase one clinical trials have shown the treatment to be safe and well-tolerated, offering a promising new avenue in the fight against deadly brain tumors.</p>

          <h2>Navigating High-Interest Debt: A Look at Debt Relief Programs Versus Credit Counseling</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 16:38:06 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As U.S. credit card debt surpasses $1.2 trillion, millions of Americans are seeking effective strategies to regain financial control. This article examines two primary options: debt relief programs and credit counseling. Debt relief, such as settlement, aims to reduce the principal balance owed but can carry risks and damage credit scores. In contrast, credit counseling focuses on creating a structured debt management plan to repay the full amount, often with negotiated lower interest rates, providing a slower but more stable path to becoming debt-free.

          <p>A significant deployment of federal law enforcement agents and state troopers is set to begin in Memphis next week as part of a Trump administration anti-crime initiative. Personnel from 13 federal agencies, including the FBI and DEA, will join 300 Tennessee Highway Patrol troopers in the city. Governor Bill Lee stated the operation has been planned for months, while President Trump has characterized the move as a replica of similar actions taken in other Democratic-led cities to combat what he describes as overwhelming violent crime.</p>

          <p>Senate Democrats are increasing pressure on the Trump administration for information regarding White House border czar Tom Homan. The inquiry follows reports that Homan was the subject of an FBI sting operation where he allegedly accepted cash from undercover agents posing as businessmen. Lawmakers are demanding all records related to Homan's involvement in federal contracts, citing potential conflicts of interest due to his previous work for a private prison company that is a major government contractor.</p>
