          <p>Harvard University has responded to President Trump's renewed threat to revoke its tax-exempt status, asserting there is no legal basis for such action. A university spokesperson stated that rescinding the tax exemption would endanger Harvard's educational mission, diminishing financial aid, medical research, and innovation opportunities. This threat follows Trump's criticism of Harvard's stance on antisemitism and DEI, leading to a freeze of over $2.2 billion in federal grants. The university argues that the tax exemption supports scholarships, medical research, and technological advancements. </p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed budget for the 2026 fiscal year outlines $163 billion in cuts to federal spending, primarily targeting the Department of Education, Health and Human Services, USAID, and the Environmental Protection Agency. The proposal aims to reduce discretionary funding while protecting homeland security, veterans, seniors, law enforcement, and infrastructure. However, it also includes a 13% increase in defense spending, bringing it to $1.01 trillion. The budget proposal has faced criticism from both Republicans and Democrats, with concerns raised about defense spending levels and potential impacts on critical programs. </p>

          <p>A New York Times article reveals that former national security advisor Michael Waltz and other senior Trump administration officials used TeleMessage, a modified version of the encrypted messaging app Signal, for official communications. This app, designed by an Israeli company and later acquired by Smarsh, archives messages for record-keeping purposes, raising concerns about compliance with federal record laws and potential security vulnerabilities. Cybersecurity experts, including Senator Ron Wyden, criticized the use of this "counterfeit Signal knockoff," citing counterintelligence risks. The White House maintains that Signal is an approved app, but the use of TeleMessage raises questions about transparency and security. </p>

          <p>The expiration of a de minimis tariff exemption is set to make cheaper goods from China more expensive for U.S. consumers. Ultra-low cost retailers like Shein and Temu have relied on this loophole, which exempted packages worth $800 from import levies. The end of the exemption is expected to increase prices, cause delays in shipments, and reduce the variety of goods available. While companies selling goods made in the U.S. may benefit, consumers are likely to "trade down" to cheaper alternatives or resale platforms. </p>
