          <p>Divers and marine biologists are puzzled by the disappearance of an 18-foot-long gray whale calf carcass from Scripps Canyon near San Diego. The article recounts how the calf, likely separated from its mother, was found at a shallow depth, attracting divers and underwater photojournalists. After a few weeks, the carcass vanished, leading to speculation about its fate. Experts suggest that gas buildup during decomposition may have caused the carcass to refloat and be swept deeper into the canyon by strong currents.</p>

Trump has previously said that there would be disruptions, but for the first time, he acknowledged that many Americans might have to do with less as a result of the tariff standoff. He argued that the trade war's impact would be worse for China, and insisted that Americans don't need many of the goods imported from China.</p>
