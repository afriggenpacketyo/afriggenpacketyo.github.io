          <p>President Trump stated on Truth Social that Iran's missile attack on the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar resulted in minimal damage and no American casualties. He claimed that of the 14 missiles fired, 13 were intercepted, and the remaining one was directed away from populated areas. Trump thanked Iran for providing early notice of the attack, which allowed for precautions to be taken. He expressed hope for peace and harmony in the region and encouraged Israel to pursue the same, concluding with a message of congratulations to the world and a call for peace.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily blocked a lower court order that allowed individuals facing deportation to countries other than their own to challenge their deportation orders. The case involves a flight of eight men from various countries, including Myanmar and Mexico, initially destined for South Sudan but rerouted to Djibouti. The U.S. government asserts that these men are violent criminals, while the lower court argued they should receive a "credible fear" interview in their native language before deportation. The Supreme Court's decision puts the lower court's order on hold while legal proceedings continue.</p>

          <p>Satellite imagery has emerged showing the extent of damage to Iranian nuclear facilities at Fordo, Isfahan, and Natanz following U.S. strikes. Experts have assessed the images, noting significant damage, including large craters and ash at Fordo, extensive destruction of buildings at Isfahan, and a large hole over an underground complex at Natanz. While President Trump claimed the sites were "completely and totally obliterated," other officials have stated that a full damage assessment is still pending. Experts suggest that the strikes at Fordo may have targeted ventilation shafts and that multiple Massive Ordinance Penetrators were used.</p>

          <p>An analysis explores the potential economic and security ramifications for the United States resulting from the recent strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities. Economic consequences could include rising oil prices due to disruptions in the Strait of Hormuz and increased shipping costs. Security risks involve potential attacks on U.S. troops in the Middle East and possible terrorist actions within the United States. The piece also considers whether the strikes have made Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon more or less likely, noting the potential for Iran to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.</p>

          <p>Approximately 80 Labour MPs are supporting an amendment to block the government's proposed changes to the benefits system. The MPs are concerned about the plans to cut disability and sickness-related benefits payments, which aim to save £5 billion annually by 2030. The amendment highlights concerns about the number of people potentially pushed into poverty, the lack of consultation, and inadequate impact assessments. If the amendment is selected and supported by a majority of MPs, it could halt the bill's progress through Parliament.</p>

An Israeli official indicated that the aim was to degrade, not destroy, Iran's nuclear program.

          <p>President Trump has urged "everyone" to keep oil prices down, warning that high prices would play "into the hands of the enemy" amidst escalating tensions in the Middle East. Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Trump called on the Department of Energy to increase drilling. White House spokesperson Harrison Fields clarified that producers must keep oil prices down to avoid benefiting adversaries. Crude oil prices closed lower after Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar caused no casualties, easing concerns about further escalation.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to strike Iran is facing bipartisan criticism on Capitol Hill, with lawmakers questioning the constitutionality of the military action. Several resolutions may be voted on, challenging Trump's authority to strike Iran without congressional approval. Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna, along with Sen. Tim Kaine, are leading efforts to limit Trump's war powers. The administration defends the strike as legally justified, citing compliance with the War Powers Resolution and the need to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear capabilities.</p>

The move comes as Cuomo, considered a frontrunner, faces a challenge from Zohran Mamdani. The election utilizes ranked choice voting, where voters rank up to five candidates, and the candidate with a majority wins, or votes are redistributed until one candidate achieves a majority.</p>
