          <h2>Fact Check Debunks Claims Linking Sunscreen Use to Increased Skin Cancer Risk</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 08:54:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article from DW fact-checks viral social media claims that sunscreen increases cancer risk, concluding they are false. Scientific evidence does not support this association; instead, rising skin cancer cases are linked to factors like better diagnostics, increased sun exposure, and historical use of less effective sunscreens. The piece clarifies that while global sunscreen sales are increasing, usage is often inconsistent or insufficient for proper protection. It emphasizes that a high incidence rate of skin cancer does not directly correlate with a higher mortality rate, thanks to improved treatments.</p>

          <p>Weeks after devastating floods in Texas Hill Country killed at least 135 people, the search for approximately 100 missing individuals continues. The tragedy, which heavily impacted a summer camp where 27 campers and counselors died, has prompted a special legislative session. Lawmakers are set to review the initial emergency response and discuss improving warning systems for the flood-prone region. Both state and federal officials are facing scrutiny over their handling of the disaster, while also designating improved emergency communications as a legislative priority.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has acquired a stake in Global Payments, a company whose stock has fallen significantly after a poorly received acquisition of Worldpay. The article suggests that Elliott's involvement could be beneficial, providing needed execution help and restoring investor confidence through board reconstitution and a focus on accountability. With the market having low expectations, successful integration of the new acquisition could yield substantial returns for shareholders, a process Elliott is well-equipped to oversee.

          <p>The Department of Defense has announced plans to use parts of military bases in New Jersey and Indiana as temporary facilities for housing illegal immigrants, prompting a furious response from Democratic lawmakers. In a joint statement, New Jersey Democrats argued the move is an inappropriate use of national defense resources that could jeopardize military readiness and militarize immigration policy. The decision is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to expand detention capacity, funded by the recently signed "Big Beautiful Bill" aimed at increasing immigration enforcement.</p>

However, the Met Office has extended yellow alerts across all four nations for the weekend and into Monday. The dry, parched ground from the heatwave has increased the likelihood of flooding as it is less able to absorb sudden, heavy rainfall.</p>

The author argues that the plan faces significant political and economic hurdles.

          <p>Representatives from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the Rwanda-backed M23 militia have signed a provisional ceasefire deal in Qatar, marking a significant step toward ending the long-running conflict in the nation's east. The agreement commits both parties to signing a permanent truce and a comprehensive peace deal by mid-August. The conflict in the mineral-rich region has displaced over seven million people and is considered one of the world's most severe humanitarian crises. The terms of the final deal, including potential concessions, are still being negotiated.</p>

Critics argue these moves, enabled by a recent Supreme Court decision, politicize science, sow distrust in public health institutions, and threaten the nation's ability to respond to health crises.

          <p>A viral TikTok trend has sparked a cross-generational debate about the "Gen Z stare," a perceived blank or non-responsive look from younger people during in-person interactions. This article explores the phenomenon, with older generations describing it as disconcerting, while some Zoomers are unaware of it or see it as a reaction to their elders. Psychologists suggest it may be linked to social development shaped by the internet and pandemic lockdowns, leading to different interaction styles. The frustration it causes is partly because older individuals interpret the lack of cues as a form of social rejection.</p>

The relief was part of the Biden administration's SAVE plan, which is now defunct following legal challenges. The 7.7 million borrowers enrolled in the plan are being encouraged to switch to other options like the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan. However, IBR calculates payments based on a higher percentage of discretionary income, leading to significantly larger bills that many may struggle to afford. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article evaluates the economic effects of President Donald Trump's tariff policies more than 100 days after their implementation. Analysts note that the tariffs have generated higher-than-expected tax revenue and prompted some companies to pledge new investments in U.S. manufacturing. However, experts also caution that these corporate commitments are long-term and uncertain, and the tariffs have started to push up consumer prices in some sectors, risking inflation. The administration's fluctuating approach to the levies adds a layer of uncertainty for businesses and the broader economy. (not investment advice)</p>
