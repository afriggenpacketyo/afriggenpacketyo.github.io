          <p>President Trump removed Mike Waltz from his position as national security advisor and nominated him to be the ambassador to the United Nations. Trump thanked Waltz for his service and stated that Secretary of State Marco Rubio would temporarily fill the role. Sources suggest Waltz was ousted due to a Signal app controversy and concerns about vetting National Security Council staff, but Trump offered him the UN post as a 'soft landing'. The article also mentions Waltz's deputy, Alex Wong, and the scrutiny faced by other Signal chat participants in congressional hearings.</p>

          <p>Amazon reported mixed first-quarter results, with overall sales growth slowing due to factors including President Trump's trade policies and tariffs. The company's North American retail business experienced its slowest growth since the pandemic's peak. CEO Andy Jassy stated that Amazon is focused on keeping prices down by purchasing extra inventory in advance of tariffs and assisting sellers on its marketplace. Amazon's cloud computing business grew by 17%, but was limited by data center capacity.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has requested the Supreme Court to allow the removal of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuelan immigrants, which would put them at risk of deportation. A federal judge had previously blocked the administration's plan, citing violations of administrative procedures and potential racial bias.

          <p>Jeffrey Hutchinson, an Army combat veteran, was executed in Florida for the 1998 shotgun slayings of his girlfriend and her three young children. Hutchinson had claimed innocence and attributed the killings to a government conspiracy related to his activism on Gulf War illnesses. The execution proceeded after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a final appeal. Hutchinson's lawyers had argued that he suffered from mental health problems linked to his Army service.</p>

          <p>Venmo is showing momentum in the peer-to-peer payments market, while Cash App has encountered challenges. PayPal, the parent company of Venmo, reported strong earnings, while Block, the parent company of Cash App, experienced a stock decline after missing revenue expectations. Venmo revenue jumped 20% in the first quarter, driven by the growing adoption of features like the Venmo debit card and integration into online checkout. For PayPal CEO Alex Chriss, monetizing Venmo is a key component of his turnaround plan.</p>

While Apple is shifting some production, most iPhones will continue to be produced in China for sale outside of the US.
