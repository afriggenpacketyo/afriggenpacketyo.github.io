          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman expressed concern that the United States is underestimating the threat posed by China's advancements in artificial intelligence. He argued that export controls on semiconductors are not a foolproof solution, as China could develop alternative methods or build its own fabrication facilities. Altman also revealed that competition from Chinese open-source models was a significant factor in OpenAI's recent decision to release its own open-weight models, aiming to prevent Chinese technology from dominating the global developer ecosystem. This strategic shift reflects the complex and consequential nature of the U.S.-China AI race beyond simple metrics of who is ahead.</p>

The renaming, which will last through the end of the month, is part of Metro's new Culture Series celebrating influential Angelenos. In conjunction with the tribute, two limited-edition Nipsey Hussle TAP cards have been released for purchase at select stations. The initiative, a partnership with Hussle's estate, recognizes his deep impact on the South Central Los Angeles community where he was raised and invested.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump asserted that the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas will only be returned once the militant group is "confronted and destroyed." In a social media post, he emphasized that decisive action against Hamas would improve the chances of a successful hostage release. His statement comes as Hamas reportedly accepted a new ceasefire proposal from Arab mediators, a development Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggests is a result of "enormous pressure" from Israel's military plans. The differing approaches highlight the ongoing complexities and high stakes in the negotiations to secure the hostages' freedom and achieve a ceasefire.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows High Annual Interest Costs for Significant Credit Card Debt</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 14:12:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With average credit card interest rates near 22%, carrying a $25,000 balance can result in approximately $5,500 in interest charges annually. This equates to about $456 per month in interest alone, making it difficult to reduce the principal balance when only making minimum payments. The article highlights that relying solely on minimum payments could extend the debt repayment period for decades and accumulate tens of thousands in extra interest. Strategies to mitigate these costs include paying more than the minimum, considering a balance transfer to a 0% APR card, or consolidating debt with a lower-interest loan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Democrats in California have unveiled a plan to redraw the state's congressional district maps mid-decade, a move aimed at gaining up to five U.S. House seats. This proposal is a direct response to a similar effort by Texas Republicans, escalating a national battle over partisan gerrymandering ahead of the midterm elections. The plan would require a state constitutional amendment, needing a two-thirds vote in the legislature and subsequent approval from California voters in a special election. If successful, the redrawn districts would significantly strengthen the Democratic advantage in the state, potentially reshaping the fight for control of Congress.</p>

In his first sermon, Floyd promised to lead with integrity and begin a new chapter for the congregation. The transition occurs while the church and Morris are still involved in multiple legal battles, including a defamation lawsuit filed by the accuser and a dispute over retirement payments.</p>

          <p>While Hurricane Erin, a major Category 4 storm, is not forecast to make a direct landfall in the United States, its powerful effects are prompting coastal evacuations. Officials have issued mandatory evacuation orders for visitors and residents on North Carolina's Ocracoke and Hatteras Islands due to the threat of severe coastal flooding and high waves, which could make key highways impassable. The National Hurricane Center warns that the large storm will generate life-threatening surf and dangerous rip currents along most of the East Coast for several days. The storm's approach highlights the increasing power of hurricanes, a trend linked to climate change and warmer ocean temperatures.</p>

          <p>After a two-week standoff, Texas House Democrats have returned to Austin, ending their quorum break and allowing the state legislature to resume business. The walkout was a protest against a Republican-led effort to redraw congressional maps mid-decade, a move that could grant the GOP up to five additional U.S. House seats. Democratic leaders stated their return allows them to build a legal case against what they call a "racist map" and to inspire similar fights against gerrymandering nationwide. The move comes as California Democrats advance their own redistricting proposal, setting the stage for a broader national conflict over political map-drawing.</p>

          <p>The sale of homegrown player Jacob Ramsey from Aston Villa to Newcastle United has highlighted fan and player frustration with the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR). These financial regulations, which limit club losses, are incentivizing teams to sell academy graduates, as their transfers count as pure profit on the books. This practice helps clubs like Aston Villa and Newcastle comply with spending limits but is criticized for forcing them to part with beloved local talent. The situation underscores the financial gap between emerging clubs and the established elite, who can leverage higher revenues to absorb costs under the current system.</p>

A bill introduced by Colorado lawmakers seeks to award him the nation's highest civilian honor for his lifetime of achievements in both aviation and art. After facing racism that led him to resign from the astronaut program in the 1960s, Dwight became a successful entrepreneur and a renowned sculptor, creating over 130 memorials dedicated to Black history.

While government offices, banks, and the U.S. Postal Service will be closed, most major retailers, grocery stores, and fast-food chains are expected to remain open, though some may have reduced hours.

          <p>The era of the "Great Resignation" has been replaced by a trend dubbed "job hugging," where employees are holding onto their current jobs due to economic uncertainty. The rate at which workers voluntarily quit has fallen to its lowest consistent level since 2016, reflecting decreased confidence in the availability of new opportunities. This stagnation is driven by a cooling labor market, higher interest rates, and slower hiring rates, which have reached a decade low. While staying put provides stability, experts caution that it can lead to slower wage growth and potential skill stagnation for employees.</p>

          <p>Financial analysts strongly recommend that investors utilize dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs) to harness the power of compound interest and enhance long-term portfolio growth. A DRIP automatically uses the cash dividends paid by a stock to purchase more shares of that same stock, often including fractional shares. This passive strategy ensures that earnings are continuously put to work, which can significantly increase total returns over time. For example, over a recent 10-year period, the S&P 500's total return with dividends reinvested was 239%, compared to a 185% return based on price appreciation alone. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial experts suggest that the best age to consider a reverse mortgage is typically in one's late 60s to early 70s, though there is no single magic number. The decision should be based on individual circumstances, including income needs, long-term goals, and commitment to aging in place. Since the loan amount increases with age, waiting allows homeowners to access more of their equity. A reverse mortgage can be a useful tool for retirees on a fixed income to eliminate monthly mortgage payments or to supplement income without selling their home, but it also reduces the equity available to heirs.

          <h2>Trump Vows to Eliminate Mail-In Ballots and Certain Voting Machines, Citing Putin's Advice</h2>

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to lead a movement to eliminate mail-in voting and certain electronic voting machines, claiming the advice came from Russian President Vladimir Putin during their recent meeting. Trump asserted on social media that he would fight to end what he called the "MAIL-IN BALLOT HOAX," despite his own campaign having previously encouraged their use. This move follows a March executive order aimed at restricting mail-in ballots, which has been partially blocked by courts over constitutional concerns. The U.S. Constitution grants states and Congress, not the President, the authority to regulate election procedures.</p>

          <p>Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim staunchly defended his decision to start goalkeeper Altay Bayindir over the newly fit Andre Onana in the team's Premier League match against Arsenal. In a tense post-match press conference, Amorim pushed back against questions about the choice, arguing that Bayindir had performed well during the preseason and deserved to keep his spot. He emphasized that Onana had only just returned to full training after an injury and that dropping Bayindir would undermine the team's group philosophy. This approach mirrors the defensive tactics often used by former manager Sir Alex Ferguson to protect his players from media criticism.</p>

          <p>State health officials have officially declared that the measles outbreak in Texas, which began in January and resulted in 762 confirmed cases, is now over. The declaration was made after 42 days—double the disease's maximum incubation period—passed without any new reported cases in affected counties. The Texas Department of State Health Services credited a comprehensive response involving vaccination, testing, and public education for containing the highly contagious virus, which led to the deaths of two unvaccinated children. Officials remain vigilant, however, as ongoing outbreaks elsewhere in the U.S. mean new cases could still appear in the state.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has proposed new regulations to restrict eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. The rule change would halt loan forgiveness for individuals employed by organizations deemed to be "undermining national security and American values through illegal means." The vague language has raised concerns among advocates that the administration could use it as a political tool to exclude non-profits it disapproves of from the popular program. The PSLF program, signed into law in 2007, allows government and non-profit employees to have their federal student loans canceled after ten years of qualifying payments.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin fell to around $115,000 after briefly touching a new all-time high of over $124,000 last week. The broader crypto market experienced a downturn, with over $500 million in forced liquidations of long positions triggered by macroeconomic concerns, including higher-than-expected wholesale inflation data. This has cast doubt on a potential Federal Reserve rate cut in September, prompting investors to take profits. The market was also affected by comments from the Treasury Secretary clarifying that the new strategic bitcoin reserve would initially be limited to forfeited assets, tempering expectations of large-scale government purchases.

          <p>The investigation into the disappearance of a 7-month-old baby in Yucaipa, California, has become more complex after his mother stopped cooperating with authorities. The mother, Rebecca Haro, initially reported that her son, Emmanuel, was kidnapped after she was attacked and knocked unconscious by an unknown man. However, the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department stated that her story contained inconsistencies and they could not rule out foul play. Due to the mother's decision to halt communication, a child advocacy group has retracted its offer of a $5,000 reward and assistance in the search for the missing infant.</p>

          <p>New York City police reopened Times Square after a brief but significant closure on Monday morning to investigate a report of a suspicious device. The area, a major hub for tourism and transit, was closed to all vehicle and pedestrian traffic for about an hour and a half between 42nd and 44th streets. The shutdown brought an unusual calm to the normally bustling district as police conducted their investigation. After determining there was no threat, authorities lifted the closures around noon, allowing normal activity to resume in one of Manhattan's busiest locations.</p>

          <p>The cable news channel MSNBC is set to change its name to MS NOW and will drop the iconic NBC peacock logo. This rebranding is part of a larger corporate restructuring, as the channel spins off from its parent company, Comcast's NBC Universal, into a new entity called Versant. The new name, which stands for My Source News Opinion World, is intended to establish a separate identity for the network. The move marks a significant shift for the channel founded nearly 30 years ago as a partnership between Microsoft (MS) and NBC, as it aims to build its own modern news organization.</p>

          <p>Several European leaders, including French President Macron and Italian Prime Minister Meloni, traveled to Washington for urgent talks with President Trump regarding the war in Ukraine. The visit was prompted by concerns over Trump's recent shift in strategy after meeting with Vladimir Putin, where he dropped demands for a ceasefire before peace talks and signaled no new sanctions on Russia. European officials fear this approach could lead to a "capitulation" by Ukraine, ceding territory to Russia without meaningful, long-term security guarantees for the rest of Europe. The leaders aim to convince Trump that any peace deal must address the broader security of the entire continent.</p>

          <p>The Canada Industrial Relations Board has declared the ongoing strike by 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants illegal and ordered them to return to work immediately. The ruling came after the union defied a previous back-to-work order issued over the weekend, extending a work stoppage that has disrupted travel for hundreds of thousands of passengers during the peak summer season. The union and the airline remain far apart in negotiations over pay and compensation for time spent on the ground. It is currently unclear what penalties the union may face if it continues to defy the federal labor board's directive.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As President Zelenskyy visits the White House, an analysis of financial aid to Ukraine reveals that while the U.S. is the largest single-country donor, Europe as a whole has contributed more. According to the Kiel Institute, European nations and EU institutions have collectively spent $165.7 billion on Ukraine since the 2022 invasion, compared to the U.S. total of $130.6 billion. This data contradicts claims made by President Trump suggesting a vast disparity in spending. The aid from both sides has been a mix of grants and loans, though the U.S. has provided more direct grants while the EU has offered more loans, some with generous repayment terms.</p>
