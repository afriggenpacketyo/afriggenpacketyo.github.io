          <p>Recently released 911 calls detail the chaotic aftermath of a fatal stabbing on the Charlotte light rail, where 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska was killed in an unprovoked attack. Witnesses expressed profound shock and recounted attempts by other passengers to provide aid, applying pressure to her severe wounds as many believed she was unresponsive. The suspect, 34-year-old Decarlos Brown Jr., was identified by witnesses and subsequently charged with first-degree murder, potentially facing the death penalty for committing an act causing death on a mass transportation system. In response to this tragedy, Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles has announced immediate increases in security measures across commuter trains, aiming to restore public confidence and prevent future incidents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A University of Cambridge professor debunks common myths about cooking oils, emphasizing that no single oil is a magic key to health. The article clarifies that sunflower and vegetable oils are good for us, being low in saturated fats and high in healthier mono- and polyunsaturated fats, and are also budget-friendly. Modern margarines are also deemed healthy, having near-zero trans fats and capable of reducing bad cholesterol. Furthermore, while extra virgin olive oil is best for dressings due to its low smoke point, basic olive oil is suitable for shallow frying, and vegetable or sunflower oil is recommended for deep frying due to higher heat tolerance.</p>

          <p>An NYPD detective, Melvin Eng, has been suspended without pay after allegedly pretending to be part of President Trump's security detail to gain unauthorized entry to the Ryder Cup golf tournament. Eng, reportedly on sick leave, arrived at the Long Island golf course in full tactical gear and managed to bypass Secret Service and state police, raising significant security concerns. His deception was ultimately uncovered when he dropped a magazine in front of working security personnel. Eng now faces administrative charges for theft of services, underscoring the serious implications of impersonating federal security at such a high-profile event and prompting questions about security protocols.</p>

Owner Taylor Cooley emphasizes the excitement of navigating the intricate pathways, which has twice earned a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's largest. The maze, featuring elaborate designs like this year's tribute to farmers and five elevated bridges, typically takes at least 45 minutes to complete. Beyond the main attraction, the pumpkin patch also offers a corn bath for toddlers, providing a distinctive and engaging fall experience for families.</p>

          <p>Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta is actively encouraging captain Martin Odegaard to continue embracing creative risks on the field, asserting that this approach is fundamental to his "phenomenal" nature. Odegaard's recent display in the Champions League win against Olympiacos, where he contributed to both goals, clearly showcased his crucial role and increasing influence for the Gunners. Arteta has granted the 26-year-old "total freedom" to explore and generate spaces, especially as he fully recovers from a shoulder injury that disrupted his season start.

          <p>Sir Mark Rowley, head of the Metropolitan Police, has issued a strong apology for the "reprehensible and completely unacceptable" behavior of officers at Charing Cross police station, brought to light by a BBC Panorama documentary. Undercover footage shockingly revealed officers making racist remarks about immigrants and Muslims, dismissing sexual assault claims, and expressing satisfaction in using force. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood and London Mayor Sir Sadiq Khan condemned the "disturbing" and "sickening" scenes, prompting an Independent Office for Police Conduct investigation. This incident has intensified calls for systemic change within the Met, highlighting deep-seated issues that require urgent rooting out to restore public confidence.</p>

          <p>Major tech companies like YouTube, Meta, and X have collectively paid President Trump and his associates nearly $60 million to settle lawsuits over the suspension of his accounts following the January 6 Capitol riot. This capitulation is seen as corporate cowardice, effectively arguing their post-insurrection content moderation decisions were wrong and weakening their stance on free speech. The article suggests these settlements allow companies to pivot away from moderation, reinforcing their argument that they are not publishers and should not be liable for platform content. This shift aligns with a broader trend of platforms loosening content rules and a perceived "MAGA pivot" by Big Tech.</p>

          <p>Manchester City twice squandered a lead, ultimately drawing 2-2 against Monaco in the Champions League after conceding a 90th-minute penalty. Star striker Erling Haaland, who scored both of City's goals, was highly critical of the team's performance, stating they "don't deserve to win" and lacked sufficient energy in the second half. This result continues a worrying trend for City, who have conceded late goals in several recent matches, costing them crucial points in both the Premier League and Champions League. Despite being unbeaten in their last six games, the team's struggles with late concessions and poor away form in European competition are becoming a significant concern for manager Pep Guardiola.</p>

Historical data from 22 previous shutdowns since 1976 indicates a modest impact on financial markets and the broader economy, particularly if the closure is brief. The S&P 500, for instance, averaged a 0.3% gain during past closures and a significant 13% jump in the 12 months following. However, experts caution that this current situation could differ due to unique political dynamics, warning that a prolonged shutdown could fuel market uncertainty, halt crucial economic reports, and negatively impact investment and hiring decisions.

His remarks, echoing common Catholic arguments, arose amidst a controversy concerning Chicago Cardinal Blase Cupich's plan to honor Senator Dick Durbin, who supports abortion rights. The Pope called for greater mutual respect and a comprehensive examination of all ethical issues within the Church's teachings, which unequivocally oppose both abortion and capital punishment while advocating for humane treatment of migrants.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's aggressive efforts to crack down on "sanctuary" cities and states, which limit cooperation with federal immigration officials, have yielded few tangible results so far. Despite numerous lawsuits, threats of funding cuts, and increased Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) presence, most jurisdictions continue to maintain their policies. Federal courts have largely blocked attempts to withhold funds, and the majority of over a dozen lawsuits filed by the Justice Department remain unresolved. Only Louisville, Kentucky, and the state of Nevada have notably reversed their sanctuary policies. The article highlights a long-standing political divide, with advocates citing community trust and opponents raising public safety concerns.</p>

          <p>Discussions about North Korea's military threat must evolve beyond its exclusive nuclear program to encompass its ambitious conventional military modernization. Leader Kim Jong-un has signaled a fundamental shift, aiming to simultaneously upgrade both nuclear and conventional armed forces, a strategy likely influenced by the Ukraine conflict's demonstration of conventional capabilities. This presents a critical new variable for Northeast Asian security: a nuclear-armed North Korea actively pursuing advanced conventional weapons systems, potentially with significant Russian assistance. The article emphasizes the world's urgent need to acknowledge and prepare for this comprehensive and evolving military challenge from Pyongyang, which aims to move beyond mere nuclear deterrence.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning significant changes to its asylum system, which will extend the waiting period for refugees to apply for permanent settlement beyond the current five years. Additionally, the route enabling refugees to automatically bring close relatives to the UK, which was temporarily suspended in September, will be permanently scrapped. These forthcoming changes, similar to those already planned for legal visa holders, aim to ensure that settlement is "earned by contributing to the country" and to reduce perceived "pull factors" for asylum seekers. Critics, including the Refugee Council, argue these measures will not deter people trying to reach the UK but will instead push more desperate individuals towards smugglers.</p>

          <p>President Trump's approval among Latino voters is reportedly slipping, primarily due to economic concerns like high grocery and housing prices, despite his historic 48% Latino vote in 2024. A recent New York Times/Sienna poll indicates 69% disapproval, with 58% believing he has worsened the economy. Democratic-commissioned polling also highlights that Latinos' top issue remains the economy, followed closely by immigration reform, with many fearing deportation for themselves or loved ones. However, these shifts away from Trump have not yet translated into significant gains for Democrats among these crucial voters. The article suggests Democrats need to focus on articulating specific benefits for Latino families to secure their support.</p>

Bermuda's Minister of National Security, Michael Weeks, emphasized the extreme seriousness of the threat, urging residents to prepare thoroughly for its arrival. Swells generated by both Imelda and the more distant Hurricane Humberto are also significantly impacting the U.S. East Coast, creating life-threatening surf and dangerous rip current conditions.

This significant surge in EV purchases is largely attributed to consumers pulling forward their plans to buy new zero-emissions vehicles ahead of the expiration of $7,500 federal incentives. Automakers are now implementing their own incentives, like Hyundai's price reductions and cash offers, to maintain sales momentum, acknowledging a potential temporary dip in EV market share following the end of the federal program.
