        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Boston has issued a preliminary injunction, preventing the Trump administration from reducing the Department of Education's workforce by half and transferring federal student loan management to the Small Business Administration. The judge, a Biden appointee, sided with a group of state attorneys general, schools, and nonprofits who argued that the president cannot unilaterally shut down a federal department created by Congress. The Trump administration argued that the changes would make the department more efficient, but the judge determined their true intention was to dismantle the department without legal authorization. The ruling underscores the legal challenges to the Trump administration's policies and its efforts to reshape federal agencies.</p>

          <p>Two people were hospitalized after a train traveling from Manchester to Cardiff collided with a tractor and trailer on a level crossing in Leominster, Herefordshire. Among the 56 passengers, one man was airlifted to the hospital with injuries not considered life-threatening, while a woman was transported by ambulance. Fifteen others were assessed and discharged at the scene, while the tractor driver remained uninjured. The British Transport Police and the Rail Accident Investigation Branch are investigating the circumstances leading up to the crash, which caused significant disruption to rail services in the area. The level crossing is a user-worked crossing, requiring the landowner to coordinate with a signaller to open and close the gates.</p>

          <p>A Cessna 550 crashed into a residential neighborhood in San Diego's Murphy Canyon near Tierrasanta early Thursday morning, resulting in multiple fatalities among those on board and the destruction of several homes. San Diego's assistant fire chief confirmed the fatalities and described the area as a "gigantic debris field" with jet fuel present throughout the neighborhood. Residents were quickly evacuated, and while there were no serious injuries reported among people on the ground, the incident prompted investigations by the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board. The plane had been attempting to land at Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport, located across a highway from the crash site.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Republican-controlled U.S. Senate voted to revoke California's vehicle emission standards that would have effectively banned the sale of new gasoline-only cars by 2035. The Senate overturned a Biden-era waiver that enabled California and other Democratic-led states to enforce zero-emission requirements for new passenger vehicles. Republicans argued that California's rule threatened the American auto industry and limited options for car buyers, while Democrats warned that nullifying the rule would have serious health effects. The vote proceeded despite warnings that the waivers could not be overturned with the Congressional Review Act, marking a rebuke of congressional norms.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House of Representatives has passed a bill that includes a strict work requirement for Medicaid recipients, mandating childless adults without disabilities to prove they worked, volunteered, or attended school for 80 hours monthly to maintain coverage. Experts estimate this could cause millions to lose insurance due to stringent paperwork demands, despite President Trump's assurance that no one will lose coverage. The Congressional Budget Office estimates this and other Medicaid changes could leave 7.6 million people uninsured, saving the government $280 billion over six years. While proponents argue it encourages contribution to society, opponents contend it's primarily a budget-saving measure that unfairly targets eligible individuals.</p>

          <p>Existing home sales in April declined by 0.5% from March, reaching the slowest pace for that month since 2009, according to the National Association of Realtors. Sales were down 2% from April of the previous year, falling short of economists' expectations for a gain. High interest rates and low consumer confidence continue to challenge the spring housing market, but any decline in mortgage rates could help release pent-up housing demand. Inventory jumped 9% month-to-month and was nearly 21% higher than the previous April, leading to a slight cooling in prices and more negotiation power for consumers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Treasury Department plans to discontinue the manufacturing of pennies due to the rising cost of production, which currently exceeds the coin's value. The U.S. Mint is expected to exhaust its final order of penny blanks by early 2026, resulting in approximately $56 million in annual savings. Pennies, primarily made of zinc with a copper overlay, have become increasingly expensive to produce as zinc costs have more than doubled since 2000. The Trump administration had previously signaled its intention to halt penny production, citing the financial inefficiency of minting coins that cost more to produce than their face value.</p>

He was apprehended by museum security after the shooting and reportedly chanted "free, free Palestine" during his arrest. The shooting is being investigated as a potential hate crime, and authorities are examining Rodriguez's social media activity, which includes pro-Palestine activism and frustration with media coverage of the Israel-Hamas war.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court announced a 4-4 split decision in Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board v. Drummond, effectively blocking the establishment of the nation's first religious charter school. Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself, leading to the tie. The decision upholds an Oklahoma Supreme Court ruling that prohibits the state from funding a Catholic charter school, meaning public schools in Oklahoma will remain secular.

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives passed President Trump's tax bill with a narrow vote, marking a victory for Republicans. The bill, which aims to deliver promised tax cuts, faces a complex path through the Senate due to concerns over its impact on the federal deficit. Democrats are strongly opposed to the bill's cuts to social safety nets to finance the tax cuts. An analysis from the Congressional Budget Office suggests the bill would decrease resources for lower-income households while increasing resources for higher-income households. The bill includes amendments designed to appease various factions within the House GOP, such as an accelerated timeline for Medicaid work requirements and an increase in the SALT deduction cap.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are carefully managing Shohei Ohtani's return to pitching, prioritizing his offensive contributions amid a series of injuries to the team's starting pitchers. Despite Ohtani's progress in bullpen sessions, the Dodgers are hesitant to rush him back to the mound, given their need for his bat and the risks associated with pitching. The team faces a challenging stretch of games against winning teams, with their pitching staff significantly depleted. The Dodgers are gambling on their existing pitchers and manager Dave Roberts' ability to navigate the injury crisis, while protecting Ohtani's offensive capabilities.</p>

The lawsuit seeks compensation for survivors and their heirs, along with a full accounting of the government's expenditures on the boarding school system.
