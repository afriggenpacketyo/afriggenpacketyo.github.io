Police identified Tranell Williams, 38, days after the August 20 incident, while Carroll's brother and a friend expressed profound shock and sought answers regarding the tragic event.

          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch experienced slowed sales growth in its fiscal second quarter, with the namesake Abercrombie brand declining by 5%. However, the company's overall performance was bolstered by a significant 19% surge in sales at its teen-focused Hollister brand, marking its best-ever second-quarter growth. The retailer narrowly exceeded Wall Street expectations for revenue and earnings, subsequently raising its full-year revenue outlook despite facing higher tariff costs, now estimated at $90 million. CEO Fran Horowitz expressed confidence in the company's trajectory, highlighting efforts to boost Abercrombie's growth through new categories and partnerships, including a multi-year deal with the NFL.

          <p>A federal judge's impending ruling could jeopardize Google's lucrative default search contracts, including a $20 billion annual deal with Apple, which constitutes nearly a quarter of Alphabet's operating income. While Google risks losing search traffic, analysts suggest that being freed from these costly agreements could paradoxically fuel its AI growth, allowing it to redirect funds and focus on platforms like Gemini. Despite concerns about Apple's potential financial hit, some economists believe Google's search dominance is robust enough to withstand the change, especially given its strong performance in Europe where similar regulations had little impact on market share. The Department of Justice is also pushing for restrictions on exclusive AI distribution deals. (not investment advice)</p>

This situation arises as Trump has repeatedly expressed interest in acquiring the strategically important, semi-autonomous Danish territory in the Arctic, despite denials from both Danish and Greenlandic politicians. The Danish Security and Intelligence Service confirmed awareness of influence campaigns aimed at creating discord between Denmark and Greenland, whether through physical agents or disinformation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's top economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, publicly urged Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to take a leave of absence from the central bank, citing it as the "honorable thing to do." This pressure comes as Cook prepares to file a lawsuit challenging Trump's attempt to remove her, which her attorney describes as lacking factual or legal basis and based solely on a referral letter. Hassett defended the President's authority to remove a Fed governor "for cause," while the Fed confirmed Cook's intention to seek a judicial decision to confirm her ability to fulfill her responsibilities. The dispute, centering on allegations of mortgage fraud raised by another Trump appointee, could ultimately reach the Supreme Court, highlighting a significant legal and political battle.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration imposed a 50% tariff on Indian goods, including a 25% penalty for transactions with Russia, aiming to punish Delhi for its continued purchase of Russian oil and weapons. India, a key US strategic partner, has rejected the tariffs as unfair, vowing to prioritize its 1.4 billion people by securing the "best deal" on oil. In response, Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised tax cuts and urged citizens to embrace "Swadeshi" or "Made in India" products to foster self-reliance, acknowledging the potential disruption to export-driven industries.

Wood, a crucial component for England's pace attack due to his high pace, has been sidelined since February after surgery and was cautiously omitted from upcoming white-ball matches to prioritize his Ashes readiness. He expressed his determination to play county matches rather than just net practice to prepare, stating he would "go insane" otherwise. The Ashes series begins in Perth on November 21, and Wood's recovery is vital for England's hopes of generating high pace against Australia, as he is one of their quickest options.</p>

          <p>A CBS News analysis of Washington D.C. crime data reveals a nearly 50% reduction in violent crime during the three weeks since President Trump deployed federal troops and law enforcement, compared to the same period last year. The analysis indicates that federal deployments were largely concentrated in areas with higher crime rates, challenging some public narratives that suggested otherwise. Despite the White House touting over 1,000 arrests and firearm seizures, local police data shows a similar arrest pace to previous years and a pre-existing downward trend in crime. Local leaders like D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser question the necessity and impact of the increased federal presence, arguing it scares people away, while some residents applaud it for public safety.</p>

The administration has designated cartels as foreign terrorist organizations and secured a deal for Mexico to extradite 26 high-ranking cartel figures.

Despite a less spectacular U.S. English-dubbed release, an earlier subtitled version performed well, indicating an audience for the original.

          <p>MongoDB shares skyrocketed over 30% after the database software company reported better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results and provided an upbeat forecast. The company's revenue increased by 24% year-over-year to $591 million, significantly exceeding expectations, with sales of its cloud database service, MongoDB Atlas, rising by 29%. MongoDB added over 5,000 customers year-to-date, its highest ever for the first half, many of whom are identified as "AI native companies." CEO Dev Ittycheria attributed this growth to a strategic shift towards larger companies, noting that these new workloads are growing faster than anticipated. The company's full fiscal year guidance also significantly surpassed analyst expectations for both revenue and earnings per share. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Millions of UK households will see their annual energy bills rise by £35, or 2%, from October 1 under the latest price cap announced by energy regulator Ofgem. This increase will bring the typical annual bill to £1,755, driven by factors including extended government support for those on benefits and costs associated with balancing electricity supply. Campaigners express concern, predicting another winter of relatively high energy bills for struggling families, many of whom are already in significant energy debt. The article notes that while the cap sets unit prices, the total bill depends on usage, and advises consumers to consider fixed-price deals to potentially save money, as a "healthier market" is emerging with more fixed deals.</p>

Bid-ask spreads are narrowing across sectors, with "living" (multifamily apartments) showing the most improvement, while industrial lags due to supply chain uncertainty and tariffs.

          <p>Miriam Toews, author of "Women Talking," explores the profound question of "Why I Write" in her new memoir, "A Truce That Is Not Peace." The article discusses how Toews confronts the deaths, grief, and guilt that have animated her work for nearly 30 years, particularly the suicides of her father and sister, both of whom suffered from severe depression. Drawing inspiration from poet Christian Wiman's concept of a "truce that is not peace," Toews's memoir is a layered, associative meditation structured around fragments of memory, nightmares, and decades-old letters to her sister. She ultimately concludes that writing, though it couldn't save her sister, has kept her alive, serving as a way of holding onto loved ones and filling the "bewildering silence" they left behind.</p>

          <p>Home equity loan and HELOC rates are forecast to decline slightly in fall 2025, primarily driven by anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts, with an 88% chance of a 25-basis-point reduction at the September meeting. While current rates remain relatively affordable in the low-to-mid 8% range, experts advise against expecting dramatic drops. The Fed's decisions will hinge on inflation, the labor market, and overall economic momentum. Borrowers are encouraged to monitor market conditions, improve credit scores, and maintain lower loan-to-value ratios to secure better rates, as well as shop around for lenders, since rates can differ by a full percentage point.

Recommendations include considering a fixed-rate energy deal, which could be significantly cheaper than the variable rate, and switching to direct debit payments for potential savings. The article also advises checking eligibility for financial support schemes like the Warm Home Discount and Cold Weather Payment, and warns against scams. Finally, it suggests reviewing energy usage habits, such as insulating homes, turning down combi boiler flow rates, and using energy-efficient appliances, to keep costs down without sacrificing warmth, emphasizing the importance of staying warm, especially for vulnerable groups.</p>

This technology is considered "game-changing" due to its potential for more compact, lightweight, and efficient engines, requiring far fewer mechanical components than traditional air-breathing engines.

Douglas cites President Trump's militarization of domestic policing, including deploying federal agents and the National Guard in D.C., and FBI raids on political opponents, as examples. He contends that Trump's "crime fighting" justification is a ruse, as D.C. crime rates were low, and warns of the dangers of deploying troops to Chicago or even polling places, potentially creating the very emergencies they claim to address.
