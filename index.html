            <h2>Luigi Mangione's Case Draws Parallels to the Unabomber</h2>

            <p>Luigi Mangione, indicted for the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has sparked debate, with some viewing him as a vigilante against the healthcare system. Mangione's online activity, particularly his review of the "Unabomber Manifesto," has drawn scrutiny, noting its prescient predictions about modern society. Sean Fleming, a researcher studying ant-tech radicalism, observes parallels between Mangione and Ted Kaczynski, including assassinating corporate executives to create a media spectacle and being disaffected overachievers with STEM backgrounds. Kaczynski's manifesto, advocating for the destruction of modern technology, has seen a resurgence in popularity due to concerns about climate change and AI.</p>

            <p>Barbara Lee, a former U.S. Representative, has won Oakland's special election for mayor, succeeding Sheng Thao, who was recalled and indicted.

Oakland faces ongoing crises, including a significant budget deficit, rising homelessness, and a crime surge. Lee's victory comes after losing the Democratic primary for U.S. Senate and promises a fresh perspective to address these issues, including a 100-day plan focused on public safety, homelessness, good governance, and economic opportunity.</p>

            <p>China's ambassador to the United States, Xie Feng, cautioned against repeating the tariff mistakes of the Great Depression era, referencing the Smoot-Hawley Act, which is believed to have worsened the economic crisis. Speaking at a Traditional Chinese Medicine event, Xie used ancient lore to emphasize addressing the root causes of economic issues rather than merely treating the symptoms. He called for collaborative efforts to expand the global economy instead of engaging in disputes over existing resources. The ambassador's remarks come amid escalating tariff tensions between the U.S. and China.</p>

            <p>New data reveals over 1 million abortions were performed in the U.S. in 2024, with approximately 155,000 people crossing state lines to access the procedure, doubling pre-Roe numbers. States like Illinois, North Carolina, Kansas, and New Mexico have become major hubs for out-of-state patients. Despite these efforts, an estimated 20-25% of individuals seeking abortions are still unable to obtain them due to bans. The Trump administration's dismantling of the CDC team responsible for abortion surveillance reports raises concerns about tracking public health outcomes and assessing the impact of policies.</p>

            <p>President Trump's economic approval rating has reached its lowest point, driven by discontent over tariffs, inflation, and government spending, according to a CNBC survey. Economic optimism following his reelection has waned, with more Americans anticipating a worsening economy and a pessimistic outlook on the stock market. While his Republican base remains supportive, Democrats and independents are significantly more negative about his economic policies. The public disapproves of tariffs and is concerned about inflation, with a majority believing a recession is imminent.</p>
