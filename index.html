          <p>A suspect is in custody following a stabbing attack at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan, that left eleven people injured. According to the Grand Traverse County Sheriff, the attack appeared to be random and occurred near the store's checkout area, where a "standard holding knife-style weapon" was recovered. The victims were transported to a local medical center for treatment. Officials, including Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, have acknowledged the swift response of law enforcement and citizen involvement in apprehending the suspect, while the FBI is assisting with the ongoing investigation into the brutal act of violence.</p>

          <p>A new BBC documentary series is set to explore the history of the "Jesus Army," a now-disbanded evangelical movement in the UK linked to widespread abuse. The investigation, which began years ago, uncovered hundreds of traumatized victims who suffered physical and sexual assault, with children being particularly vulnerable within the group's communal homes. The film's director, Ellena Wood, interviewed over 80 survivors, revealing how the cult's founder, Noel Stanton, and senior leaders allegedly covered up the abuse for years. The Jesus Fellowship Trust, which is managing the group's affairs, has apologized and established a redress scheme for victims.</p>

          <p>An American Airlines flight bound for Miami was evacuated on the runway at Denver International Airport due to a landing gear issue during takeoff. The Boeing 737 MAX 8, carrying 173 passengers and six crew members, experienced a problem with a tire, leading to visible smoke and a small fire that was extinguished by the fire department. All individuals were safely evacuated via emergency slides, with only one person transported for a minor injury. The incident caused a temporary ground stop at the airport, but operations have since returned to normal, and passengers were rebooked on a replacement aircraft.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has resumed airdropping humanitarian aid into Gaza and announced plans for humanitarian corridors amid a severe hunger crisis and increasing international pressure. The move comes as the United Nations and other groups report a rising number of starvation-related deaths, particularly among children, with aid distribution hampered by military restrictions and logistical challenges. While Israel states it is facilitating aid, UN officials argue that airdrops are insufficient and call for lifting restrictions on land access to prevent a full-blown famine. The situation remains dire, with ongoing combat and recent deadly incidents involving civilians seeking aid.</p>

          <p>An advertisement for the brand Guess in Vogue magazine has generated controversy by featuring a photorealistic model created entirely by artificial intelligence. This marks the first time an AI-generated person has appeared in the magazine, raising questions about the future of modeling and the reinforcement of unrealistic beauty standards. Critics, including plus-size model Felicity Hayward, call the move "disheartening" and a setback for diversity in the fashion industry. While the AI firm behind the model defends its work, the ad has ignited a debate about transparency, the potential displacement of human workers, and the psychological impact of digitally perfected, unattainable images.</p>

Despite its historical acclaim for being "as accurate as the gods," the invention has been dismissed by some modern scholars and was even removed from school curriculums.

          <p>Emerging research is revealing the potential long-term health impacts of nanoplastics, with a recent study at the University of New Mexico finding these microscopic particles in human brain tissue for the first time. Scientists have also found more plastic in the brains of people with dementia. Further studies are linking nanoplastic pollution to a higher risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke, as well as hormonal issues and cognitive abnormalities in children. Experts explain that these particles, which originate from degrading plastic waste, can act as "toxic drug delivery systems" in the body, prompting calls for urgent action to reduce plastic use.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge has been placed on the injured list with a flexor strain in his right elbow, but an MRI revealed no acute damage to his ulnar collateral ligament, a result considered good news. The injury, which affects his throwing but not his hitting, was first felt during a game earlier in the week. While Judge will miss time and received a PRP injection, the team is optimistic he can return in 10 to 14 days, initially as a designated hitter. The diagnosis comes as a relief to the team and its fans, who feared a more serious, long-term injury for the star player.</p>

          <p>A new article reflects on the legacy of "The Osbournes," the early 2000s MTV show that transformed Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne into a beloved reality TV father and pioneered the "reality sitcom" genre. Before shows like "Keeping Up With the Kardashians," the series captivated audiences by blending the family's rock-star fame with mundane domestic life, from Ozzy struggling with a TV remote to family squabbles. Producers recall how the show was an experiment that humanized the famous family and established many tropes still used in reality TV today.

          <p>Ahead of the tense Euro 2025 final, experts in psychology are explaining the intense physical and emotional reactions fans experience during high-stakes football matches. The body's stress response, driven by hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, can cause an elevated heart rate, shakiness, and anxiety, which is a normal reaction for deeply invested supporters. To manage these effects, psychologists advise getting adequate rest, having a clear match-day plan, and engaging in physical movement to release energy. They also suggest reframing the nervous feelings as part of an enjoyable, collective experience that allows for a rare and healthy expression of emotion.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in 20 to 30 years, defying typical seasonal expectations with persistent fog and daytime high temperatures struggling to leave the mid-60s. Meteorologists attribute the chilly weather to a misplaced high-pressure system and increased coastal upwelling, which brings cold, deep ocean water to the surface. While the gray, drizzly conditions are a source of conversation and jokes for Bay Area residents, they stand in stark contrast to the oppressive heat waves affecting other parts of California. Forecasters warn that summer is not over, however, as the city's hottest days historically occur in September.</p>

The reforms hope to reverse the steady decline in the number of UK pubs by making it easier to open new establishments and promote al fresco dining and live performances. The government hopes the changes will bring new vibrancy to the hospitality sector.</p>

          <p>Opposition lawmakers in Taiwan have successfully survived a recall vote, ensuring they will retain their controlling majority in the legislature and continue the country's political gridlock. The recall campaign was initiated by civic groups who accused 24 opposition lawmakers of being "pro-China" and undermining national security. Since winning a legislative majority in early 2024, the opposition has consistently blocked the agenda of President William Lai's Democratic Progressive Party. The failure of the recall effort means the tense political standoff is likely to persist, forcing President Lai to navigate an emboldened opposition for the remainder of his term.</p>

          <p>A BBC News investigation has uncovered how a convicted fraudster named James Kenny orchestrated a completely fabricated music festival, "Monmouth Rising," from his mother's kitchen. Kenny falsely claimed the event would be a 45,000-capacity, hydrogen-powered festival featuring major acts like The Killers and Pulp, duping employees and suppliers into providing work for which they were never paid. The investigation revealed that Kenny used forged documents and false claims of backing from prominent investors and the Welsh government to build his scheme. After his plan unraveled, Kenny cancelled the event, leaving many out of pocket and exposing his long history of deceit.</p>

          <p>Joseph Czuba, the 73-year-old Illinois landlord sentenced to 53 years in prison for a hate-crime attack, has died in custody. Three months ago, Czuba was found guilty of murdering 6-year-old Wadee Alfayoumi and attempting to murder his mother, Hanan Shaheen, in October 2023. Prosecutors demonstrated that Czuba targeted the pair because they were Muslim, with the attack occurring just days after the start of the Israel-Hamas war. He stabbed the young boy 26 times. The brutal case drew international attention and heightened fears of anti-Muslim violence in the U.S., deeply affecting the large Palestinian community in the Chicago area.</p>

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight en route to Las Vegas from Burbank, California, executed a sudden dive of nearly 500 feet to avoid a potential midair collision. Shortly after takeoff, the pilots of Flight 1496 received an onboard traffic alert about another aircraft, a decommissioned fighter jet, in their vicinity. The pilots responded immediately by rapidly descending to create a safe distance between the two planes. The flight continued to its destination and landed without further incident. While no passengers were injured, one flight attendant was treated for minor injuries, and the FAA is now investigating the event.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's expansive use of tariffs and recently negotiated trade agreements are facing critical legal challenges, with a federal appeals court set to hear arguments in a key case. The lawsuit contests Trump's authority to impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the law underpinning many of his recent trade actions. A lower court has already ruled that Trump exceeded his authority, a decision that was paused pending appeal. If the courts ultimately rule against the administration, it could invalidate a wide range of tariffs and trade deals, creating significant uncertainty for U.S. economic policy.

During the visit, Modi unveiled a $565 million credit line and inaugurated several India-funded infrastructure projects. The move signals a thaw in tensions, with both leaders emphasizing their nations' long-standing partnership in a geopolitically strategic area of the Indian Ocean.</p>

          <p>England's hopes for victory against India in the fourth Test are clouded by uncertainty over captain Ben Stokes' fitness. After bowling extensively in the first innings and retiring hurt with cramp while batting, Stokes did not bowl at all on the fourth day, with the coaching staff describing him as "a bit stiff and sore." The team will assess him overnight to see if he can contribute on the final day. Given Stokes' history with injuries and his crucial role as an all-rounder, his potential absence from the bowling attack is a significant concern for England as they push for a series-leveling win.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's response when asked if he would consider pardoning convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell has drawn criticism and bewilderment from legal analysts. When questioned by a reporter, Trump stated, "It’s something I haven’t thought about," rather than outright rejecting the possibility. Maxwell, a close associate of the late Jeffrey Epstein, is currently serving a 20-year sentence for helping sexually abuse underage girls. CNN analyst Elie Honig called it "the easiest question in human history," expressing shock at the president's failure to immediately dismiss the idea of pardoning one of the most notorious child sex traffickers in modern history.</p>

          <p>More than two decades after its original release, the beloved film "Bend It Like Beckham" is officially getting a sequel, director Gurinder Chadha has confirmed. The 2002 movie, which starred Keira Knightley and Parminder Nagra, is credited with inspiring a generation of female footballers. Chadha stated that the recent success of England's Lionesses and the upcoming 25th anniversary of the film in 2027 make it the right time to revisit the characters. While the format is still undecided—it could be a film or a TV series—the director hopes to reunite the original cast and potentially include cameos from current football stars.</p>

The actress, who was once married to Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, appeared in a short video to help the company move past the scandal that erupted at one of the band's concerts. In the video, Paltrow humorously addresses the public's "newfound interest in data workflow automation" while deftly avoiding any mention of the controversy. The move is a lighthearted attempt at damage control for the embattled company.</p>
