          <p>London's public transport is severely impacted as Underground staff, members of the RMT union, begin a five-day strike over pay and working conditions. The union is demanding a 32-hour work week and is protesting fatigue management, while Transport for London has offered a 3.4% pay increase. This rolling action will result in little to no service on the Tube until Friday, with other services like the Elizabeth line and buses expected to be much busier. This marks the first network-wide Tube strike since March 2023, causing significant disruption for commuters.</p>

          <p>Daniel Andreas San Diego, a suspected double bomber linked to animal rights extremism, is facing an extradition hearing in London after being on the FBI's most-wanted list for 21 years. He was apprehended in Wales in 2024 after disappearing in 2003 following a series of bombings in California's San Francisco Bay Area. Former FBI agents reflect on "missed opportunities" to arrest him before he fled, discovering a "bomb-making lab" in his abandoned car. San Diego, who had a $250,000 bounty, will now face a UK court to determine if he will be sent back to the US to stand trial.</p>

          <p>Global financial markets are experiencing significant volatility, particularly in European government bonds, driven by political instability in France. Investors are concerned that French President Emmanuel Macron may be forced to call a snap election, which could impact the country's sovereign debt rating. All eyes are on the upcoming European Central Bank meeting, where President Christine Lagarde is expected to hold interest rates steady but will likely face questions about the economic uncertainty. The situation highlights growing investor anxiety over political risks influencing market stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwan is enhancing its defense capabilities by developing a new class of low-cost, long-range attack drones in collaboration with US company Kratos. These unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), reportedly derived from the MQM-178 system, are said to have a range of at least 1,000 kilometers. This positions them as a strategic, affordable alternative to more expensive cruise missiles, capable of striking deep into mainland China. The development signifies a deepening of military-technical cooperation between Taipei and Washington amid rising regional tensions.</p>

          <p>Sky-gazers in the United Kingdom are preparing to witness a total lunar eclipse, which will cause the full moon to take on a reddish hue, creating a "Blood Moon" effect. The spectacle occurs when the Earth passes directly between the Sun and the Moon, casting its shadow on the lunar surface. While the full eclipse will be visible, viewing in the UK will be limited to the period after moonrise, with eastern parts of the country getting the best and longest view. Astronomers encourage the public to watch the event, which showcases the mechanics of the solar system in real-time.</p>

          <p>This opinion article contends that world leaders, including UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, are making a strategic error by attempting to curry favor with Donald Trump. Citing examples like India's Narendra Modi and France's Emmanuel Macron, the author argues that such efforts ultimately fail and result in humiliation or broken promises. The piece criticizes Starmer's "Trump-whisperer" approach ahead of a planned state visit, suggesting it yields few benefits for the UK while damaging its reputation. The author concludes that resistance and strength, rather than appeasement, are more effective ways to deal with Trump's transactional and personal approach to foreign policy.</p>

          <p>A collaborative team of scientists from the US and China has discovered a novel way to launch millimeter-scale robots into the air using the energy from collapsing vapor bubbles. The process, known as cavitation, is triggered by using a laser to rapidly heat light-absorbing materials on a wet surface, causing water droplets to boil and form bubbles. When these bubbles collapse, they release a powerful force capable of propelling small objects up to 1.5 meters high. This innovative method could have applications in soft robotics and micro-scale machinery, demonstrating how a typically destructive natural phenomenon can be harnessed for controlled propulsion.</p>

          <h2>Israeli Military Expands Gaza City Operations, Urges Residents to Evacuate to Southern Safe Zone</h2>

          <p>The Israeli army is expanding its military operations in Gaza City and has called on Palestinian residents to evacuate to a designated humanitarian zone in the south. The military identified a makeshift tent camp area in Muwasi as a safe zone and urged people to leave what it terms a Hamas stronghold. This move comes as aid groups warn that a large-scale evacuation will worsen the severe humanitarian crisis, with many famine-stricken residents too weak to move or having nowhere safe to go. The war, which began after the Hamas attack in October 2023, has resulted in over 64,000 Palestinian deaths, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.</p>

          <p>Heather Hall, a college instructor and mother of two from South Carolina, has been identified as the American citizen killed in the recent funicular crash in Lisbon, Portugal. Hall, who specialized in literacy and special education at the College of Charleston, was in Lisbon to speak at a conference when the tragic accident occurred, killing 15 others. Her family and colleagues remembered her as a passionate advocate for people with disabilities and someone who lived life fully. Investigators have indicated that a cable on the railway snapped, though the emergency brakes also failed to prevent the derailment.</p>
