          <p>American golfer Scottie Scheffler has won his first British Open, claiming the Claret Jug at Royal Portrush with a commanding four-stroke lead.

          <p>According to the Hamas-run Health Ministry, at least 85 Palestinians were killed in Gaza while attempting to access humanitarian aid convoys. The deadliest incident occurred in northern Gaza, where witnesses reported Israeli forces fired on massive crowds gathered at the Zikim crossing. The Israel Defense Forces stated they fired warning shots to disperse a crowd that posed a threat, and they dispute the casualty figures provided by Gaza officials. The event highlights the catastrophic humanitarian crisis and the extreme dangers civilians face in their desperate search for food amid the ongoing war and new Israeli evacuation orders for central Gaza.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a three-game sweep by the Milwaukee Brewers, culminating in a 6-5 loss that extended their worst slump since 2018. The team's struggles were compounded when star first baseman Freddie Freeman was forced to leave the game with a left wrist contusion after being hit by a pitch. This potential loss of Freeman adds to an already injury-plagued roster, presenting a significant challenge for the team. The game ended on a frustrating note as Mookie Betts lined out with the bases loaded, sealing the sweep and deepening concerns about the team's current performance.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the UK's High Speed 2 (HS2) rail line suggests the project was beset by fundamental problems from its inception, leading to massive cost and time overruns. Insiders and experts point to a combination of factors, including an initial ambition to build the world's fastest line, which dramatically increased costs. The article also highlights the complexities of the UK's democratic and property-owning landscape, where a complex hybrid bill process allowed for thousands of expensive changes to appease local constituencies. This resulted in a fragmented and inefficient planning process that contributed to the project's current state of uncertainty and massive expense.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent clashes of the 1980s miners' strike. The incident, which took place on June 18, 1984, involved thousands of police officers and striking miners at a coking plant in Rotherham, leaving over 100 injured. The inquiry comes after decades of campaigning by former miners and their families, who have long sought accountability for the events of that day and the subsequent failed prosecutions of 95 miners, which collapsed amid allegations of falsified police evidence. The decision marks a landmark moment for those seeking justice and truth.</p>

          <p>A new book and investigation reveal a Vatican-led program from 1950 to 1970 that sent approximately 3,500 Italian children to the United States for adoption, falsely classifying them as orphans.

The report details how consent forms were forged or misleading, with some mothers being tragically told their child had died.

He noted that while a framework deal on tariffs has been announced, an extension of the 90-day pause is almost inevitable, as a return to triple-digit tariffs is unthinkable for either side. However, the business community remains worried because discussions have been narrowly focused on tariffs, ignoring broader systemic issues. Stein suggests that a path toward a more normal trade relationship could emerge if the U.S. reciprocates China's recent move to restrict fentanyl precursors by lowering some tariffs.

Her comments follow teammate Jess Carter's revelation that she received significant racial abuse during the Euro 2025 tournament, prompting her to step back from social media. Bronze emphasized that while criticism is part of the sport, abuse is unacceptable and seems to be a particular problem online for female players. The Lionesses squad has decided to stop taking a knee before matches, seeking a new way to combat racism, and continues to use its platform to call for more accountability from social media companies.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has vowed to stay in his post despite his ruling coalition losing its majority in the upper house of parliament. The defeat for his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its partner, Komeito, marks the first time since 1955 that the LDP has lacked a majority in both houses. The election results reflect public discontent over inflation and political scandals, as well as the rise of the right-wing populist Sanseito party. Ishiba cited the need to lead critical trade negotiations with the United States as his reason for not resigning, though he may face internal pressure to step down.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced the creation of a new water ombudsman to serve as a single point of contact for consumer complaints against water companies. This new watchdog will have legal powers to address issues like leaks, incorrect billing, and poor service. The move is part of a wider overhaul of the water industry, which has faced intense public backlash over rising bills and a record number of sewage discharges into waterways. Environment Secretary Steve Reed described the sector as "broken" and has pledged to significantly reduce pollution spills, signaling major reforms are forthcoming for the industry and its regulator, Ofwat.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that while Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's recent visit to China had positive aspects, his government's concurrent actions are sabotaging the potential for improved relations. The author contends that by publicly discussing the potential forced sale of the Chinese-leased Port of Darwin, Albanese undermined his own message that Australia is a reliable place for Chinese investment. This move is seen as sending a contradictory signal, playing to a domestic audience and media critical of China while simultaneously attempting to stabilize a crucial economic and diplomatic relationship. The piece suggests this approach creates mistrust and hinders genuine progress.</p>

Created by artist Robert Vargas, the vibrant artwork depicts Valenzuela in his famous windup pose and tipping his cap, symbolizing his connection to the Latino community. Valenzuela, who played for the Dodgers from 1980 to 1990, sparked the phenomenon known as "Fernandomania" and became a hero to fans who saw his success as a source of immense pride. The mural serves as a permanent tribute to a player whose impact transcended the field, uniting a city and inspiring generations.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly disputed a Wall Street Journal report claiming that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent convinced him not to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The report suggested Bessent argued that removing Powell could destabilize the economy and that a firing was unnecessary since the Fed is already expected to cut interest rates. In a social media post, Trump called the story untruthful, asserting, "Nobody had to explain that to me... People don't explain to me, I explain to them!" This denial comes amid ongoing, harsh criticism of Powell by the president and his allies over interest rate policy. (not investment advice)</p>

Lyons defended his agents' tactics, including wearing masks for safety, and stated that while they prioritize serious criminals, anyone in the country illegally is subject to arrest. In contrast, Mayor Bass condemned the raids as a "reign of terror," describing them as random and fear-inducing, and criticized the use of masked agents in unmarked cars as looking like violent kidnappings.

          <p>A new CBS News poll reveals that six months into his second term, President Trump's job approval rating has fallen to 42 percent. The decline appears linked to public perception of his key policies, particularly immigration and the economy. A majority of Americans now believe the administration's deportation efforts have expanded beyond targeting only dangerous criminals, and support for the program has dropped. On the economy, most Americans oppose new tariffs and feel the administration is not focused enough on lowering consumer prices. The poll suggests a growing disconnect between the administration's actions and the expectations of the broader public.</p>
