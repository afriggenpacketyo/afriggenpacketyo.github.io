          <p>According to the New York Times, Britain is on track to become the first nation to finalize a trade agreement with the United States following the imposition of tariffs. While the White House and British Embassy have not commented, a UK Department for Business and Trade spokesperson stated that discussions are underway with the U.S., emphasizing the importance of the alliance and aiming for a resolution that benefits both UK businesses and consumers. It remains unclear whether the agreement will be a finalized deal or a framework for future negotiations, especially given conflicting statements from U.S. officials regarding the necessity of formal trade deals. This development follows previous indications of a potential agreement and the U.K.'s avoidance of higher reciprocal tariffs.</p>

The university will restrict campus access, requiring IDs for building entry, and has suspended guest and alumni access.

          <p>The British film and TV industry is concerned about President Trump's proposal to impose 100 percent tariffs on films made in "foreign lands." The industry, still recovering from pandemic shutdowns and Hollywood strikes, relies heavily on American productions, with nearly 90 percent of its film and high-end TV production revenue coming from abroad. Experts question the enforceability of such tariffs, given the international nature of film production. The British government is in discussions with the U.S. administration, but the uncertainty could devastate the industry.</p>

The avatar was created using AI and archival research, but the course content is based on Christie's own words and advice. While Christie's family supports the project, some ethicists argue that it is still problematic because Christie cannot consent to the course. The use of AI in this way raises questions about authenticity, artistic integrity, and the potential for blurring the lines between fact and fiction.</p>

The article discusses potential solutions such as degrowth, green growth, and a new form of managed capitalism, while also acknowledging the difficulties in implementing these changes and the political forces that resist them. The author writes, in containing capitalism within a new set of rules and social norms, postwar Keynesian social democracy seemingly refuted Polanyiâ€™s argument, which he made during the 1930s, that socialism or fascism was the logical end point of the system.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are utilizing powerful Earth-based instruments, including the world's largest radio telescope, to search for water ice at the moon's south pole. A study estimates that ice makes up no more than 6% of the lunar soil within the top 10 meters, existing as fragmented chunks buried 5-7 meters underground. The findings could aid in selecting landing sites for future lunar missions and inform the design of a China-led research base on the moon, opening a new pathway to investigate water abundances.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that deporting noncitizens to Libya without due process would violate an existing court order. The ruling came after lawyers representing migrants filed an emergency motion to prevent deportations to Libya or Saudi Arabia, citing press reports and firsthand accounts. The judge clarified that any imminent removals to these countries would violate the preliminary injunction he issued last month, which bars the Trump administration from deporting noncitizens to any country other than their place of origin without due process.</p>

The author describes the process of using tools like Cursor and Gemini 2.5 Pro to develop a negotiation training tool, emphasizing that the process relies more on prompt engineering than traditional coding skills. The author said that the class taught her that the most difficult part of using AI to code is not the coding itself, but coming up with a solid idea for the software.</p>

The announcement comes as British officials have also been negotiating with the European Union and agreed to a trade deal with India.</p>
