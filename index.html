          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to expedite investigations into his political rivals, including former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James. In social media posts, Trump expressed frustration that "nothing is being done," a sentiment that follows the departure of a federal prosecutor who reportedly found insufficient evidence to charge James. Critics, such as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, have condemned the move, warning that using the Justice Department to target political enemies is a step toward authoritarianism.</p>

          <p>A leading Chinese analyst on the South China Sea has suggested that Beijing may construct a science laboratory at the contested Scarborough Shoal. Wu Shicun, president of the National Institute for South China Sea Studies, proposed that the facility could host international experts for coral reef and fisheries research. This potential development has drawn condemnation from the Philippines, which also claims the territory—known as Bajo de Masinloc—and considers it part of its exclusive economic zone. The proposal signals a potential escalation of territorial disputes in the strategically important waterway.</p>

          <p>A 64-year-old man, Anibal Hernandez-Santana, has been taken into federal custody after allegedly firing multiple shots at the ABC10 television station building in Sacramento. The incident, which occurred on Friday afternoon, is being investigated as a drive-by shooting and resulted in at least three rounds hitting the building's exterior, though no injuries were reported. After initially being released on bail for local charges, the suspect was rearrested by the FBI on a federal charge of interfering with a radio communications station. The motive remains under investigation, but the event has drawn condemnation as an attack on journalism.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that media executive Lachlan Murdoch and his father, Rupert Murdoch, are expected to be part of an investor group aiming to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations. In a Fox News interview, Trump also named Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell as likely participants, describing them as "American patriots." The potential deal is being negotiated to comply with a U.S. law requiring TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell its American arm over national security concerns. This development suggests a powerful coalition of media and tech figures could soon control the popular social media platform.</p>

Authorities have arrested 23-year-old Hunter Nadeau in connection with the attack, charging him with second-degree murder in the killing of 59-year-old Robert Steven DeCesare. Witnesses reported that the gunman shouted "free Palestine" before opening fire, though investigators are still working to determine a definitive motive. The community has been left shaken by the violence at what was meant to be a celebration.</p>

          <p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola's defensive tactical shift nearly secured a victory against Arsenal, but a last-minute equalizer from Gabriel Martinelli resulted in a 1-1 draw. After taking an early lead, Guardiola surprisingly substituted striker Erling Haaland and switched to a deep-defending 5-5-0 formation, ceding the majority of possession to Arsenal. This uncharacteristic strategy frustrated the hosts for most of the match but was ultimately undone by a single lapse in the 93rd minute. The result benefits league leaders Liverpool, who now hold a five-point advantage at the top of the Premier League table.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The practice of "speculative buying," where consumers order multiple versions of an item online with the intent to return most of them, is creating significant financial and environmental costs for retailers. This trend, particularly prevalent among wealthier shoppers, contributes to billions in return processing fees, increased carbon emissions from shipping, and packaging waste. In response, many retailers are tightening their return policies by introducing restocking fees, shortening return windows, or favoring store credit over full refunds. This shift may ultimately impact all consumers as businesses seek to offset the mounting expenses associated with high return volumes.</p>

          <p>Super Typhoon Ragasa, located northeast of the Philippines, has intensified to become the most powerful storm on Earth so far this year, achieving Category 5-equivalent status. The typhoon reached maximum sustained winds of 270 km/h, surpassing the previous strongest storms of 2025. Its immense strength is attributed to nearly ideal conditions, including warm sea surface temperatures near 30°C and a lack of wind shear. While it is expected to gradually weaken as it moves towards the South China Sea, its current intensity and well-defined structure mark it as an exceptionally formidable weather system.</p>

          <p>Leading Democrats, including Senator Chuck Schumer, have issued stark warnings that President Trump's recent actions are putting the United States on a path to dictatorship. Their concerns were heightened by Trump's public call for the Justice Department to prosecute his political rivals and the administration's pressure on ABC, which led to the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show. Schumer stated that turning the DOJ into an instrument against political enemies is a hallmark of authoritarian regimes. These events have intensified the debate over the current administration's respect for democratic norms and the independence of federal institutions.</p>

While attempting to slide to a safer area, he lost control, struck a boulder, and was knocked unconscious. Shortly after regaining consciousness, he tragically slipped again and fell down the remainder of the glacier, a fall that proved fatal despite search and rescue efforts.</p>

          <p>Protests have erupted across all 26 states of Brazil against legislative measures that could grant a pardon to former President Jair Bolsonaro and his allies convicted for their roles in a 2023 coup attempt. The demonstrations were sparked by the lower house fast-tracking a bill that could provide amnesty for those involved in the uprising. The movement has drawn support from prominent cultural figures, including music legends Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil. The public outcry reflects deep national divisions and a strong desire among many Brazilians to see those responsible for the attack on democracy held accountable.</p>

Mohammadi, who was arrested in December 2023 for her union activities, has been accused of belonging to an opposition group. Human rights organizations and international trade unions have condemned the verdict, citing serious procedural flaws and arguing the charges are politically motivated. Her case highlights the Iranian regime's use of vaguely worded laws to suppress civil and political dissent, drawing widespread criticism both domestically and internationally.</p>

          <p>Mandy Damari, the mother of a British-Israeli hostage who was held captive for 15 months, has strongly criticized the UK government's decision to formally recognize a Palestinian state. Damari argues that the move effectively "rewards" Hamas for its October 7th attack, especially while hostages remain in Gaza and the conflict is ongoing. Prime Minister Keir Starmer defended the decision as a necessary step to revive the two-state solution and insisted it is not a reward for the terrorist group. The differing viewpoints highlight the deep and painful complexities surrounding diplomatic efforts in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

          <p>According to multiple sources, the Department of Justice under the Trump administration shut down an FBI sting operation that had allegedly recorded "border czar" Tom Homan accepting $50,000 in cash. The investigation, which began during the previous administration, involved undercover agents posing as executives who offered the money in exchange for potential help securing government contracts if Trump won the 2024 election. FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy AG Todd Blanche stated that a full review found no credible evidence of criminal wrongdoing, leading to the case's closure.

          <p>Gary Cohn, who served as National Economic Council director during President Trump's first term, has stated that the U.S. job market is showing clear signs of degradation. Speaking on "Face the Nation," the IBM vice chair pointed to recent data showing a significant slowdown in job creation, from over 100,000 per month to less than 50,000. He attributed this trend to companies cutting labor costs to protect their margins amid rising input costs. Cohn's assessment aligns with the Federal Reserve's recent decision to cut interest rates, which was partly justified by a cooling labor market. (not investment advice)</p>
