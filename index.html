          <p>In an attempt to break the impasse in nuclear negotiations, Iran has proposed a joint nuclear enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments, according to Iranian officials. This proposal was presented to American envoy Steve Witkoff in Oman, aiming to allow Iran to continue producing civilian-grade fuel under increased monitoring. The plan seeks to establish a permanent consortium where Iran enriches uranium to a low grade and ships it to Arab countries for civilian use, with potential oversight from other nations, including the United States. This initiative aims to provide a more lasting solution than the 2015 nuclear deal, addressing concerns about Iran's nuclear program and regional stability. (nytimes.com)</p>

In contrast, Japan ranked first in physical health and 12th in academic and social skills. The report emphasizes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children's academic performance and overall well-being, urging countries to address issues affecting children in the modern world.

          <p>Karen Read's defense team's decision to present text messages between Read and another man has allowed prosecutors to introduce new evidence concerning a prior argument between Read and the victim, John O'Keefe, during a vacation in Aruba. Prosecutors argue this evidence is relevant to demonstrating Read's intent, opportunity, and preparation in the alleged crime, portraying the incident as a possible motive in a "domestic violence homicide". The texts reveal Read's complaints about O'Keefe's behavior with another woman, and her overall dissatisfaction with the relationship, which prosecutors claim Read refused to end. The prosecution plans to call four witnesses to testify about the Aruba incident. (foxnews.com)</p>

          <p>Amid recent military exchanges between India and Pakistan prompted by a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, China's role as Pakistan's primary weapons supplier has come into focus. China accounts for 81% of Pakistan's arms imports from 2020 to 2024, providing crucial defense capabilities against India's arms from Russia and the West. Key Chinese weapons being used by Pakistan's military include the Chengdu J-10C Vigorous Dragon fighter jet, a 4.5-generation aircraft equipped with advanced radar and compatible with modern Chinese munitions. This military support underscores the strategic alliance between China and Pakistan in the region. (scmp.com)</p>

          <p>Pete Buttigieg, former Transportation Secretary under Joe Biden, suggested that Biden's decision to run for a second term in 2024 might have been a mistake. Speaking in Iowa, Buttigieg noted that with hindsight, most people would likely agree with this assessment, following Biden's poor debate performance and subsequent withdrawal from the race. He defended Biden's cognitive abilities during his time in office, citing their collaboration on the Baltimore bridge collapse as an example of Biden's competence. Buttigieg also encouraged Democrats to avoid returning to the status quo and to meet people where they are, hinting at a potential future presidential run in 2028. (cbsnews.com)</p>

          <p>Despite public dismissals, an internal Israeli analysis indicates that Palestinians in Gaza face widespread starvation unless aid deliveries are restored within weeks. Military officials have warned that many areas of Gaza will run out of food, necessitating immediate action to reinstate the aid supply system. The analysis contrasts with Israel's public stance that the blockade did not pose a major threat to civilian life. The UN Security Council has called on Israel to immediately allow aid into Gaza, highlighting the severity of the humanitarian crisis. (nytimes.com)</p>
