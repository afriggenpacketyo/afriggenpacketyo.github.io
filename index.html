          <p>In a jailhouse interview, Robert Baker, who pleaded no contest to murdering Fabio Sementilli, adamantly claims his former lover and the victim's wife, Monica Sementilli, was not involved in the crime. Baker, a former racquetball coach, alleges that Monica had no knowledge of the plot to kill her husband and would have reported him sooner if she had known. Despite facing a life sentence, Baker insists his potential testimony at her trial would be to tell the truth, not as a favor to her. This interview introduces a significant claim that contradicts the prosecution's narrative of a murder-for-hire conspiracy between the two lovers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines the key evidence and timeline prosecutors used to build a murder conspiracy case against Monica Sementilli and her lover, Robert Baker. On the day of the murder, prosecutors allege Monica met with Baker in a Target parking lot to establish an alibi before he and an accomplice attacked and killed her husband, Fabio. Key evidence includes security footage of hooded figures near the home, Monica's high data usage suggesting she was monitoring home surveillance, and Baker's DNA found at the crime scene. The prosecution argues these elements, combined with their ongoing affair, point to a coordinated plot to murder Fabio.</p>

          <p>An Alvarado, Texas, police officer was shot and injured while responding to a call about a suspicious person near the Prairieland Detention Facility, an ICE detention center. The officer was struck in the neck after attempting to make contact with the individual but has since been treated and released from the hospital. Several armed suspects who fled the scene were later apprehended by law enforcement. In response to this and similar incidents, the Trump administration has declared a "zero tolerance" policy for assaults on federal officers and property, promising to prosecute those responsible to the full extent of the law.</p>

          <p>After nearly eight years of legal proceedings, Monica Sementilli was tried and convicted for the murder of her husband, celebrity hairdresser Fabio Sementilli. Prosecutors successfully argued that she conspired with her lover, Robert Baker, to kill Fabio for financial gain, including a life insurance policy. Key trial evidence included testimony from Baker's accomplice, details of Monica's affair, and her suspicious actions on the day of the murder. Despite Baker testifying that Monica was innocent, the jury found her guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy, leading to a sentence of life in prison without parole.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have found that genetics play a significant role in shaping brain criticality, the crucial balance between neural excitation and inhibition that enhances information processing. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, demonstrates that genetic factors influence this balance across various scales, from individual brain regions to large-scale networks. The findings also establish a link between brain criticality and cognitive functions, suggesting a shared genetic foundation. This positions brain criticality as a biological phenotype, opening new avenues for understanding brain function and potential dysfunctions related to mental ability.</p>

          <p>In a television interview, Barry Morphew, previously charged in the 2020 disappearance and presumed death of his wife Suzanne, asserted his innocence and accused authorities of having tunnel vision. Flanked by his two daughters, Morphew claimed he was wrongly targeted and that investigators should look elsewhere. Prosecutors dropped the initial charges against him just before trial due to evidentiary issues, including the discovery of unknown DNA linked to other sexual assault cases. Morphew has since filed a $15 million lawsuit against prosecutors, alleging his constitutional rights were violated during the investigation.</p>

          <p>Just days before his trial was set to begin, a judge dismissed all murder charges against Barry Morphew in connection with the disappearance of his wife, Suzanne. The prosecution filed the motion to dismiss, stating they needed more time to locate Suzanne's body and were hampered by the judge's decision to exclude key expert witnesses. The judge had sanctioned the prosecution for repeatedly failing to turn over potentially exculpatory evidence to the defense. Morphew's attorneys argued the case was manufactured and that he is innocent, while the dismissal without prejudice allows prosecutors to refile charges in the future.</p>

Forensic analysis of her bone marrow revealed the presence of a potent animal tranquilizer compound, to which only Barry Morphew had access in the area. This new evidence suggests she was drugged before her death and that her body was relocated after decomposition, strengthening the prosecution's case against him.</p>

          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, made his first public appearance since the start of a 12-day war with Israel, attending a religious ceremony in Tehran. His absence had fueled speculation that he was in seclusion in a bunker, particularly after President Trump issued warnings via social media during the conflict. The war, which began over fears of Iran's nuclear program, involved Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear sites and retaliatory missile attacks from Iran. The conflict resulted in significant casualties and damage, and Iran has since suspended cooperation with the UN's nuclear watchdog, escalating tensions over its atomic activities.</p>

The case centers on an agent who violently abused women, with MI5 initially attempting to stop a BBC story about him and later lying to courts about its interactions with the journalist. Secretly obtained material revealed that MI5 repeatedly tried to conceal its actions, providing inaccurate summaries of its own investigations.

          <p>Originally a gift from France to commemorate the end of slavery, the Statue of Liberty's meaning was profoundly transformed into a symbol of welcome for immigrants. This shift was largely inspired by Emma Lazarus's poem describing Lady Liberty as a "mother of exiles," a vision that gained prominence with the opening of Ellis Island. The article traces how this new identity was solidified over time, particularly through the end of restrictive immigration quotas and President John F.

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal is nearing the southeastern U.S. coast, prompting the extension of tropical storm warnings as far north as Surf City, North Carolina. The storm, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph, is expected to make landfall early Sunday, bringing heavy rainfall, potential flash flooding, and dangerous rip currents to the coastal Carolinas. Forecasters anticipate rainfall totals of two to four inches, with localized amounts up to six inches, creating a significant flood risk through Monday. The system is also expected to generate life-threatening surf conditions along the East Coast from Florida to the Mid-Atlantic states.</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods have devastated central Texas's Hill Country, resulting in at least 50 fatalities and a large-scale search for over two dozen missing individuals, primarily from a children's summer camp. The Guadalupe River rose dramatically, with some areas receiving months' worth of rain in a short period, overwhelming communities and washing away homes. Officials have launched a massive rescue operation involving hundreds of personnel, helicopters, and drones, while Governor Greg Abbott has signed a federal disaster declaration to provide state resources. The rapid and severe nature of the flooding caught many by surprise.</p>

          <h2>Dodgers' Bullpen Struggles in Loss to Astros Despite Strong Ohtani Start</h2>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered another dominant but short performance on the mound, pitching two scoreless innings and striking out the side in the second against the Houston Astros. However, the Dodgers' bullpen could not maintain the momentum, as long reliever Justin Wrobleski gave up five runs, leading to a 6-4 loss. The defeat clinched a series loss for the Dodgers and highlighted the team's ongoing reliance on tenuous pitching depth. While the team awaits the return of injured starters Tyler Glasnow and Blake Snell, Saturday's game served as a reminder of their current vulnerabilities despite Ohtani's impressive pitching.</p>

          <h2>New Communist Party Rules Suggest China's Xi Jinping May Be Delegating More Power</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's Communist Party has introduced new regulations for its central decision-making bodies, which some analysts interpret as a sign that President Xi Jinping may be delegating more authority to his deputies. The new rules are designed to standardize the policy coordination and review process for top-level organs like party "central commissions" and "leading groups." According to state media, these bodies are now instructed to focus on major strategic planning and oversight rather than day-to-day implementation. This structural shift could indicate a move towards a more distributed leadership model and potentially hint at Xi's long-term succession planning.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Police Department officer assigned to a gang enforcement detail is in serious but stable condition after being shot during a foot pursuit in the Exposition Park area. The incident occurred when two officers attempted to stop and question a suspect, who then fled on foot. During the pursuit, the suspect turned and fired at the officers, striking one before the other officer returned fire. The suspect, who was not hit, was taken into custody, and the injured officer was transported to a hospital with what officials described as a non-life-threatening injury.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers lost their opening game of the California Classic to the Golden State Warriors, 89-84, after surrendering a double-digit lead in the second half. Cole Swider was a standout performer for the Lakers, scoring a game-high 24 points, while DJ Steward added 20 points. However, the team struggled with perimeter defense and first-round pick Dalton Knecht had a difficult shooting night, scoring 10 points on 3-for-13 shooting. Bronny James, who traveled with the team, did not play in the game as the Lakers look to rebound in their next matchup against the Miami Heat.</p>

          <p>Australian police have arrested and charged a 34-year-old man with multiple offenses, including reckless conduct endangering life, for an arson attack on a synagogue in Melbourne. The incident occurred while worshippers were inside for a Shabbat meal, but they were able to evacuate safely without injury. The attacker doused the front doors of the East Melbourne Hebrew Congregation with an accelerant and set them alight. The attack has been condemned by both Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a cowardly act of antisemitism, coming amid a rise in such incidents in Australia.</p>
