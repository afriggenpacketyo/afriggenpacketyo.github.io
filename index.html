          <p>CVS and Walgreens are limiting COVID-19 vaccine availability in certain states, now requiring prescriptions for some age groups or not offering the shots at all. This move follows the FDA's approval of new vaccines for seniors but only for younger individuals with specific health conditions, leading to a patchwork of access rules. The pharmacies' policies are dictated by varying state laws regarding CDC approvals, creating confusion and differing recommendations from bodies like the American Academy of Pediatrics. This situation highlights the complex regulatory landscape as the nation transitions away from emergency health authorizations.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has declared that the majority of former President Trump's global and "reciprocal" tariffs are illegal, stating they overstep presidential authority. The court rejected the argument that the tariffs were permissible under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), affirming that the power to impose tariffs belongs to Congress. The ruling, which affects levies on numerous countries including China, Mexico, and Canada, will be paused to allow the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court. This decision sets the stage for a significant legal battle over executive power in trade policy. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Stanford Medicine study reveals that preschool-aged children diagnosed with ADHD are frequently prescribed medication, such as stimulants, too soon after diagnosis. The research, which analyzed nearly 10,000 health records, found that 42% of children received prescriptions within 30 days, contrary to clinical guidelines that recommend behavioral intervention as the first line of treatment. Experts note that while medication can be helpful, early intervention carries a risk of side effects outweighing benefits for young children. The findings call for further investigation into the appropriateness of early medication practices for this age group.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has ended the "de minimis" tax exemption, which previously allowed imported goods valued under $800 to enter the country duty-free. This change means consumers ordering products from overseas will now face tariffs, potentially leading to higher prices and longer delivery times for items like clothing and electronics. The White House justified the move as a way to close a loophole exploited for illicit goods and to level the playing field for American businesses. Experts predict a significant price increase on many common consumer goods, altering the landscape of international e-commerce. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>America First Legal (AFL) has filed a lawsuit against the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to obtain records concerning the agency's internal guidance on the use of puberty blockers for minors. The legal group alleges that the Biden-era FDA is withholding documents, following a previous records release that suggested the agency knew of increased mental health risks but still recommended the drugs' approval for gender transition. AFL claims the lawsuit is necessary to expose what officials knew about the potential harms of these treatments. The FDA has not yet responded to the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris will now be protected by the California Highway Patrol after President Trump revoked her Secret Service protection, which had been extended by the previous administration. The move, described by critics as politically motivated, prompted California officials to arrange for state-level dignitary protection. This decision comes as Harris is preparing for a book tour and follows a pattern of Trump removing security details from former officials and political opponents. While the Secret Service reported no credible threats, the action has raised concerns about the safety of public figures.</p>

          <p>The Department of Defense is exploring ways to speed up the process for reinstating service members who were discharged for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine. Officials are also considering granting honorable discharges to those whose only infraction was vaccine refusal, which could make them eligible for more benefits. This comes after many of the roughly 8,700 discharged troops described the current reinstatement process, initiated by a Trump executive order, as slow and difficult. The Pentagon aims to address these frustrations and potentially offer incentives like back pay and duty station preferences.</p>

          <p>The White House is standing by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. following significant turmoil at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including the firing of its chief and the resignation of several senior leaders.

The administration, however, praised Kennedy's efforts to reform the agency.

          <p>The U.S. State Department has revoked the visas of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and approximately 80 other officials, preventing them from attending the upcoming UN General Assembly in New York.

The move is highly unusual, as the U.S. is generally expected to facilitate travel for officials visiting the UN headquarters.

          <p>Costa Coffee, reportedly up for sale by owner Coca-Cola, is struggling to appeal to younger consumers who are increasingly drawn to trendier alternatives like matcha and artisanal beverages. Newer chains such as Blank Street Coffee have gained a cult following on social media by offering a wider variety of colorful, non-traditional drinks that cater to Gen Z's health-conscious and novelty-seeking preferences. Analysts suggest that legacy brands are caught in the middle, lacking the value of budget options and the unique experience of specialty cafes.

          <p>The two children killed in the mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis have been identified as eight-year-old Fletcher Merkel and ten-year-old Harper Moyski. Their parents released statements mourning the loss of their children and, in the case of Harper's family, urging leaders to address gun violence and the mental health crisis. The attack occurred during a first-week-of-school mass when a 23-year-old former student, Robin Westman, fired into the church from outside before taking their own life. The shooting also injured 17 others, including 14 children.</p>

          <p>American men's tennis suffered a major blow at the US Open as two of its top players were eliminated in quick succession. Sixth-seed Ben Shelton was forced to retire from his third-round match due to a shoulder injury, marking the first retirement of his career while he was leading two sets to one. Shortly after, 17th-seed Frances Tiafoe, a two-time semifinalist in New York, was defeated in a straight-sets upset by German qualifier Jan-Lennard Struff. These losses leave only Taylor Fritz and Tommy Paul remaining in the men's singles draw, significantly narrowing the chances of ending the 22-year American drought for a men's Grand Slam title.</p>

          <p>Several enterprise technology companies, including MongoDB, Pure Storage, and Snowflake, experienced a massive stock rally this week, suggesting the financial benefits of the AI boom are expanding beyond chipmakers like Nvidia. These companies reported strong quarterly earnings and optimistic forecasts, driven by increased demand for data management, storage, and analytics services that underpin AI applications. MongoDB, a cloud database provider, saw its best week on record with a 44% gain. The results ease Wall Street concerns that AI might displace rather than bolster these established cloud software vendors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 people from Venezuela. The court unanimously upheld a lower court's ruling, stating that the administration likely acted unlawfully and that the Homeland Security Secretary lacks the authority to vacate a prior TPS extension. The judges emphasized that Congress designed the TPS program to be predictable and insulated from shifting political winds. This decision provides temporary relief for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans who were facing the loss of their permission to live and work in the U.S.</p>

The primary purpose of this new company is to accumulate and hold large amounts of Cronos, the cryptocurrency created by Crypto.com. This move is the latest in a series of ventures linking the Trump brand to the cryptocurrency world, aligning with his campaign promise to make the U.S. a "crypto capital." The deal further intertwines Trump's personal business interests with his administration's increasingly deregulatory stance toward the crypto industry. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is facing criticism for pursuing potential mortgage fraud charges against prominent Democrats, including Senator Adam Schiff and New York AG Letitia James. The allegations involve misstating a property as a primary residence on a home loan application, a felony that is rarely prosecuted. Critics, including The Wall Street Journal's editorial board, argue this is a politically motivated "lawfare" campaign, selectively targeting the president's enemies for a common paperwork discrepancy. The situation highlights the potential for the weaponization of obscure federal laws for political revenge, further eroding the rule of law.</p>

          <h2>Analysis of Minneapolis Shooter's Writings Reveals Complex, Non-Ideological Motives</h2>

          <p>While the FBI has labeled the Minneapolis school shooting as motivated by "hate-filled ideology," extremism analysts suggest a more complex picture is emerging from the shooter's online materials. The writings of Robin Westman show a toxic mix of left- and right-wing extremist references, anti-religious sentiments, and an obsession with past mass killers, rather than a coherent political motive. Experts believe the profile aligns with a trend of misanthropic attackers who seek notoriety through violence itself. The shooter's own handgun was inscribed with the words, "There is no message," underscoring a focus on violence over ideology.</p>
