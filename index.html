          <p>A fast-moving wildfire has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge on the park's North Rim, a landmark known for its massive limestone facade and ponderosa beams. The blaze also consumed the visitor center, a gas station, and some employee housing, forcing the closure of the North Rim for the remainder of the season. The fire, sparked by lightning, has resulted in the loss of a treasured piece of national park history, though no injuries have been reported.</p>

          <p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has suspended the nation's police minister, Senzo Mchunu, and launched a judicial inquiry into his conduct. The move follows public allegations from a top police commander that Mchunu has ties to organized crime and has interfered with investigations into political assassinations. The commission will conduct a broad investigation into corruption within the country's justice system, though opposition parties have criticized the response as inadequate.</p>

          <p>Muhammadu Buhari, who served as both a military dictator and a democratically elected president of Nigeria, has died at the age of 82. His complex legacy includes a repressive anti-corruption drive in the 1980s and a historic 2015 election victory that brought hope for change. However, his presidency from 2015 to 2023 was largely marked by disappointment due to widespread insecurity and a severe economic downturn.</p>
