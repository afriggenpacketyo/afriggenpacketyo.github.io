          <p>China and Central Asian countries are strengthening ties, raising questions about Russia's regional dominance as it remains focused on the war in Ukraine. Despite Kremlin assurances, diplomatic observers note Russia's limited ability to counterbalance China's growing influence. Beijing is careful not to directly challenge Russia's role as Central Asia's key security guarantor, but its economic and political influence is undeniably expanding. This shift reflects a changing geopolitical landscape where China is asserting itself as a major player in the region, potentially reshaping the balance of power. The situation underscores the complex dynamics at play as various nations navigate their interests in a turbulent world. Optimism score is not related to this summary.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core consumer prices rose by 3.7% in May, marking the largest increase in over two years, primarily driven by surging food costs, particularly rice. The nationwide consumer price index, excluding fresh food, has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target since April 2022. Rice prices have set a fresh record for the eighth consecutive month, jumping by 101.7% due to supply shortages, while other food items like chocolate and coffee beans also experienced significant price hikes. While energy prices saw a slower increase compared to the previous month, service prices climbed due to higher dining out and travel costs, indicating broader inflationary pressures in the economy.

Meta will also acquire a stake in NFDG, Gross and Friedman's venture capital firm, highlighting the company's commitment to expanding its AI capabilities. This move underscores the intense competition for AI talent among major tech companies like Meta, Google, and OpenAI, all racing to develop powerful large language models and achieve artificial general intelligence.

          <p>Rice prices in Japan have more than doubled in May, marking the largest increase in over half a century, with a spike of 101.7% year-over-year. This surge follows similar increases in previous months and has prompted the government to release emergency stockpiles to moderate prices. The rise in rice prices has contributed to Japan's core inflation rate climbing to 3.7% in May, its highest level since January 2023. While the Bank of Japan held rates steady, it acknowledged that wage increases are being passed on to selling prices, supporting core inflation, with future inflation trends heavily reliant on food prices.

          <p>Several airlines, including United and American, have suspended some flights between the United States and the Middle East due to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran. United Airlines has paused its daily flights between Newark and Dubai, while American Airlines has temporarily suspended flights between Philadelphia and Doha. Delta Air Lines had previously suspended flights between New York and Tel Aviv, with the suspension set to last until late August. These suspensions come as airspace over Israel, Jordan, Iran, and Iraq has been closed, and the U.S. State Department has issued travel advisories for the region, advising Americans against travel to Israel and Iran. The travel disruptions reflect heightened concerns about safety and security in the region.</p>

          <p>President Trump has been briefed on the potential risks and benefits of bombing Iran's Fordo nuclear site, with sources indicating he views disabling the facility as necessary due to the risk of weapons production. While attack plans have been approved, a final decision on whether to strike Iran has not been made, pending potential negotiations with Tehran regarding its nuclear program. The White House has set a two-week deadline for a decision, coinciding with diplomatic efforts involving the UK, Germany, France, and the EU to find a resolution to the conflict. Trump is aware of these diplomatic efforts and has reviewed intelligence reports on Iran's potential speed in producing nuclear weapons.

          <p>China has kept its benchmark lending rates unchanged, following monetary easing measures implemented last month, as a trade deal with the U.S. eases some growth concerns. The People's Bank of China held the 1-year loan prime rate at 3.0% and the 5-year LPR at 3.5%, aligning with expectations. This decision comes after authorities cut lending rates for the first time since October in an effort to cushion the impact of trade tensions with Washington. The recent trade agreement between the U.S. and China has reduced trade war fears, leading to a potential shift in China's approach to fiscal stimulus. (not investment advice)</p>

Proposed budget cuts for the National Park Service could also lead to the closure of over 300 park sites, including the Till monument.

The proceeds will be distributed based on eligible outstanding debts from existing investment projects, prioritizing cities and counties to complete construction, fulfill obligations, and reduce fiscal risk.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from requiring states to cooperate with federal immigration authorities in order to receive transportation funding. The ruling sided with 20 states that argued the administration lacked the authority to tie transportation dollars to immigration enforcement. The judge deemed the policy arbitrary and lacking specificity, emphasizing that Congress did not authorize such conditions on transportation funds. The decision underscores ongoing legal battles between the Trump administration and "sanctuary" jurisdictions over immigration enforcement policies.</p>

          <p>The New Mexico National Guard has deployed unarmed troops to Albuquerque to assist with crime prevention, focusing on securing perimeters and freeing up police officers for other duties. Unlike deployments in other states, these Guard members are not armed or in military uniform, having undergone training in crisis intervention and de-escalation. While city officials hope this will help reduce crime rates, concerns have been raised about the effectiveness of unarmed personnel in dealing with violent situations. The deployment reflects ongoing efforts to address crime in Albuquerque, with some residents expressing support for any measures that improve public safety.</p>

While attacking Iran's nuclear enrichment program would cripple its nuclear weapons capability, it would not eliminate it, as Iran possesses the knowledge, experience, and resources to rebuild.
