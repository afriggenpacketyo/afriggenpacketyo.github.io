        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced on social media that Israel and Iran have agreed to a complete ceasefire, which is scheduled to commence in approximately six hours. The agreement entails two 12-hour ceasefire periods, with Iran initiating the first period, followed by Israel with a second 12-hour ceasefire. Trump congratulated both countries for their stamina, courage, and intelligence in ending what he termed 'THE 12 DAY WAR,' following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear targets two days prior. This announcement signals a potential de-escalation of tensions in the region, although the long-term implications remain to be seen. The situation remains fluid, and further developments are anticipated as the ceasefire takes effect. Optimism surrounding the agreement will depend on its successful implementation and adherence by both sides. </p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has lifted a lower court order, allowing the Trump administration to resume deporting migrants to countries that are not their origin without prior notice or opportunity to raise fears of torture. Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson dissented, with Sotomayor accusing the government of unlawful conduct and undermining due process. The Department of Homeland Security hailed the ruling as a victory for American safety, while immigration lawyers criticized the decision as punitive and dangerous for migrants. This ruling impacts the administration's ability to deport migrants to countries like Costa Rica, Panama, and Rwanda, as part of its broader immigration agenda. </p>

          <p>This article examines the constitutional division of war powers between Congress and the president, highlighting the ongoing debate over the authority to initiate military action. It notes that while Congress has the power to declare war, presidents have often deployed troops without formal declarations, citing examples from the Quasi War to more recent conflicts. The War Powers Resolution of 1973 sought to reassert congressional authority, but presidents have largely bypassed its requirements. Experts argue that the Constitution prohibits the president from using armed force against a country like Iran without an attack or imminent threat to the United States. </p>

          <p>U.S. military strikes in Iran have raised concerns about potential disruptions to the global oil supply and subsequent increases in energy prices. While prices initially surged, they later declined as experts speculated that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical waterway for oil transport. However, ongoing tensions could still disrupt the energy market, particularly if Israel targets Iran's oil production facilities. A closure of the Strait of Hormuz could send prices soaring, potentially reaching $130 per barrel and significantly impacting global GDP. (not investment advice) </p>

This concern is amplified by the ongoing support the U.S. is providing to Ukraine, leading to worries about the resources available to address potential Chinese aggression towards Taiwan. Despite assurances that Taiwan remains a core U.S. interest, the possibility of divided attention remains a significant concern. </p>

          <p>A top U.S. analyst suggests that China is unlikely to deploy its navy to secure the Strait of Hormuz if Iran threatens to close it, despite China's heavy reliance on Middle Eastern oil. Instead, China's approach would likely involve quiet negotiations and prioritizing its self-interests, rather than direct military intervention. This assessment is based on China's past behavior, such as its agreement with Houthi rebels in the Red Sea to spare Chinese-flagged vessels. China's focus remains on protecting its own economic interests rather than policing global waterways. </p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has allowed President Donald Trump's administration to resume deportations of migrants to countries other than their homeland. By a 6-3 majority, the justices reversed a lower court order that required the government to give migrants a meaningful opportunity to explain the risks they might face in being deported to a third country. The three liberal justices dissented, and the decision is seen as another victory for President Trump in his pursuit of mass deportations. This ruling impacts the rights of migrants and the administration's ability to enforce its immigration policies. </p>

          <p>This article warns against taking cold showers during a heat wave, as they may hinder the body's natural cooling mechanisms. While a cold shower may provide immediate relief, it can cause blood vessels to constrict, trapping heat around the organs. This can trigger a cold shock response, leading to changes in breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure, which is especially dangerous for people with heart conditions. Despite potential benefits like improved circulation, experts caution against cold water immersion during extreme heat. </p>
