          <p>Eric Spofford, former CEO of Granite Recovery Centers, was arrested for allegedly orchestrating a conspiracy to stalk journalists from New Hampshire Public Radio (NHPR) in retaliation for an investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against him.

The NHPR article had gained significant attention, leading to Spofford filing a defamation lawsuit, which was later dismissed.

          <p>Germany is experiencing one of its driest springs on record, leading to significant challenges for agriculture, groundwater levels, and retail prices. The Rhine River's low water levels have already increased transport costs, and experts warn that consumer prices will rise. The German Association of Towns and Cities has urged residents to conserve drinking water as soil dryness worsens, particularly in the north and northeast of the country, stressing plants and ecosystems. Experts emphasize the need for steady, continuous rain to replenish groundwater levels, as heavy rainfall tends to run off without penetrating the parched soil. </p>

In response to concerns about people dying, Ernst stated, "Well, we all are going to die," which further agitated the crowd.

          <p>Recent Supreme Court decisions have made legal immigrants more vulnerable to deportation, marking a significant shift for a population that entered the country legally and shared detailed information with the government. The court's rulings have narrowed the scope of protections previously afforded to legal immigrants, potentially leading to increased deportations. This has raised concerns among immigration advocates, who argue that the decisions undermine the rights of individuals who followed legal procedures to reside in the United States. The impact of these rulings is expected to be far-reaching, affecting numerous legal immigrants and their families.</p>

The Royal College of Surgeons criticizes this policy, warning it could cost patients their mobility and cause health deterioration.

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a tractor-trailer carrying pollinator hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. Authorities initially reported a much higher number but corrected the figure after consulting with a beekeeper. The incident prompted warnings for the public to avoid the area and stay at least 600 feet away. More than two dozen beekeepers assisted with the rescue, aiming to re-hive as many bees as possible, and the road was closed for about 24 hours to facilitate the effort.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth warned of China posing an "imminent" threat to Taiwan, urging Asian countries to increase defense spending and collaborate with the U.S. to deter war. Hegseth characterized China as seeking to become a "hegemonic power" and is "credibly preparing to potentially use military force to alter the balance of power" in Asia. In response, China accused the U.S. of being the "biggest troublemaker" for regional peace. Hegseth also stressed the importance of a strong deterrent force with allies and warned against economic ties with China, saying Beijing would use it as "leverage" to deepen its "malign influence."</p>

          <p>A New York Times article examines how inflation is impacting the cost of a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich, a staple in New York City bodegas. At El Vacilon Grocery in Brooklyn, the price recently increased from $4.50 to $5 due to soaring egg costs and other rising expenses. The bodega owners, Freddy and Yovanna Melo, are closely monitoring their costs to maintain a profit margin of 20-30% per item. The Melos emphasize that owning their building is crucial for their business's survival, as revenue has declined while expenses have increased.</p>

          <p>Scientists are criticizing Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s approach to autism research, arguing that his focus on environmental toxins overlooks the significant role of genetics. Kennedy, now the nation's top health official, has declared autism an "epidemic" and launched a federal effort to identify environmental causes, dismissing genetic research as a "dead end." However, experts say the increase in autism rates is largely due to expanding definitions, more awareness, and better screening, with genetic factors being the most important driver. Researchers fear Kennedy's emphasis on toxins could distract from genetic research that has facilitated the development of promising new therapies.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee is grappling with a lead poisoning crisis that has forced school closures and rigorous inspections, with lead detected in at least nine public schools.

With the CDC's lead exposure team laid off, Milwaukee is left to navigate the crisis independently, inspecting schools and providing free blood testing. The city faces a $630 million funding gap to replace all lead water service lines, and local officials express concern about the lack of federal expertise and support.</p>

The WFP said that after nearly 80 days of a total blockade, communities are starving and are no longer willing to watch food pass them by. The agency has chosen aid delivery routes closer to populations and safer, away from gangs, but workers are unable to control who takes what.</p>

          <p>UK steelmakers have condemned President Donald Trump's decision to double import taxes on steel and aluminium to 50%, calling it "another body blow" to the industry. The UK government is engaging with the US on the implications of the latest tariff announcement to provide clarity to the industry. UK Steel director general Gareth Stace said UK steel companies are fearful that orders will now be cancelled. The UK was the first country to secure a trade deal with the US earlier this month, and remains committed to protecting British business and jobs across key sectors, including steel.</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced a mixed week, influenced by President Trump's trade-related announcements, Nvidia's earnings, and inflation data. Trump's accusations against China and subsequent comments about speaking with Xi Jinping kept investors on edge. Nvidia delivered a strong earnings report and upbeat guidance, while Costco reported a "perfect quarter." The Federal Reserve's favorite inflation gauge came in cooler than expected for April, but concerns remain about the potential for tariffs to rekindle inflation. (not investment advice)</p>
