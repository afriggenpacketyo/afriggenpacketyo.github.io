          <p>Dutch semiconductor equipment giant ASML is working to alleviate investor worries about its 2026 growth projections, even as it forecasts a significant decline in sales from China next year. The company expects total net sales in 2026 to at least match 2025 figures, with further details due in January. Despite benefiting from the AI boom, ASML faces challenges from tightening U.S. chip export restrictions and potential tariffs. Analysts remain largely bullish on the firm, citing AI chip foundry expansion and increased manufacturing.</p>

          <p>Royal Mail has been issued a £21 million fine by the communications watchdog Ofcom after significantly missing its first and second-class post delivery targets. The company delivered only 77% of first-class mail and 92.5% of second-class mail on time during the 2024/25 financial year, falling short of its 93% and 98.5% goals, respectively. Ofcom's director of enforcement stated that millions of important letters are arriving late, indicating customers are not receiving the service they paid for. This penalty underscores a failure to meet essential service commitments.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' offense has proven relentless and deep in the postseason, particularly with significant contributions from the bottom half of their batting order. In their 5-1 Game 2 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers in the NLCS, players batting sixth through ninth combined for seven hits, three runs, and three RBIs. This trend has been consistent throughout the playoffs, with these hitters boasting a .302/.391/.448 slash line. The team emphasizes a collective trust, knowing that if the top of the lineup doesn't produce, others will step up.</p>

Concurrently, France's Prime Minister promised to suspend a controversial pension reform until after the 2027 election, a move welcomed by Socialists. Investors are also monitoring the IMF and World Bank annual meetings in Washington, which address global economic concerns.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has rejected Alex Jones' appeal, leaving in place the $1.4 billion defamation judgment against him for falsely claiming the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was a hoax. Jones had argued against being found liable without a trial on the merits, but the justices dismissed his appeal without comment. A lawyer for the Sandy Hook families praised the decision, affirming accountability for the harm caused. Jones, who filed for bankruptcy, continues to appeal a separate $49 million judgment in Texas.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced that adult ChatGPT users will soon gain access to a less censored version of the AI chatbot, which will include erotic materials. This policy shift, expected in December with age-gating, aims to "treat adult users like adults" after mitigating mental health risks. Existing versions were restrictive, making the chatbot less useful for many. The move comes as OpenAI faces increased scrutiny over its safety practices, particularly concerning minors, and recently formed an expert council on well-being and AI.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has seized approximately $15 billion worth of Bitcoin, the largest forfeiture in its history, from a massive "pig butchering" fraud operation based in Cambodia. Chen Zhi, identified as the founder of Prince Holding Group, faces charges of wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy. Prosecutors allege his conglomerate secretly grew into one of Asia's largest transnational criminal organizations, operating scam compounds where victims were trafficked and forced to carry out cryptocurrency investment frauds. The Treasury Department also sanctioned Prince Group and its associates.</p>

          <p>Hamas has returned four more deceased Israeli hostages, bringing the total to eight, as part of a ceasefire agreement with Israel. Israeli authorities identified three of the four bodies returned Tuesday. Israel has expressed frustration over the slow pace of returns, threatening further aid restrictions on Gaza, while Hamas cites difficulties locating remains due to widespread destruction. Palestinians worry that delays in returning the remaining 20 bodies could jeopardize the fragile ceasefire and the next phase of negotiations for a lasting peace.</p>

          <p>The State Department revoked the visas of six non-citizens from various countries for making incendiary social media comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The administration stated it would not host foreigners who "wish death on Americans." This action is part of a broader crackdown, which includes sidelining service members and agents for similar posts. The legal authority of the government to revoke visas based on speech remains an unresolved question, raising concerns about First Amendment protections for non-citizens in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The UK Labour government faces increasing demands from Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties to publish evidence related to the recently collapsed China spy case. Prosecutors unexpectedly dropped charges against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry, citing the government's failure to provide evidence classifying China as a national security threat during the alleged offenses. The Crown Prosecution Service clarified it would not obstruct the release of the evidence, contradicting earlier government suggestions. This situation has sparked accusations of a cover-up and appeasement towards China, intensifying political scrutiny.</p>

          <p>The Manhattan District Attorney's office has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene after a federal appeals court ordered a new trial or release for Pedro Hernandez, convicted of murdering Etan Patz.

Hernandez, who has mental health issues, confessed after hours of questioning before being read his Miranda rights. Prosecutors are seeking 90 days to decide on a potential retrial.</p>

New laws require AI companies to implement guardrails against self-harm and sexually explicit content, and to alert minors that chatbots are not human. Another bill removes a civil legal defense for AI developers, holding them accountable for harm caused by their products. Additionally, penalties for creating nonconsensual "deepfake" pornography are increased, and social media platforms will require warning labels for minors by 2027.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi, president of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, faces a more challenging route to becoming Prime Minister after coalition partner Komeito abruptly withdrew. This exit leaves the LDP with a smaller minority in the Diet, opening opportunities for opposition parties to unite behind a single prime ministerial candidate. While the LDP remains the largest bloc, a united opposition could surpass its seat count. Analysts note the coalition's collapse might free the LDP to pursue long-delayed policy goals, but also question Takaichi's leadership.</p>
