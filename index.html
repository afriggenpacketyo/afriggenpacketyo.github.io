          <p>SpaceX's Super Heavy-Starship launched for its ninth test flight from Boca Chica, Texas, featuring upgrades after previous failures. The Super Heavy first stage successfully separated from the Starship, aiming for a splashdown in the Gulf, while the Starship targeted the Indian Ocean. The mission tested a previously flown Super Heavy stage and aimed for a steeper descent to gather data on stress endurance. The flight included deploying dummy Starlink satellites, reigniting a Raptor engine in space, and stress-testing heat shield tiles, all critical for future missions to the moon and Mars. Optimism surrounds the successful launch and incremental tests, but the ultimate success of the mission will determine future deep space exploration plans.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he is pardoning Scott Jenkins, a former Virginia sheriff convicted of fraud and bribery for accepting cash in exchange for making businessmen law enforcement officers. Jenkins was found guilty on multiple counts related to taking $75,000 in bribes from individuals, including undercover FBI agents, in exchange for badges and auxiliary deputy status. Trump defended Jenkins, claiming he was a victim of the Biden Department of Justice and that evidence was wrongly disallowed. Jenkins, a long-time Trump supporter, is the latest ally to receive a pardon from the former president.</p>

          <p>In Sean "Diddy" Combs' sex trafficking trial, his former assistant, Capricorn Clark, testified about witnessing violence and threats while working for him. Clark recounted being forced to accompany Combs to confront Kid Cudi, witnessing Combs beat Cassie Ventura, and being threatened with harm if she failed a lie detector test regarding stolen jewelry. Kid Cudi testified that Combs broke into his home after learning he was dating Ventura. Clark's testimony was complicated by cross-examination where defense attorneys questioned her desire to reconcile with Combs, while prosecutors sought to highlight Combs' abuse of power.</p>

Chefs like Andrew Zimmern have called the combination a "travesty," while others question how the flavors would even work together. Some chefs, however, jokingly wondered if this could become a new food trend, drawing parallels to other popular burger toppings like applewood smoked bacon. The article also mentions Combs' preference for Heinz ketchup, which he reportedly brings with him when traveling to the UK.</p>

          <p>A new study published in JAMA Internal Medicine reveals a significant decline in the mental health of mothers in the United States between 2016 and 2023. The study, which surveyed nearly 200,000 mothers, found that the prevalence of "excellent" mental health decreased from 38.4% to 25.8%. Declines were noted across socioeconomic subgroups, with single parents and those with lower educational attainment experiencing the lowest health status. The findings align with documented increases in depression and anxiety among pregnant and reproductive-aged women, suggesting maternal mortality may be a broader indicator of women's health.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced the removal of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommendation for children and healthy pregnant women to receive COVID-19 vaccines, a decision that has not yet been reflected in the CDC's official immunization schedule. Kennedy's move bypasses the agency's advisory panel, which was considering narrowing recommendations to older adults and those with underlying conditions. Experts warn that this change could impact access to vaccines for children and pregnant women due to insurance coverage and liability protections. The move also contradicts the FDA's stance on pregnancy as an underlying condition warranting continued vaccine eligibility.</p>

          <h2>Trump Considers Taking Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Public Again</h2>

          <p>President Trump is considering taking mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, potentially ending 17 years of federal control. This move has garnered support from investors like Bill Ackman, who believes it could benefit taxpayers and the firms. Fannie and Freddie guarantee trillions of dollars in mortgages and were bailed out during the 2008 recession. Critics, like Senator Elizabeth Warren, warn that privatization could disrupt the mortgage market and increase housing prices. The White House stated that any actions would be carefully evaluated to restore homeownership.</p>

          <p>Curtis Jackson III, known as 50 Cent, received court approval to seize the Connecticut home of a former employee, Mitchell Green, who embezzled from Jackson's Sire Spirits. Green admitted to a kickback scheme involving wholesalers, resulting in a $7 million debt. After a four-year legal battle, the bankruptcy judge lifted a stay protecting Green's home, allowing Sire Spirits to seize it as partial payment. The home is valued at $1 million, which will be credited against the judgment. Meanwhile, 50 Cent has been mocking Sean "Diddy" Combs amidst his ongoing sex trafficking trial.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that the Colorado River basin has lost 27.8 million acre-feet of groundwater in the past 20 years, nearly equivalent to the full capacity of Lake Mead. The research, based on NASA satellite imagery, highlights the severity of the water crisis in the southwestern United States. Groundwater is disappearing 2.4 times faster than surface water, with most losses occurring in the Lower Colorado River basin. Overpumping, driven by expanding agriculture and industrial farming, is the primary cause, exacerbated by climate change.</p>

Dr. Baha Ghalayini estimates that 100 to 150 women lost their only chance at having children due to the war and its impact on medical facilities. The UN has accused Israel of intentionally attacking the clinic, a claim Israel denies, stating it does not deliberately target fertility clinics.</p>
