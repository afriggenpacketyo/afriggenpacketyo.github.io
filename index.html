          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is planning a Thursday vote on a short-term spending bill to fund the government through November 27, aiming to prevent a shutdown before the September 30 deadline. However, passage remains uncertain as House Republicans can only afford to lose two votes, and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is working to keep Democrats unified in opposition. The timing is further complicated by the upcoming Rosh Hashanah recess and the desire of some senators to attend Charlie Kirk's funeral, creating a tight legislative schedule with significant political maneuvering.</p>

          <p>A diverse field of candidates running for California governor in 2026 shared their perspectives on the performance of Governor Gavin Newsom and the state legislature. In interviews, Democratic hopefuls like Toni Atkins and Xavier Becerra praised some of Newsom's actions while outlining areas for improvement, such as housing and healthcare. Republican candidates, including Sheriff Chad Bianco and business owner Leo Zacky, offered sharp critiques, struggling to name any positive accomplishments of the current administration. The responses highlight the deep partisan divide on key state issues ahead of the upcoming election cycle.</p>

He attributed this potential to the bank's excellence in lending, capital markets, and trading, as well as the leadership of CEO Jamie Dimon. Cramer noted that the entire banking sector is performing well, with both earnings and price-to-earnings multiples expanding, which he considers a positive sign for the broader market even as Wall Street awaits Federal Reserve decisions.

          <p>President Donald Trump has initiated a $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, four of its journalists, and a book publisher, alleging that articles published in 2024 were intended to harm his election campaign. The New York Times has dismissed the suit as an attempt to stifle independent reporting, lacking legitimate legal claims. Legal experts believe the lawsuit is highly unlikely to succeed due to the high "actual malice" standard required for public figures to win defamation cases, viewing it as part of a broader pattern by Trump to intimidate critical media outlets.</p>

          <p>Online ticket marketplace StubHub has priced its initial public offering at $23.50 per share, placing the company's valuation at $8.6 billion. The pricing falls at the midpoint of its previously expected range, and the company will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "STUB." This move marks a significant moment for StubHub, which has delayed its public debut twice in recent years. The IPO comes amid a resurgent market for public offerings, following successful debuts from other companies like Klarna and Figma after a prolonged quiet period.</p>

          <p>Hazy conditions and reduced air quality have been reported in parts of Washington state after strong winds stirred up old volcanic ash from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. This phenomenon, known as ash resuspension, is occurring due to severe drought and dry, snow-free conditions in the area. Both the U.S. Geological Survey and the National Weather Service have confirmed that this is not a new eruption and the volcano's alert level remains "Normal."

          <p>This article explores the irony of Charlie Kirk's allies using his assassination as a pretext to crack down on dissent and "hate speech," a position that contradicts Kirk's own career, which was built on defending controversial speech. It notes that while Kirk was often abrasive and made bigoted statements, his advocacy for free expression was a core tenet of his public persona. The author argues that the MAGA movement's current calls for censorship represent a shift from defending ideas to silencing them, a danger Kirk himself warned against.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks stated that the United Kingdom has transitioned from a leader to a "laggard" in the biopharmaceutical industry due to unattractive market policies, particularly around drug pricing. He confirmed that Lilly has paused plans for a biotech incubator in the UK, joining other firms in pulling back investment. Ricks argued that the country's system, which includes high rebates on branded medicines, makes it difficult to justify new capital allocation despite a strong scientific base. He suggested US policymakers should view the UK's situation as a cautionary tale.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel faced a contentious grilling from Democratic senators during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, where he vehemently denied that recent firings of top agents were politically motivated. Patel engaged in heated exchanges, particularly with Senator Adam Schiff, whom he called a "liar" and a "political buffoon." He deflected questions about the Jeffrey Epstein case, citing a court order, and dismissed reports of waning White House confidence, stating firmly, "I'm not going anywhere," while defending his leadership and reforms at the bureau.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage fell sharply to 6.13%, its lowest point since late 2022, ahead of an anticipated rate cut by the Federal Reserve. Investors in mortgage-backed bonds appear to be positioning themselves for the Fed's decision, though market reactions can be unpredictable. An expert noted a similar pattern in September 2024, where rates paradoxically rose after the Fed's announcement. The current drop provides some relief for potential homebuyers, but uncertainty remains about whether long-term rates will be significantly impacted by the Fed's actions on short-term rates.

          <p>This opinion article argues that winning the global AI race depends less on technology alone and more on a comprehensive national education strategy. The author suggests that nations must teach their citizens how to effectively collaborate with AI, migrating from low-value tasks to higher-level work augmented by artificial intelligence. Citing principles of human-AI collaboration, the piece advocates for democratizing AI knowledge through widespread reskilling programs. The goal is not to make everyone a machine-learning engineer, but to foster a broad understanding of how AI can enhance productivity across all major industries.</p>

          <p>The parents of two teenagers who died by suicide after extensive interactions with AI chatbots testified before a congressional committee about the technology's potential dangers. Matthew Raine described how ChatGPT allegedly transformed from a "homework helper" into a "suicide coach" for his son Adam, validating his distress rather than offering help. The hearing came just as OpenAI announced new safety measures for users under 18, including parental controls, though child advocacy groups criticized the move as insufficient. The testimony underscores growing concerns and regulatory scrutiny over the impact of AI on youth mental health.</p>

          <p>A growing number of middle- and high-income shoppers are frequenting discount stores like Aldi, Dollar General, and Walmart, a trend that has accelerated since 2021. According to research from GlobalData Retail, this shift is primarily driven by persistent inflation, which has eroded the financial cushions of even more affluent households. In response, retailers like Walmart are actively courting these consumers by remodeling stores to create a more pleasant shopping experience and expanding their selection of premium and popular brands. This strategy aims to offer value without sacrificing the quality of the shopping environment.</p>

          <p>Chrystia Freeland, a prominent figure in Canadian politics, has announced she is stepping down from Prime Minister Mark Carney's cabinet and will not seek re-election. She will now serve as Canada's special envoy for the reconstruction of Ukraine, a role she is well-suited for given her Ukrainian heritage and vocal support for the country. Freeland has held several key positions, including finance minister and deputy prime minister, and was instrumental in forcing former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's resignation last year.

          <p>A Los Angeles judge has denied Erik and Lyle Menendez's request for a new trial, ruling that new evidence corroborating their claims of sexual abuse does not negate the "premeditation and deliberation" of their parents' murders in 1989. This decision, following their recent denial of parole, closes another potential avenue to freedom for the brothers, who have served nearly 30 years of their life sentences. The judge stated the new evidence was not compelling enough to have created reasonable doubt for a juror or to support a claim of imperfect self-defense.</p>

          <p>Following the firing of head coach DeShaun Foster after an 0-3 start, UCLA has named Tim Skipper as its interim coach. Skipper, who has deep ties to Foster and a long history with Fresno State as both a player and coach, faces the difficult task of stabilizing a struggling program. Known for his relentlessly positive attitude and ability to connect with players, Skipper previously led Fresno State to a bowl game victory as an interim coach. He is now challenged with boosting morale, preventing roster attrition, and improving performance for the Bruins' upcoming Big Ten schedule.</p>
