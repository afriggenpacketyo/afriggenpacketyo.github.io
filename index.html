          <p>Indonesian State Secretariat Minister Prabowo Subianto attended China's military parade in Beijing, a visit appreciated by the Chinese foreign ministry. Prabowo is expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his one-day trip.

The visit occurs amidst protests in Indonesia, adding a layer of complexity to Prabowo's diplomatic engagement.</p>

The Greater Bay Area encompasses Hong Kong, Macau, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, and other cities in Guangdong province.

Putin praised North Korean soldiers for their "bravery and heroism" in supporting Russia's efforts against Ukraine, while Kim offered his support to the Russian people. South Korea estimates that North Korea has sent 15,000 troops to Russia since last year, along with military equipment. This meeting marks Kim's first visit to Beijing since 2019 as he seeks to strengthen ties with China and Russia.</p>

          <p>A US court ruled that Google is a monopolist in online search but proposed remedies that some view as lenient, leading to scrutiny in Silicon Valley. The judge decided against breaking up Google by spinning off Chrome or imposing court oversight on Android. The emergence of generative AI influenced the ruling, as the judge believes AI companies can pose a threat to Google's dominance. Google must share certain data with qualified competitors and allow them to display Google search results as their own, but can continue paying for distribution. </p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed as investors considered rising global bond yields and trade developments, with Chinese markets in focus following President Xi Jinping's speech. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index and mainland China's CSI 300 both experienced declines, while RatingDog's China General Services purchasing managers' index hit a 15-month high. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 benchmark logged its biggest one-day drop since April 7, despite the country's second-quarter GDP growing faster than expected. Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix indexes also fell, while South Korea's Kospi index saw a slight increase. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that President Trump's deployment of National Guard soldiers to Los Angeles was illegal. The judge accused the Trump administration of turning the National Guard into a "national police force", breaching a law from 1878. Trump deployed the troops against the wishes of the local government, describing LA as "invaded" and "occupied". The ruling is a setback to Trump's ambition to federalize Democrat-run cities and deploy the National Guard in other states.</p>
