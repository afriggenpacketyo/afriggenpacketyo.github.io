          <p>A data breach at a Ministry of Defence sub-contractor, Inflite The Jet Centre, has potentially exposed the personal information of up to 3,700 Afghans resettled in the UK. The compromised data includes names, passport details, and information related to the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (Arap). This incident follows a similar, larger breach in 2022, raising serious concerns among advocacy groups about the safety of Afghans who assisted British forces and their families. The government has stated there is currently no evidence of a public data release or direct threat to individuals' safety.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Air Force has implemented new standardized guidance for separation boards concerning service members who no longer meet military requirements, which includes changes impacting transgender personnel. According to an internal memo, once a board determines a member fits the policy's criteria, it is mandated to recommend separation. Supporters of the new rules argue they prioritize military readiness and create a more consistent disciplinary process, aligning with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's focus on restoring a "warrior ethos." The changes apply across the Air Force and Space Force to ensure uniform application.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent summit in Alaska between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin concluded without a discernible deal to end or pause the war in Ukraine. Despite Trump describing the three-hour meeting as "productive," he offered few specifics and took no questions, leaving allies uncertain about the next steps. Analysts suggest the meeting was a symbolic victory for Putin, who gained a high-profile photo opportunity on American soil without making any public concessions regarding his demands on Ukraine. The lack of a clear outcome has left Kyiv and European capitals guessing about future developments.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration and Washington D.C. have reached an agreement to limit the federal government's control over the city's Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). Following a lawsuit filed by the city, a revised directive was issued that keeps Pamela Smith as the police chief, while the head of the DEA will serve as a federal liaison rather than taking command. This resolution came after a judge expressed skepticism about the legality of the administration's initial order to assume full control. The new arrangement still directs the MPD to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement, a point of ongoing legal contention.</p>

          <p>An internal review by the Arkansas Department of Corrections reveals that convicted murderer Grant Hardin, known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," spent six months meticulously planning his escape. Hardin stated that lax security in the prison kitchen, where he worked, allowed him to gather supplies and create a fake law enforcement uniform to simply walk out of the facility. The report details multiple security failures, leading to the firing of two employees and disciplinary action against others. Hardin survived in the woods on smuggled food and natural sources before being recaptured eleven days later.</p>

This is the first accessory dwelling unit (ADU) in the state that can be legally sold as a separate property from the main home it is built on. This development follows a city law passed last year aimed at creating more affordable homeownership opportunities. Officials hope this new model of for-sale ADUs will serve as a template for other cities, providing a more accessible entry point into the housing market for first-time buyers.</p>

          <p>A recent report finds that dust from the exposed shoreline of the shrinking Salton Sea accounts for less than 1% of the small particle air pollution in California's Coachella and Imperial valleys. For years, dust control projects at the sea have been the primary focus for addressing the region's high rates of asthma and respiratory illness. The study, led by the Pacific Institute, suggests that pollution sources are more varied, including agricultural chemicals, diesel exhaust, and unpaved roads. Researchers now recommend shifting focus from source control to protecting people indoors with air filters and better home weatherization.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom and California Democrats have unveiled a plan to redraw the state's congressional districts, a move that could grant their party up to five additional seats in the U.S. House. The proposal, which would bypass the state's independent redistricting commission, will be presented to voters in a special election. Democrats frame this as a necessary response to similar mid-decade redistricting efforts by Republicans in states like Texas. If approved, the new map would significantly alter California's political landscape and could play a crucial role in determining which party controls the House of Representatives after the 2026 elections.</p>

          <p>An art exhibition in Bangkok focusing on authoritarian repression has been censored following complaints from the Chinese embassy. The show, "Constellation of Complicity," featured works by exiled artists, including pieces related to Tibet, Xinjiang, and Hong Kong, which China claimed promoted independence. After visits from Chinese officials, the Bangkok Arts and Cultural Centre removed sensitive artworks and blacked out artists' names. The Burmese curator, Sai, and his wife have since fled Thailand for the UK to seek asylum, fearing for their safety. Human rights advocates have condemned the incident as an act of transnational repression.</p>

          <p>Slate Automotive, an EV startup backed by Jeff Bezos, is promoting a new electric pickup truck designed to be highly affordable by simplifying its base model and allowing for extensive owner customization. The compact, two-seat Slate Truck is planned to be "open source," enabling third parties to create and sell over 100 different accessories, including a kit to convert it into an SUV. The company's main selling point is its low price, aiming to address consumer concerns about the high cost of electric vehicles. However, the expiration of federal EV tax credits may challenge its price competitiveness.</p>

          <p>Leading House Democrats have introduced a joint resolution to end President Trump's federalization of the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). The lawmakers argue that Trump's move, made under the Home Rule Act, is unlawful as there are no "special conditions of an emergency" to justify it. Representative Jamie Raskin and others contend the president manufactured a crisis and that his actions have undermined public safety in the district. This legislative action follows a separate agreement between the White House and the city to scale back the federal takeover, but seeks to terminate the authority completely.</p>
