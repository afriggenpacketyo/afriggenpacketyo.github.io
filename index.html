          <p>Chinese central government inspectors, known as xunshi, are being deployed to investigate lower-level officials as part of President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign. These inspections, a hallmark of Xi's decade-long anti-graft efforts, have become a source of anxiety for many officials, with numerous individuals, including provincial and state ministry heads, facing disciplinary action as a result. The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) has stationed 16 inspection teams in various regions, including Shanxi province, where former governor Jin Xiangjun is under investigation. The CCDI, which previously relied on tips, now largely generates its own leads for investigations, signaling a more proactive approach to rooting out corruption.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's SpaceX is nearing the establishment of an official city named Starbase in South Texas, following a vote approved by local residents, primarily SpaceX employees. The city, located near the Mexico border, aims to support SpaceX's rocket program, which is under contract with the Department of Defense and NASA for lunar and Martian missions. While SpaceX argues that city status will streamline operations and allow for community growth, critics express concerns over Musk's increased control, including potential authority to close a popular beach and state park for launches. This development coincides with SpaceX seeking federal permission to increase South Texas launches from five to 25 annually.</p>

James Harden's disappointing performance (7 points) further contributed to the Clippers' defeat, while the Nuggets had six players scoring in double figures, led by Aaron Gordon with 22 points.

Kendy had reportedly told friends she was divorcing Dan and had an affair, leading investigators to consider the possibility of a staged crime scene.

Nearly half of the party's youngest cohort of bureau-level officials hold doctoral degrees, with a significant proportion coming from Tsinghua University, often called "China's MIT." This pivot towards competence over ideology reflects a modern adaptation of the traditional Chinese reverence for scholar-officials, and it also offers relative stability amid economic uncertainty. This trend is seen as a strategic move to bolster China's capabilities in its rivalry with the United States.</p>

          <p>Many Chinese tech workers fear the "curse of 35," a term referring to the risk of being laid off once they reach that age due to growing age discrimination in the country's tight job market. Online job listings, including civil service posts, often explicitly state that candidates should be no older than 35. This phenomenon highlights the challenges faced by older workers in China's rapidly evolving tech industry, where younger employees are often favored. The article explores the reasons behind this trend and the sectors most affected by it.</p>

The decision effectively shuts down VoA, as the broadcasters are unlikely to return to work until the case is resolved.
