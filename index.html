          <p>President Trump announced on social media his intention to nominate Dr. Casey Means as the new surgeon general, replacing his initial nominee, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat. Trump praised Means' "MAHA" (Make America Healthy Again) credentials and her collaboration with Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to address the chronic disease epidemic. Dr. Nesheiwat, a former Fox News contributor, will reportedly work with Kennedy in another capacity within the department. The withdrawal of Nesheiwat's nomination followed scrutiny of her credentials and opposition from conservative activists who deemed her ideologically misaligned with the president.</p>

          <p>In a state trial, three former Memphis police officers were found not guilty on all charges, including second-degree murder, in the beating death of Tyre Nichols. This verdict contrasts with a previous federal trial where the officers were convicted of witness tampering. The incident, which occurred during a traffic stop in 2023, led to nationwide protests against police brutality. Two other officers involved pleaded guilty to federal charges, avoiding trial, and the US Justice Department found that the Memphis Police Department regularly used excessive force against black residents.</p>

          <p>Pakistan's defense minister stated that he would welcome further U.S. efforts to help defuse the crisis with India and praised President Trump for calling for a quick end to the conflict. This follows airstrikes conducted by India in Pakistan and Pakistani-controlled Kashmir in response to a terrorist attack. The minister suggested that Pakistan had already responded by shooting down Indian planes and drones and would refrain from further action if India took no additional steps to attack and agreed to an independent investigation.</p>

          <p>In Texas, a county judge, two City Council members, and a former county election administrator were indicted on charges of "vote harvesting" and tampering with evidence. These indictments, brought by Attorney General Ken Paxton, elevate accusations of voter fraud by mostly Latino Democrats to a criminal level. The investigation stemmed from a referral from a Republican district attorney and has raised concerns among Latino voting rights activists, who view the actions as a form of voter suppression.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has kept interest rates unchanged, citing the "uncertainty" caused by President Trump's tariffs as a key factor in its decision. Despite pressure from Trump to lower borrowing costs, the central bank is hesitant to act due to the potential for both increased inflation and slower economic growth. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged the complexity of the situation, stating that it is "not at all clear" what the bank should do next.</p>
