        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reddit has initiated a lawsuit against AI company Perplexity, accusing it of illegally scraping user posts to train its AI models. The complaint, filed in New York federal court, also names data scrapers Oxylabs, AWMProxy, and SerpApi, alleging they masked identities to extract copyrighted content. Perplexity denies the claims, calling Reddit's actions "extortion" and an opposition to an open internet, stating it only summarizes and cites public discussions. This case marks another front in the ongoing battle between content owners and the AI industry over data usage, with Reddit having previous licensing agreements with OpenAI and Google.</p>

          <p>Felipe Mora scored two first-half goals, ending a long dry spell, to lead the Portland Timbers to a 3-1 victory over Real Salt Lake in the Western Conference wild-card game. Kamal Miller added an insurance goal late in the match, sealing Portland's spot in the first-round series against top-seeded San Diego FC. Despite RSL's Justen Glad scoring a header and a disallowed goal, the Timbers' defense and Mora's timely performance secured their win. This triumph marks a significant moment for Portland, advancing them to the next stage of the MLS Playoffs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France is reportedly retracting its commitment to more forcefully intercept small boats crossing the English Channel, a move attributed partly to the nation's political turmoil. Sources indicate that promises of a new "maritime doctrine" to pull boats back to shore are unfulfilled, frustrating UK government efforts. Legal and moral concerns, including the risk of increased deaths and potential prosecution of security forces, are major obstacles. Despite the delays in sea interventions, France continues land-based patrols, with UK funding, as volunteer rescue crews highlight the dangers and challenges of intervention at sea.</p>

          <p>As China's fourth plenum concludes, a state media editorial champions the nation's socialist system as a fundamental source of strength for its economic development and global stability. The article emphasizes the Communist Party's scientific and consistent approach to formulating five-year plans as a core political advantage. It contrasts China's unified national strategy with the short-term policymaking and reversals seen in multi-party systems, asserting the party's ability to steer China's economic ship steadily. This narrative aims to reinforce confidence in the party's governance and its long-term strategic vision.</p>

          <p>The US President announced "tremendous" new sanctions against Russia's largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, to pressure Moscow into ending the war in Ukraine. These sanctions, mirroring recent UK measures, target firms responsible for nearly half of Russia's crude oil exports, aiming to impact its "war machine." Experts suggest the sanctions' near-term military impact is limited, but could force Russia to balance socio-economic stability with war financing. The move could also lead to secondary sanctions on major Russian oil customers like China and India, potentially causing global oil price volatility.</p>

          <p>A 21-year-old semi-truck driver, Jashanpreet Singh, was arrested for driving under the influence after a deadly eight-vehicle collision on the 10 Freeway in Ontario, California, which killed three and injured four. Department of Homeland Security officials confirmed Singh, an Indian national, entered the U.S. illegally in 2022. The incident highlights concerns regarding commercial driver's licenses issued to undocumented immigrants, a practice that led Florida to sue California and Washington last week.

Many observers believe President Trump holds the key to ending the stalemate, but he has yet to directly engage in negotiations.

While the Home Office supports Phillips, the controversy has led to the withdrawal of two potential inquiry chairs.

          <p>A former official policy adviser has urged China to break free from Western "discourse traps" on issues like state subsidies, democracy, and the global order. Speaking at Fudan University, he emphasized the need for China to confidently defend its Communist Party rule while challenging perceived "double standards" about its rise. He warned that simply reacting to Western provocations risks alienating Global South countries and failing to convince Western societies. This advice highlights China's ongoing efforts to shape its international narrative and assert its perspective on global governance and economic models.</p>

          <p>President Trump's plan to construct a $300 million ballroom, necessitating the demolition of parts of the White House East Wing, has sparked strong criticism from historians, preservationists, and politicians. The 90,000-square-foot venue, privately funded by Trump and "generous Patriots," will significantly alter the 224-year-old residence. Critics, including the National Trust for Historic Preservation, argue the massive addition will "overwhelm the White House itself" and demand a public review process. The administration dismisses the outcry as "manufactured outrage" by "unhinged leftists," while concerns persist over the project's opaqueness and its timing amidst national economic struggles.</p>

          <p>California's special election for Proposition 50, a Democratic-led effort to redraw congressional districts, is experiencing higher-than-expected early voter turnout. Over 3.4 million mail ballots have been returned, comparable to presidential election levels, with Democrats outpacing Republicans and non-affiliated voters. Governor Gavin Newsom and former President Obama, who endorsed the proposition, highlight its national significance for democracy against partisan manipulation. Republicans, however, express concerns about potential suppression of GOP early votes due to past criticism of mail balloting and inaccuracies in voter guides, anticipating a surge in in-person voting to defeat the measure.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is preparing to expand its nationwide immigration crackdown to the San Francisco area, deploying Border Patrol agents who may stage at a U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda.

          <p>Food insecurity is a growing concern in rural America, exemplified by long lines at a mobile food bank in Clinton, Missouri, where demand has doubled. Rising inflation and over $1 billion in federal food aid cuts have led to fewer donations, impacting organizations like Harvesters, which feeds nearly 375,000 people daily. The situation is expected to worsen with the ongoing government shutdown potentially withholding SNAP payments. The Trump administration's cancellation of the annual USDA report on food insecurity further hinders efforts by removing vital data, leaving food banks "operating in the dark" amidst increasing need.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania are making strides in preventing breast cancer recurrence by targeting dormant "sleeper cells" that can later spread cancer. A clinical trial co-led by Dr. Angela DeMichele identified and treated these lurking cells in patients like Illeana Casiano-Vazquez, who had an aggressive form of the disease. The study, published in Nature Medicine, showed promising results, with only two out of 51 women experiencing recurrence after seven years, significantly below the expected rate. The next steps involve larger trials and exploring applicability to other cancers, offering new hope for survivors.</p>

          <p>Lebanon is facing the world's fastest increase in cancer incidence and mortality, with new cases up 162% and deaths up 80% since 1990.

Lung, pancreatic, liver, prostate, colon, and breast cancers are all rising. Lawmakers have invited researcher Ali Mokdad to discuss findings and potential interventions like improved health screening and public smoking bans, but implementing change is expected to be a slow journey.</p>
