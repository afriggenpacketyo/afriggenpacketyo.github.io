        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Treasury and IRS have released proposed regulations for President Trump's "no tax on tips" initiative, clarifying key details for workers and employers. The new rule allows for a deduction of up to $25,000 in tips annually but excludes workers in certain professional fields like healthcare and legal services. Additionally, the guidance specifies that mandatory or automatic gratuities do not qualify for the tax break, as the tips must be given voluntarily by the customer. Officials acknowledged the complexity of the new tax provision and indicated that further guidance will be provided once the regulation is finalized. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to impose a new $100,000 fee on applications for H-1B visas, a program essential for U.S. companies hiring highly skilled foreign workers. This policy change, which could be enacted by presidential proclamation, would directly impact major technology firms like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google that rely on the program to fill specialized roles. The move is framed as part of a broader effort to overhaul immigration and labor policies, though it has raised concerns about attracting top global talent to the United States. The proposal is currently pending final confirmation and the president's signature.</p>

          <p>The Panama Canal Authority is introducing significant changes to its booking system and planning a new pipeline to attract energy trade back to the crucial waterway. After severe droughts caused a major decline in liquified natural gas (LNG) tanker transits, officials aim to reinstate a preferred booking system for LNG carriers next year. The authority is also developing the Interoceanic Energy Corridor, a 76-kilometer pipeline for natural gas liquids, to free up canal slots and offer an alternative transit method. These strategic moves are designed to enhance flexibility and reliability for energy shippers, particularly from the U.S. and Asia.</p>

This fundraising effort reflects the soaring investor interest in foundational AI models, following similar large-scale investments in competitors like Anthropic and OpenAI. However, Musk has publicly denied the report, labeling it as "fake news" on his social media platform X.

          <p>A vaccine advisory panel appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has voted to weaken previous COVID-19 vaccine recommendations. The committee now suggests that individuals aged 6 months and older receive the vaccine based on "shared clinical decision-making" with a healthcare provider, rather than a universal mandate. This shift comes after Kennedy installed several critics of mRNA vaccines on the panel, raising concerns among public health experts that this could create barriers to access and lower vaccination rates. The CDC must still adopt these new recommendations before they become official U.S. policy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has failed to advance competing Republican and Democratic proposals to fund the government, significantly raising the risk of a shutdown as the October 1 deadline approaches. Both the House-passed short-term funding bill and a Democratic counter-offer were blocked in procedural votes, leaving Congress at a standstill. Party leaders have remained entrenched in their positions, with each side blaming the other for the impasse.

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, ruling that the legal complaint failed to meet procedural requirements. U.S. District Judge Steven Merryday stated the filing violated a rule requiring a "short and plain statement" and was instead a platform to "rage against an adversary." The judge has given Trump's legal team 28 days to submit an amended, compliant version of the lawsuit. The New York Times welcomed the swift ruling, characterizing the original complaint as a political document rather than a serious legal action intended to stifle independent reporting.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Ted Cruz has sharply criticized Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr for his statements regarding Jimmy Kimmel, comparing Carr's warning to ABC to a threat from a mob boss.

This positions Cruz in opposition to President Trump, who praised the FCC chairman's actions.

          <p>American consumers are facing higher grocery bills, with food prices experiencing their fastest monthly increase since 2022. According to food industry experts, three primary factors are driving this inflation: the Trump administration's tariffs, the effects of climate change on agriculture, and a shortage of farm workers. Tariffs have increased the cost of imported goods like coffee, while climate change has shifted crop production to other regions. Concurrently, new immigration policies have contributed to a labor deficit, compelling companies to pass on increased costs to shoppers through higher prices and "shrinkflation."

A senior White House official confirmed the plan, which would coincide with the 250th anniversary of the U.S. The visit is intended to reinforce the "unbreakable bond" between the two nations, a sentiment echoed by both leaders during Trump's trip. The last official state visit by a reigning British monarch to the U.S. was in 2007 by the late Queen Elizabeth II.</p>

          <p>Prominent late-night television hosts, including Stephen Colbert, Seth Meyers, and Jon Stewart, have united in support of Jimmy Kimmel after ABC suspended his show. The suspension followed pressure from the Trump administration and the FCC over Kimmel's comments about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Colbert described the network's action as "blatant censorship," while Meyers and Stewart used satirical sketches to criticize the perceived crackdown on free speech. The collective response from the hosts has amplified the debate surrounding media freedom and political pressure in the current administration.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly set to fire Erik Siebert, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, for not pursuing criminal mortgage fraud charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James. According to sources, federal investigators found no clear evidence of wrongdoing by James, but Trump administration officials still pushed for an indictment. Siebert's expected dismissal is seen by critics as a significant escalation in a politically motivated retribution campaign against the president's rivals. The move has caused alarm within the Justice Department over the potential for political interference in one of the nation's most prominent prosecutor's offices.</p>

          <p>A CNBC investigation has found that Walmart's rapid expansion of its third-party online marketplace has been accompanied by a surge in counterfeit products and fraudulent sellers. In its effort to compete with Amazon, Walmart reportedly relaxed its seller vetting processes, making it easier for bad actors to join the platform and sell fake goods, including potentially dangerous health supplements and beauty products. The report details how some fraudulent sellers used the identities of legitimate businesses to create accounts. In response to the findings, Walmart has recently tightened its policies for sellers in certain categories, stating that trust and safety are non-negotiable.</p>

          <p>A Vox analysis argues that recent events, particularly the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show following threats from the FCC, reveal a clear pathway toward authoritarianism in the United States. The article details how the weaponization of regulatory agencies, the targeting of political enemies, and the consolidation of media ownership under allied figures could systematically undermine democratic institutions. It draws parallels to the political strategies used in Hungary under Viktor Orbán, creating a "Frankenstate" where the opposition is legally able to compete but practically unable to win. The author calls for collective defiance to prevent this consolidation of power.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut of the year has led to a notable decrease in mortgage rates, providing financial relief for homebuyers. With the average 30-year fixed rate dropping to around 6.13%, the monthly principal and interest payment on a $750,000 mortgage is now approximately $4,560. This represents a savings of over $450 per month compared to the rates seen at the beginning of 2025, which were above 7%. The lower rates enhance affordability for new buyers and create attractive refinancing opportunities for existing homeowners looking to reduce their long-term interest costs.

Kashkari's dovish stance is influenced by a weakening labor market and contained inflation expectations, despite core inflation currently running above the Fed's 2% target.
