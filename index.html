          <p>Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent convened to address currency matters intertwined with ongoing bilateral tariff negotiations, reaching a consensus that the current dollar-yen exchange rate accurately reflects underlying economic conditions. This acknowledgement implies that the yen's recent depreciation against the dollar should not be a focal point in tariff discussions, diverging from President Trump's earlier assertions that yen weakness unfairly advantages Japanese exporters. The ministers also reaffirmed their shared conviction that exchange rates should be determined by market forces, refraining from discussing specific exchange rate targets. Japan continues to strongly oppose additional tariffs imposed by the U.S., while considering options to concede to lower tariff rates to expedite a deal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New figures are expected to show a fall in net migration to the UK, but immigration continues to be a divisive political issue. Politicians have long struggled to assuage public concerns over immigration, rooted in events like the 1968 Race Relations Act and Enoch Powell's inflammatory rhetoric. While attitudes towards immigration have softened since the Brexit vote, concerns remain about the impact on public services and competition for jobs. The current Labour government, elected on a manifesto promising to reduce migration, has implemented stricter visa rules and aims to address exploitation in the care sector, facing the challenge of balancing economic needs with public sentiment.</p>

          <p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that the Trump Gold Card, a $5 million visa program, will soon be available online, with a website expected to launch in weeks.

Lutnick emphasized that applicants will undergo thorough vetting and that this initiative could generate substantial revenue for America, potentially helping to reduce the national debt. Critics, however, have raised concerns about potential fraud and national security risks associated with the program.

          <p>The Trump administration announced its withdrawal from the federal oversight plan for the Minneapolis Police Department, coinciding with the fifth anniversary of George Floyd's death. This decision has sparked dismay among officials and residents who viewed the oversight as crucial for addressing the department's history of violent, racist, and unconstitutional practices. The Justice Department defended the withdrawal by stating that such agreements are often ineffective, costly, and prolonged. Despite the federal pullback, Minneapolis officials affirm their commitment to implementing the reforms outlined in the agreement, with Mayor Jacob Frey denouncing the timing of the announcement as insensitive and politically motivated.</p>

          <p>President Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson are working to rally Republican support for a massive budget package that contains Trump's second-term agenda, facing resistance from both conservative fiscal hawks and moderate blue-state Republicans. The Rules Committee met overnight to address demands for deeper spending cuts and changes to the state and local tax deduction (SALT). A manager's amendment included provisions to accelerate Medicaid work requirements and phase out some clean energy subsidies. The bill's passage remains uncertain, with Democrats expected to oppose it and Republicans divided over spending cuts and tax policies, as leaders strive to meet a self-imposed Memorial Day deadline.</p>

Ford alleges that the attorneys took advantage of a statute designed to protect consumers from faulty products, creating an opportunity to pad their bottom line.

Republicans argue that the Congressional Review Act allows them to overturn these waivers, while Democrats contend that such a vote is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. The outcome of the vote could significantly impact efforts to reduce emissions and promote electric vehicle adoption across the country.</p>

          <h2>Some Afrikaners Dispute Claims of White Genocide in South Africa</h2>

          <p>As the Trump administration offers refugee status to Afrikaners claiming persecution in South Africa, some members of the Afrikaner community dispute the existence of a "white genocide." While violent attacks on farmers occur, racial motives are not generally a factor, and most Afrikaners feel safe. Critics suggest the claims are fueled by right-wing groups and that the South African government's stance against Israel and relations with China may influence Trump's decision. Despite land expropriation measures, no cases of expropriation without compensation have been documented since apartheid ended.</p>

          <p>Food banks in Florida are experiencing reduced aid due to recent federal funding cuts, impacting their ability to provide food to those in need. The White House's Department of Government Efficiency cut funding for USDA programs, affecting the ability of schools and food banks to purchase food directly from local farmers. This has led to empty shelves and longer lines at food distribution sites, with the CEO of Feeding South Florida reporting a 40% reduction in their annual budget. The situation also affects farmers who rely on these programs to process surplus produce for families in need.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has condemned the Trump administration for violating a court order by deporting migrants to countries not their own with insufficient notice. The judge, Brian E. Murphy, stated that the administration's actions were "unquestionably violative" of the court's order and raised the possibility of criminal contempt penalties. The deportees were reportedly told they were being sent to South Sudan, a violence-plagued country, but were later found to have landed in Djibouti. Judge Murphy has ordered the administration to provide the men with legal representation and interviews to ensure their safety.</p>
