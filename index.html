          <p>Irish center Garry Ringrose has been forced to withdraw from the British and Irish Lions' second Test match against Australia due to a concussion sustained in training. This marks the second time a head injury has sidelined him on this tour. His withdrawal led to a midfield reshuffle, with Huw Jones and Bundee Aki starting together for the first time since a tour game. Coach Andy Farrell praised Ringrose's honesty and selfless decision to prioritize his health and the team's needs ahead of the crucial match in Melbourne.</p>

          <p>Tensions between Thailand and Cambodia have escalated into an armed clash along their disputed border near ancient temples. Both nations accuse the other of initiating the conflict, which reportedly involved rocket fire and resulted in civilian injuries on the Thai side. The incident follows a recent landmine blast that injured Thai soldiers, leading to a diplomatic downgrade with ambassadors being expelled. Thailand deployed an F-16 fighter jet in response to the fighting, highlighting the serious and volatile nature of the long-standing territorial disagreement between the two countries.</p>

          <h2>Court Documents Reveal Late Jesuit Leader Pedro Arrupe Was Aware of Child Molester Priest</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 02:00:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Court documents from a New Orleans lawsuit show that the late Jesuit leader Pedro Arrupe, a candidate for Catholic sainthood, was warned in the 1970s that an aspiring priest had been accused of sexually molesting minors. Despite these warnings, the man, Donald J. Dickerson, was eventually ordained and later faced more accusations of abuse. The revelations have emerged from a lawsuit accusing Dickerson of sexually assaulting a student at a Jesuit university. This case raises serious questions about Arrupe's judgment and the Jesuit order's handling of abuse allegations during his leadership.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued executive orders aimed at preventing the use of "woke AI" within the federal government and promoting the U.S. as an "AI export powerhouse." The orders state that government-procured AI models must be neutral and avoid ideological agendas, specifically targeting concepts related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). The White House argues that such ideologies compromise truthfulness and can lead to manipulated outputs, referencing past controversies with image generation models. The plan emphasizes procuring "truth-seeking" AI while also aiming to reduce regulations that could hinder private sector AI development.</p>

The threat of increased tariffs, set to take effect August 1 if no deal is reached, is causing uncertainty for many European exporters.

          <p>A Venezuelan man, Arturo Suarez, has described enduring constant physical and psychological abuse after the Trump administration sent him and over 250 other Venezuelans to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador. Suarez, who had no criminal record, was accused of being a gang member and detained for four months in the CECOT prison, which he called "hell." He was recently released as part of a prisoner swap with the U.S. but is scarred by the ordeal. The case highlights a controversial U.S. immigration policy where individuals were deported to a third country and imprisoned without due process.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to offer unaccompanied migrant teenagers aged 14 and older the option to voluntarily return to their home countries. This policy upends a long-standing practice under a 2008 anti-trafficking law, which required these minors from non-contiguous countries to be transferred to government shelters overseen by HHS. Previously, this voluntary departure option was limited to children from Mexico and Canada. The administration cites new authorities in a recent spending law for the change, which critics see as a way to expedite deportations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's Environment Agency (EA) has cancelled thousands of scheduled water tests for river pollution over the last three months due to significant staff shortages at its main laboratory. Internal documents reveal that seven national testing programs, including those tracking chemical pollutants and drought plans, have been completely paused. The cancelled tests are for inorganic substances like nitrates and phosphates, which are key indicators of sewage or agricultural pollution. Campaigners and former employees warn that this reduction in monitoring makes it harder to identify pollution trends and hold polluters accountable, undermining efforts to protect the nation's waterways.</p>

          <p>European and Chinese leaders met in Beijing to mark 50 years of diplomatic relations, with talks highlighting both shared interests and significant friction. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated the relationship is at an "inflection point," pointing to a historic €306 billion trade deficit and calling for a rebalancing. Chinese President Xi Jinping urged the EU to make "correct strategic choices" and work together for global stability. The summit addressed major disagreements over market access, industrial subsidies, and geopolitics, reflecting the complex and often strained nature of the crucial partnership.</p>

          <p>A rare and vibrant purple sea snail, Janthina janthina, has been discovered on a La Jolla beach, a species not typically seen in the area. An oceanography student from Scripps Institution of Oceanography found the creature, which floats on the open ocean using a self-secreted bubble raft. These snails are usually found in warmer subtropical and tropical waters, and their appearance often coincides with warmer offshore currents. While a direct link to climate change is not certain, researchers suggest that continued warm water events could lead to more frequent sightings of such species outside their normal habitats.</p>

The company, a key supplier to Nvidia, saw its operating profit jump nearly 69% year-on-year to 9.21 trillion won. Its dominance in the HBM market has allowed it to challenge rival Samsung for leadership in the broader memory space. SK Hynix expects strong demand to continue and plans to double its HBM sales for the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new UK law under the Online Safety Act now requires websites with pornographic content to implement robust age verification systems to prevent access by children. Media regulator Ofcom has outlined several acceptable methods, including credit card checks and photo ID matching. Major sites like Pornhub have confirmed they will comply, but concerns remain about the effectiveness of these measures, particularly with the use of VPNs to circumvent them.

          <p>The White House has pushed back against reports that President Trump's name appears in Department of Justice documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, calling the claims "fake news." This response comes as a senior DOJ official is scheduled to meet with the convicted sex-trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell in prison, who has been subpoenaed by the House Oversight Committee. Being named in the documents is not evidence of wrongdoing, and an unnamed White House official did not deny Trump's name appears, pointing to previously disclosed files.

Democrats and former intelligence officials have condemned the move, arguing it misrepresents the findings and recklessly risks exposing sensitive sources and methods.

          <p>Emerging from industrial Birmingham, Black Sabbath reacted against the "hippy-dippy" music of the late 1960s to create a new, heavier sound that would define a genre. The band, fronted by Ozzy Osbourne, combined slow tempos, high volume, and dark lyrical themes inspired by horror films. Guitarist Tony Iommi's unique playing style, developed after an industrial accident damaged his fingertips, was central to their sound, creating detuned, powerful riffs that became the foundation of heavy metal. Their early albums like "Paranoid" and "Master of Reality" established a blueprint for countless rock bands that followed.</p>

This contrasts with his time at the Boston Red Sox, where he was adamant about being the DH and publicly rebutted suggestions he play a position. The change of heart comes after a tense spring with his former team, and he contributed two hits in his successful defensive debut with his new club.</p>

The plan, approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, aims to protect the threatened northern spotted owl, which is being outcompeted by the more aggressive barred owl. The resolution's sponsors argue the culling plan is inhumane, unworkable, and a waste of taxpayer money. However, some conservationists and scientists warn that blocking the plan will likely lead to the extinction of the spotted owl.</p>
