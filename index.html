          <p>A Soviet spacecraft, Kosmos-482, launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, is expected to re-enter Earthâ€™s atmosphere. Due to a rocket malfunction, the spacecraft has been adrift in space for 53 years and is now predicted to return to Earth. While the exact location of re-entry is unknown, experts calculate it will occur between 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south latitude. The spacecraft was designed with a heat shield, increasing the likelihood that parts of it will survive re-entry and impact, legally belonging to Russia if recovered.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's trade policies are characterized by frequent reversals and a lack of clear direction, causing uncertainty for businesses worldwide. The article highlights instances where Trump's administration shifted positions on tariffs, including those on strollers and movies, as well as on the importance of trade deals themselves. This erratic approach has made it difficult for businesses to plan and adapt, with even Federal Reserve officials expressing concern about the unpredictability of the administration's economic policies. Despite initial promises to overhaul trade agreements, Trump's stance appears to change on a daily basis, creating confusion and instability in the global market.</p>

Google's policy is to follow local official names, but it uses 'Gulf of America' for U.S. users.

          <p>Changes to the 'de minimis' rule, which allowed low-value packages to enter the U.S. without tariffs, are causing upheaval for consumers and businesses.

Consumers are bracing for higher prices, while e-commerce brands warn of potential failures for smaller firms. The shift is already impacting shopping habits, with some consumers rushing to make purchases before the changes take full effect. This article explores the broader implications of these policy changes on trade and consumer spending.</p>

          <p>Xi Jinping has been implementing a strategy to make the world reliant on China's exports and know-how, positioning the country as a dominant force in global supply chains. This approach, aimed at countering foreign pressure and securing China's economic interests, involves increasing exports, weaponizing supply chains, and promoting technological self-reliance. While this strategy has strengthened China's position, it has also strained relationships with trading partners and created internal economic challenges.

However, uncertainties remain regarding the impact on products processed in the European Union and the overall stability of trade relations.
