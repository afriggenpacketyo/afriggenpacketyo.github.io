          <p>Former Conservative cabinet minister Penny Mordaunt has spoken out about being a victim of AI-generated deepfake pornography, calling the experience deliberately humiliating and violent. She highlights the real-world consequences and dangers of such content, particularly for children, and calls for stronger government action on age verification for online platforms. Mordaunt advocates for banning social media for under-16s, similar to Australia's policy, and urges courage in confronting tech leaders like Elon Musk to implement better safety measures. The article notes other female politicians have also been targeted.</p>

          <h2>Fossil Evidence Suggests 13-Million-Year-Old 'Terror Bird' Was Killed by a Giant Caiman</h2>

          <p>Scientists analyzing a 13-million-year-old fossil have found evidence that a formidable "terror bird" was likely killed by an even larger predator. Bite marks on the bird's leg bone, discovered in Colombia, were matched to an extinct, five-meter-long caiman species called Purussaurus neivensis. This rare finding provides insight into the ancient ecosystem, revealing that even apex predators like the 2.5-meter-tall terror bird were vulnerable to attack from other powerful creatures in their swampy, riverine habitat.</p>

          <p>In a rare move, federal judges in New Jersey voted to sideline interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, a former personal lawyer for President Trump, and install her deputy in the role. However, hours later, the Trump administration's Justice Department ousted the newly appointed replacement, career prosecutor Desiree Leigh Grace, escalating the conflict. The confrontation highlights the political tensions surrounding Habba's appointment, which has been opposed by the state's Democratic senators and marked by controversial charges against local politicians.</p>

          <p>The case of the four murdered University of Idaho students has reached a legal conclusion with Bryan Kohberger's guilty plea, but the abrupt end leaves the community and victims' families with lingering questions. The article recounts the crime that shook the small college town, the intense, month-long investigation that followed, and the public's fascination with the case. While the plea deal avoids a painful trial and ensures Kohberger will be imprisoned for life, the absence of a stated motive means the reason behind the horrific act remains a mystery.</p>

          <p>A group representing the Detroit Three automakers—General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis—has raised concerns about the new trade agreement with Japan. They argue that the deal is unfair because it imposes a lower 15% tariff on Japanese imports, which have minimal U.S. content, compared to the 25% tariff on vehicles built in North America with high U.S. content. The automakers noted that existing tariffs have already negatively impacted their earnings and production levels, creating a competitive disadvantage. (not investment advice)</p>

This development adds pressure on the Dodgers to acquire relief pitching ahead of the trade deadline, as their bullpen has been significantly depleted by numerous injuries throughout the season, undermining their championship aspirations.</p>

          <p>The announcement that CBS is canceling "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert," the top-rated late-night program, has fueled speculation that the decision is a capitulation to political pressure from the Trump administration.
