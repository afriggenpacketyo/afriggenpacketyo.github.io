          <p>An excerpt from Ron Chernow's new biography, "Mark Twain," delves into the author's 1882 return to the Mississippi River, a journey undertaken to gather material for his book "Life on the Mississippi." Traveling incognito, Samuel Clemens sought to reconnect with his past as a steamboat pilot, a profession he cherished for its freedom. The trip revealed a changed landscape and brought a mix of nostalgia and disappointment, highlighting the paradox of his life: the more famous he became, the more he longed for the simpler world of his youth.</p>

          <p>China has introduced new regulations for the Communist Party's central commissions and leading groups, which could indicate a shift in President Xi Jinping's leadership style. The rules are designed to standardize the policy coordination process at the highest levels of government. According to state media, these bodies will focus on major strategic planning and oversight, leading some analysts to speculate that Xi may be delegating more power to his deputies, possibly as part of a long-term succession plan.</p>

          <p>Barry Morphew has been arrested for a second time and charged with the murder of his wife, Suzanne, whose remains were discovered in 2023. The new indictment reveals that a combination of tranquilizer drugs, which Barry had admitted to using on deer, was found in her bone marrow. After initial charges were dropped in 2022, the discovery of her body and this new toxicological evidence led prosecutors to refile the case, with Morphew now held on a $3 million bond.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent deadly floods in Texas Hill Country highlight the region's geographical vulnerability, earning it the name "Flash Flood Alley." According to a hydrology expert, the area's steep hills and soil that poorly absorbs water cause rapid runoff, allowing creeks and rivers to surge dangerously fast. This effect is amplified by the Balcones Escarpment, which can trigger intense downpours, making the region the most lethal in the U.S. for flash flooding.</p>

          <h2>Cuts to U.S. HIV Research Funding Threaten Progress on Ending Epidemic</h2>

          <p>Public health experts are raising alarms over recent cuts to HIV research funding in the U.S., warning it could reverse progress made toward eliminating the virus. While the Trump administration's initial goal to end the epidemic by 2030 saw success, recent budget cuts have reportedly canceled crucial research into an HIV vaccine and cure. Experts worry that a narrowed focus on treatment, without robust funding for prevention research and access, will lead to a rise in new infections.</p>

          <p>Representative Mark Green, a Tennessee Republican, has officially resigned from Congress, further shrinking the GOP's already slim majority in the House of Representatives. Green, who chaired the Homeland Security Committee, stated he is leaving to start a private sector business aimed at helping the U.S. compete against China. His departure leaves the Republican majority at 219-212, potentially creating more challenges for Speaker Mike Johnson in passing legislation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is continuing its efforts to limit the use of Chinese-made drones in the U.S., but faces significant hurdles due to China's dominance in the global market. An executive order targeting the industry is the latest move in this ongoing struggle, but analysts and industry insiders note that few non-Chinese alternatives exist. This makes it difficult and costly for commercial users to remove Chinese technology from their supply chains, despite national security concerns raised by Washington.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Social Security Administration is facing backlash for sending an email that critics call "blatant misinformation" regarding President Trump's new spending bill. The agency claimed the bill eliminates federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for most recipients. However, the legislation only provides a temporary, income-limited tax deduction, not a full elimination of the tax, leading former officials and Democratic lawmakers to condemn the communication as a partisan and misleading political statement.

          <p>A new study indicates that exposure to high heat and wildfire smoke during pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester or even before conception, is linked to negative birth outcomes. Researchers found these environmental stressors were associated with babies being smaller in the womb and at birth, with the effects being more pronounced in climate-vulnerable neighborhoods. Doctors are urging more attention to these risks, advising pregnant people to take precautions like staying cool and wearing masks during smoke events.</p>
