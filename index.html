          <p>Major US stock indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq experienced a volatile week, closing with minor losses despite reaching record highs earlier. Investor focus was on mixed economic signals, including jobs and inflation data, which influenced speculation about future Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. Key corporate news included Nvidia's massive $100 billion investment in OpenAI to develop AI data centers and strong initial sales reports for Apple's new iPhone models. This market activity highlights the ongoing tension between positive corporate developments and broader macroeconomic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of U.S. troops to Portland, Oregon, authorizing the use of "full force" to address ongoing protests and protect federal facilities, such as the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) building. The announcement, made on Truth Social, framed the action as a response to "Antifa, and other domestic terrorists." This move escalates the administration's crackdown on civil unrest and has been met with resistance from local Democratic officials, including Portland's mayor, who stated that federal intervention was not requested or needed.</p>

          <p>Jefferies' David Zervos has warned that rapid growth in artificial intelligence could create a significant labor market problem, posing a dilemma for the Federal Reserve. He suggests a scenario where the economy experiences strong growth, driven by AI, while unemployment simultaneously rises due to job displacement. Zervos argues that this could force the Fed to navigate a difficult situation, balancing its mandates of price stability and full employment. He cites predictions from tech industry leaders who anticipate the loss of three to five million jobs in the coming years due to AI advancements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to multiple reports, the FBI has dismissed approximately 20 agents who were photographed kneeling during the George Floyd protests in Washington, D.C., in 2020. The act of kneeling was a common symbol of solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. The FBI Agents Association has condemned the firings as "unlawful," arguing the agents were making a de-escalation decision in a volatile situation. Critics suggest the dismissals are part of a broader cultural overhaul within the bureau under Director Kash Patel, appointed during Donald Trump's second term.</p>

          <p>Sources indicate that one of the counts in the indictment against former FBI Director James Comey pertains to his alleged role in sharing information about an investigation related to Hillary Clinton. The indictment accuses Comey of making false statements to Congress when he denied authorizing an FBI employee to act as an anonymous source for news reports. The individual allegedly authorized to share the information is identified as Daniel Richman, a close friend who served as an unpaid "Special Government Employee" at the FBI.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has strongly criticized the rival Reform UK party, stating their policies would "tear this country apart." Speaking ahead of the Labour party conference in Liverpool, Starmer highlighted Reform's proposal to abolish indefinite leave to remain for legal migrants as particularly "shocking." He positioned the Labour conference as an opportunity to present an alternative vision of "patriotic national renewal" against what he described as Reform's divisive agenda. The comments come as Labour faces pressure from opinion polls showing a close race with Reform UK.</p>

          <p>A 12-year-old boy in Flagler County, Florida, was arrested for allegedly threatening to stab another boy during an argument in a group chat. The suspect reportedly sent a photo of a box containing 15 knives and brass knuckles along with the profanity-laced threat. After being contacted by the victim's parents, deputies interviewed the suspect, who admitted to sending the message out of anger, and located the weapons in his room. Sheriff Rick Staly emphasized the seriousness of such threats, urging parents to monitor their children's online activities and teach them about the severe legal consequences.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the significant cultural power of teen novels, using Judy Blume's "Forever," which turns 50, as a prime example. It highlights how such books served as a rite of passage, offering young readers, particularly girls, a rare perspective on sexuality and desire from a female vantage point. These novels provide a space for teenagers to see their own anxieties and curiosities reflected, validating feelings that are often difficult to express. The piece explores how the art and literature discovered during adolescence can have a singular, lasting impact on personal development and understanding of the world.</p>

          <p>This article provides advice for interracial couples on navigating the unique challenges and conversations that can arise from their different racial and cultural backgrounds. Experts suggest four key discussions: openly addressing differences, co-creating a new shared family culture, compromising on cultural or spiritual practices, and planning how to support each other against external biases. The guidance emphasizes that being curious, open, and intentional can help couples build a stronger relationship. Rather than ignoring differences, couples are encouraged to blend their backgrounds to create a unique family identity that respects both partners.</p>

          <p>Georg Stefan Troller, a renowned journalist, writer, and documentarian, has died at the age of 103. An Austrian Jew who fled the Nazis, he later returned to Europe as a U.S. soldier and was present at the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp. He became famous for his unconventional and sensitive television interviews with international celebrities like Marlon Brando and Woody Allen for his German TV show "Personenbeschreibung." Troller viewed his journalistic work as a form of "self-healing" after losing 19 relatives in the Holocaust, leaving behind a legacy of insightful and deeply human storytelling.</p>

          <p>A spokesperson for Prince Harry has suggested that certain sources are intentionally trying to sabotage his reconciliation with his father, King Charles. The statement came in response to a media report that characterized a recent meeting between the two as more formal than familial, which the spokesperson called "categorically false" and "pure invention." The meeting at Clarence House was their first face-to-face encounter in several months and was seen as a potential step toward healing the family rift. The prince's statement indicates his frustration with the media narrative surrounding his relationship with the Royal Family.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece critiques President Trump's recent comments advising pregnant women to "tough it out" and avoid taking Tylenol, which he baselessly linked to autism. The author argues this is wildly irresponsible guidance that ignores the potential dangers of an untreated fever during pregnancy and dismisses the real pain women experience. The column frames the "Tylenol scare" as another example of mom-shaming and the historical tendency to blame mothers for their children's health outcomes. The author concludes that this rhetoric is not about women's health but is another attempt to control women's bodies and choices.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of State Security has issued a warning about foreign attempts to illegally acquire the country's scarce strategic resources, posing a threat to national security. The ministry revealed it had recently busted two smuggling rings attempting to export high-purity antimony, a rare metal crucial for various industrial and military applications. One case involved a family-run network where a ringleader based overseas financed the operation and used shell companies to place orders. This highlights Beijing's increasing focus on protecting its control over key minerals amid a global resource race.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the growing trend of dating apps, including a new venture from Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd, incorporating artificial intelligence to act as a "matchmaker." The goal is to move beyond superficial swiping by using AI to pair users based on deeper values and goals. However, the author questions whether this is truly groundbreaking, pointing to past experiments by sites like OkCupid which found that algorithms struggled to predict real-world chemistry. The piece argues that romantic compatibility is still largely unpredictable, and while AI might refine suggestions, it cannot solve the fundamental mystery of human connection.</p>

          <p>Despite leading the Labour Party back to power, Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing significant internal criticism and questions about his leadership ahead of the party's annual conference. Senior figures within the party have privately expressed concerns about his judgment, slow decision-making, and communication style, contributing to a period of poor polling against rival Reform UK. While some allies defend his steady leadership and performance on the world stage, there is a widespread feeling that the government lacks a clear vision.

          <p>China is significantly expanding its soft power across Africa, primarily through its government-run Confucius Institutes, which promote Chinese language and culture. With institutes now in 49 African countries, China is investing heavily to build sociocultural ties alongside its economic and infrastructure projects. While these programs offer opportunities for African students, critics raise concerns about the potential for political indoctrination and the intertwining of cultural expansion with China's strategic interests, including access to the continent's natural resources.

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on the 1977 legal battle over a neo-Nazi group's right to march in Skokie, Illinois, a suburb with many Holocaust survivors. The author recounts the pain the case caused survivors, while also presenting the ACLU's argument that protecting even offensive and hateful speech is essential for the First Amendment to have meaning. The ACLU lawyer on the case, who was Jewish himself, argued that if speech can be denied because it is offensive, officials gain the power to silence any speech they dislike. The article draws a parallel to current debates, concluding that free speech must apply even when we disagree with the content.</p>
