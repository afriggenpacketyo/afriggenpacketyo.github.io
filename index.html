            <p>New tariffs imposed by Donald Trump on goods from China, including clothes, may lead to price increases for fast fashion retailers like Shein and Temu. The tariffs, ending a duty-free exemption for low-priced goods, could push consumers towards alternatives like secondhand clothing. While some experts believe Americans' love for cheap goods will persist, others see an opportunity for resale markets to become more competitive. The situation remains dynamic, with potential for further policy shifts and market reactions. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The UK government has taken control of the Chinese-owned British Steel plant in Scunthorpe to prevent the shutdown of its blast furnaces. Emergency legislation was passed to ensure continued steel production, but the Business Secretary declined to guarantee sufficient raw material supplies. The situation is described as "difficult and challenging," with the government working to secure the necessary coal to keep the furnaces operational, because shutting them down would mean the end of primary steel production in the UK.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump is increasingly emphasizing his personal faith and framing his presidency as fulfilling a divine mission, especially after surviving an assassination attempt last year. He believes he was saved by God to "make America great again" and feels a stronger connection to his faith. Trump often refers to his Presbyterian upbringing and warns of America's spiritual decline, advocating for religious liberty as a cornerstone of his leadership. He also links America's founding ideals directly to faith, asserting that rights are bestowed by the Creator.</p>

            <p>More than 100 civilians, including at least 20 children and a medical team, have been killed in attacks on famine-hit camps in Sudan's Darfur region.

The camps house over 700,000 displaced people, many facing famine-like conditions. The war between the army and the RSF has created the world's largest humanitarian crisis.</p>

            <p>Sarah Palin's defamation case against The New York Times is set for a retrial after a judge's misstep in the initial suit. The case stems from a 2017 Times editorial that Palin's attorneys argue accused her of inciting murder in a 2011 shooting. A previous jury found against Palin, but an appellate court ordered a retrial due to jurors learning of the judge's initial ruling dismissing the case. The retrial's outcome remains uncertain, particularly given a New York state law passed after the initial suit that strengthens press freedoms.</p>

Lee also connects the film's themes to Donald Trump's administration and the transactional nature of contemporary politics, and how his own stand-up show is becoming increasingly relevant as world events unfold.</p>

            <p>Rex Heuermann was indicted in the death of a fourth alleged victim, Maureen Brainard-Barnes. Investigators said they linked Brainard-Barnes' murder to Heuermann via DNA from a female hair found in the buckle of a belt used to bind her ankles, feet and legs - eight trillion to one that it matched Heuermann's wife Asa Ellerup or daughter Victoria, who was tailed on a commuter train and threw out an energy drink, according to court documents. Prosecutors made it clear they believed all hair transfer were made from Heuermann to his alleged victims. The family was out of town for the murders of the Gilgo Beach Four. Heuermann has pleaded not guilty to the murders.</p>

            <p>Rex Heuermann, the suspected Gilgo Beach serial killer, was charged with killing two more women 10 years apart on Long Island — the 1993 murder of Sandra Costilla and the 2003 murder of Jessica Taylor. Costilla's death was not previously tied to the Gilgo case. The Suffolk County district attorney's office says DNA from hair found near Costilla and Taylor's remains and pick-up truck evidence connect Heuermann to their killings. Heuermann has pleaded not guilty to all charges.</p>

            <p>Katherine Ann Reniers, a federal worker at USAID, faces a significant reduction in her pension benefits due to a layoff ordered by the White House's DOGE office, five months before she would have reached 20 years of service. This abrupt change will reduce her monthly pension by an estimated $3,000, leaving her struggling to cover her mortgage and medical bills. Reniers is now advocating for other affected employees and seeking new employment to bridge the financial gap until she can access her reduced pension and Social Security benefits.

The modified moss repels water and efficiently soaks up oil, offering a cost-effective, environmentally friendly alternative to conventional methods. The bio-based absorbent outperforms other materials in oil absorption capacity, presenting a potential breakthrough for cleaning up oil spills and mitigating their environmental impact.</p>

Some consumers are stocking up on essentials, while others are delaying purchases or opting for cheaper alternatives, adding to the economic turmoil. (not investment advice)</p>

The Trump administration's use of AI to monitor federal employee emails for anti-Trump sentiment exemplifies this trend. However, Gen Z workers are rejecting this grueling work culture, prioritizing work-life balance and seeking companies that offer secure contracts and ample benefits, suggesting a potential clash between corporate practices and employee expectations.</p>

            <p>High heels are making a comeback in fashion, but their meaning has shifted beyond mere aesthetics, authority, and swagger. While some embrace heels as a symbol of retrogressive femininity, others, particularly those on the left, are wearing them as a form of protest, a "battle gear" to combat the anxieties and disconnects in the current world. The return of heels reflects a desire to "flip" fear and confront the challenges of the world head-on.</p>
