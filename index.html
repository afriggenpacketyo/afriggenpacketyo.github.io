          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10% year-over-year increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by heightened demand in anticipation of potential negative impacts from increased U.S. tariffs on imported cars. The company's global production also saw a rise of 7.8%, hitting an all-time high for April. While Toyota plans to absorb the tariff costs without passing them on to consumers, analysts anticipate pressure to do so if the tariffs remain long-term. The company expects a 34.9% drop in net profit for the business year through March due to these tariffs and a stronger yen. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal court has struck down most of the tariffs imposed by President Trump, deeming them illegal and exceeding the president's legal authority. The ruling halts the 10% tariffs assessed on numerous U.S. trading partners and a separate set of tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada. The court rejected the administration's justification based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), stating that the tariffs were designed to address trade imbalances, which do not constitute an emergency.

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has reaffirmed China's commitment to bolstering advanced manufacturing, a strategy that could intensify trade tensions with the U.S. While the U.S. seeks to boost domestic production of high-tech products, China's push for self-reliance in manufacturing, particularly in sectors like electric vehicles and semiconductors, may conflict with the Trump administration's demands for addressing trade imbalances and state subsidies. Experts anticipate that the U.S. will maintain high tariff rates on Chinese goods as China is unlikely to scale back its manufacturing-led strategy. China's "Made in China 2025" plan aims to transform the country into a leading high-end manufacturer, despite having missed several key targets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the Trump administration will "aggressively revoke" visas of Chinese students, including those with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or who are studying in "critical fields." The State Department is revising visa criteria to "enhance scrutiny" of future applications from China, including Hong Kong. This move has caused anxiety across university campuses in the United States, as universities benefit from talented students from China. It is unclear how U.S. officials will determine which students have ties to the Communist Party, but the roughly 275,000 Chinese students in the United States, as well as professors and university administrators are worried.</p>

It explores the motivations and radicalization processes that lead young Americans to serve in a foreign army involved in what the author describes as the occupation of Palestinian territories. The article also discusses the social and political factors that contribute to this phenomenon, including the influence of Zionist summer camps and the broader affinity for Israel within the American establishment. The piece contrasts this with the scrutiny faced by Muslims in the West and calls for greater attention to the radicalization of young Zionists.</p>

          <p>A federal court has blocked President Trump's sweeping tariffs, ruling them unlawful and undermining a key component of his economic agenda. The court stated that the president exceeded his authority by imposing tariffs without congressional approval, citing that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant such broad power. The ruling has been criticized by the White House, which argues that it is not for unelected judges to decide how to address a national emergency.
