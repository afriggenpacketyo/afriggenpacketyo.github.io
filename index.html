          <p>A 30-year-old woman, Hanna S., is currently on trial in Munich, facing a requested nine-year sentence for her alleged involvement in attacking a group of neo-Nazis in Budapest in February 2023. Prosecutors contend she is a member of a "militant left-wing extremist ideology" group, accusing her of engaging in "violence tourism" against individuals participating in a "Day of Honor" event. This high-profile case has sparked discussions on political violence and the challenges of combating extremist ideologies, while also bringing historical scrutiny to German authorities' past failures in addressing far-right terrorism, such as the National Socialist Underground. The verdict is anticipated later this month, underscoring the legal and social complexities surrounding such incidents.</p>

          <p>David Liao Yi-chien, HSBC's co-CEO, reported that multinational companies are increasingly directing investments towards China's new-economy sectors, including high-end manufacturing, healthcare, and pharmaceuticals. This strategic reorientation reflects global companies positioning China as a key market for driving innovation, consumption, and growth, with continued optimism for consumption-related industries. An HSBC survey indicated that China is the top target market for companies looking to enhance global trade capabilities, with around 40% planning to increase manufacturing there over the next two years. The nation's vast market size, comprehensive industrial facilities, dynamic innovation ecosystem, and abundant talent are cited as primary attractions for international capital.

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba's resignation, announced after a trade deal with the United States that reduced tariffs on Japanese car imports, has initiated a period of political transition in Japan. While China's foreign ministry has refrained from commenting, calling it an internal matter, analysts anticipate that Tokyo will continue to view Beijing as a strategic competitor. The new leader will face the significant challenge of navigating the complex and often contentious relationship between Japan and China, a key dynamic in regional stability. This leadership change highlights the delicate balance of economic interests and geopolitical rivalries in East Asia.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article critiques the populist right's strategy in both the US and UK, exemplified by actions from the Trump administration and Reform UK, to erase or rewrite historical narratives. The aim is to dismantle democratic advancements and erode rights for vulnerable communities by reframing national stories, such as portraying Britain as a besieged island rather than a former empire. These efforts, disguised as cultural debates, provide ideological justification for legislative changes impacting daily lives and aim to roll back the democratic expansion of the 20th century. Resisting this project requires building cross-communal solidarities to protect shared stakes against racialized narratives and economic dispossession.</p>

          <p>India urged its BRICS partners to address significant trade imbalances, particularly with China and Russia, during a virtual summit where the bloc collectively rallied against US tariffs. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar highlighted India's largest trade deficits being with BRICS members, advocating for expeditious solutions to these imbalances. This call for internal trade review within BRICS contrasts with the more direct condemnation of US policies by other members like Brazil and China, who warned against "Hegemonism" and "protectionism." The article also notes that despite bilateral trade strains with the US, India's relationship with China shows signs of warming, reflecting complex geopolitical and economic alignments.

          <p>European stock markets are anticipated to open steady or with a slight dip, reflecting the heightened political uncertainty in France after Prime Minister Francois Bayrou's government lost a confidence vote. This outcome, driven by a failure to secure support for 2026 budget plans, will require President Emmanuel Macron to appoint his fifth prime minister in under two years. Investors are closely monitoring this instability, alongside key US inflation reports, including the producer price index and consumer price index, due this week. Weaker-than-expected US hiring data, however, has recently spurred investor optimism for potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, presenting a mixed economic outlook.

Demonstrators, largely from Gen Z, carried signs demanding an end to corruption and "our country back."

President Putin is reportedly focused on managing this demobilization, promising veterans prestigious careers and leadership positions to prevent societal destabilization.

          <p>Rockim Prowell, a 44-year-old Inglewood man, has been charged with two counts of murder, one count of attempted murder, and multiple counts of carjacking and burglary. Prosecutors allege he used online dating websites to lure men, whom he then subjected to brutal robberies and assaults. One victim, Miguel Angel King, was allegedly shot and had his car stolen in 2021, while another 40-year-old man this year was reportedly beaten with a baseball bat and run over, sustaining a broken leg. These charges outline a deeply disturbing pattern of predatory violence, with forensic evidence reportedly linking Prowell to these horrific crimes, raising significant public safety concerns.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has expressed "real worry" that the UK might be forced into an International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout, drawing parallels to the 1976 sterling crisis. She called on the government to implement an economic growth plan and offered to collaborate with Sir Keir Starmer on welfare spending cuts, warning of a "doom loop" of rising taxes and precarious public finances. Badenoch cited rising UK borrowing costs, which recently hit a 27-year high, and warnings from some economists as indicators of a potential crisis, though others dismiss such fears as hyperbole. Labour, however, criticized her advice, attributing the current economic challenges to Conservative policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The murder of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a Charlotte Metro train last month has escalated to federal attention, with FBI Director Kash Patel and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy indicating a national investigation. Duffy announced the Department of Transportation would investigate Charlotte's transit system for failing to protect Zarutska, threatening to pull federal funding from cities that do not curb violence on public transportation. President Trump also issued a "zero tolerance" message, condemning cashless bail and demanding accountability for criminals, framing the incident as a national test of public safety. This federal involvement signals a broader push for increased federal oversight and intervention in local crime issues.</p>

          <p>This article critiques President Trump's "Chipocalypse Now" meme, an AI-generated image threatening Chicago with immigration enforcement and mass deportations, as a serious declaration of "war" on an American city. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Senator Dick Durbin condemned the post, highlighting its non-joking nature and authoritarian implications. Trump defended his rhetoric, stating it aims to "clean up our cities" from crime, but critics argue his targets are politically motivated, focusing on Democratic-led cities rather than those with the highest crime rates. The Department of Homeland Security subsequently announced "Operation Midway Blitz" in Chicago, further escalating concerns about federal overreach and the weaponization of immigration policy.</p>

          <p>Boeing aircraft orders have become a recurring and prominent feature in President Trump's bilateral trade deals, serving both symbolic and pragmatic purposes. These high-profile, high-value purchases allow partner countries to visibly demonstrate their commitment to reducing bilateral trade surpluses with the US, without causing political friction by impacting domestic industries. Unlike sensitive commodities, aircraft imports are less contentious, and their extended delivery windows offer financial flexibility to airlines. Beyond their symbolic weight, these planes are genuinely needed due to the global tourism upswing and the effective duopoly between Boeing and Airbus. Despite recent safety concerns, Boeing's perceived improvements in quality further solidify its significant role in these agreements. (not investment advice)</p>

While President Trump has denied impropriety and writing the note, Mandelson has previously expressed regret over ever meeting Epstein.

The new arrangement establishes trusts benefiting Lachlan and his younger half-sisters, Grace and Chloe Murdoch, while Prudence MacLeod, Elisabeth Murdoch, and James Murdoch will divest their holdings in exchange for cash.

This policy shift offers greater flexibility and fewer barriers for international talent, directly addressing concerns faced by individuals like Pakistani PhD student Rahdar Hussain Afridi, who previously faced uncertainty about remaining in China after graduation. While observers widely interpret this as a strategic move to bolster the nation's hi-tech sectors, they also caution that the plan's ultimate success will hinge on effective and comprehensive policy support.

          <p>Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, a former top National Institutes of Health (NIH) leader, has filed a whistleblower complaint alleging her removal stemmed from clashes with the Trump administration over vaccine research.

She described being silenced and witnessing the placement of "politically motivated leaders" in key meetings, warning of a "substantial and specific danger to public health and safety." Marrazzo, who succeeded Dr. Anthony Fauci, explicitly called Kennedy "dangerous" for his alleged disregard of scientific evidence.</p>

          <p>A Supreme Court majority decision in Noem vs. Vasquez Perdomo has sparked widespread alarm, as it implicitly permits immigration raids in Los Angeles that target individuals based on their appearance, Spanish language, and perceived low-wage work. Justice Sonia Sotomayor's powerful dissent warned against living in a country where the government can seize people for such reasons, emphasizing the severe erosion of constitutional freedoms. This ruling, issued through the emergency docket without full argument, bypasses standard deliberative processes and normalizes suspicion as policy. Critics argue that this decision fundamentally undermines the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, setting a dangerous precedent for equal protection under the law for all Americans.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on a Chinese film that portrays the Nanking massacre of 1937, and the broader perception of Chinese war suffering within Western media. It highlights a perceived disparity in how such historical pain is often received or interpreted in the West, contrasting with Chinese sentiment that links national strength to a better life. The film itself is commended for its restrained storytelling, focusing on civilians who risk their lives to smuggle out evidence of atrocities, rather than dwelling on explicit brutality. The powerful emotional impact of the film on its audience underscores the profound importance of remembering and acknowledging this significant, yet often under-recognized, historical event.</p>

There was no immediate comment from Israel, although its defense minister previously affirmed that Israeli forces operate in all combat zones for national security. These alleged attacks are part of dozens of Israeli operations across Syria since the fall of ex-President Bashar al-Assad in December, which Israel has justified as necessary to prevent weapons from reaching extremist groups. Reports indicated targets near Homs, Palmyra, and the coastal city of Latakia, with no immediate word on casualties.</p>
