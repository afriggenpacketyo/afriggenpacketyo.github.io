          <p>Police in Georgia clashed with anti-government protesters attempting to storm the presidential palace in Tbilisi, using water cannons and pepper spray to disperse the crowd. The protests, which saw tens of thousands waving Georgian and EU flags, erupted amidst a political crisis following disputed parliamentary elections and the government's pause on EU accession talks. Demonstrators demanded the release of political prisoners and snap elections, with many accusing the ruling Georgian Dream party of acting in Russia's interests.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift's new song, 'Elizabeth Taylor,' from her album 'The Life of a Showgirl,' explores themes of fame and heartbreak by drawing parallels to the iconic Hollywood legend. The article highlights clever references within the lyrics, such as nods to Portofino, Taylor's violet eyes, and Cartier jewels, which Swift uses to question whether glamour can replace trust. The song, described by Swift as exploring 'the anxiety provoked by fickle fame,' also contains hints about her relationship with NFL star Travis Kelce.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, halting the Trump administration's initiative to detain immigrant children in adult facilities after they turn 18, which would have violated a 2021 court order. The ruling prevents the transfer of unaccompanied minors, who are typically released to 'the least restrictive setting available' if not a danger or flight risk. This decision follows concerns about the administration's broader immigration policies, including accusations of reviving family separations and offering self-deportation stipends.</p>

Her victory comes after two previous attempts, and she now faces the challenge of regaining voter trust amidst party scandals and responding to a rising far-right.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker strongly condemned the Trump administration's intent to federalize 300 Illinois National Guard members, calling the ultimatum 'outrageous and un-American.' The White House confirmed the move, citing ongoing 'violent riots and lawlessness' that local leaders allegedly failed to quell, particularly near an ICE facility in Broadview. Pritzker asserted there was no need for federal troops and accused Trump of using the situation for control rather than public safety.</p>

          <p>Turkey faces increasing pressure from the U.S. and G7 nations to reduce its reliance on Russian oil and gas, which accounts for over half of its imports. Despite President Trump's demands, Turkey is unlikely to halt purchases due to price advantages and energy security concerns, as confirmed by the Kremlin. Instead, Ankara is pursuing a diversification strategy, signing long-term LNG contracts with U.S. and Australian firms while also promoting domestic and renewable energy sources, balancing geopolitical pressures with its energy needs.</p>
