          <h2>UK Travelers Face Significant Bank Holiday Disruptions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Millions across the UK are expected to encounter substantial travel disruption this bank holiday weekend, stemming from a combination of planned rail strikes by the RMT union, extensive engineering works, and anticipated heavy road traffic. CrossCountry services will be severely affected, with no direct trains on Saturday and limited operations on Monday, while LNER also faces cancellations on the East Coast Main Line. The RAC warns of particularly heavy traffic on the M5, highlighting the widespread impact. Passengers are strongly advised by Network Rail to verify their journey details before traveling, as these factors converge to create a challenging period for holidaymakers. Despite the travel woes, the weather forecast promises largely dry and warm conditions, especially in central and southern England, with temperatures reaching up to 25C.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's third-largest steelworks, Speciality Steels UK (SSUK), has been placed under government control following a compulsory winding-up order granted by insolvency courts, creating an uncertain future for nearly 1,500 workers in Rotherham and Sheffield. Creditors, owed hundreds of millions, sought the order against the Liberty Steel unit of controversial tycoon Sanjeev Gupta's empire, which has faced financial instability. The government has agreed to cover ongoing wages and costs while a buyer is sought, emphasizing its commitment to a sustainable future for UK steelmaking, which is considered strategically vital for national defense. This intervention aims to prevent the business from falling into "free fall" and ensure an orderly process for potential new ownership.</p>

          <p>European stocks are expected to open lower as investors assess the full implications of the recently detailed EU-U.S. trade deal. While pharmaceutical tariffs were capped at 15%, alleviating some concerns, automotive stocks reacted negatively to the "conditional" nature of their lower duties, which depend on Brussels reducing its own industrial tariffs. The agreement involves the EU spending $750 billion on U.S. energy and investing $600 billion in the U.S. Futures for major European indices, including the DAX and CAC 40, were down, reflecting market apprehension. Investors are also monitoring upcoming economic data, including French business confidence and German GDP figures.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, is moving northeast away from the central U.S. East Coast as a Category 1 storm, but dangerous swimming conditions are expected to persist for several more days at most beaches. Tropical storm conditions continue to affect Nantucket and Bermuda. The "very large hurricane" has sustained winds of 90 mph, with hurricane-force winds extending up to 125 miles from its center. Although not expected to make direct U.S. landfall, storm surge warnings and life-threatening rip currents have prompted evacuations in parts of the Outer Banks, with officials urging caution along the entire East Coast. The National Hurricane Center advises people to heed local warnings for their safety.</p>

A key factor in this moderation is the easing of rice inflation, which fell to 90.7% after two months of more than doubling, though prices remain historically high. The Bank of Japan closely monitors these figures, with some strategists suggesting the easing food inflation could support a rate hike later in the year, despite the central bank being seen as "behind the curve" in combating inflation.

Despite these strategic efforts, the gross profit margin declined by 0.4 percentage points to 50% due to channel structure adjustments and heavier discounting.

          <p>Aid workers are accusing international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) of "whitewashing" the reality of Israel's war in Gaza by systematically watering down public communications and avoiding terms like "occupation" or "accountability." An investigative article by DW reveals that several organizations have restricted their language, reportedly due to a new Israeli registration process for NGOs, which requires sensitive staff data and allows permit denial for groups supporting legal action against Israeli soldiers. This "chilling effect" is forcing NGOs to choose between speaking out and risking operational permits, leading to concerns that impartial aid and advocacy are being stifled amidst a severe humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>India and Russia have affirmed their commitment to expanding bilateral trade, signaling defiance against U.S. tariff threats aimed at New Delhi over its substantial imports of Russian oil. Indian Foreign Minister Jaishankar highlighted their relationship as "steadiest" globally, with both nations planning to boost India's exports of pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and textiles to Russia to address a $59 billion trade deficit. Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov confirmed progress in hydrocarbon cooperation. This move comes as Washington escalates criticism and tariffs on India, despite the U.S. and EU's continued trade with Russia, underscoring complex geopolitical dynamics and India's strategic partnership with Moscow.

          <p>Major Japanese automakers, including Toyota and Honda, have denied that they are passing the costs of Trump administration tariffs directly onto U.S. consumers through price increases. This refutes a Nikkei Asia report suggesting otherwise. Toyota clarified that its July price adjustments were routine annual increases reflecting operational costs, not a response to the 25% tariffs (later lowered to 15% through a trade deal). Honda attributed its ability to avoid direct tariff pass-through to its high percentage of American-made vehicles. This article highlights the complexities of international trade and how companies navigate tariff impacts while striving to maintain market competitiveness and customer affordability.

          <p>Chocolate lovers face continued price increases due to a lagged impact from soaring cocoa prices, which hit record highs in late 2024 amid adverse weather and supply tightness in West Africa. Agricultural commodities strategist Tracey Allen notes that chocolatiers are still dealing with these heightened costs, which are being passed on to consumers. However, the outlook for next year's Easter season appears sweeter, as industrial demand softens and supply improves with ramping production and new plantings in Ecuador and Brazil maturing. Despite this, cocoa prices are expected to remain structurally higher at around $6,000 per metric ton, also influenced by other factors like minimum wage hikes and U.S. tariffs.

          <p>The European Union's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, has cautioned against pressuring Ukraine to concede territories to Russia as part of a future peace deal, labeling such a move a "trap that Putin wants us to walk into." Kallas, speaking after EU leaders joined White House peace talks, stressed that "the strongest security guarantee is a strong Ukraine army" and emphasized the need for "credible and robust" security guarantees. She criticized Putin for not making concessions and for increasing military action, despite his recent meeting with President Trump.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thailand's former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has been cleared of royal defamation (lese majeste) charges by a Bangkok court, avoiding a potential 15-year prison sentence. The charges stemmed from remarks made in a 2015 interview concerning the 2014 coup that ousted his sister. Thaksin's legal team successfully argued that his comments were misinterpreted. This acquittal is considered unusual, as convictions in lese majeste cases are rare in Thailand, and it significantly eases a major legal threat to his family's influential political movement. His daughter, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, leads the Pheu Thai party and became prime minister last year.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to cancel hundreds of National Institutes of Health (NIH) research grants related to diversity, gender identity, and other issues, by lifting a lower court order that had required their restoration. In a 5-4 decision, the high court's ruling allows the administration to withdraw awards deemed not aligned with its policy objectives, which include directives against DEI-related initiatives. While the legal challenge from 16 states and research groups will continue, this decision impacts over 1,700 grants nationwide. The court clarified that challenges to grant terminations belong in the Court of Federal Claims, while challenges to agency guidance belong in district court.</p>

          <p>Despite a visible show of unity from European leaders at the White House in support of Ukraine, the prospect of a fair peace remains a distant dream, according to an analysis. The meeting aimed to overshadow President Trump's earlier, inconclusive meeting with Russian President Putin in Alaska. While Europe's support for Ukraine continues, concerns persist over Trump's unpredictable stance, focused on a quick end to the war rather than a just peace involving territorial liberation. Ukrainians view a bilateral meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin as unlikely, with Russia showing no willingness for substantive negotiations, highlighting the ongoing diplomatic stalemate and the continued conflict.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An international study has uncovered a novel mechanism by which corn plants communicate with their neighbors: by releasing a gas called linalool, which prompts nearby plants to alter their soil composition. Published in the peer-reviewed journal Science, this research offers crucial insights into plant interactions and their potential agricultural applications. Field surveys in China revealed that densely planted corn in inner rows experienced less herbivore damage but also reduced growth, suggesting a trade-off in defense and development. Scientists believe that optimizing linalool release could be key to developing new strategies for pest control and enhancing crop yields, contributing significantly to sustainable agriculture.</p>

          <p>Colombia is facing its most serious security crisis in decades after two separate, deadly attacks killed at least 18 people and injured dozens. A car bomb exploded in Cali, killing six and wounding over 60, while a drone attack on a police helicopter near Medellin killed 12 officers. These attacks are attributed to dissident factions of the former FARC group, posing fresh challenges to the country's fragile peace processes ahead of upcoming elections. Cali's mayor declared martial law, and national security councils are convened to define protection measures. The incidents underscore a rise in violence linked to clashes with rebels, paramilitaries, and drug gangs, particularly concerning coca leaf eradication efforts.</p>

Musk, who later started xAI to compete with OpenAI, sued the company alleging breach of contract. OpenAI, in turn, has accused Musk of a "sham bid" and harassment. Meta, which is heavily investing in its own AI capabilities and poaching researchers, did not sign Musk's letter of intent, highlighting the intense competition and legal disputes in the burgeoning AI sector.</p>
