          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed immediate, direct talks with Ukraine, suggesting Istanbul as the venue and aiming to address the conflict's root causes for a lasting peace, as he stated in a rare televised address. This proposal follows a visit by European leaders who urged Russia to agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire, a request that Kremlin initially responded to cautiously. Putin indicated he would discuss the details with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, but Kyiv has yet to respond to the invitation, which comes amid ongoing international pressure for de-escalation and peace. The article provides context on the conditions and potential outcomes of these proposed discussions.</p>

          <p>A Maryland oral surgeon, Dr. James Ryan, was convicted of depraved-heart murder in the overdose death of his girlfriend, Sarah Harris, after her sister Rachel uncovered incriminating texts revealing his provision of dangerous drugs. The article details the complex relationship between Ryan and Harris, including her history of mental health struggles and his role in providing her with surgical anesthetics. Despite Ryan's defense suggesting he was trying to help her, prosecutors successfully argued that his reckless disregard for her life led to her death.

          <p>As China seeks to diversify its food import sources amid global uncertainties, the province of Yunnan is playing a crucial role in agricultural cooperation with Southeast Asian nations. The province's involvement dates back to initiatives aimed at reducing opium production through sustainable agricultural alternatives. Yunnan Agricultural University professor Feng Lu notes that while neighboring countries may have weak consumption markets, they possess land resources suitable for agricultural production. This cooperation helps support China's food security by diversifying its food supply sources, especially as Chinese consumption patterns shift towards more meat, dairy, fruits, and vegetables.</p>

          <p>Starbucks and Luckin Coffee are regaining momentum in China by focusing on lower-tier cities, as they navigate sluggish consumption and intense price competition. Starbucks experienced flat same-store sales but saw a 4% increase in transactions, offsetting a decline in average spending, and has expanded to over 1,000 county-level markets. According to Canyan.com, the growth of coffee shops is concentrated in second and new first-tier cities, like Chengdu and Hangzhou, indicating a shift in market strategy. Richard Lin of SPDB International notes that Starbucks' focus on transaction volume is a positive sign of defending market share amid price competition.</p>

          <p>Despite Japan's gradual shift towards a cashless society, app-based salary payments have struggled to gain traction two years after their introduction, with only a small percentage of workers opting for this method. While over 100 companies offer PayPay as a salary payment option, only 2.8% of surveyed individuals use such apps, citing a lack of perceived benefits. Many companies also avoid the option due to increased costs and administrative work, though some part-time workers find it convenient. Despite this reluctance, cashless payments in Japan have surpassed 40% of all settlements, achieving the government's target ahead of schedule.</p>

          <p>With Eurovision attracting millions of viewers, experts offer insights on how to win, suggesting a combination of lyrical themes like self-empowerment, simple yet effective staging, and strategic use of minor keys. Songwriter Thomas Stengaard emphasizes the importance of memorable staging, while vocal coach Carrie Grant highlights the appeal of quirky acts that embrace the LGBT community. While minor-key songs dominate Eurovision, Remember Monday attempts to buck the trend with a major-key song. The article also points to the importance of a surprise element, such as a costume change or key change, to make a song stand out.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration, led by Vice President JD Vance and National Security Advisor Marco Rubio, intervened to de-escalate a rapidly escalating conflict between India and Pakistan, driven by fears of a potential nuclear exchange. The crisis followed a terrorist attack in Kashmir, leading to intense aerial engagements and strikes on key military installations. U.S. officials, including Vance and Rubio, engaged in direct communication with leaders from both countries, urging de-escalation and proposing alternatives to continued strikes. The intervention, along with efforts from Saudi Arabia and the UAE, ultimately led to a cease-fire agreement, though cross-border firing was still reported.</p>

          <p>Charlie Hopkins, possibly the last living former inmate of Alcatraz, reflects on his time in the infamous prison and shares his thoughts on President Trump's proposal to reopen it. Hopkins recalls the "deathly quiet" and barren conditions of Alcatraz, where he spent three years after causing trouble at other facilities. He recounts making friends with gangsters and helping plan an unsuccessful escape. While the prison is now a popular museum, Trump wants to reinstate it as a federal prison for the country's most violent offenders, despite its decrepit condition and high operating costs.</p>

Mr. Putin said Russia was “prepared for serious negotiations with Ukraine” and proposed a meeting between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul on May 15.
