          <p>Young adults across England are expressing significant financial strain due to the high cost of bus fares, with some spending over £120 monthly on transportation. This expense impacts their ability to socialize, save money, and even afford daily necessities like food. Following a report by MPs recommending free bus travel for those under 22, similar to a policy in Scotland, individuals shared their struggles with the BBC. The Department for Transport states it is already investing £1 billion to improve bus services, but young people argue that current fares remain prohibitively expensive and hinder their financial independence.</p>

          <p>A 104-year-old World War II veteran, Captain Yavar Abbas, recently moved King Charles and Queen Camilla to tears during a VJ Day commemoration ceremony. Originally from British India, Abbas served as a combat cameraman for the British 14th Army in the Burma campaign, documenting key battles like Kohima and Mandalay. Despite fighting for the British, he detested imperialism but felt it was necessary to oppose Nazism and fascism. Now, reflecting on his experiences, including witnessing the devastation in Hiroshima, Abbas views war as a futile crime and laments that humanity has learned nothing from past conflicts.</p>

          <p>Veteran NFL running back Matt Breida has decided to retire from football just weeks before the start of the regular season. The 30-year-old, who most recently played for the New York Giants, reportedly declined a workout invitation from the Miami Dolphins. Breida began his seven-year career as an undrafted free agent with the San Francisco 49ers, where he had a career-high 814 rushing yards in 2018. He concludes his professional career with 2,652 rushing yards and 19 touchdowns across stints with four different teams.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The fashion brand Topshop is planning a major comeback, with the return of standalone physical stores and its first catwalk show in seven years. After its parent company Arcadia collapsed in 2020, the brand was acquired by Asos and has since operated online only. The relaunch aims to capitalize on nostalgia while also attracting a new generation of shoppers with its signature "London girl" aesthetic. However, industry experts caution that Topshop faces challenges, including stiff competition from fast-fashion giants like Shein and the need to regain its "cool" factor in a changed retail landscape.</p>

          <p>Liverpool defeated Bournemouth 4-2 in a chaotic and emotional Premier League season opener at Anfield, marked by tributes to the late Diogo Jota. New £70m signing Hugo Ekitike made an immediate impact, scoring one goal and assisting another for Cody Gakpo. Despite the victory, Liverpool's defensive vulnerabilities were exposed, particularly when Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo scored an impressive equalizer. Late goals from Federico Chiesa and Mohamed Salah ultimately secured the win for the reigning champions, but the match highlighted areas for improvement in the team's transitioning lineup.</p>

Turner was previously sentenced to five years. The arrests followed a SWAT raid on Kingston's rented Florida mansion in May 2024. In addition to prison time, Kingston will face three years of supervised release.</p>

          <p>California Democrats, led by Governor Gavin Newsom, are advancing a plan to redraw the state's congressional district maps, aiming to regain partisan control over the process. The proposal, which would appear on a special election ballot in November, seeks to override the state's independent redistricting commission established in 2010. This move is a direct response to similar efforts by Republican-led states like Texas and could significantly impact control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2026 midterms. The proposed maps would consolidate Republican voters into fewer districts, potentially eliminating one GOP seat and shoring up vulnerable Democratic incumbents.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are meeting at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska, for a high-stakes summit focused on ending the war in Ukraine. The meeting, which could last several hours, was arranged after Trump pushed for a resolution to the conflict. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is not in attendance but has welcomed the talks, emphasizing that any agreement must respect Ukraine's sovereignty. The choice of Alaska, a territory the U.S. purchased from Russia in 1867, adds historical resonance to the discussions, which are being closely watched by international observers.</p>

          <p>Solomon Peña, a former Republican candidate for the New Mexico state legislature, has been sentenced to 80 years in federal prison for orchestrating a series of drive-by shootings at the homes of Democratic officials. The attacks occurred in late 2022 and early 2023 after Peña lost his election by a large margin, which he baselessly claimed was "rigged." Prosecutors stated Peña aimed to instill political terror, and a jury convicted him on conspiracy and weapons charges. No one was injured in the shootings, though bullets did enter the home of a state senator.</p>

          <p>King Charles III and Queen Camilla joined dozens of World War II veterans at the National Memorial Arboretum to commemorate the 80th anniversary of Victory over Japan (VJ) Day. The event honored the service and sacrifice of those who fought in the Far East, often known as the "Forgotten Army." The ceremony included the laying of wreaths, a two-minute silence, and a flypast by historic aircraft. In a message, the King paid tribute to the courage of the British, Commonwealth, and Allied forces, acknowledging the horrific conditions many endured and vowing their sacrifices would never be forgotten.</p>

          <p>The Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Buyback program, which allows public servants to make retroactive payments for periods of forbearance to qualify for debt cancellation sooner, is experiencing significant delays. According to a recent court filing, the Department of Education has a backlog of 72,730 applications, an increase from the previous month. The program's popularity grew after the SAVE repayment plan was blocked by courts, which put many borrowers into forbearance. Consumer advocates advise applicants to be patient and, if possible, not rely solely on the buyback program for forgiveness while the administration works through the queue.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel and his foundation have won a $250,000 default judgment in a defamation lawsuit against blogger Jim Stewartson. The lawsuit cited numerous posts where Stewartson accused Patel, a longtime Trump loyalist, of being a "Kremlin asset" and planning the January 6th Capitol attack. A federal judge in Las Vegas issued the ruling after Stewartson failed to respond to the lawsuit in court, stating that the blogger acted with malice. Stewartson claims he was never properly served with the lawsuit and described it as a frivolous attempt to intimidate him for his reporting.</p>

          <p>Carrie Wheeler has resigned as CEO of the online real estate company Opendoor, following a pressure campaign from investors critical of the company's performance. Wheeler, who became CEO in 2022, stated her departure would allow the company to focus and make room for new leadership. The company's stock has seen a recent surge driven by retail investor interest but has struggled since its 2020 IPO due to the impact of rising interest rates. Technology chief Shrisha Radhakrishna has been named interim leader while the board conducts a search for a permanent replacement.</p>

          <p>Playboy Enterprises is moving its corporate headquarters from Los Angeles to Miami Beach, with CEO Ben Kohn citing California's "anti-business" environment and high operational costs. The move is part of a trend of companies leaving California for states perceived as more business-friendly, such as Florida and Texas. Playboy plans to be fully operational in its new luxury office space by next year and intends to open a new Playboy Club in the area. The relocation marks a strategic return to South Florida for the brand, which previously operated a club and hotel in Miami in the 1960s and 70s.</p>

          <p>The arrival of Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska for his summit with President Donald Trump was marked by a significant display of U.S. military power. As the two leaders met on the tarmac at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, a B-2 Spirit stealth bomber and several F-35 fighter jets conducted a flyover. The B-2 bomber is a potent symbol of American air power, capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear munitions and known for its use in long-range strikes. The flyover was widely interpreted as a show of force ahead of the high-stakes negotiations regarding the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>After a six-month halt and a lawsuit from over a dozen states, the Trump administration is resuming a federal program to fund the installation of electric vehicle chargers along highways. The administration, which has been critical of the program, has released new guidance that allows the funds to flow but removes many Biden-era requirements related to community engagement and labor standards. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated that while he disagrees with subsidizing green energy, the administration will respect Congress's decision. EV advocates have welcomed the end of the freeze but are frustrated by the lengthy and disruptive delay.</p>
