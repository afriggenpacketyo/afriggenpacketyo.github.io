          <h2>Trump Warns House Republicans Against Medicaid Cuts During Tax Bill Discussions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill, President Donald Trump cautioned House Republicans against tampering with Medicaid while urging them to pass a major tax bill. Trump's blunt message highlighted the divisions within the Republican party, as some members sought cuts to the Medicaid program, which provides healthcare coverage to nearly 80 million low-income Americans and children, jointly financed by the federal government and individual states. The tax bill's progress has been hindered by these internal disagreements among House Republicans regarding Medicaid cuts.</p>

          <p>Ryanair is requesting that some of its flight attendants in Spain return salary increases they received, ranging from â‚¬1,500 to â‚¬3,000, following a legal battle with the Union Sindical Obrera (USO). The USO had challenged the original pay agreement with CCOO, stating that the negotiators lacked the authority to make such a deal, and a court ruling sided with the USO, nullifying the agreement. Ryanair is complying with the court order, but the USO is exploring legal solutions, and Ryanair has agreed to a separate pay deal with CCOO members who will not be required to repay the increases. The airline has not specified the number of affected flight attendants or the consequences of non-payment.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has charged New Jersey Congresswoman LaMonica McIver with assaulting federal agents during a visit to a Newark immigration detention center, while also dropping a trespass charge against Newark Mayor Ras J.

Federal officials accused the lawmakers of "storming" into the facility, suggesting assault charges were looming, while the House Democratic leadership has called the charges against McIver "morally bankrupt" and lacking any basis in law or fact.</p>

          <p>An inquest concluded that the death of 11-year-old Kyra Hill, who drowned at Liquid Leisure water park in Berkshire, was an unlawful killing due to gross breaches in health and safety. The breaches included a lack of an emergency plan, risk assessment, and inadequate warning signs about the water's depth, which reached 4.67m (15.3ft) in parts of the swimming area. The coroner stated that the lack of parental awareness about the risks and water depth likely contributed to Kyra's death, and the owner of the park was previously fined Â£80,000 in June 2024.</p>

While this caused disappointment in Ukraine, it also reduced pressure, as Trump has previously pressed Ukraine to cede territory to Russia.

The article highlights instances of Biden's decline, such as memory lapses and confusion, and accuses top aides of masking his condition and stifling dissent. Ultimately, the piece suggests that the Democrats' failure to address Biden's issues and their lack of a clear identity led to Trump's victory.</p>

          <p>Global investors are growing concerned about America's rising federal deficit amid President Trump's ongoing trade war and a Republican spending bill that could add trillions to the deficit. The prospect of increased borrowing has led to volatility in the U.S. government debt market, with foreign investors appearing to shy away from U.S. assets, and Wall Street is closely monitoring the bond market as CEOs and economists warn about the unsustainable fiscal situation. Home Depot reported disappointing first-quarter sales but intends to maintain current pricing levels despite tariffs, while 23andMe agreed to sell itself to Regeneron for $256 million.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Seniors considering tapping into their home equity have options like HELOCs and reverse mortgages, each with pros and cons. HELOCs offer flexible financing at lower interest rates but require monthly payments, while reverse mortgages allow seniors to access equity without immediate repayment, though interest and fees accumulate. A HELOC is better for short-term needs and affordable payments, while a reverse mortgage suits those with limited income and a desire to age in place, so seniors should consider their financial situation and consult professionals to determine the best option.</p>
