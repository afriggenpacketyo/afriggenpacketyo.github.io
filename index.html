          <p>The 1979 disappearance of 6-year-old Etan Patz in New York City became a landmark case that transformed national awareness of missing children. For decades, the investigation focused on suspect Jose Ramos, but the case remained cold. A breakthrough occurred in 2012 when a tip led police to Pedro Hernandez, a former corner store employee who confessed to the crime. His trial was complicated by claims of mental illness and a coerced confession, resulting in a mistrial before a second jury ultimately convicted him, bringing a long-awaited, albeit somber, conclusion for the Patz family and the investigators haunted by the case for nearly 40 years.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel faced intense questioning from the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding the investigation into the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Patel defended his decision to publicly release photos of the suspect, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, against law enforcement recommendations, arguing it was crucial for the swift apprehension. He also revealed that the FBI is investigating numerous individuals in a Discord chat group with the alleged shooter. The hearing was contentious, featuring a heated exchange with Senator Cory Booker, who accused Patel of making the country less safe, highlighting the intense political scrutiny surrounding the high-profile case.</p>

          <p>House GOP leaders have introduced a temporary spending bill designed to keep the government funded until November 21, thereby avoiding an imminent shutdown. The legislation, described as a "clean" continuing resolution, maintains current funding levels while also allocating additional money for the security of lawmakers and other officials following the recent assassination of activist Charlie Kirk. The proposal faces opposition from Democrats, who are demanding the extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies be included. With a slim majority, Republican leadership must achieve near-unanimous support within their party to pass the bill through the House, while its fate in the Senate remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>A senior Labour MP, Dame Emily Thornberry, stated that "red flags were missed or ignored" concerning Lord Mandelson's known links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein before his appointment as UK ambassador to the US. Following Mandelson's dismissal by Prime Minister Keir Starmer over newly published emails, an emergency debate in Parliament highlighted widespread criticism of the vetting process. The Foreign Office indicated that the Cabinet Office conducted the due diligence and raised no concerns, shifting scrutiny onto the Prime Minister's office. The controversy has sparked questions about governmental accountability and judgment, creating a significant political crisis for the Prime Minister.</p>

          <p>The House Judiciary Committee has announced it will conduct a field hearing in Charlotte, North Carolina, to address rising crime rates in the city. The decision follows the highly publicized murder of 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska, who was fatally stabbed on the city's light rail. The suspect, a career criminal, has been federally charged, with Attorney General Pam Bondi attributing the tragedy to "soft-on-crime policies." This hearing is part of a series where the Republican-led committee visits Democrat-run cities to scrutinize local prosecutorial policies and highlight the impact of crime on communities, turning local tragedies into a national political debate.</p>

          <p>An analysis of energy production costs reveals that renewables like onshore wind and utility-scale solar are the most cost-effective forms of energy, even before considering government subsidies. The report uses the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) metric, which shows fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas are more expensive to generate. However, the true cost is complex, influenced by factors like government tax incentives, tariffs, and the need for backup power sources for intermittent renewables. The current administration's policies, which are phasing out clean energy credits while expanding breaks for oil and gas, are set to alter this financial landscape significantly.

Under the proposed deal, which is expected to be finalized within 30 to 45 days, Oracle will continue its role as the cloud and data security partner for the platform. This arrangement aims to address U.S. national security concerns about data privacy and potential influence from the Chinese government, which had prompted legislation forcing a divestiture.

Van Hollen dismisses concerns that this could backfire, stating that it is necessary to prevent President Trump from getting a "blank check" for what he terms "lawless activities."

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A key regulation for reverse mortgages, known as the "6-month rule," dictates the timeline for settling the loan after the borrower passes away or permanently leaves the home. Once a qualifying event occurs, the lender issues a "Due and Payable" letter, giving heirs six months to either repay the loan balance in full or sell the property to cover the debt. This rule primarily applies to federally insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs). While extensions are possible with HUD approval, the deadline emphasizes the need for borrowers to engage in thorough estate planning and communicate clearly with their families to avoid foreclosure and ensure a smooth transition.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has lifted travel restrictions on Hungarian citizens that were imposed by the previous administration in 2021. The earlier restrictions, which limited the validity of travel authorizations under the Visa Waiver Program, were enacted due to security concerns over Hungary's policy of granting citizenship to nearly a million people abroad without adequate vetting. The restoration of the two-year, multiple-entry travel authorization signals a significant warming of diplomatic ties between Washington and Budapest.

          <p>For the first time since it sank in 1916, artifacts have been recovered from the wreck of the Britannic, the sister ship of the Titanic. An 11-member deep-sea diving team retrieved items including the ship's bell, a navigation light, and first-class silver trays from the vessel, which lies nearly 400 feet deep in the Aegean Sea. The Britannic was serving as a hospital ship during World War I when it struck a mine and sank. The challenging recovery operation was organized by the Britannic Foundation, and the recovered artifacts will be conserved and displayed in a new Museum of Underwater Antiquities in Greece.</p>

          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has led to professional repercussions for several individuals who made public comments about his death. A sports reporter, a university employee, a Nasdaq staffer, and a U.S. Secret Service agent are among those who have been fired or placed on administrative leave for social media posts or on-air remarks deemed inappropriate or callous by their employers. These actions highlight the legal right of private companies to terminate employees for speech that could harm their reputation. The incidents have ignited a broader debate about free speech, workplace policies, and the consequences of public expression in a politically polarized climate.</p>

          <p>A public inquiry into the 2024 Southport dance studio attack has heard that a teacher expressed alarm over the "frightening red tape" that hindered efforts to intervene with the killer, Axel Rudakubana. Emails show the teacher struggled to get a response from police, social services, and mental health agencies despite Rudakubana's history of violence and carrying knives. The inquiry revealed that various agencies, including the counter-extremism program Prevent, had been involved with the teenager but failed to take decisive action. The hearing is focused on identifying systemic failures and missed opportunities to prevent the attack where he murdered three young girls.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the key factor that "turned the tide" in securing a deal for TikTok's U.S. operations was President Trump's credible threat to let the app "go dark." Bessent stated that the administration made it clear it would prioritize national security over finalizing a deal, which motivated China to agree to a framework. He noted that the commercial terms had been largely in place for months but were put on hold by China after a U.S. tariff announcement. This insight reveals the high-stakes brinkmanship involved in the negotiations over the future of the popular social media platform in the United States.</p>

          <p>Israeli forces have initiated a long-anticipated major ground offensive in Gaza City, which Israel describes as Hamas's last significant stronghold. The operation began with intense overnight airstrikes, forcing tens of thousands of Palestinians to flee south along a single coastal road, joining hundreds of thousands already displaced. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) estimates that 350,000 people have fled the recent advance, though over half a million may remain. The offensive has drawn sharp international condemnation, and a UN commission of inquiry has released a report finding that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, a charge Israel categorically rejects.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz delivered an emotional speech at the reopening of a historic Munich synagogue, addressing the rising tide of antisemitism in the country. Visibly moved, Merz spoke of the "crime against humanity of the Shoah" and his personal shame that Jewish institutions in Germany still require police protection. He acknowledged a "new wave of antisemitism" on social media, at universities, and in public spaces, partly attributing it to ideologies from the home countries of some recent immigrants. The speech comes as the Central Council of Jews in Germany marks its 75th anniversary amid growing concerns for the safety of the Jewish community.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Robert Redford, who passed away at 89, was a cinematic icon whose acting talent was often overshadowed by his classic good looks. While films like "The Natural" capitalized on his all-American image, his true craft was in his subtlety and ability to convey deep thought with an unassuming presence, as seen in his role as Bob Woodward in "All the President's Men." His skill was often most visible in contrast with dynamic co-stars like Barbra Streisand or Dustin Hoffman. Despite his fame, he was only nominated for one acting Oscar, with more recognition coming for his directing and his monumental contribution to independent film through the Sundance Institute, which he co-founded.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has filed a $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times and its publisher, Penguin Random House, alleging a coordinated campaign to damage his reputation. The suit, filed in Florida, claims that a series of articles and a book published by the defendants contained falsehoods and amounted to libel, with the intent of harming his 2024 election chances. The lawsuit portrays the newspaper as a "mouthpiece of the Democrat Party" engaged in "industrial-scale defamation." A spokesperson for The New York Times called the lawsuit meritless and an intimidation tactic, vowing to defend their reporting and First Amendment rights.</p>
