        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to give police broader powers to manage recurring protests by allowing them to consider the "cumulative impact" of previous demonstrations. This could lead to protests being relocated if a site is used repeatedly, and individuals who violate these conditions face arrest. The move follows recent mass arrests and is framed by the Home Secretary as a measure to protect communities, particularly the Jewish community, who feel intimidated by large, repeated demonstrations. The government is also reviewing legislation, which includes the possibility of banning protests outright.</p>

          <p>Three states in India have banned the sale of Coldrif cough syrup after it was linked to the deaths of at least nine children. The Indian Health Ministry confirmed that samples of the syrup, manufactured by Sresan Pharma, contained toxic levels of diethylene glycol (DEG), an industrial solvent. This incident places India's large pharmaceutical industry, which supplies 20% of the world's generic medicines, under renewed scrutiny. The country has faced similar controversies in recent years, including WHO warnings about other Indian-made syrups linked to child deaths in The Gambia and Uzbekistan.</p>

The attacks resulted in two deaths in the Lviv region and another fatality in Zaporizhzhia, where a power plant was struck, causing widespread electricity outages. In response to the proximity of the strikes, neighboring NATO member Poland scrambled its fighter jets to secure its airspace. The escalation follows a US official's statement indicating support for Ukrainian strikes deep within Russian territory.</p>

          <p>The death toll from a prayer hall collapse at the Al Khoziny Islamic boarding school in Sidoarjo, Indonesia, has reached 37, with rescuers still searching for 26 missing students. The structure, which was undergoing unpermitted construction to add two new floors, collapsed on hundreds of boys aged 12 to 19. Authorities and construction experts attribute the tragedy to structural failure, highlighting a widespread issue of illegal construction in the country. The school's caretaker has apologized, but a criminal investigation is underway to determine if negligence led to the fatal incident.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, a Black, British doctoral student at Cornell University recounts his decision to flee the United States after participating in a pro-Palestine protest on campus. After being banned from campus, he went into hiding and eventually self-deported, fearing detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), especially after his student visa was terminated and he was notified his Google data was handed to Homeland Security. The article connects his experience to a broader pattern of surveillance against non-US citizens, citing a report on the use of AI technologies to monitor and target activists.</p>

          <p>In the investigation into the 2023 murder of Kenneth Fandrich at an Intel campus in Oregon, police faced a major setback when a key piece of evidence was destroyed. A maroon minivan, believed to be the primary crime scene where Fandrich was killed, was traced by detectives to a metal scrapyard. However, they arrived just a week too late, discovering the vehicle had already been crushed and processed as scrap metal. The suspect, Dr. Steven Milner, was a former veterinarian who had been stalking the victim and was later arrested and charged with the murder.</p>

          <p>The article examines the evolution of Newcastle United since its controversial, Saudi-led takeover four years ago, noting a significant but gradual transformation. While the club has modernized its training facilities and achieved on-field success, including winning the Carabao Cup and qualifying for the Champions League, it has not simply bought its way to the top. Financial regulations like Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) have constrained spending, forcing a more strategic approach to player development and signings. Despite off-field growth, the club still faces challenges in competing commercially with top rivals.</p>

The 76-year-old artist explained that as a shy young man, he considered the clergy a viable path until a pivotal moment while performing with his college band, The Commodores. An enthusiastic comment from a woman in the audience—"Sing it, baby!"—gave him the validation he needed to pursue music instead.

The piece argues that Trump's bullying tactics alienate regional partners and push them closer to rivals like China.

          <p>Despite recent record sales, the United States remains behind China and Europe in the transition to electric vehicles (EVs). The article attributes this lag to comparatively weaker government support, higher vehicle costs, and the effective exclusion of low-cost Chinese brands due to high tariffs. A recent sales boom was largely driven by a federal tax credit that has now expired, and automakers expect demand to drop sharply. The policy landscape under President Trump, who has moved to scrap many pro-EV measures, further complicates the market and the nation's competitiveness in the global auto industry.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has temporarily blocked President Trump's attempt to deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland without the governor's consent. Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump nominee, ruled that the administration's justification for the deployment did not meet the high legal standard required, stating that protests in the city were not disruptive enough to warrant such an action. The judge's decision, which blocks the deployment for 14 days, emphasized the nation's tradition of separating military from civil affairs. Oregon officials praised the ruling as a victory for state sovereignty.</p>
