        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack voiced skepticism about lowering interest rates, citing persistent inflation concerns despite market expectations for a September cut. She emphasized the need to maintain a "modestly restrictive" policy to bring inflation back to target, noting that the Fed's target has been exceeded for four years. Hammack's perspective, which includes a higher "neutral" interest rate, contrasts with some market sentiment and other officials, highlighting internal Federal Reserve debate on future monetary policy. She worries that an accommodative stance could reignite inflationary pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered National Guard troops deployed in Washington D.C. to be armed, escalating President Trump's law enforcement crackdown. This decision reverses previous guidance that troops would not carry weapons, despite no overt threats requiring arms. Nearly 2,000 National Guard members, including those from Republican-led states, are stationed in the city, primarily protecting landmarks and assisting with crowd control. Local officials dispute the necessity of the initiative, citing declining violent crime rates in D.C., while the president maintains the city is safer.</p>

          <p>Canada announced it would remove many of its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products, a significant step in improving trade relations between the two nations. Imposed in March in response to U.S. duties on steel and aluminum, Canada's 25% tariffs on U.S. autos, steel, and aluminum will, however, remain in place. Prime Minister Mark Carney confirmed the change takes effect September 1, following a "productive" phone call with President Trump. This move comes as the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) approaches a review later this year, signaling a potential de-escalation in trade tensions.</p>

          <p>The summer box office is projected to reach at least $3.75 billion, a 2% increase from 2024, driven by films like Disney's "Lilo & Stitch" and "Superman." Despite the improvement, the industry fell short of the $4 billion pre-pandemic standard, as many major franchise films underperformed. Analysts predict a significant cooldown in ticket sales through October, with no major breakout hits expected until late November. However, AMC and Cinemark CEOs expressed optimism for a strong fourth quarter, anticipating blockbusters like "Wicked: For Good" and "Avatar: Fire and Ash" to boost year-end revenue.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo's position is uncertain due to a deteriorating relationship with owner Evangelos Marinakis, despite the team's recent European qualification and Premier League win. Nuno confirmed the strained relationship, expressing concern about its impact on the squad and summer recruitment, where he reportedly felt uninvolved. The situation has created unease among players, and Nuno stated he would continue to perform his best until the "very last moment."

          <p>Ether surged, nearing its record high, after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish remarks at Jackson Hole hinted at possible interest rate adjustments. Powell's statement about policy in "restrictive territory" and shifting risks led traders to anticipate a September rate cut, triggering a "panicked repositioning" in the crypto market. This resulted in approximately $120 million in Ether short liquidations within an hour, pushing prices higher. Crypto-focused companies like Bitmine Immersion and SharpLink Gaming saw significant gains, reflecting renewed momentum for risk assets as the Fed and administration appear aligned on easing.

          <p>Jason Zehe, 19, received a 20-year sentence—10 in prison and 10 on extended supervision—for an OWI-related crash that killed 17-year-old Megan Voss. Zehe pleaded guilty to homicide by intoxicated use of a motor vehicle and second-degree recklessly endangering safety. The crash occurred when Zehe's pickup sped through a stop intersection, colliding with Voss's vehicle. Zehe expressed sincere remorse in court, acknowledging his "horrible mistake." The judge also ordered $12,000 in restitution and 200 hours of community service, including eight hours each December 30, marking the anniversary of the tragic event.</p>

          <h2>International Postal Services Suspend Some US Deliveries Due to New Import Tax Rules</h2>

          <p>Royal Mail and DHL have temporarily halted some parcel deliveries to the U.S., citing confusion over new import tax rules taking effect August 29. President Trump's executive order ends a global import tax exemption for low-value parcels, meaning most packages will now face tariffs. While gifts under $100 remain duty-free, postal services are struggling to implement systems to comply, leading to service suspensions. The White House justified the change by aiming to combat "deceptive shipping practices" and the flow of illicit materials, as de minimis shipments have surged significantly, posing challenges for international e-commerce and logistics.</p>

          <p>The US is increasingly deporting undocumented migrants to African countries, with Uganda becoming the latest to accept a deal to take individuals not qualifying for US residency. This initiative, part of President Trump's "largest deportation operation," builds on earlier agreements with nations like South Sudan and Eswatini. Human rights groups raise alarms, particularly concerning deportations to countries with poor human rights records or already strained refugee resources. While African nations may seek improved relations and potential benefits, residents express concern about their countries becoming a "dumping ground" and question the humanitarian implications of these policies.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom's press office has adopted President Trump's aggressive social media style, using all-caps posts and name-calling to troll critics, particularly Fox News. This tactic has triggered dismay among Fox News hosts, who criticize Newsom's "childish" and "performative" confrontational approach, despite their network's history of similar rhetoric. Newsom's account has gained significant traction, generating hundreds of millions of impressions, and he justifies his strategy by pointing to Trump's own online behavior. The article highlights a new front in political messaging, where Newsom uses his online presence to counter conservative narratives and promote his political agenda.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lending experts caution homeowners about the risks of maxing out Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs), despite their current attractiveness due to high home equity. HELOCs, functioning like credit cards with variable interest rates, can lead to unaffordable payments if rates rise, or if the borrower's financial situation changes. Maxing out a HELOC can negatively impact credit scores due to high utilization and, in severe cases, risk foreclosure. The article advises building a repayment plan, monitoring interest rate changes, and considering refinancing to a fixed-rate home equity loan or cash-out refinance to mitigate these potential financial pitfalls.

Elon Musk's compensation is tied to performance-based stock options, which are currently embroiled in a legal battle after a Delaware judge revoked his 2018 $56 billion package. Tesla's board recently granted an "interim" package of 96 million shares, worth about $29 billion, without shareholder approval, which an investment group is now asking Nasdaq to investigate. This ongoing dispute highlights governance concerns and the significant financial stakes involved. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lyle Menendez appeared before California's parole board, seeking release a day after his brother Erik was denied parole. Both brothers were convicted in 1995 for the 1989 murders of their parents and sentenced to life, but recent sentence reductions made them parole eligible. They maintain they acted in self-defense due to alleged parental abuse, a claim disputed by District Attorney Nathan Hochman, who argues they lied and haven't taken full responsibility. Erik's parole was denied primarily due to prison policy violations, with the board acknowledging the abuse claims but emphasizing alternative actions the brothers could have taken.</p>

In his Jackson Hole speech, Powell noted the labor market's resilience but warned of rising downside dangers, including tariffs potentially reigniting inflation. He emphasized the Fed's ability to "proceed carefully" given current conditions, reiterating the commitment to its 2% inflation target while acknowledging past lessons from high inflation.
