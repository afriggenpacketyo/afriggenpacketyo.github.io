        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>PepsiCo reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, largely due to strong performance in its international markets. This growth helped to counterbalance a continued decline in sales volume within North America for both its food and beverage segments. The company is now focusing on cost-cutting measures and innovation to improve its domestic performance, particularly for brands like Frito-Lay and Quaker. PepsiCo reaffirmed its full-year financial outlook, anticipating stable earnings and modest organic revenue growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines announced a fourth-quarter profit forecast that exceeded analyst expectations, attributing the positive outlook to rising airfares and sustained demand for luxury travel. The airline's third-quarter results also beat estimates, with revenue from premium cabins increasing by 9% while main cabin revenue saw a slight decline. CEO Ed Bastian noted that the company has not observed any negative impacts from a potential government shutdown and is well-positioned for continued growth. The strong performance suggests a recovery in travel demand and effective capacity management by the carrier. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government's plan to introduce a mandatory digital ID system by 2029 has triggered a significant public backlash, with over 2.8 million people signing a petition against it. The "Brit Card" is intended to curb illegal immigration by requiring it for employment, but critics from across the political spectrum have raised concerns about potential mass surveillance and digital control. While the White House has stated a similar system is not being considered in the U.S., security experts argue that decentralized digital IDs can be secure. The controversy highlights the ongoing debate between national security measures and individual privacy rights.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Forensic experts have identified major procedural failures in the federal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's 2019 death, which was ruled a suicide. A review of evidence, including 90 photos from his cell, suggests the scene was not properly preserved, items were moved before the FBI arrived, and basic forensic tests were not conducted. Key witnesses, such as the corrections officers on duty, were not interviewed for nearly two years, fueling continued speculation about the circumstances of his death. While the review does not suggest foul play, it concludes the probe did not follow standard procedures for a suspicious death investigation.</p>

While industry groups have welcomed the potential for reduced costs and increased flexibility, critics warn that relaxing alcohol regulations could lead to a rise in antisocial behavior.

Legal scholars question the president's authority to make such a designation for a domestic entity, citing First Amendment protections for freedom of association. The move is seen as part of a broader political campaign against the "radical left," though data suggests far-right extremism has been a more prevalent source of political violence.</p>

          <h2>Rose Byrne Delivers Superb Performance in a Dark and Anxious Psychodrama</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new film "If I Had Legs I'd Kick You," written and directed by Mary Bronstein, is reviewed as an intense and claustrophobic psychodrama. The movie centers on a mother in crisis, played by Rose Byrne in what is described as a "vivid, impassioned performance." The film uses extreme close-ups and oppressive sound design to immerse the audience in the protagonist's anxiety as she deals with a mysteriously ill daughter, a collapsed ceiling, and an absent husband. While the experience is purposefully exhausting and unpleasant, Byrne's portrayal of a woman on the verge of erasure is praised as magnificent and unforgettable.</p>

          <p>"Family Meal," a new immersive theater production in Los Angeles, combines a six-course fine-dining menu with the chaotic drama of a dysfunctional restaurant family. The show casts the audience as guests at a retirement party for an acclaimed chef, which devolves into a "culinary pissing match" between his children who are vying for control of the restaurant. The experience, a collaboration between the Speakeasy Society and chef Ben Baron, aims to capture the high-energy, behind-the-scenes tension of kitchen culture popularized by shows like "The Bear." Guests are pulled into the narrative, interacting with characters and witnessing family secrets unfold between courses.</p>

          <p>On the 30th anniversary of its release, a look back at No Doubt's diamond-certified album "Tragic Kingdom" reveals it was nearly never made. The Anaheim band faced numerous setbacks, including a lack of support from their original label, Interscope Records, which was unenthusiastic about their new material and considered dropping them. The album's creation was marked by strife, such as co-founder Eric Stefani quitting halfway through production due to creative differences. The record was ultimately saved when it was picked up by subsidiary Trauma Records, which championed "Just a Girl" as the lead single, launching the band into global stardom.</p>

          <p>Moisture from Hurricane Priscilla, currently moving up the coast of Mexico, is expected to bring rain and thunderstorms to Southern California from Thursday to Saturday. The National Weather Service predicts the region's mountains, foothills, and deserts are most likely to see significant rainfall, with some areas potentially receiving 1 to 2 inches. While the rainfall is not expected to be as severe as that from a recent tropical storm, the weather pattern will make conditions across the Southland cloudy and muggier. The most hazardous weather, including potential flash flooding, is forecast further east in Arizona, Utah, and Colorado.</p>

          <p>Following the recent cancellation of nearly $8 billion in clean energy projects, a leaked list indicates the Trump administration is considering terminating an additional 300 projects valued at over $15.8 billion. The potential cuts would affect projects across the country, including five of the seven national "hydrogen hubs" designed to advance clean energy technology. While the administration claims the cuts save taxpayer money on non-viable projects, critics argue the move is politically motivated and undermines U.S. energy leadership and efforts to combat climate change.

The court-ordered redistricting comes as President Trump encourages Republican states to redraw maps to their advantage. MWEG, which includes members from across the political spectrum, states its actions are guided by faith and a principled commitment to a fair democratic process.</p>
