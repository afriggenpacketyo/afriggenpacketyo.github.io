          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native mistakenly deported from Maryland, has been returned to the U.S. to face charges of illegally transporting migrants. A federal grand jury indicted Abrego Garcia for allegedly participating in a years-long conspiracy to transport undocumented migrants from Texas to the country's interior. His attorney claims the charges are an abuse of power to avoid admitting the deportation mistake, while Attorney General Pam Bondi thanked El Salvador for returning him. The indictment alleges Abrego Garcia made over 100 trips, smuggling people throughout the country, and faces a maximum of 10 years' imprisonment for each alien transported.</p>

          <p>Undocumented immigrants attending ICE check-in appointments in Los Angeles were detained and held in a federal building's basement, some overnight, according to lawyers and family members. Attorneys reported hundreds detained, with dozens held in rooms fitting up to 30 people, with one family spending the night with limited access to necessities. ICE refutes the claims, asserting their commitment to treating those in custody with dignity and as mandated by law, while the Department of Homeland Security stated those arrested had final removal orders. Internal data reveals ICE arrests have surged under the current administration, intensifying efforts to detain unauthorized immigrants.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed executive orders designed to bolster the American drone industry, enhance airspace security, and strengthen military readiness. These orders could potentially exclude Chinese manufacturers like DJI and Autel Robotics from the U.S. market. Trump stated that immediate action is needed to ensure American sovereignty over its skies, citing concerns that foreign-made drones endanger the public and compromise critical infrastructure.

          <p>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), a nonpartisan agency, is facing criticism from Republicans after projecting that their legislation would increase federal deficits by $2.4 trillion over a decade. Established in 1974 to provide Congress with objective budgetary information, the CBO acts as a counterbalance to the executive branch's Office of Management and Budget. The CBO calculates how much bills would increase or decrease revenues and spending, providing advisory cost estimates without policy recommendations, though its work is often difficult due to the complexities of economic forecasting.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's recent cuts to the Pentagon's weapons testing office have led to a halt in work and potential layoffs at the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA), a Pentagon-funded think tank. Hegseth deemed much of the office's work as redundant and nonessential, resulting in a significant reduction in the civilian workforce and the end of contractor support, including IDA's work. GOP Sen. Roger Wicker has expressed concerns about the cuts, questioning their advisability and potential reversal of congressional policy.

In a closely divided country, even a small disruption could have massive implications, potentially helping Democrats in the short term.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly preparing to cancel a large swath of federal funding for California, potentially targeting the University of California and California State University systems. Agencies are being instructed to identify grants that can be withheld, with the White House criticizing California's energy, immigration, and other policies. The administration is allegedly targeting California universities over antisemitism on campus, though the schools have been making efforts to address the issue.</p>
