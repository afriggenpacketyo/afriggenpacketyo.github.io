          <p>Following his recent conviction, Sean "Diddy" Combs attended a bail hearing to determine if he will be released pending sentencing. Prosecutors and defense attorneys are currently disputing the appropriate length of his prison sentence, with estimates ranging from two to over five years. A key factor in the hearing is a letter from Cassie Ventura's attorney, urging the judge to keep Combs detained, citing him as a potential danger to victims and the community. The judge has not yet set a sentencing date.</p>

          <p>A powerful explosion at a fireworks warehouse in Yolo County, California, has left seven people unaccounted for and two others injured. The blast, which occurred Tuesday evening, triggered a large fire that spread to nearby grasslands, burning approximately 80 acres and causing a smoke plume to rise up to 15,000 feet. Authorities issued mandatory evacuations for a one-mile radius and shut down local roads as they investigate the incident. Family members of the missing, some of whom were working their first day, are anxiously awaiting news.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major U.S. department stores are increasingly passing the cost of President Trump's tariffs on to consumers, with noticeable price hikes on items like footwear and apparel. Data shows prices for some goods have risen by as much as 4% since January, with private-label lines and products from China being affected first. The new trade deal imposing a 20% tariff on goods from Vietnam, a major manufacturing hub for brands like Nike and Lululemon, is expected to further accelerate these price increases. Analysts are now watching to see how consumer behavior will shift in response to the rising costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The B-2 bomber pilots involved in the recent strike on Iranian nuclear facilities have been invited to the White House for the July Fourth holiday but are being advised to maintain a low profile for security reasons. President Trump has publicly celebrated the mission as having "obliterated" Iran's nuclear program, a claim that has been questioned by a Defense Intelligence Agency assessment suggesting a more modest setback of several months. The president criticized news reports that downplayed the strike's effectiveness, stating the pilots were "devastated" by the coverage and should be treated as heroes.</p>

          <p>The United States has reached a new trade agreement with Vietnam, imposing a 20% tariff on Vietnamese imports and a steeper 40% tariff on goods trans-shipped through the country from places like China. The deal averts a previously threatened 46% levy and, according to President Trump, grants the U.S. "TOTAL ACCESS" to Vietnam's markets with zero tariffs on American products. Vietnam has become a critical manufacturing hub for many international brands, which had moved production there to avoid tariffs on Chinese goods. The agreement provides some clarity for businesses but still introduces new costs for importers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the debate over President Trump's "big, beautiful bill" reveals a significant crisis of trust in American political institutions. The sprawling, 940-page legislation has become a symbol of political division, with most citizens feeling uninformed and distrustful of claims from both parties. Citing multiple national polls, the article highlights the bill's deep unpopularity, with a majority of voters opposing it and believing it will personally harm their families. The author suggests that regardless of the bill's final outcome, the underlying issue is a loss of faith in the democratic process itself.</p>

The artist, Louie Palsino, stated the mural is a tribute to HernÃ¡ndez "for standing up for what is right."

          <p>This opinion piece argues that Los Angeles needs to adopt a more aggressive strategy to combat the widespread use of illegal fireworks, which pose significant fire, health, and safety risks. The author, from the public safety organization MySafe:LA, notes that despite current laws and enforcement efforts, the problem has worsened. The article proposes that the city follow the example of Riverside, which uses surveillance drones to identify violators and mail them citations starting at $1,500. This tech-driven approach would enhance deterrence without straining public safety resources, especially as the city prepares to host major events like the World Cup and Olympics.</p>

          <p>This column frames President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" as a stark example of modern-day Gilded Age excess, juxtaposing it with Jeff Bezos's recent extravagant wedding in Venice.

The piece criticizes the bill for exacerbating income inequality, increasing the number of uninsured Americans, and adding trillions to the national debt. It concludes that the legislation is a "killer" bill that benefits billionaires at the expense of the most vulnerable. (not investment advice)</p>

While the vote is largely symbolic and not expected to pass, it highlights growing frustration within Brussels over the Commission's handling of the matter.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's policy that effectively suspended the right of migrants to seek asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority by declaring an "invasion" and unilaterally barring asylum applications, stating the president cannot create an "alternative immigration system." The judge's order, which has been stayed for 14 days to allow for an appeal, affirms that the executive branch cannot override immigration laws passed by Congress. The ruling is a significant legal victory for immigrants' rights groups who challenged the policy.</p>

          <p>Tesla reported delivering 384,122 vehicles in the second quarter, a 13% decline from the previous year and the company's second consecutive quarterly drop. Analysts attribute the sales slump to a combination of factors, including increased competition from both legacy automakers and EV startups, as well as brand damage linked to CEO Elon Musk's political activities. Demand for electric vehicles has also begun to plateau as the market matures. As sales of its current models falter, the company is increasingly focusing its future on the development of self-driving technology and a planned robotaxi service. (not investment advice)</p>

The move has drawn sharp criticism from educators and Democratic lawmakers, who warn it will force cash-strapped school districts, particularly in low-income areas, to cut staff and services.

This would come from a provision imposing a one-year Medicaid ban on non-profits that offer abortions, effectively serving as a "backdoor abortion ban." The cuts could force the closure of nearly 200 health centers, over 90% of which are in states where abortion remains legal, and impact over a million patients who rely on Planned Parenthood for a range of healthcare services. The move is seen as the closest anti-abortion activists have come to their long-held goal of defunding the organization.</p>

          <p>Millions of Americans are bracing for a major travel crush for the Fourth of July holiday, with airports and highways expected to be exceptionally busy. The American Automobile Association projects over 72 million people will travel more than 50 miles, a significant increase from last year. Los Angeles International Airport alone anticipates over 1.5 million travelers, with Sunday projected to be its busiest day. The TSA is also preparing for a surge in air travel nationwide, advising passengers to arrive early and be prepared for long lines and potential delays during the peak holiday period.</p>
