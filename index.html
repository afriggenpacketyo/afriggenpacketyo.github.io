          <p>AB Hernandez, a transgender high school athlete, competed in the California track and field championships, facing both support and protests. The event drew national attention, including criticism from President Trump, who threatened to pull federal funding. The California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) implemented a policy change to allow an additional athlete to receive a medal in events where a transgender athlete placed. One person was arrested following an altercation between protesters and counterprotesters, but the events continued without disruption as coaches and participants voiced their support for Hernandez. The competition proceeded despite the controversies.</p>

          <p>Ernest Williams, a 90-year-old Royal Navy veteran, is still campaigning to correct what he believes is an unfair military pension. Williams says that due to his discharge date in 1970, he received a significantly lower pension than others who left in 1972 when the rules changed. Despite numerous appeals to the Ministry of Defence and support from local MPs, he has been told his pension reflects his "full and correct entitlement" based on the rules at the time. Williams and his wife believe approximately 400 men were discharged under similar circumstances, and they are seeking justice for these veterans.</p>

          <p>The Mitchell City Council will consider a resolution expressing interest in constructing a state correctional facility in Davison County. A local developer believes that stable jobs backed by the state will bring income to support homeownership and local business patronage. The proposed prison site is located near the Mitchell Regional Landfill and owned by James River Farms. The council will also consider change orders for the South Wastewater Treatment Facility and the jetty project at Lake Mitchell.</p>

          <p>The UK government will unveil a major defense review, announcing plans to build up to 12 new attack submarines and invest £15 billion in its nuclear warhead program. The review is expected to recommend that the armed forces move to "warfighting readiness" to deter growing threats. The new submarines will replace the UK's current fleet from the late 2030s onwards, and the Ministry of Defence said building the new submarines will support 30,000 jobs into the 2030s. The Strategic Defence Review will shape the UK's armed forces for years to come.</p>

          <p>Angela Zhang, a law professor at USC, discusses how US technology restrictions have spurred innovation in China, forcing tech firms to cut costs and scale up. She notes that tariffs can affect the Chinese tech sector directly, making it harder to compete in the US market, and indirectly, causing firms to look to other markets and deepen trade with Europe. In response to the chip embargo, many Chinese tech firms started open-sourcing their AI models, a cost-effective and collaborative way to develop advanced technologies when resources are tight. Despite challenges, Chinese firms are expected to continue pushing hard to make their products more competitive.</p>
