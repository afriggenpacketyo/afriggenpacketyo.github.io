          <p>A federal appeals court has granted the Trump White House the ability to restrict Associated Press access to spaces like the Oval Office. The court's ruling temporarily blocks a lower court's decision that deemed the ban unconstitutional, arguing that these spaces are not public forums. The AP lawsuit was filed after the White House restricted their access, citing a disagreement over the AP Stylebook's use of "Gulf of Mexico" instead of "Gulf of America." White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated the administration's intent to expand access to new media outlets. This decision raises questions about press freedom and the White House's control over media access.</p>

Some analysts argue that Tesla's problems extend beyond the feud, citing competition in the autonomous vehicle market and Musk's shift towards right-wing politics as contributing factors.

          <p>An article in The Atlantic discusses how President Trump's administration is implementing policies that isolate the United States from the rest of the world. The article highlights the expansion of travel bans, restrictions on foreign students, and increased scrutiny of foreign visitors. These measures, coupled with anecdotes of negative experiences faced by foreign nationals, contribute to a perception of the U.S. as unwelcoming. The administration's stance is driven by xenophobia and aligned with the "Great Replacement" theory, aiming to limit both legal and illegal immigration. The economic impact includes a predicted decline in tourist spending.</p>

          <h2>Madeleine McCann Search Ends Without Closure</h2>

          <p>The recent police search for Madeleine McCann in Praia da Luz, Portugal, has concluded without providing closure to the case. Residents expressed hope for resolution, either through finding McCann's remains or discovering her alive. The initial Portuguese investigation faced criticism for failing to adequately preserve the scene, and subsequent investigations yielded no definitive suspects. The German prosecutor's claim in 2020 that they had evidence of McCann's death led to Christian Brückner being identified as a suspect. However, Brückner's acquittal on related charges has complicated the pursuit of justice, leaving the mystery unresolved.</p>

          <p>Sunny Jacobs, who gained fame after being exonerated and released from death row, has passed away at the age of 77. Her story, which was adapted into an Off Broadway play and television movies, drew significant attention to the issue of wrongful convictions. However, an investigator later questioned aspects of her story in a 2021 book. Jacobs' case remains a notable example of the potential for injustice within the legal system.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Russian truck drivers were unaware of their involvement in transporting platforms used for Ukraine's drone attack on Russian warplanes. The drones were hidden in "mobile houses" with retractable roofs, which were loaded onto the trucks and remotely opened to conduct the operation. Zelenskyy emphasized that Ukraine used only its own weapons in the attack, without deploying equipment from its allies. The attack reportedly damaged over 40 Russian bombers, significantly impacting Russia's strategic bomber fleet. Zelenskyy's comments suggest an effort to minimize the involvement of external actors and highlight Ukraine's capabilities.</p>

CFO John David Rainey noted that tariffs haven't significantly altered consumer spending patterns, with shoppers prioritizing groceries over discretionary items.

          <p>A New York Times guest essay criticizes an executive order issued by President Trump that imposes sanctions targeting the work of the International Criminal Court (I.C.C.). The order singles out the court's chief prosecutor for sanctions and prohibits providing "services" to the prosecutor's office, punishable by fines or imprisonment. The author, Matthew Smith, argues that this infringes on First Amendment rights and threatens efforts to pursue international justice for crimes against humanity. Smith, with representation from the ACLU, has filed a federal lawsuit challenging the order. The order raises concerns about the administration's commitment to human rights and international law.</p>
