          <p>GE HealthCare exceeded first-quarter earnings expectations, reporting adjusted earnings per share of $1.01 versus the expected 91 cents, and revenue of $4.78 billion against the expected $4.66 billion. However, the company revised its full-year forecast downward, anticipating a significant impact from President Trump's tariff policies. The new forecast estimates adjusted earnings between $3.90 and $4.10 per share, a decrease from the previous guidance, which includes an 85-cent per share reduction due to tariffs. CEO Peter Arduini stated that GE HealthCare is actively taking steps to mitigate the effects of the global trade environment while maintaining strong customer demand and investing in future innovation.</p>

          <p>The NFL has penalized the Atlanta Falcons and assistant coach Jeff Ulbrich following a prank call made to prospective quarterback Shedeur Sanders during the NFL draft by Ulbrich's son. The Falcons were fined $250,000, and Ulbrich was fined $100,000 for failing to prevent the disclosure of confidential team information. Jax Ulbrich, 21, obtained Sanders' number from an unsecured team iPad and posed as the New Orleans Saints general manager during a livestream event, leading Sanders to believe he would be drafted by the Saints.

          <p>The Trump administration plans to reduce its diplomatic presence in Africa, potentially closing nearly 30 embassies and consulates, according to a draft executive decree. This move has raised concerns about a power vacuum that could be filled by countries like China. Appointments of ambassadors have slowed, and key positions in countries like Nigeria and Kenya remain vacant. Budget cuts driven by the Department of Government Efficiency are downsizing the State Department, leading to speculation about the future of US-Africa relations and the extension of the US trade agreement with African countries (AGOA).</p>

          <p>In 1993, 11-year-old Kevin Nazemi persistently called the White House to request an interview with President Bill Clinton for a school project, eventually securing an eight-minute interview. A White House staffer, Dave Anderson, was impressed by Nazemi's determination and helped make the interview happen. The interview became a half-hour special on KOMU, and Nazemi went on to attend MIT and Harvard Business School, founding several startup companies. Years later, Nazemi established college funds for Anderson's children, acknowledging Anderson's profound impact on his life.</p>

          <p>President Trump's policies have created economic chaos, leading to a contraction in the first quarter of the year. While underlying economic growth remained solid, tariffs and uncertainty are expected to cause a further slowdown. The decline was driven by a surge in imports as businesses sought to avoid tariffs, and economists predict that spending and investment will slow in the months ahead. Despite some good news on inflation, concerns about higher prices and a potential recession are growing. The article also notes that the U.S. economy has proven resilient in recent years, but the impact of Trump's policies remains a significant concern.</p>
