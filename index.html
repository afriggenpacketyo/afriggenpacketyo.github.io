            <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) reported first-quarter earnings that surpassed expectations, fueled by strong demand for AI chips, with net income rising 60.3% year-over-year to NT$361.56 billion. High-performance computing, including AI and 5G applications, drove sales, accounting for 59% of total revenue. The company anticipates continued growth in the second quarter, supported by its advanced 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies. However, TSMC faces potential headwinds from U.S. trade policies, including tariffs and export controls, leading the company to invest heavily in diversifying its supply chains, including significant investments in U.S. facilities.

            <p>According to royal experts, King Charles is maintaining a distance from Prince Harry, exacerbated by Harry's legal battle for security in the UK, and also strained by Prince William's reported lack of communication. Harry is reportedly unaware of his father's current health condition, and insiders claim that Harry's letters and calls to his father continue to go unanswered. Experts suggest that the royal family is wary of sharing personal information with Harry due to trust issues and fear of media leaks, leading to a breakdown in communication and reconciliation.</p>

            <p>Instead of focusing on tariffing goods, China is now targeting the American services sector and individual companies as retaliation against U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs. China has widened export controls on rare-earth minerals, opened antitrust probes into American companies like DuPont and Google, and restricted or banned firms from trading with or investing in China through the "unreliable entity" list. Beijing has also reportedly instructed Chinese airlines to halt further Boeing jet deliveries and U.S. aircraft part purchases. These actions signal a strategic shift towards non-tariff measures aimed at inflicting pain on U.S. businesses and accelerating the decoupling of the two economies.</p>

BP's renewed focus on hydrocarbons has also positioned it as a potential takeover target, with Shell, Exxon Mobil, and Chevron mentioned as possible suitors.</p>

This could impact access to spaces like hospital wards and changing rooms, with the updated guidance expected by summer. The new guidance may also affect women's sports, where transgender athlete participation has been a contentious issue.</p>

            <p>The recent market sell-off has left investors wondering if they should buy the dip, with the S&P 500 down approximately 9% year-to-date. The Buffett indicator, which divides the market cap of U.S. stocks by the country's GDP, currently stands around 177%, above the 70%-80% range Buffett considers attractive. While the market may appear cheaper, tensions with China and other uncertainties make the environment risky, so investors should be cautious. It's important to note that the Buffett indicator hasn't been below 100% since 2013, and the U.S. economy and the stock market have changed significantly over the years. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>As Bashar al-Assad's regime crumbled, a private jet was used to transport cash, valuables, and confidential documents out of Syria, orchestrated by his top economic adviser Yasar Ibrahim. The operation involved four flights to the UAE carrying unmarked bags of cash and intelligence about Assad's corporate network. The Embraer Legacy 600 jet, leased from Lebanese businessman Mohamad Wehbe, made the trips before Assad fled to Russia. The new Syrian government is determined to recover these public funds.</p>

            <p>A senior Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) official was found to have breached the organization's ethics code following an investigation into their behavior at a social event. The official, identified as 'AB', reportedly spent an excessive amount of time with a volunteer, causing discomfort among witnesses who feared it could damage the CGF's reputation. While the official denied any inappropriate behavior, the ethics commission chair concluded that the actions created an appearance of impropriety and could bring the Commonwealth Games into disrepute.</p>

            <p>The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office has requested a delay in the Menendez brothers' resentencing hearing pending review of a recently completed parole board assessment. The motion follows a judge's decision against the DA's attempt to withdraw a previous motion favoring reduced sentences. The request stems from Gov. Gavin Newsom's order for a risk assessment as part of a clemency appeal. The DA argues that the court should have the most current risk assessments before making any resentencing decisions in this high profile case.</p>

            <p>Martin Kettle argues that a trade deal with the U.S. under Donald Trump is unlikely to be a major economic boost for the UK, and should be viewed defensively rather than strategically. While a limited deal might protect British trade interests, it is unlikely to drive significant economic growth. Trump's approach to trade is about asserting power and prioritizing U.S. interests, potentially making the UK a loser in the negotiation. Furthermore, any closer alignment with the EU, even modestly, may be seen as a hostile act by Trump's Washington.</p>
