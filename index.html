          <p>A Spirit Airlines pilot has been removed from duty following his arrest at a New Orleans airport on stalking charges originating from Kansas. The 40-year-old pilot is accused of stalking two individuals whose ages are reported to be approximately 12 and 17. He was taken into custody on July 17, later posting a $12,500 bond for his release. Spirit Airlines confirmed the pilot's removal pending an internal investigation, stating the matter was unrelated to his job performance and that a replacement pilot operated the scheduled flight.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study reveals that artificial intelligence models can subliminally pass traits to one another, even when the training data appears harmless. Researchers found that behaviors like bias or ideology can be transmitted between AI systems, particularly within the same model family, without any direct evidence in the shared data. This phenomenon, likened to a contagion, raises significant safety concerns about data poisoning, where bad actors could insert hidden agendas into AI training materials. The findings underscore the need for greater transparency and a deeper understanding of how these complex systems learn and operate.</p>

          <p>A new episode of a documentary released by China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) depicts a simulated, full-scale amphibious assault on Taiwan. The footage shows various military capabilities relevant to such an operation, including paratroopers conducting precision strikes, frogmen seizing infrastructure, and unmanned vehicles breaching beaches. The documentary also highlights joint forces executing maritime blockades, reinforcing Beijing's stance that it considers Taiwan a part of China to be reunified by force if necessary. The release serves as a public display of the PLA's readiness for a cross-strait conflict.</p>

          <p>The Netherlands has become the first NATO ally to announce a purchase of U.S. weapons for Ukraine under a new cost-sharing initiative. The Dutch government will spend €500 million on equipment, including Patriot missile parts, to support Ukraine's defense against Russia. This new mechanism, called the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL), was designed to allow NATO allies to fund U.S. defense systems for Ukraine. The scheme was developed after President Trump conditioned continued U.S. military support on increased financial contributions from other NATO members.</p>

          <p>Recent economic data presents a confusing picture of the U.S. economy, moving from positive GDP figures to weak employment numbers within days. Economist Michael Hiltzik argues that strong GDP growth was distorted by trade effects from President Trump's tariffs, while revised job reports suggest a significant labor market slowdown. The firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner further complicates trust in future data. Long-term projections indicate that ongoing tariffs will create a drag on the economy, disproportionately affecting lower-income households. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed rescinding its 2009 "endangerment finding," a scientific conclusion that greenhouse gases harm human health and welfare. This move would dismantle the legal foundation for nearly all federal climate regulations, including vehicle emissions standards and power plant rules. The proposal argues that U.S. emissions are too small a share of the global total to matter and attacks the scientific consensus on climate change.

As the U.S. imports about 95% of its olive oil, domestic production cannot meet demand, meaning the tariffs will likely impact consumers more than they boost local industry.

          <p>Experts are warning that President Trump's firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, could jeopardize the credibility of U.S. economic data. The dismissal followed a jobs report that was weaker than expected, which Trump baselessly labeled as "rigged." Specialists draw parallels to countries like Argentina and Greece, where political interference with official statistics led to a loss of international trust and severe economic consequences. The move is seen as part of a broader effort to politicize federal agencies, potentially pressuring civil servants to produce data that aligns with a political agenda.</p>

He also played a crucial role in Palestine's historic run in the 2026 World Cup qualifiers.

          <p>A new budget law championed by President Trump will have significant health care consequences, particularly in the 10 states that have refused to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The law imposes new paperwork requirements and cuts funding for navigators, changes that will disproportionately impact non-expansion states like Florida and Texas, which have a higher reliance on ACA marketplace plans. With enhanced federal subsidies for these plans also set to expire, millions could face higher premiums or lose coverage, placing a greater burden on patients and hospitals in these states.

          <p>China's high-speed rail network, the world's largest, is approaching a 50,000-kilometer milestone after nearly two decades of rapid construction. While the system has transformed domestic travel and showcased engineering prowess, analysts are raising concerns about its long-term financial sustainability. Many newer lines are not commercially profitable, and the massive debt accumulated to fund the expansion cannot be ignored. As policymakers prepare the next five-year plan, they face a critical decision on whether to continue expanding the network at the same pace or prioritize freight capacity and address existing financial challenges.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, the city's public defender office stands as a testament to the transformative change that rose from the chaos. The 2005 storm exposed a deeply flawed criminal justice system, where thousands of inmates were lost in the system and legal defense was severely under-resourced. In the years since, visionary lawyers and advocates rebuilt the office from the ground up, securing full-time staff, proper funding, and resources like investigators and social workers. This evolution created a more robust and fair system, ensuring constitutional rights are better protected.</p>

          <p>Republicans in the Texas state legislature have voted to authorize the arrest of dozens of Democratic lawmakers who fled the state to prevent a vote on a contentious redistricting plan. The plan would redraw electoral maps to heavily favor Republicans in future congressional elections. By leaving Texas, the Democrats broke the quorum required for the House to conduct business. Governor Greg Abbott has ordered state troopers to locate and return the absent members, though the arrest warrants are only enforceable within Texas, and most of the lawmakers have traveled to Illinois.</p>

          <p>Republican strategist Karl Rove has cautioned that President Trump's current approval ratings and economic messaging could pose a significant problem for the GOP in the upcoming midterm elections. Rove noted that while Trump maintains strong support among his base, he is losing ground with independent voters who are crucial for electoral success. He argued that the administration is making a "big mistake" by prematurely declaring victory on the economy and inflation, as many Americans are not yet feeling the benefits. This disconnect, he suggests, mirrors a similar error made by the previous administration.</p>
