          <p>Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk, the maker of Wegovy weight-loss medication, announced plans to cut approximately 9,000 jobs, representing 11.5% of its global workforce. This extensive restructuring aims to simplify the organization, accelerate decision-making processes, and strategically reallocate resources towards key growth opportunities in diabetes and obesity treatments. The company expects to incur a one-off cost of 8 billion Danish kroner, which will adjust its full-year operating profit growth forecast. This move, the first major initiative by new CEO Maziar Mike Doustdar, comes as Novo Nordisk navigates intense competition and persistent supply chain issues in the evolving weight-loss drug market, seeking to enhance efficiency and maintain its leadership position.</p>

          <p>British 400m hurdler Seamus Derbyshire, who gained viral fame for his expressive pre-race routines, is poised for the World Championships, championing his commitment to being an "authentic self." After mental health struggles derailed his European and Olympic aspirations in 2024, Derbyshire purposefully changed his mindset towards competing, adopting his now-famous start-line displays. This shift, coupled with new coaching and solo training, has culminated in his most successful season to date, achieving a personal best and qualifying for the prestigious Tokyo event. As one of few openly gay sportsmen, Derbyshire hopes to serve as an inspiration for future athletes, despite encountering some homophobic abuse amidst widespread positive reception.</p>

          <p>Australia has announced a substantial US$1.1 billion investment to procure a fleet of "Ghost Shark" underwater attack drones, significantly bolstering its naval defense capabilities. Defense Minister Richard Marles emphasized Australia's leading role in developing autonomous underwater military technology, with the first domestically produced drones expected by January next year. While the precise number remains undisclosed, "dozens" are slated for deployment within the next five years. This strategic enhancement aims to complement Australia's existing nuclear-powered submarine fleet and is positioned as a critical response to China's growing military presence and expansionist activities in the broader Pacific region.</p>

Notably, South Korea's Kospi index achieved a record high, advancing 1.75% and extending its winning streak to seven consecutive sessions. Shares of Asian tech firms within Apple's supply chain also saw gains following the launch of new iPhones, contributing to the region's overall positive market sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council vehemently condemned Beijing after its warplanes allegedly intimidated a Taiwanese medical evacuation flight, labeling the incident as "irrational" and a grave threat to human lives. Officials asserted that this maneuver undermines humanitarian rescue operations and compromises flight safety in the region. Taiwan believes this encounter signifies a new pattern of "aerial grey-zone harassment" by the People's Liberation Army, designed to assert its jurisdiction over the Taiwan Strait's airspace and test Taiwan's military responses. The council demanded an immediate cessation of such provocations, underscoring a blatant disregard for universal values and human life.</p>

          <p>A recent survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai indicates a record-low optimism among US businesses regarding their five-year outlook in China, with only 41% expressing positive sentiment. This unprecedented pessimism, now in its fourth consecutive year, is primarily attributed to rising geopolitical uncertainties between the US and China, intensified competition from innovative Chinese companies, and a persistent economic slowdown. The article highlights how the business environment has significantly changed from previous decades, making it harder for multinational firms to replicate strategies.

Commuters across the capital have been forced to rely on alternative transport methods, including boats, bikes, and buses, facing significant travel challenges.

This "tipping point" is primarily attributed to increasingly unhealthy food environments, where ultra-processed and fast foods are replacing nutritious options, adversely affecting children's growth and cognitive development. UNICEF advocates for comprehensive measures, including improved food labeling, marketing restrictions, and banning junk food in schools, to address this escalating public health crisis.</p>

          <p>A record 47% of US businesses have redirected planned investments from China to other regions over the past year, according to the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai. Southeast Asia emerged as the primary alternative destination, followed by the Indian subcontinent, with the US and Mexico tied for third. This significant shift is occurring amidst escalating US-China trade tensions, tariffs, and increased domestic market competition in China. While some tariffs have seen temporary rollbacks, businesses require greater long-term certainty for supply chain planning. The survey also highlighted concerns about China's economic slowdown and the rapid advancements of Chinese competitors, particularly in AI. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australia has officially approved a groundbreaking vaccine designed to combat the rampant chlamydia epidemic devastating its endangered koala populations, marking a pivotal moment for conservation. Developed by University of the Sunshine Coast scientists over a decade, the single-dose jab has demonstrated a significant reduction in symptom development and mortality by at least 65% in wild koalas. Chlamydia, a distinct strain from human variants, causes painful infections, blindness, infertility, and is often fatal for koalas, contributing to up to 50% of deaths. While the vaccine offers immense hope, scientists emphasize that critical issues like habitat loss must also be addressed for the species' long-term survival.</p>

          <p>Hamas has claimed that its negotiating team survived an Israeli airstrike in Qatar's capital, Doha, but confirmed the deaths of five members, including Khalil al-Hayya's son. The group asserted that the attack, which severely damaged a residential compound, was an assassination attempt targeting negotiators discussing a US ceasefire proposal. Israeli Prime Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended the strike as "fully justified," aiming at senior Hamas leaders responsible for the October 7, 2023, attack. Qatar condemned the incident as a "cowardly" violation of international law, while the White House, though calling it "unfortunate," supported the goal of eliminating Hamas.</p>

The whistleblowers claimed Meta lawyers influenced internal research and instructed researchers to erase evidence of sexual assault risks on these platforms. One researcher specifically identified coordinated pedophile rings exploiting Roblox within Meta's VR environment, using in-app currency to pay children. Meta vehemently denies these allegations, labeling them "nonsense" and based on selectively leaked documents, while Roblox also strongly disputed the claims, emphasizing its commitment to user safety.</p>

          <p>Plans to distribute the remaining £25 million fortune of the disgraced evangelical sect, the Jesus Army, are facing intense criticism as alleged child abusers could potentially receive larger payments than their victims. The organization, which disbanded in 2020, previously provided £7.7 million in compensation to 601 abuse survivors through a redress scheme, primarily funded by insurers. Survivors have condemned the new proposals, which would benefit 172 loyal members, as "sickening," arguing that the majority of the remaining funds should be allocated to victims.
