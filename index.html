          <h2>Porsche Shares Decline Following Announcement of Electric Vehicle Rollout Delays</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-23 02:49:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Porsche's stock tumbled over 7% after the luxury carmaker disclosed delays in its electric vehicle (EV) rollout, which is projected to significantly dent its 2025 earnings. The German firm is strategically slowing its EV push due to weakening global demand and intense competition from Chinese rivals, opting to extend production of iconic combustion engine models well into the 2030s. Challenges cited include US import tariffs, a downturn in the Chinese luxury market, and the slower-than-anticipated ramp-up of electric mobility. This shift, including an upcoming SUV line launching with hybrid options instead of fully electric, underscores the broader difficulties European manufacturers face in navigating the complex and competitive EV transition.</p>

          <p>Five teenagers, including two females and three males aged 15 to 17, were wounded in a shooting at an El Paso apartment complex on Monday night. Law enforcement officials reported that a male suspect began firing into a crowd in an outdoor area, where a fight appeared imminent. One victim sustained potentially life-threatening injuries, while the others received non-life-threatening wounds, all requiring hospitalization. A 15-year-old has been taken into custody in connection with the incident, though authorities have not yet definitively determined if he is the shooter. This distressing event, occurring near the U.S.-Mexico border, underscores ongoing concerns about youth violence.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are poised for a broadly higher open on Tuesday, mirroring a significant rally on Wall Street that propelled all three major U.S. indexes to record highs. This positive sentiment was partly fueled by chipmaking giant Nvidia's announcement of a substantial $100 billion investment in OpenAI to build data centers, a partnership CEO Jensen Huang labeled "a giant project." Global investors are also closely monitoring developments in Sino-U.S. relations, with the U.S. Ambassador to China suggesting a highly anticipated meeting between Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping is more likely in early 2026. Upcoming economic data from Germany, the UK, and Spain will further influence European trading. (not investment advice)</p>

This trend signals a significant reopening of financial channels that had slammed shut during China's unprecedented property crisis and economic slowdown. Companies can now refinance at more palatable terms, potentially rebuilding trust in sectors global investors had deemed untouchable. The resurgence reflects a changing interest-rate environment and renewed global investor appetite for Chinese debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger have collectively declared their immediate withdrawal from the International Criminal Court (ICC), effective one year after notifying the UN. In a joint statement, the military-led West African states criticized the ICC as an "instrument of neocolonial repression" and accused it of selective justice, noting that all but one of its 33 cases involved an African country. They asserted the court's incapacity to prosecute war crimes and announced plans to establish "indigenous mechanisms for peace and justice." This move follows their earlier withdrawal from ECOWAS and aligns with their pivot towards Russia for military cooperation.</p>

Coaches are now emphasizing set-pieces, direct long balls to tall strikers, and even observing games from the stands for a better overview, strategies Allardyce pioneered decades ago. This strategic shift moves away from strict possession-based play, with teams like Manchester United and Manchester City reconsidering goalkeepers' footwork. Allardyce notes that giving the ball away in one's own half is statistically more damaging, suggesting a return to more "sensible" and effective use of team skills to maximize player strengths.</p>

This development further disadvantages U.S. farmers, who are already largely excluded from the crucial Chinese market due to ongoing trade tensions and low prices. The deals for fourth-quarter shipments underscore China's strategic shift to South American suppliers, as U.S.-China trade talks remain unresolved. Analysts suggest the immediate impact might be short-lived due to Argentina's limited overall supply and the temporary nature of the tax break, but it highlights persistent trade friction.

Israel vehemently denies these accusations, calling them antisemitic and asserting adherence to international law, while pointing to Hamas's October 7th attack as a genocidal act. The article details the definition of genocide and the differing views from various international bodies, academics, and rights groups, including Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez. South Africa has brought a case against Israel at the International Court of Justice, though a final ruling could take years and the court lacks enforcement power.</p>

          <p>British-Egyptian activist Alaa Abdel Fattah has been released from prison and reunited with his family after nearly six years of imprisonment in Egypt, marking a significant development for human rights advocates. A prominent political prisoner, he was pardoned by President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi following a request from the National Council for Human Rights. Abdel Fattah, 43, was arrested in 2019 and sentenced for "spreading false news." His release, though overdue according to his family, follows extensive hunger strikes by his mother and widespread international support. It remains unclear if he will be able to travel to the UK to join his son.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes Europe's precarious geopolitical position, caught between an unpredictable U.S. and an assertive China, with its relationship with Washington increasingly unmoored. Europe's China policy, once aligned with the U.S., now faces complex dilemmas regarding trade protectionism, technology dependence, and climate ambitions. The piece highlights two core challenges: the rise of illiberal forces within Europe, potentially inspired by China's authoritarian success, and China's practical alignment with Russia in the Ukraine war. It concludes that Europe cannot afford to confront both Russia and China simultaneously without reliable U.S. support, underscoring a complex and vulnerable strategic outlook for the continent.</p>

          <p>Zheng Yongnian, Dean of the School of Public Policy at Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, advocates for China to create a unique foreign relations knowledge system, distinct from prevailing Western concepts. Published in People's Daily, this argument emphasizes intellectual autonomy as crucial for Beijing's global influence and aligns with its recently introduced Global Governance Initiative (GGI). Zheng believes a China-centric framework would more effectively explain China's foreign policy and global role to the world, moving beyond Western-dominated theories like realism, liberalism, and constructivism that have long shaped the understanding of international relations.</p>

          <p>A 33-year-old man, Jacob Samuel Winkler, has been arrested and charged with a felony for allegedly shining a laser pointer at Marine One, the presidential helicopter carrying President Trump. The incident occurred shortly after the helicopter departed the White House, posing a significant risk of temporarily blinding or disorienting the pilot, which could lead to an airborne collision. Winkler reportedly told investigators he points the laser at "all kinds of things" and was unaware of the prohibition against aiming it at Marine One. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro emphasized that such behavior endangers those aboard and will be fully prosecuted.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Gabrielle has intensified into a major Category 4 storm, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. Its center is expected to pass east of Bermuda on Monday night, with no watches or warnings currently issued for the island, though the Azores are advised to monitor its progress closely. Packing maximum sustained winds of 140 mph, Gabrielle is generating swells forecast to reach the East Coast from North Carolina northward to Atlantic Canada through the early part of this week, likely causing life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. This season has been quieter than initially predicted by NOAA.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump, alongside Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr., announced that pregnant women should avoid Tylenol (paracetamol) due to a disputed link with autism. Trump claimed the drug "is no good" for pregnant women, advocating its use only for extreme fever. Kenvue, Tylenol's maker, strongly refutes any autism link, asserting its safety and warning of health risks from avoiding it. The FDA is expected to issue a physicians' notice and initiate a safety label change, while also potentially approving Leucovorin, a decades-old drug, for autism treatment, based on early-stage, cautious research.</p>

          <p>This article critically analyzes Stephen Miller's eulogy for Charlie Kirk, describing it as a "battle cry" for the Trump administration's war on perceived foes. Miller's speech, delivered after Kirk's assassination, depicted opponents as "wickedness" and "nothing," contrasting sharply with Barack Obama's call for reconciliation after a similar tragedy. The article highlights Miller's "proud insistence" on holding enemies to standards he disregards, accusing him of Manichean rhetoric that seeks to subjugate rather than unite. It questions the premise that Kirk's murder "awakened" Miller's desire for retribution, suggesting it merely provided a convenient pretext for existing animosity and a push for political dominance.</p>

          <p>Writer Jack Thorne has commended the "remarkable" journalists who uncovered the phone hacking scandal, ahead of ITV's new drama "The Hack." The series stars David Tennant as Nick Davies, the Guardian reporter who exposed extensive hacking at the News of the World. Thorne notes that the story goes beyond mere journalistic misconduct, revealing a troubling relationship between the press, politics, and police. He contrasts this with the Post Office Horizon IT scandal, where journalism struggled for traction, emphasizing the bravery of those who held their own industry accountable, a feat he describes as "quite remarkable" for its impact on media ethics.</p>

          <p>China has decisively rejected Nvidia's B40-series chips, stripped-down versions designed to comply with U.S. export restrictions, viewing their acceptance as an endorsement of technological inferiority. Regulators have reportedly ordered leading technology companies to halt purchases and launched antitrust investigations into Nvidia, citing potential safety and security risks. This move signals a significant turning point, as Beijing prioritizes indigenous innovation and technological independence over reliance on American suppliers. The U.S. policy of allowing watered-down chips inadvertently strengthened calls within China for self-sufficiency, transforming what was once considered a distant dream into a national necessity in the ongoing tech rivalry.</p>

          <p>France has formally recognized a Palestinian state, joining a wave of countries taking this diplomatic step, with President Emmanuel Macron stating "the time for peace has come" at the UN. This move intensifies international pressure on Israel regarding the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and continued settlement building in the West Bank. The U.S., Germany, and Italy were notably absent from a French-Saudi summit on a two-state solution. Israel views such recognition as rewarding Hamas for its October 7th attack. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the Gaza situation "morally, legally and politically intolerable," reaffirming a two-state solution as the "only credible path" to lasting peace.</p>

Trump explicitly stated his advice was based on "what I feel," bypassing normal research processes.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the common experience of decreased sex drive after childbirth, a phenomenon many new mothers, like reality TV star Holly Hagan-Blyth, encounter. Sex and relationship therapist Rachel Gold notes that the six-week postnatal check often creates a false expectation for intimacy to resume. Physical factors like drastic hormonal shifts (estrogen and progesterone drop), healing from birth, and emotional challenges of fatherhood for partners contribute to this decline. Experts emphasize open communication between partners and acknowledging that such changes are normal and not personal, providing reassurance and guidance for couples navigating this sensitive and often overlooked period.</p>
