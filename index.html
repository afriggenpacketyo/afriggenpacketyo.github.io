          <p>Following a deadly explosion that killed three Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies, authorities have revealed that one of two recovered grenades is now missing. The blast occurred at a training facility after deputies, believing the devices were inert, held them overnight. An extensive search is underway for the second grenade, which investigators believe was brought to the facility and not lost in transit. The sheriff's department has updated its policies to treat all explosive devices as live and has temporarily suspended its bomb squad operations, relying on LAPD for assistance while the investigation continues.</p>

          <p>While visiting Scotland, President Donald Trump addressed ongoing questions regarding his connections to Jeffrey Epstein and the Justice Department's interviews with Ghislaine Maxwell. Trump dismissed the controversy as "not a big thing" and stated he was not closely following the developments. When asked about the possibility of a pardon or clemency for Maxwell, he indicated that it was not the appropriate time to discuss such matters. His comments come as his administration faces scrutiny over the handling and potential release of files related to the Epstein case.</p>

          <p>A family has filed a lawsuit against two funeral homes for negligently mishandling human remains and inflicting severe emotional distress. The parents of the deceased received their son's brain in an unlabeled, leaking box that they transported in their car for several days before discovering its horrifying contents. The lawsuit alleges that one funeral home improperly shipped the biohazardous material, while the other failed to verify the contents before handing them over. The family is seeking compensation and answers, stating they still do not know if their son's brain was ultimately buried with his body.</p>

          <p>Despite CEO Elon Musk's recent announcements about expanding Tesla's robotaxi service, California regulators have clarified the company's limitations within the state. The California Public Utilities Commission stated that Tesla is not authorized to operate autonomous vehicles for public transport, with or without payment, and any service must include a human driver. This comes as Tesla notified the state of its plans to offer a "friends and family" car service in the Bay Area. The distinction highlights the regulatory hurdles Tesla faces in deploying its "Full Self-Driving" technology for ride-hailing, a market where competitors like Waymo have already secured driverless permits.</p>

          <p>Inter Miami's owner, Jorge Mas, has publicly criticized Major League Soccer for its "draconian" decision to suspend star player Lionel Messi for one game. The suspension was enacted after Messi, along with teammate Jordi Alba, missed the MLS All-Star game, citing a need for rest. According to league rules, players who skip the event without prior approval are ineligible for their club's next match. Mas argued that the punishment is unfair, especially considering the league's scheduling, while MLS Commissioner Don Garber defended the enforcement of the long-standing policy but agreed to reevaluate it in the future.</p>

          <p>Disgraced former New York Congressman George Santos has surrendered to a federal correctional facility in New Jersey, commencing a more than seven-year prison sentence. He pleaded guilty to federal wire fraud and identity theft charges after admitting he fabricated large parts of his life story to defraud voters and donors. Prosecutors detailed how he used campaign funds for personal enrichment, including luxury goods and Botox, while presenting false financial disclosures to Congress. Following his sentencing, Santos publicly appealed on social media to President Trump for a future pardon, framing his sentence as politically motivated, although the White House has declined to comment.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has experienced a significant increase in certain insect populations, such as ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps, following the warmest and sunniest spring on record. The boom is partly attributed to a surge in aphids, a primary food source, which thrived in the warm conditions. However, experts express concern that the relative lack of rain could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year by affecting egg-laying and drying out wetlands. This short-term boom contrasts with long-term research suggesting a general decline in the UK's overall flying insect population, highlighting the complex effects of changing weather patterns.</p>

          <p>An Illinois federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration that challenged Chicago's sanctuary city policies. The lawsuit, filed in February, argued that the city's ordinance illegally restricts local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration agents and sharing information. In her ruling, Judge Lindsay Jenkins granted the city's motion to dismiss the case. Chicago's mayor and Illinois's governor both praised the decision, affirming that the city's welcoming ordinance is lawful and enhances public safety by allowing police to focus on local needs rather than federal immigration enforcement, which they termed a reckless and inhumane agenda.</p>

The exhibit focuses on the "Hollywood Ten," a group of writers and directors who were imprisoned and blacklisted for refusing to answer the committee's questions. It details the immense pressure on creatives to "name names" to save their careers, a chilling period that impacted not only famous figures but also many ordinary Americans.

Maxwell's attorney confirmed she answered every question about roughly 100 different people but stated no deals have been made.

          <p>Wildlife biologists in Texas are undertaking a significant conservation effort to save the state's bighorn sheep population, which has been decimated by disease over the last five years. The disease, spread by non-native animals, wiped out about half of the native sheep. In a rescue mission, biologists captured dozens of healthy sheep from the last disease-free herd and airlifted them over 200 miles to an isolated, safe mountain range. A recent follow-up revealed the relocated herd is not only surviving but also growing, with newborn lambs spotted, offering a sign of hope for the species' future in the region.</p>

Experts worry this approach raises questions about Maxwell's credibility, as she is likely desperate for a reduced sentence, and makes it difficult to assess the truthfulness of her information.

          <p>As Palestinians in Gaza face a deepening starvation crisis, a BBC Verify analysis of aid boxes from the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has raised concerns about their nutritional value. The boxes primarily contain dried goods like pasta and lentils, which require scarce water and fuel to prepare. Nutrition experts who reviewed the contents stated that while the boxes provide calories for survival, they are critically deficient in essential vitamins and minerals like iron, calcium, and vitamin C. Prolonged consumption of this diet could lead to serious health problems and "hidden hunger," highlighting a major flaw in the aid being provided to the besieged population.</p>

          <p>In a modern twist on civic duty, the U.S. Treasury Department is now allowing Americans to make contributions to pay down the national debt via the mobile payment app Venmo. This new, youth-friendly payment option has been added to the government's long-standing "Gifts to Reduce the Public Debt" program, which also accepts payments through methods like PayPal and credit cards. The national debt currently stands at over $36 trillion and has grown annually since 2001. While public contributions since 1996 have totaled over $67 million, this amount covers only about 20 minutes of the federal government's total spending.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, sentenced to life without parole for the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students, is expected to serve his time at the Idaho Maximum Security Institution (IMSI). The facility is the state's only maximum security prison and has a reputation for harsh conditions, violence, and inadequate mental health care. IMSI houses Idaho's most notorious inmates, including all of its male death row prisoners, such as serial killer Thomas Creech and "Doomsday mom" Lori Vallow's husband, Chad Daybell. Recently released police files offer a glimpse into Kohberger's behavior in county jail, where he was described by an inmate as a "weirdo."</p>

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight from Burbank to Las Vegas took a dramatic dive shortly after takeoff to avoid a potential mid-air collision with a privately owned fighter jet.

Passengers described a terrifying free-fall experience before the pilot announced they had to avoid another aircraft. The flight landed safely in Las Vegas, but the Federal Aviation Administration has launched an investigation into the incident to determine how the two planes came into such close proximity.</p>

          <p>Twenty-five years after its debut, reality television may have a more positive impact on society than its critics suggest, according to some sociologists and psychologists. The genre has historically been more demographically diverse than other media, offering viewers a glimpse into different social landscapes and perspectives. This exposure can help build social understanding and even overcome biases. By showing raw, unfiltered emotions and tackling controversial subjects like coercive control, reality TV can spark national conversations and help viewers feel less isolated in their own experiences, despite the ethical concerns surrounding the welfare of its participants, which are now being addressed by regulators.</p>

          <p>Upon landing in Scotland for a five-day trip, President Donald Trump issued a stark warning to Europe regarding its immigration policies. He told reporters that Europe must "get its act together" on the issue, claiming that what he described as an "invasion" was "killing Europe." The comments came as he arrived for a visit that mixes business with diplomacy, including the opening of a new golf course and meetings with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Trump's visit has drawn criticism over costs and potential conflicts of interest, with protests planned in several Scottish cities.</p>

The clashes, which have involved heavy weapons, have killed at least 16 people and displaced tens of thousands on both sides. Thailand has declared martial law in border districts and accused Cambodia of firing into civilian areas, an allegation Cambodia denies while accusing Thailand of using banned cluster munitions. The conflict stems from a century-old border dispute, and despite offers of mediation from international bodies, Thailand has so far stated there is no need for third-party involvement.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers from Texas met with California Governor Gavin Newsom to strategize against what they call Republican efforts to "rig" the 2026 midterm elections. The meeting comes as Texas Republicans, at President Trump's urging, pursue redistricting to gain more congressional seats. In response, Newsom is exploring options to redraw California's own congressional maps to favor Democrats, a move that would counter the state's nonpartisan redistricting process. The Texas Democrats pledged to use every available tool to fight the redistricting in their state, which they argue will illegally dilute the power of minority voters.</p>

          <p>A global craze for matcha, the powdered Japanese green tea, is causing soaring demand that suppliers are struggling to meet. Fueled by social media trends and a post-pandemic tourism boom in Japan, the demand has led to shortages and rising prices. The situation is exacerbated by poor harvests in Japan due to record heatwaves and a 15% U.S. tariff on Japanese products. Retailers in Japan are limiting customer purchases, and tea masters report significant price increases. The shortages have sparked a movement for more mindful consumption, urging people to savor high-grade matcha rather than using it in recipes where its delicate flavor is lost.</p>

The population, already weakened by 21 months of war and inadequate nutrition, is now facing a near-total blockade of effective aid, with the current distribution model being dangerously insufficient. The analysis explains that famine's momentum means people will die not just from hunger but also from preventable diseases their bodies can no longer fight.

An analysis explores the multi-million dollar ecosystem behind the genre, which often mirrors mainstream styles but without "objectionable content." Experts note the rise of a "barstool conversion rock" sound, blending masculinity, conservative politics, and country music. The economic engine of megachurches, which provides plug-and-play resources for smaller churches to replicate their worship experience, is a major driver of this trend, raising questions about what this faith-flavored boom says about the current cultural and political moment.</p>

The move to withhold the funds triggered widespread outrage from educators and a rare pushback from ten Republican senators, including Mitch McConnell. They argued the freeze denied states the ability to support students and families with long-standing, bipartisan programs, ultimately leading to the administration's reversal.</p>
