          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Economists are concerned that Donald Trump's proposed tariffs could lead to corporate profiteering, with companies using tariffs as an excuse to raise prices beyond actual cost increases. This "greedflation" phenomenon could see businesses inflating prices to boost profits, even on goods not directly affected by tariffs. While some argue tariffs could benefit US manufacturers, others warn of significant consumer price increases, potentially offsetting any economic gains. The potential for tariffs to reignite inflation is a major concern, particularly as consumer expectations of rising prices could become a self-fulfilling prophecy. (not investment advice)</p>

Museums are instructed to represent China as diverse yet unified, respecting and accommodating cultural differences, aligning with Beijing's broader efforts to foster a sense of community within the nation.</p>

The Houthi-led government condemned the attack as a war crime, asserting that the terminal was a civilian facility, and warned of consequences for the US escalation in the Red Sea. The strikes have sparked condemnation and raised concerns about the ongoing conflict's impact on civilians.</p>

            <p>Following Harvard University's public rejection of a series of authoritarian demands from the Trump administration, a top official reportedly made a frantic attempt to claim the letter was sent in error. The demands included discontinuing diversity efforts, limiting student protests, and installing right-wing faculty. Harvard President Alan Garber condemned the demands as an infringement on the university's independence and constitutional rights. Despite the alleged retraction attempt, the administration has since escalated the situation by freezing Harvard's public funding and considering revoking its tax-exempt status.</p>

The ACLU argues that the Trump administration is preparing to deport dozens of men, potentially to El Salvador's notorious mega-prison, without due process. This action follows a previous Supreme Court ruling allowing deportations to resume, provided immigrants have a chance to challenge their cases.

            <p>Donald Trump has stated that the US will "take a pass" on brokering further Russia-Ukraine talks if Moscow or Kyiv impede progress towards a peace deal. His comments followed warnings from Secretary of State Marco Rubio that the US would abandon talks without clear signs of progress. Despite the Trump administration's initial confidence, attempts to secure a ceasefire have not materialized, with Washington blaming both sides for the lack of progress.</p>

The order does not rule in either way on the merits of Boasberg’s inquiry, however, and merely gives the petitioners in the case a deadline of April 23 by 5 p.m. to file their reply to the government.</p>

            <p>US bond markets are being closely watched due to recent volatility sparked by trade tariffs, with investors losing confidence in the US economy. The rate the US government had to pay on its bonds rose sharply, while the price of bonds themselves fell. The uncertainty over the impact of tariffs on the US economy led to investors no longer seeing government bonds as such a safe bet, so demanded bigger returns to buy them. This could affect public spending and household finances, potentially leading to economic slowdown and job losses. (not investment advice)</p>
