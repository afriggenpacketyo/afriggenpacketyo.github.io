          <p>Sean Stein, president of the US-China Business Council, outlines the precarious situation for American businesses operating in China. He notes that while a recent 90-day pause in tariff escalations is likely to be extended, the business community remains concerned that bilateral discussions are overly focused on tariffs rather than broader trade issues. Stein suggests that China's recent move to restrict fentanyl precursors could pave a path toward a more normal trade relationship, but this depends on reciprocal actions from the United States, which have not yet materialized.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man in Westbury, New York, has died after being fatally drawn into a running MRI machine by a heavy metallic necklace he was wearing. The man had reportedly entered the MRI room without permission at the request of his wife, who had just completed a scan and needed help. The powerful magnetic field pulled him into the machine, resulting in a fatal "medical episode." This tragic incident highlights the stringent safety protocols required around MRI machines, which can turn any magnetic metal objects into dangerous projectiles.</p>

          <p>England defender Lucy Bronze has stated that online abuse targeting female football players is increasing as the sport's popularity grows. Her comments follow teammate Jess Carter's revelation of receiving racist messages during the Euro 2025 tournament, prompting a police investigation. Bronze noted that while men's football sees more abuse in stadiums, women's football is a significant target online. The Lionesses squad is addressing the issue, calling for social media platforms to implement stronger accountability measures to combat the hate.</p>

          <p>A nine-year-old girl from Canada was found dead in upstate New York after her father had falsely reported her kidnapped, leading to an Amber Alert. The body of Melina Galanis Frattolin was discovered near Ticonderoga, about 15 miles from where her father claimed she was abducted. Authorities stated they found inconsistencies in the father's account and that there was no indication an abduction occurred. The investigation is now focused on the father, 45-year-old Luciano Frattolin, as a person of interest in his daughter's death.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's ruling coalition has lost its majority in the upper house of parliament following a recent election. This defeat adds to their minority status in the lower house, marking the first time the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has lacked a majority in both houses since 1955. Despite the setback, driven by public discontent over inflation and scandals, Ishiba has vowed to remain in office to manage critical trade negotiations with the United States.

          <p>An opinion piece suggests that Australia may be sabotaging its own efforts to improve diplomatic and economic ties with China. While Chinese media highlighted the positive aspects of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's recent visit, some Australian media and opposition figures were critical, creating mixed signals. The author argues that despite some progress, actions like the potential forced sale of the Chinese-leased Darwin Port undermine the goal of presenting Australia as a reliable investment partner.

In a social media post, Trump called the story "untruthful," asserting, "People don't explain to me, I explain to them!" The denial comes amid escalating criticism of Powell by some Trump allies, though removing a Fed chair pre-emptively would be an unprecedented and legally contentious action.

          <p>Bedouin fighters near the southern Syrian city of Suweida are observing a fragile ceasefire with the local Druze community following a week of deadly sectarian clashes. The fighting, which also involved government forces and Israeli air strikes, has displaced over 128,000 people and killed more than 1,120. Bedouin leaders told the BBC they have retreated but demand the release of their injured members from the city, warning they will re-enter if the agreement is not honored. The conflict underscores the deep-seated tensions and complex dynamics in the region.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to block a deal for the Washington Commanders to build a new stadium in Washington, D.C., unless the NFL team changes its name back to the "Washington Redskins." In a series of social media posts, Trump called for the immediate restoration of the former name, which was dropped in 2020 due to its perception as a slur against Native Americans. The proposed stadium site is on federal land, giving the president potential leverage over the deal. Trump also urged baseball's Cleveland Guardians to revert to their former "Indians" name.</p>

The city of Kerrville reported that a massive, coordinated effort by thousands of officials helped verify that most of the missing individuals were safe. Efforts are now focused on reuniting these individuals with their families and continuing the search for the remaining three.</p>

          <p>A fire that broke out on the KMII Barcelona ferry off the coast of Indonesia's Sulawesi Island has resulted in at least five deaths, including a pregnant woman. The vessel was carrying hundreds of passengers when the blaze started, forcing many to jump into the sea to escape. Rescue efforts involving the navy, coast guard, and local fishermen have so far evacuated 284 passengers and crew members. The incident highlights the frequent marine accidents in Indonesia, an archipelago nation where ferry travel is common but often hampered by poor safety standards.</p>

          <p>Author Michael Wolff, who had extensive access to the Trump White House for his book "Fire and Fury," has commented on the physical appearance of the president's female staffers. In a podcast interview, Wolff observed that many of these women, past and present, share a similar look: long hair, skirts above the knee, and high boots. He went further to state that many of them, including figures like Hope Hicks and Alina Habba, "look like Melania." Wolff also suggested that these staffers were not always qualified for their prominent roles within the administration.</p>

The deadliest incident occurred in northern Gaza, where at least 81 people were killed near a UN World Food Programme truck convoy.

The Israel Defense Forces stated its troops fired warning shots to remove an "immediate threat" and that its initial review does not align with the reported number of casualties.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has confirmed that August 1 is a "hard deadline" for new U.S. tariffs to take effect on imported goods. Speaking on CBS News, Lutnick stated that while countries can continue negotiations after this date, they will begin paying the new rates on August 1. He specified that many smaller nations in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Africa will face a baseline tariff of 10 percent. However, larger economies will either have to open their markets to U.S. goods or face higher tariffs as part of the Trump administration's strategy. (not investment advice)</p>
