          <p>A maintenance worker at a New Orleans jail, Sterling Williams, has been arrested for allegedly aiding 10 inmates in their escape. According to court documents, Williams claimed he was threatened by an inmate to turn off the water in a cell, which was crucial for the escape plan involving removing a toilet from the wall. Williams' attorney asserts his client is innocent, stating that he was simply performing his job duties when asked by a deputy to check an overflowing toilet. The inmates escaped on Friday, and investigations revealed they sawed through steel bars behind the toilet and fled through a loading dock, highlighting security lapses at the facility. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's plan to fund his second-term agenda with a comprehensive bill is facing challenges due to disagreements over the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction. The SALT deduction allows taxpayers to itemize state and local taxes, benefiting residents of high-tax states like New York, New Jersey, and California. Trump's 2017 tax law capped the SALT deduction at $10,000, causing divisions among Republicans, with some advocating for an increase and others opposing it due to concerns about subsidizing blue states. Despite Trump's pledge to end the cap, the issue remains a sticking point in Republican infighting over the bill.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines will implement a new policy requiring passengers to keep battery packs and portable charging devices visible during flights, effective May 28, as a safety precaution to quickly address potential fires. The airline emphasized that safety is their top priority and this measure aims to mitigate risks associated with lithium-ion batteries, which can overheat and cause fires. The FAA already prohibits spare lithium-ion batteries in checked bags, but Southwest's policy further mandates that these devices be removed from carry-on bags and remain in plain sight when in use, prohibiting charging in overhead bins.</p>

          <p>State Farm General is pursuing an additional 11% rate increase for homeowners policies in California, following a recently approved 17% emergency interim hike. The company says these increases are necessary due to "severe capital depletion", especially after the Los Angeles County wildfires.

The California Department of Insurance has scheduled a rate hearing to examine the request, emphasizing that all rates must be justified to protect consumers from overpaying.</p>

          <p>Freedom Debt Relief, founded in 2002, is a debt settlement company that negotiates with creditors to reduce total debt in exchange for lump-sum payments. The process involves a free debt evaluation, setting up a dedicated FDIC-insured account, negotiation with creditors, and approval and payment upon reaching a settlement. Fees range from 15% to 25% of the total enrolled debt, and the program typically spans 24 to 48 months. While it can substantially reduce debt, it may also severely damage credit scores and involves considerable costs; it should be viewed as a serious financial intervention and not a quick fix.</p>

          <p>Oklahoma has made significant strides in cleaning up its streams by implementing a simple solution: keeping cows out of the water. Farmer Grant Victor fenced off his cattle from Horse Creek, which runs through his land, and quickly observed positive results such as reduced veterinarian bills and the return of wildlife. As a result of practices like these, approximately 100 streams in Oklahoma, previously polluted by farmland runoff, have been restored to health, more than any other state according to the EPA. This initiative demonstrates how straightforward conservation efforts can lead to substantial environmental improvements.</p>

You don't necessarily have to pay today's top price, as fractional gold offers a lower entry point. While gold prices fluctuate, they generally increase over time, so it may be beneficial to invest sooner rather than later. Keep them as a small but healthy portion of a diversified portfolio to better ensure long-term investing success. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stocks closed significantly lower on Wednesday as bond yields surged amid concerns over deficit spending related to a tax cut bill in the House. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 817 points, or 1.9%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also declined. The bond sell-off, driven by the Congressional Budget Office's finding that Trump's tax policies would add $3.8 trillion to the national debt, raised borrowing costs and sparked investor fears about the economic impact. The 10-year Treasury yield jumped to its highest level since February, further pressuring the market.</p>

          <p>Federal food assistance under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) may face cuts of about 30% under the terms of the proposed tax bill. According to Ty Jones Cox, vice president for food assistance policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, this would be the "biggest cut in the program's history." The proposed cuts would largely happen by expanding work requirements to qualify for benefits and by cutting federal funding for food benefits and administration, leaving it up to states to make up the difference. These cuts come amid rising food costs and potential recession risks.</p>

The initiative would have multiple layers that expand on what the U.S. already has and build new programs to counter the full range of aerial threats, according to Gen. Gregory Guillot.

Credit card debt forgiveness may sound like the easiest and most dramatic solution to your credit card debt problem … but is it the most appropriate one? In many instances, it may not be. Also, be sure you meet the qualifications for debt relief.
