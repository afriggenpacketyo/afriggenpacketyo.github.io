          <p>Norway's $1.8 trillion sovereign wealth fund faces pressure to lift its ban on investing in weapons manufacturers.  Opposition parties argue the ban is illogical given the current global security climate, particularly citing Russia's invasion of Ukraine and China's military buildup.  The Conservative party emphasizes the need for increased Western defense investment, while the finance ministry remains noncommittal. This highlights the tension between ethical investment principles and national security concerns.</p>
