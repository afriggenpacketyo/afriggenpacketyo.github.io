          <p>Shares of Kering, the French fashion house owning Gucci and Saint Laurent, experienced a 7% surge following reports that Renault's CEO, Luca de Meo, is expected to become the group's new CEO. De Meo's potential appointment is viewed as a strategic move to revitalize Kering's brands, particularly Gucci, which has seen a decline in popularity. Analysts believe de Meo's brand management and marketing skills align well with the luxury industry's needs, citing his successful turnaround of Renault, however, some experts suggest that turning around luxury brands is complex, costly, and requires significant investment, and if such revenue and cash flow for the group is achieved, it could result in significant multiple re-rating. Kering's shares have fallen over 60% in the last two years due to profit warnings and designer changes at Gucci.</p>

          <p>Iran launched a barrage of missiles at Israel, resulting in at least five deaths and numerous injuries, marking the fourth day of escalating conflict between the two nations. One missile landed near the American consulate in Tel Aviv, causing minor damage, while Israel responded with airstrikes on Iranian command centers in Tehran. Israeli Defense Minister warned that Tehran's residents would "pay the price" for the attacks on Israeli civilians, while Iran vowed further retaliation for Israeli attacks on its military and nuclear infrastructure. The fighting has led to the cancellation of talks on Iran's nuclear program, and the U.S. State Department issued a directive emphasizing its non-involvement in Israel's actions. The conflict has resulted in a rising death toll on both sides, with concerns over further escalation and regional stability.</p>

          <p>Researchers have tracked a plumed egret flying non-stop for 38 hours between Australia and Papua New Guinea during its northern migration. The Australian scientists used GPS to follow eight plumed egrets and 10 great egrets after the birds left the Macquarie Marshes in New South Wales. One plumed egret flew almost 2,400 kilometers over several months before settling near Kalo, taking 38 hours to cross 700km across the Coral Sea, marking the first time scientists have recorded the plumed egrets' migration. This discovery adds to the understanding of bird migration patterns and the impressive endurance capabilities of these species.</p>

The accelerated launch follows Xiaomi’s efforts to ramp up capacity amid the fanfare surrounding the car, and inquiries about the YU7’s presale greatly exceeded those for the company’s first model, the SU7.</p>

The situation is being closely monitored as it could have significant implications for the global economy, particularly in sectors reliant on fuel and consumer confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

Ishiba aims to maintain G7 unity in addressing global issues, including the situation in the Indo-Pacific and the war in Ukraine.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that ice jams will become more frequent in the Yellow River's estuary due to global warming by the end of this century. Researchers analyzed the dynamics of ice jam floods over the past 160 years, finding that warmer weather causes upstream ice to break apart and drift downstream, where it can refreeze and accumulate. This localized hazard can lead to destructive flooding, damaging downstream communities, wildlife, and infrastructure. The study highlights the need for proactive measures to mitigate the increasing risks associated with climate change in the region.</p>

This move reinforces existing policies and tightens loopholes, potentially raising the punishment for future breaches.

          <p>Two state lawmakers from Minnesota were shot in their homes, with Governor Tim Walz calling it a "politically motivated assassination" attempt. State representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, were killed, while State Senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, were injured but survived. The suspect, Vance Luther Boelter, has been taken into custody after a two-day search, and investigators reportedly found a list of 70 "targets", including the names of state Democratic politicians, in a vehicle the suspect drove for the assassination.</p>
