          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has called for a wide-ranging review of the Federal Reserve, questioning its overall success and institutional function beyond recent controversies. The call comes amid escalating tensions between the White House and the central bank, including President Trump's criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell and interest rate policies. Bessent suggested the Fed has been too slow to lower rates given moderating inflation, criticizing the institution's mindset. The market anticipates a potential rate cut in September.

          <p>This article details the current landscape of mortgage and refinance interest rates, acknowledging the challenges homebuyers face with high rates and limited housing inventory. As of mid-July 2025, average rates for a 30-year mortgage are around 6.75%, while a 15-year loan is near 5.95%. The report suggests that borrowers with strong credit profiles can still secure favorable rates by shopping around. It also notes that a potential pause in Federal Reserve rate hikes could bring relief to the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The price of gold is currently reported at $3,361.93 per ounce, reflecting its status as a popular safe-haven asset for investors during times of economic instability. The article explains that gold's value is influenced by numerous factors, including supply and demand, global economic conditions, inflation, and geopolitical turmoil. Historically, gold retains its value when fiat currencies weaken, making it an attractive hedge against inflation. Its price often moves inversely to interest rates and the strength of the U.S. dollar. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Analysts from China International Capital Corporation (CICC) are urging Beijing to address "neijuan," or involution, a cycle of inefficient and excessive competition in a limited market. They argue that top-down macroeconomic policies are needed to combat this self-defeating trend where companies invest more resources for diminishing returns. The proposed solution is to boost domestic consumption and foster innovation-led growth to create a larger "incremental cake." This would expand market demand and provide a more favorable environment for companies to escape the damaging competitive cycle.</p>

          <p>With gold prices surging, wealthy investors are increasingly allocating funds to the precious metal, viewing it as a safe-haven asset amid geopolitical uncertainty and a depreciating U.S. dollar. High-net-worth individuals employ various strategies, from buying gold-backed ETFs to purchasing physical bars and storing them in high-security vaults, including former military bunkers in the Swiss Alps. Bankers note an uptick in U.S. clients seeking to diversify, with some opting for unallocated gold held by banks and others insisting on owning specific, allocated bars for maximum security.

          <p>A catastrophic crash occurred in Dhaka, Bangladesh, when an F-7 training jet from the air force slammed into a school campus, killing at least 19 people and injuring 164. The aircraft reportedly experienced a mechanical fault shortly after takeoff, and the pilot, who was among the deceased, attempted to navigate to a less populated area. The crash caused a massive fire at the Milestone School and College, where students, staff, and parents were present. The government has declared a national day of mourning and formed a committee to investigate the tragic incident.</p>

Harvard has filed a lawsuit arguing the administration's actions are a punitive and unconstitutional violation of free speech and academic freedom. The university is seeking a swift judgment to unfreeze the critical funding, in a high-stakes case that could ultimately reach the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>A Belgian environmental project is using a century-old shipwreck off its coast as a nursery to reintroduce rare native flat oysters to the North Sea. Scientists deposited 200,000 oyster larvae into the ship's hull, hoping to establish a new reef in a protected area where fishing is banned. Oyster reefs are crucial for marine ecosystems, as they purify water and provide habitats for other species, but they have largely vanished due to overfishing and disease. The project aims to turn the wreckage into a biodiversity hotspot and help revive the region's marine environment.</p>

          <p>This article argues that Chief Justice John Roberts has been instrumental in expanding presidential power, creating a legal framework that supports President Trump's authoritarian tendencies. Through key opinions he authored, Roberts has legitimized broad executive authority, from upholding the "Muslim ban" to inventing a form of presidential immunity from criminal prosecution. The analysis contends that Roberts's narrative of a "unitary executive" who composes an entire branch of government is a dangerously ahistorical view. This judicial philosophy, the article concludes, has remade the American presidency into something closer to a dictatorship.</p>

Critics describe this as "denial by erasure," a strategy to remove the scientific evidence needed to create and defend environmental regulations.

          <p>President Donald Trump's second term has been marked by a strong preference for using tariffs as a primary tool of foreign and economic policy, a departure from the traditional reliance on sanctions. This "tariff tango" approach provides direct, unilateral control, aligning with his "America First" agenda to address trade deficits and protect domestic industries. The article explores how Trump blurs the line between the two tools, using tariffs to pressure countries on non-trade issues like immigration and drug trafficking. While this strategy offers flexibility, it also creates significant uncertainty and risks destabilizing global trade. (not investment advice)</p>

The regulations are designed to "strengthen political loyalty" and "eliminate toxic influences," according to the PLA's official newspaper. The new rules establish clear "political red lines" and require Communist Party officials within the military to act with integrity and lead by example.

Currently, staff receive about €1.50 for each oversized bag they intercept, a practice intended to enforce the airline's strict baggage rules. O'Leary stated that over 99% of passengers comply, but the fees and incentives are designed to "eliminate the scourge" of non-compliant bags that delay boarding.

          <p>Stellantis, the parent company of car brands like Jeep, Fiat, and Vauxhall, has stated that US tariffs on imported cars have cost it €300 million. The financial impact stems from the 25% tariff implemented in April, which has disrupted trade and led to lost production. The company's shipments to North America fell by 25% in the second quarter compared to the previous year, contributing to a 10% drop in total sales. This highlights the significant financial repercussions President Trump's protectionist trade policies are having on major global automakers with complex international supply chains.</p>
