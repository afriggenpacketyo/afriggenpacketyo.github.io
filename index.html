          <p>A federal judge in Brooklyn has issued a ruling that prevents the Trump administration from terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants this year. The judge determined that the Department of Homeland Security secretary lacks the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation before its scheduled expiration in February 2026. This decision provides temporary relief to migrants who have established lives in the U.S., citing their enrollment in schools, employment, and medical treatments. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the ruling, arguing that district courts cannot prohibit the executive branch from enforcing immigration laws.</p>

          <p>The jury in the trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs has reached a partial verdict on four of five counts but remains deadlocked on the most serious charge of racketeering. After two days of deliberations, jurors informed the judge they were unable to reach a unanimous decision on the racketeering count, which carries a potential life sentence. The judge has instructed the jury to continue deliberating in an effort to break the impasse. Combs has pleaded not guilty to all charges, which also include sex trafficking and transportation for prostitution, following a two-month trial with testimony from 34 witnesses.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced a halt to some weapons shipments to Ukraine following a Pentagon review that raised concerns about dwindling U.S. military stockpiles. The decision, described as putting "America's interests first," affects certain military aid, reportedly including air defense missiles and precision munitions. This policy shift comes as Russia intensifies its attacks and marks a change in the Trump administration's approach to supporting Kyiv. While officials state the U.S. military's strength is unquestioned, the move creates uncertainty for Ukraine's defense capabilities at a critical time in the war.</p>

          <p>Intel's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, is reportedly exploring a significant strategic change for the company's contract chip manufacturing business to attract major clients like Apple and Nvidia. The proposed shift involves discontinuing the marketing of its 18A manufacturing process to external customers, a technology heavily promoted by his predecessor. Instead, resources would be focused on the next-generation 14A process, where Intel believes it can gain a competitive edge over rival TSMC. This potential pivot could result in a multi-billion dollar write-off but is seen as a necessary step to revive the U.S. chipmaker's fortunes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer experienced a significant political setback after a large-scale rebellion from his own MPs forced a U-turn on a key welfare reform bill. The chaotic events, which saw the government change its position multiple times, have been compared to the instability of previous administrations, despite Starmer's large majority. The episode has weakened the Prime Minister's authority, prompted questions about his chancellor's future, and led to open criticism within the Labour party. This slow-motion humiliation has left the government appearing bruised and not in control of its own legislative agenda.</p>

          <p>Preliminary government data reveals that the number of migrants apprehended for illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border fell to a historic monthly low of just over 6,000 in June. The Trump administration attributes this dramatic decrease to its aggressive deportation policies, which include empowering border officials to swiftly deport migrants without asylum hearings. For the second consecutive month, no migrants were released into the U.S. interior, a stark contrast to previous years. This lull in illegal immigration is occurring alongside an intense messaging campaign and increased interior enforcement actions by ICE.</p>

Musk criticized the bill for increasing the national debt and cutting support for renewable energy and electric vehicles, which could negatively impact Tesla's sales and energy division. Trump retaliated by suggesting Musk could lose more than just his EV mandate, alluding to the substantial government contracts his companies rely on. (not investment advice)</p>

The lawsuit alleges that the transfer of personal health informationâ€”including names, addresses, and immigration statusâ€”violates federal privacy laws and creates a climate of fear that could deter people from seeking medical care. The data, from states that offer state-funded health programs to non-citizens, was reportedly shared to aid immigration enforcement.

          <p>Minnesota has implemented the nation's most stringent law regulating PFAS, also known as "forever chemicals," found in many consumer products and linked to health issues. The legislation, called "Amara's Law," is named after Amara Strande, who testified before lawmakers while dying of a rare cancer at age 20. The law will phase out the manufacture and sale of nonessential PFAS products by 2032. Strande's advocacy was inspired by the belief that her illness was linked to PFAS waste from a nearby 3M plant, which contaminated local groundwater for decades.</p>

The research found that USAID programs have saved over 90 million lives in the past two decades, particularly by combating HIV/AIDS and malaria. The administration argues the agency has been inefficient, but researchers say their analysis shows that for just 18 cents per taxpayer per day, the agency has had a profound life-saving impact globally.

The lawsuit seeks to invalidate policies that limit city cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. Bass criticized federal agents for indiscriminate arrests and accused the administration of trying to meet a daily detention quota. The conflict highlights the escalating tensions between the Trump administration and sanctuary cities over federal immigration crackdowns and local autonomy.</p>

          <h2>California Enacts Sweeping Housing Reform by Waiving Environmental Law for Urban Development</h2>

          <p>California has passed its most significant reform to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) in decades, a move intended to spur housing construction.
