          <h2>Trump Advocates Free Passage for US Ships Through Panama and Suez Canals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-26 22:12:57 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump has called for American commercial and military ships to have free access through the Panama and Suez Canals, directing his secretary of state to pursue this goal. Trump asserted that the US's involvement was crucial for the existence of both canals. The Panamanian president responded by stating that canal fees are governed by the Panama Canal Authority, and Egypt reported a 60% drop in Suez Canal revenues due to Houthi rebel attacks on shipping, highlighting the canal's importance for global trade. Optimism is cautiously moderate due to the geopolitical implications and potential trade disruptions.</p>

          <p>During the European Fencing Championship in Tallinn, Estonia, the Swiss under-23 fencing team turned their backs to the Israeli team while the Israeli national anthem played. This action drew condemnation from Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar. This incident follows previous instances of protests against Israeli sports teams, such as Iraq's fencing team withdrawing from a match against Israel at the World Fencing Championship in 2023. FIFA previously considered allegations of discrimination against Team Israel, adding to the ongoing tensions surrounding Israeli participation in international sports.</p>

          <p>Canada's election campaign has experienced a significant turnaround with the rise of Liberal leader Mark Carney and the return of Donald Trump to the White House, overshadowing earlier Conservative dominance.

Voters express concerns over housing shortages, economic sluggishness, and social issues, while Trump's presence looms large, motivating left-leaning voters. The election outcome hinges on which party can convince voters they have the best strategy for dealing with the US president.</p>

The camp saw a high death toll due to overcrowding, dysentery, malnutrition, and typhus, with many prisoners from eastern camps ending up there.</p>
