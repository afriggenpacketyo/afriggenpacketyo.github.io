          <p>President Trump declared that Israel and Iran have agreed to a "complete and total" ceasefire, intended to end the recent conflict, although an Iranian official offered a less definitive statement. According to Trump's timeline, both sides would cease strikes within specific timeframes, leading to an official end to the conflict. However, Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi suggested that Iran had already halted strikes but made no formal agreement on a ceasefire. The White House maintained that both sides agreed, contingent on no further Iranian attacks, with Qatar playing a role in brokering the deal after Iran's strike on Al Udeid Air Base. The conflict began with Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets, prompting Iranian counterattacks. Optimism score is not being used in the summary.</p>

          <p>More than 100 Labour MPs are supporting an amendment to block the government's planned changes to the benefits system, expressing concerns about cuts to disability and sickness-related benefits. The welfare reform bill, called the Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment Bill, includes proposals to make it harder for disabled people with less severe conditions to claim personal independence payment (Pip). The amendment cites concerns about pushing people into poverty, a lack of consultation, and inadequate impact assessments. The vote on the government's bill is scheduled for July 1, and the level of support for the amendment indicates a potential rebellion facing ministers.</p>

          <p>Florida is planning to build a migrant detention center in the Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," to hold an estimated 1,000 people, a proposal that has drawn criticism from lawmakers and environmentalists. The facility would be built on the site of the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport, with Florida's Attorney General arguing the location acts as a natural deterrent for escapees due to the presence of alligators and pythons. Miami-Dade County's mayor criticized the plan, saying the impacts to the Everglades ecosystem could be devastating, though officials claim the facility would not be located within Everglades National Park. The facility is expected to cost around $450 million a year to run.</p>

          <p>The USDA announced it will rescind the 2001 "Roadless Rule," which protects 58.5 million acres of national forestland from road construction and timber harvesting. USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins described the rule as outdated and overly restrictive, arguing that rescinding it will enable better forest management for fire risk and timber production. Environmental groups denounced the decision, saying it will harm wildlife habitats, water sources, and recreational opportunities. Opponents also dispute the notion that eliminating the rule will reduce fire risk, arguing that commercial logging exacerbates climate change.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to resume quick deportations of certain immigrants without advance warning, prompting praise from a Homeland Security official. The court lifted an injunction blocking the practice, which was put in place after an executive order signed by President Trump in January. Justice Sotomayor dissented, calling the order "a gross abuse of the Court's equitable discretion." The legal group representing the immigrants expressed concern that the ruling strips away critical due process protections, while the administration hailed it as a victory for American safety and security.</p>

Iran stated it would cease attacks if Israel stopped its aggression, and Israeli attacks reportedly ceased as the deadline arrived in Tehran. The situation developed after Iran followed through on its promise to retaliate for a prior U.S. strike, with no American casualties or damage reported.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has become increasingly reliant on rare earth supplies from Myanmar, with Myanmar accounting for about 57% of China's total rare earth imports last year. These imports are particularly high in heavy rare earth element contents, which are generally less abundant, elevating their value and scarcity. China has effectively outsourced much of its rare earth extraction to Myanmar at a terrible cost to the environment and local communities. This dynamic has strengthened China's dominant position, giving Beijing a de facto monopoly over the global heavy rare earths supply chain.</p>

          <p>The body of the last person missing after a boat capsized in Lake Tahoe over the weekend has been recovered, bringing the total death toll to eight. The 27-foot boat capsized due to a large swell near D.L. Bliss State Park. Initial reports indicated that six adults died, two were rescued, and two were missing. The search for the missing individuals covered over 390 square miles and was suspended before the bodies were eventually recovered.</p>

          <p>Florida officials have asked the Supreme Court to allow the state to enforce a new immigration law that makes it a crime for people in the United States unlawfully to enter Florida. The state is appealing a federal judge's decision preventing law enforcement officers from enforcing the law, known as SB 4-C. Florida argues that the law is a measured effort to protect its sovereignty and falls within its law enforcement responsibilities. The state's immigration law was passed earlier this year and makes it a crime for people living in the U.S. illegally to knowingly enter or re-enter Florida after coming into the country by eluding examination by immigration officers.</p>

Braziel also warned that U.S. restrictions on ethane trade to China pose serious issues for exporters, making global customers more reluctant to buy other energy products. (not investment advice)</p>
