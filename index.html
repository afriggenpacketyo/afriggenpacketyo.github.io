          <p>Across Africa, particularly in commercial hubs like Nairobi and Lagos, traders are shifting away from the US dollar and adopting Chinaâ€™s yuan for international transactions. Logistics companies are playing a key role by providing Shilling-yuan conversion services, enabling traders to pay in local currency while handling yuan payments to Chinese sellers. This localized system streamlines trade with China, the worldâ€™s second-largest economy, benefiting both African traders and Chinese businesses, as Kenyan traders can now easily purchase goods from Guangzhou and Yiwu through local agents who manage payments and deliveries.

          <p>As the US government seeks a new nuclear agreement with Iran, the Iranian opposition remains cautiously optimistic, though divided on the best path forward. Some opposition figures hope for a regime change through foreign intervention, while others, like historian Arash Azizi, emphasize the need for internal change and a diplomatic resolution. A successful agreement could ease sanctions and create more freedom for pro-democratic activities, although skepticism remains regarding the influence of Iranians in the diaspora.</p>
