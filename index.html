            <p>Federal investigators report that a 17-year-old from Wisconsin, Nikita Casap, murdered his parents as part of a plot to assassinate former U.S. President Donald Trump and overthrow the government.

He faces charges including first-degree intentional homicide, hiding a corpse, and identity theft, and is being held on a $1 million bond.

            <p>Chinese officials are urging the United States to completely remove tariffs imposed by former President Donald Trump, as trade tensions between the two nations continue. While Trump announced a 90-day pause on some global tariffs, levies on Chinese imports have increased to 145%. The Chinese commerce ministry views recent exemptions as a "small step" but calls for a full cancellation of tariffs, while the Trump administration hints at future levies on semiconductors. Tensions remain high, with no immediate plans for talks between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>

            <p>Billionaire Ray Dalio warns of a potential global economic crisis worse than a recession, driven by trade disruptions, rising U.S. debt, and the emergence of new world powers. Dalio believes that President Trump's tariff policies are disruptive and create global conflict, threatening the international economic and geopolitical structure established after World War II. He advocates for a "win-win" trade agreement with China and calls for Congress to reduce the federal deficit. Dalio fears a breakdown in the bond market could lead to a severe shock to the monetary system.</p>

            <p>Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari discussed the potential economic impact of the trade war with China, noting concerns from Minnesota farmers about soybean exports. He suggested that investors may be viewing America as a less attractive investment destination, as reflected in rising treasury yields. Kashkari emphasized that the Fed's role is to keep inflation under control amid trade uncertainties, but that the long-term economic destination is determined by trade and fiscal policy, not the central bank. He also acknowledged a significant hit to confidence and the risk of a recession.</p>

            <p>Scientists have discovered a remarkable fossil of a 520-million-year-old worm larva with its brain and guts still intact. The fossil, an early ancestor of arthropods, provides a unique window into the past and allows experts to better understand evolutionary links between ancient and modern arthropods. The preserved structures, including the brain, digestive glands, and primitive circulatory system, reveal a previously underestimated complexity in early arthropods. This discovery has allowed scientists to draw evolutionary connections between ancient creatures and those that thrive today.</p>

            <p>US stock markets are expected to rebound following President Trump's decision to exempt smartphones and laptops from his tariff regime. Shares in Apple and Nvidia are projected to increase significantly due to the tariff relief. The temporary reprieve is viewed as a concession following pressure from Republican leaders concerned about rising smartphone costs affecting voters. However, the US commerce secretary hinted that the exemption might be temporary, with separate tariffs potentially being negotiated on these specific products in the future.

            <p>Former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown has accused President Trump of "weaponizing" the global trading system with steep import tariffs, potentially leading to a breakdown in the global economic order. Brown calls for a coordinated global rescue plan, including synchronized interest rate cuts, to mitigate the impact of the tariffs. He expresses concerns that the tariff regime could cause further turmoil in financial markets and potentially trigger a 1930s-style depression. Brown urges finance ministers and central bankers to discuss measures to shore up the global economy at upcoming IMF and World Bank meetings.</p>

Lutnick indicated that separate tariffs for these products are "coming soon," potentially within a month or two, as they are considered matters of national security. These comments contradict hopes that popular tech products made in China would be spared from Trump's 145% reciprocal tariffs. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer attempted to clarify the situation, stating that the supply chain has moved to the national security tariff regime.</p>
