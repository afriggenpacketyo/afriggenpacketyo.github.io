            <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy anticipates that AI costs will decrease over time due to advancements in the field and increased competition in the chip market, even as Amazon invests heavily in AI projects. Jassy highlights that more efficient chips and improvements in AI model architectures will reduce the per-unit cost of AI, enabling broader adoption. Amazon is allocating a significant portion of its capital expenditures to AI-related initiatives, including data centers and hardware, to meet the growing demand for generative AI. He likens this to the company's cloud juggernaut, which brought down the cost of compute and storage, leading to "more invention, better customer experiences, and more absolute infrastructure spend."</p>

            <p>As Trump's tariffs unsettle global markets, Democrats are debating their stance on trade. While some acknowledge the failings of free trade and advocate for targeted tariffs, others emphasize the negative impact of Trump's policies on consumers. Data suggests that public opinion is shifting against tariffs. A more focused message emphasizing the economic pain caused by tariffs may be more effective for Democrats.</p>

            <p>In retaliation against President Trump's tariffs, China is planning to reduce the number of US films shown in the country. The China Film Administration stated that the tariffs may diminish the Chinese audience's favorable perception of American films. This measure could significantly impact Hollywood studios, as China is the second-largest cinema market in the world. The decision reflects escalating tensions between the two countries.</p>
