          <p>New Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers is already establishing a standard of protection for his teammates during training camp. Speaking on a podcast, Rodgers recounted an incident where he admonished the offensive line after another quarterback was knocked down, telling them to act as "policemen" on the field. He stressed the importance of protecting all players and backing each other up, noting that he saw a positive response from the line in a subsequent situation. This leadership demonstrates his immediate impact on the team's culture ahead of the regular season.</p>

The company's president, Quan Gang, predicts that its latest cleaner featuring an AI-powered robotic arm, currently priced around $2,600, could eventually sell for just a few hundred dollars. This strategy is part of a larger vision for household human-like robots to become common by 2030, driven by generative AI.

The university's president confirmed that no shooter, firearms, or injuries were found on campus after police sweeps were conducted. The incident, known as "swatting," occurred during the school's orientation mass and is now under investigation by local and federal authorities, including the FBI. This event followed a similar unfounded active shooter scare at the University of Tennessee in Chattanooga earlier the same day.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is intensifying its campaign for the removal of Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook over unconfirmed allegations of mortgage fraud. After President Trump called for her resignation, a top administration official sent a letter to Fed Chair Jerome Powell urging him to remove Cook from the board. This action represents a significant escalation in the administration's conflict with the Federal Reserve's independence. Cook has stated she has no intention of resigning and will provide accurate information to address any legitimate questions about her financial history.</p>

          <p>Representative Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat who has served in Congress since 1995, announced he will not seek reelection if the new Republican-drawn congressional map in Texas is enacted. The proposed redistricting, pushed by President Trump, would significantly alter his Austin-area district, likely forcing him into a primary against fellow progressive Democrat Greg Casar. Doggett stated he prefers to focus on fighting the administration's policies rather than engaging in an intra-party battle. His decision highlights the direct political consequences of the contentious mid-decade redistricting effort in Texas.</p>

          <p>President Trump has voiced strong support for the Resolution Copper mine project, which would be located on a sacred Apache site known as Oak Flat in Arizona. After meeting with mining executives, Trump criticized a recent court decision that temporarily halted the transfer of the federal land to the mining companies. The San Carlos Apache Tribe, which considers the land sacred and has been fighting the project for years, hailed the court's decision as a temporary victory. The project highlights a major conflict between industrial resource demand and the preservation of Indigenous cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>A New York appellate court has thrown out the nearly $500 million financial penalty imposed on President Donald Trump in his civil fraud trial. While the court upheld the finding that Trump is liable for fraud, it deemed the massive fine excessive and potentially unconstitutional. The judges' ruling was divided, but it effectively nullifies the monetary component of the original judgment while leaving other penalties, such as a ban on serving as a company director in New York, in place. The New York Attorney General's office plans to appeal the decision regarding the fine.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, a Category 2 storm, has begun moving northeastward into the Atlantic, away from the North Carolina coast. While the storm did not make landfall in the U.S., it brought tropical storm conditions and dangerous surf to the Outer Banks, where some evacuation and storm surge warnings remain in effect. The National Hurricane Center continues to caution against swimming along most of the East Coast due to life-threatening rip currents generated by the large storm system. Erin is expected to weaken and become a post-tropical cyclone by Saturday.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is expanding its immigration enforcement by reviewing the records of all 55 million foreign nationals who currently hold valid U.S. visas. According to the State Department, this "continuous vetting" will search for any new information that could make a visa holder ineligible, including criminal activity, overstays, or threats to public safety. If such information is found, the visa can be revoked, and the individual could face deportation if they are in the United States. This follows a related policy to vet applicants for "anti-American" views.</p>

          <h2>Wealthy Investors Utilize ETF Conversions to Defer Capital Gains Taxes</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A financial strategy known as a 351 conversion is gaining traction among wealthy investors as a method to defer capital gains taxes on appreciated assets. The process involves exchanging a portfolio of stocks for shares in a new or privately seeded exchange-traded fund (ETF) before it launches. This allows the investor to avoid an immediate tax bill on their profits, though gains are realized when the ETF shares are eventually sold. The strategy has strict diversification requirements and potential downsides, such as being locked into a specific ETF. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel's market value dropped by nearly $100 million after its stock plunged following the unveiling of a new, more modern logo. The new design removes the iconic image of a man leaning against a barrel, which has been part of the brand for decades. The change is part of a broader effort by the company to update its image and menu to remain relevant. The redesign was met with criticism from some conservative commentators and marketing experts, and the negative market reaction reflects investor uncertainty about the company's new strategic direction.</p>

          <p>The Texas House has approved a mid-decade redistricting plan aimed at creating five new congressional districts likely to elect Republicans. This highly unusual and partisan move, requested by President Trump, is designed to strengthen the GOP's hold on the U.S. House of Representatives ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The plan is being met with a retaliatory effort in California, where Democrats are seeking to create five new Democratic seats. This escalation highlights the increasingly aggressive tactics being used in the national battle for congressional control.</p>
