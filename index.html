          <p>Female refugees in Germany encounter significant barriers to employment, including childcare shortages, non-recognition of foreign qualifications, and language hurdles, resulting in a much lower employment rate compared to their male counterparts. Various publicly funded projects and nonprofit organizations, such as Work for Refugees and ReDi School, are working to address these issues through counseling, job fairs, and digital skills training. These programs, often staffed by women with similar backgrounds, provide crucial support and create a sense of community, helping individuals rebuild their careers and find stability in their new country.</p>

          <p>European allies have collectively urged the U.S. not to negotiate a peace deal with Russia without Ukraine's direct involvement, following President Trump's announcement of an upcoming summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska. Leaders from the UK, France, Germany, and others issued a joint statement emphasizing that Ukraine's borders must not be changed by force and that its destiny cannot be decided without its participation. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy strongly rejected any potential agreements made without Kyiv, particularly reacting to Trump's suggestion that a deal might involve "swapping of territories."</p>

The win showcases the strength of the Dodgers' fully restored starting rotation, which also includes stars like Tyler Glasnow and Shohei Ohtani, who contributed with his 40th home run of the season. After a slow start to the season due to injury, Snell's recent form, with 18 strikeouts in his last 10 innings, suggests he is back to his best and is bolstering the team's postseason prospects.</p>

The documentary focuses on a 19th-century Qing dynasty general who suppressed a separatist state in Xinjiang, framing the historical events to bolster contemporary Chinese identity and territorial claims.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford is showing positive signs of recovery from a back issue after completing an extensive passing workout. Coach Sean McVay expressed optimism, stating that Stafford "looked good" and threw over 60 passes without apparent limitations, marking a significant step toward his return to practice. While the 37-year-old quarterback will be progressed back into drills cautiously, the successful workout has raised hopes within the team for his imminent return to full participation ahead of the upcoming season.</p>

The event, which has been running for nearly 50 years, celebrates unique and unconventionally beautiful dogs, with Petunia and her owner taking home a $5,000 prize. The contest also serves to promote dog adoption, as many of the participants are rescue animals from shelters and puppy mills. It highlights the message that a dog's pedigree does not define its value as a pet.</p>

          <p>A man in Leicestershire was wrongly issued a £165 parking charge after an automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) system confused his car with another vehicle. The photographic evidence from the parking company showed his Hyundai entering the car park, but a different car, a Kia with a nearly identical license plate, leaving nine hours later. The driver expressed anger over the error and the threatening legal letter he received, fearing that many people in similar situations might pay incorrect fines out of intimidation. The parking company stated the issue was rectified once brought to their attention.</p>

          <p>Musician Ed Sheeran's recent self-identification as "culturally Irish" has ignited a conversation about the nature of identity in the modern, globalized world. This article explores the complexities of what it means to be Irish, moving beyond simple definitions of birthplace or citizenship to include heritage, family connections, and cultural immersion. The discussion touches upon the evolving identities in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, the historical context of the Irish diaspora in Britain, and the idea that identity can be a fluid, multi-layered, and personal concept.</p>

          <p>Six months after its surprise launch roiled the US stock market, this article assesses the lasting impact of the Chinese AI model, DeepSeek. The app initially challenged the "bigger is better" assumption in AI development by claiming superior performance at a fraction of the cost, prompting a "Sputnik moment" for the industry. While some US startups adopted it for cost savings, security concerns and a renewed push by American tech giants toward massive investment in computing power suggest DeepSeek's disruption may have been short-lived. The company now faces its own challenges in sustaining momentum.</p>
