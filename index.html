          <p>The Trump administration has announced the elimination of over 500 jobs at Voice of America and its parent agency, the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM). The move, directed by the President, is framed as an effort to reduce federal bureaucracy and save money, but it comes amidst legal challenges. A federal judge recently blocked the agency's acting CEO, Kari Lake, from removing the VOA director, raising concerns among employees and some lawmakers about the potential weakening of the broadcaster's mission to provide objective news in countries with limited press freedom.</p>

          <p>Several local councils in the UK are continuing their legal efforts to prevent hotels from housing asylum seekers, despite a recent Court of Appeal ruling that overturned a temporary injunction. The ruling, which concerned The Bell Hotel in Epping, was seen as a potential precedent, but councils like West Northamptonshire and Broxbourne are proceeding with legal action based on planning law violations. The situation has sparked protests and counter-demonstrations across the country, highlighting the intense debate surrounding the government's asylum policies and the use of hotels for accommodation.</p>

          <p>Russia has launched a massive overnight assault on Ukraine, targeting 14 regions with nearly 540 drones and 45 missiles, according to Ukrainian officials. The attacks killed one person in Zaporizhzhia and injured at least 30 others, causing significant damage to infrastructure and residential buildings. In response, Ukraine's military reported successful drone strikes on two Russian oil refineries. The barrage comes amid stalled diplomatic efforts to end the war, with President Zelensky calling for stronger international sanctions against Moscow.</p>

          <h2>Federal Appeals Court Rules Trump's Global Tariffs Are an Illegal Overreach of Power</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump's "reciprocal tariffs," imposed on nearly all trading partners, were an illegal use of presidential authority. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which the administration used to justify the levies, does not grant the power to impose taxes or duties. The tariffs will remain in place until mid-October to allow for an appeal to the Supreme Court, a step the President has indicated he will take, creating uncertainty for the U.S. economy and global trade.

          <p>After a two-year, $1 million study concluded that agricultural pollution is a significant source of Iowa's water quality problems, funding for public outreach to promote the findings has been quietly eliminated. The report, which connects contaminants from the state's powerful farm industry to health risks like high cancer rates, has been controversial. Project leaders had planned to use the remaining $400,000 for public education, but the funds were "zeroed out" by county officials without explanation, raising concerns that the report's impactful findings are being suppressed.</p>

          <p>Longtime investor and former Bridgewater strategist Rebecca Patterson has warned that President Trump's efforts to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook could threaten the central bank's independence and harm the U.S. economy. Patterson argues that politicizing the Fed could erode its legitimacy, leading to negative long-term consequences seen in other countries, such as higher inflation, weaker currency, and reduced foreign investment. While markets might initially react positively to politically motivated lower interest rates, she believes the eventual damage to consumption and earnings would be significant.

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has climbed to an estimated $1 billion for the upcoming Saturday night drawing, the sixth-largest prize in the game's history. The prize has grown after 39 consecutive drawings without a winner matching all six numbers. Winners face a choice between an annuity paid over 30 years or a lump-sum cash option of nearly half the total, both of which are subject to significant federal and state taxes. Eight states do not tax lottery winnings, while five states do not participate in the Powerball lottery at all. (not investment advice)</p>

The Palestinian Authority has condemned the action as a violation of U.S. commitments as the U.N.'s host country and has called on international partners to pressure the administration to reverse its decision.</p>

The deployment has heightened tensions with Venezuela, whose President Nicolas Maduro has been accused by Washington of leading a drug cartel. Venezuelan officials have responded by deploying their own security forces and mobilizing militia members in response to what they call "outlandish threats."</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in northern Iraq have discovered approximately 40 ancient tombs, believed to be over 2,300 years old, after receding water levels in the Mosul Dam reservoir exposed the site. The severe drought plaguing the country has lowered the reservoir to historic lows, enabling the excavation of the Hellenistic-period tombs. While the drought has had devastating effects on agriculture and electricity, it has provided a rare opportunity for archaeological work. The team is now working to excavate and preserve the artifacts before the area is submerged again.</p>

          <p>The Utah Supreme Court has blocked the scheduled execution of Ralph Leroy Menzies, a 67-year-old inmate on death row for 37 years, citing significant questions about his mental competency. Menzies' lawyers argued that his severe dementia renders him unable to understand why he is being executed, a standard protected by the U.S. Constitution's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. The court has ordered a lower court to re-evaluate his fitness, temporarily pausing what would have been only the sixth execution by firing squad in the U.S. since 1977.</p>
