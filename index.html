          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has condemned a massive Russian aerial attack that lasted over 12 hours, resulting in at least four deaths and 40 injuries across seven regions. The bombardment involved nearly 600 drones and dozens of missiles, targeting civilian infrastructure in Kyiv and other cities, including a cardiology institute and a bread factory. Zelensky vowed retaliation and reiterated calls for stronger international sanctions against Russia, emphasizing the attack's timing at the end of the UN General Assembly week. The article also notes recent airspace violations in neighboring NATO countries, heightening regional tensions.</p>

          <p>Vietnamese authorities are conducting mass evacuations of over a quarter-million people from coastal areas in preparation for Typhoon Bualoi. The storm, which previously caused at least 10 fatalities in the Philippines, is expected to make landfall with winds of approximately 130 kilometers per hour. Officials have closed four airports and mobilized thousands of troops, warning that the fast-moving typhoon could trigger multiple disasters, including flash floods and landslides. Vietnam is particularly vulnerable to such storms, having suffered significant economic damage and loss of life from previous typhoons.</p>

Pro-EU President Maia Sandu has accused the Kremlin of "massive interference" in the vote, alleging that Russia is spending heavily to bribe voters and destabilize the nation. The election is tightly contested, with polls suggesting Sandu's ruling party could lose its majority. The tense political climate was further highlighted by the disqualification of two pro-Russian parties just before the election due to alleged illegal foreign financing.</p>

          <p>Switzerland is holding a second national referendum on the introduction of an electronic identity card system, after a similar proposal was rejected in 2021 over data privacy concerns. The revised plan addresses previous objections by making the system optional and keeping it entirely state-run, with data stored on users' smartphones rather than centrally. Supporters argue the e-ID will streamline bureaucratic processes, from signing contracts to age verification. Despite Switzerland's strong tradition of privacy protection, recent polls suggest that voters, now more familiar with digital credentials from the pandemic, may approve the measure this time.</p>

          <p>Four major figures from a Scottish crime syndicate have been arrested in Dubai, escalating a violent feud between the Lyons and Daniel crime families that has spanned 25 years. The arrests of Steven Lyons and three associates are linked to a recent wave of violence across Scotland, reportedly triggered by a drug deal dispute. This long-running conflict has included murders, kidnappings, and brutal attacks, with leadership now in its second generation. The article details the history of the rivalry and notes the criminals' connections to international groups like the Kinahan cartel, highlighting the global reach of Scottish organized crime.</p>

          <p>The breakaway region of Transnistria in eastern Moldova serves as a significant military and operational base for Russia, creating persistent instability for the nation. This unrecognized republic, established after a post-Soviet war in 1992, is home to about 1,500 Russian troops and a large Soviet-era weapons arsenal. The territory operates as a Soviet-style dictatorship controlled by an oligarchic group, systematically violating human rights and functioning as a hub for money laundering and Russian influence operations. Despite ongoing negotiations, Russia has consistently blocked the region's reintegration into Moldova, leveraging it to maintain influence near Ukraine and the EU.</p>

          <p>The UK, France, and Germany have activated the "snapback" mechanism to reimpose sweeping UN sanctions on Iran, ten years after they were lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal. The European powers cited Iran's "continued nuclear escalation" and lack of cooperation with inspectors as the primary reasons for the move. This development follows Iran's suspension of nuclear facility inspections after US and Israeli strikes on its sites in June. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian condemned the sanctions as "illegal" but maintained that the country does not seek nuclear weapons, though negotiations to de-escalate tensions have so far failed.</p>

Their methods allegedly include political interference, economic pressure, and cultural subversion, with both supporting hard-right populist parties across the continent.

          <h2>Opinion: Trump's TikTok Deal May Represent a Strategic Victory for China</h2>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the recent "framework consensus" for TikTok's US operations, brokered by the Trump administration, may not be the American victory it appears to be. While the deal places American data and servers under US control, it leaves TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, as the single largest shareholder with just under 20% ownership of the new entity. The author suggests this arrangement still provides China with significant leverage over the popular social media platform. The article concludes that what is being presented as a resolution could ultimately be a major strategic triumph for Beijing.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Autistic Individuals Possess Qualities of Focus and Empathy That Trump Lacks</h2>

          <p>In response to Donald Trump's recent contentious claims about autism, this opinion column argues that autistic people embody many positive traits that the former president lacks. The author highlights qualities such as the capacity for intense focus, adherence to facts, and a profound sense of empathy and social justice, citing Greta Thunberg as an example. The piece challenges the narrative of autism as a tragedy, instead celebrating the unique ways autistic individuals experience and express joy, memory, and love. It concludes that these human qualities are more valuable than the divisive rhetoric used by some politicians.</p>

          <p>As the regular season concludes, the Los Angeles Dodgers are grappling with several key roster decisions for their upcoming wild-card playoff series, primarily centered on player health and bullpen composition. The availability of key players like Max Muncy and Will Smith remains uncertain due to injuries, while the team evaluates a surplus of left-handed relievers. Manager Dave Roberts is also considering how to best utilize two-way star Shohei Ohtani, either as a Game 1 starter or saving him for a potential later game. These final choices will be critical for the team's postseason aspirations.</p>

          <p>The town of Rock Springs, Wyoming, is taking new steps to acknowledge a dark chapter in its history by erecting a monument to the victims of the 1885 anti-Chinese massacre. The incident, where a mob of white miners killed 28 Chinese laborers and burned their neighborhood, is one of the deadliest acts of anti-Chinese violence in U.S. history. The new seven-foot bronze statue, "Requiem," was unveiled on the 140th anniversary, representing a significant shift from the previously small and overlooked plaque. This public reckoning is bringing descendants of the victims back to the town for the first time.</p>

          <h2>Hairy Crab Prices in China Decline Amid Weak Consumer Spending</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 00:00:16 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>On the eve of China's "super golden week" holiday, prices for hairy crabs, a popular seasonal delicacy, have fallen due to sluggish consumer demand. Industry insiders report that retail prices are down significantly compared to last year and are expected to drop further due to higher production and weak household spending. The eight-day holiday, which combines the National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival, is being closely watched as a key indicator of the country's domestic consumption strength. The lower prices for this luxury food item suggest that Chinese consumers remain cautious with their spending.</p>
