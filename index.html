          <p>A devastating Russian aerial strike targeted residential buildings in Kyiv, resulting in the deaths of six people, including a six-year-old boy, and injuring at least 52 others, with nine children among those hospitalized. Tymur Tkachenko, head of the city's military administration, confirmed a direct hit on a Sviatoshynskyi district building, one of 27 locations struck overnight. Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Andrii Sybiha‎, condemned the attack as a brutal and deliberate act of war against the Ukrainian people, emphasizing the destruction of homes, schools, and hospitals. Lawmaker Ruslan Stefanchuk called it a "particularly sinister act," underscoring Russia's intent to wage war against Ukrainian citizens, their homes, and their right to live freely.</p>

          <p>British energy major Shell reported better-than-expected adjusted earnings of $4.26 billion for the second quarter, surpassing analyst forecasts despite a decline in global oil and gas prices. The company announced a steady pace of $3.5 billion in share buybacks for the next three months, marking its 15th consecutive quarter of significant returns to shareholders. This strong performance follows Shell's strategic update in March, which prioritized shareholder returns, ramped up cost savings, and doubled down on its liquified natural gas (LNG) push. The article highlights that Shell's share price has outperformed many European and U.S. rivals this year, reflecting positive investor reception to its focus on value creation and simplification.

          <p>Canada and Malta have announced their intention to formally recognize the state of Palestine at the upcoming UN General Assembly in September, joining France and potentially the United Kingdom in a growing international push. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney stated that Canada's recognition is predicated on the Palestinian Authority holding general elections in 2026 where Hamas cannot participate, and the demilitarization of the Palestinian state. Malta emphasized its long-standing support for Palestinian self-determination as a concrete step towards realizing a just and lasting peace. This collective diplomatic effort by G7 nations aims to advance a two-state solution amid increasing international pressure on Israel, which, along with the U.S., opposes such recognition.</p>

          <p>Australia has implemented a world-first national ban on social media for youth, aiming to address a growing mental health crisis, despite experts questioning its causal link to social media use. The law, passed in November 2024, will fine major platforms like TikTok and Instagram for failing to block underage users, though parents and children face no penalties. While proponents cite concerns over cyberbullying and disinformation, critics, including social media companies, warn the ban could push young people to unregulated online spaces. Researchers suggest focusing on mental health system reform rather than prohibition, noting the potential positive aspects of social media for some youth.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's H20 AI chips, intended for export to China, are facing increased scrutiny from Beijing's Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) due to national security concerns. The CAC summoned Nvidia officials to clarify and provide documentation regarding potential vulnerabilities, backdoors, and alleged "tracking and positioning" and "remote shutdown" technologies within the chips. This inquiry follows reports of US lawmakers advocating for mandatory built-in location reporting systems on advanced chips exported from the country, aiming to combat smuggling and export loopholes. The situation underscores escalating tech tensions and security concerns between the US and China over the control and use of advanced AI hardware.</p>

          <p>UK airlines are demanding explanations from NATS, the air traffic control provider, following a system outage that caused widespread flight cancellations and groundings across the UK.

Airlines like EasyJet expressed profound disappointment, while a Ryanair executive called for NATS chief executive Martin Rolfe's resignation, citing a similar major outage in August 2023.

          <p>Archaeologists have identified the earliest direct biochemical proof of betel nut consumption in Southeast Asia, dating back 4,000 years, through advanced scientific analysis of dental plaque. Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) on ancient calculus from a Neolithic burial site in Thailand, researchers detected psychoactive compounds like arecoline in an individual with no visible tooth discoloration. This innovative method, requiring only tiny samples, predates previous evidence by at least 1,000 years and offers new insights into prehistoric practices. The discovery challenges assumptions that visible evidence is always necessary and opens avenues for understanding ancient social and cultural habits.</p>

          <p>Meta's shares surged in extended trading after the tech firm posted second-quarter financial results that significantly exceeded analyst expectations, alleviating concerns about its position in the artificial intelligence (AI) race. CEO Mark Zuckerberg's substantial investments in AI infrastructure and talent are proving fruitful, with AI-powered ad recommendations driving increased conversions on Instagram and Facebook. The company reported $47.5 billion in revenue and $7.14 profit per share, and forecasts up to $50 billion in revenue for the current third quarter. Analysts view Meta as a potential "clear winner" in the AI space over the longer term, despite the high capital expenditure plans and near-term cost risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a "Full and Complete" trade deal with South Korea, setting a 15% blanket tariff on South Korean exports to the US, including autos, a significant reduction from the previously threatened 25%. Under the agreement, South Korea will invest $350 billion in key US industries and purchase $100 billion in liquified natural gas and other energy products. However, interpretations of the deal's specifics differ between Washington and Seoul, particularly regarding the allocation of profits from investments and concessions on agricultural products like rice and beef. The agreement marks a departure from previous free trade regimes and aims to strengthen industrial cooperation and the military alliance between the two nations. (not investment advice)</p>

This capital raising initiative follows several other Chinese novel drug developers, including Innovent Biologics and Ascentage Pharma, in tapping Hong Kong's capital markets for funds. The overall bullishness in the sector is largely fueled by mainland investors buying shares in Hong Kong-listed Chinese biotech and pharmaceutical firms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Top Texas Democrats are vehemently criticizing a proposed GOP redistricting plan, calling it "grossly unfair" and "deeply undemocratic," warning it would significantly dilute minority representation and create a nationwide ripple effect. The draft map, supported by President Trump, aims to convert five currently Democratic U.S. House districts into GOP-leaning seats, bolstering the Republican congressional majority. Democrats argue the plan intentionally fractures Black and Latino communities for political gain, risking a backfire due to softening GOP support among Latino voters. This contentious proposal highlights ongoing partisan battles over electoral maps and raises serious concerns about potential voter suppression and its long-term impact on democratic representation.</p>

          <p>A Colorado jury found dentist James Craig guilty of first-degree murder and five other charges for poisoning and killing his wife, Angela, with a lethal cocktail of arsenic, cyanide, and tetrahydrozoline. Prosecutors successfully argued a financial motive, citing a struggling dental practice and $4 million in life insurance policies where Craig was the sole beneficiary, along with extramarital affairs. Angela suffered worsening, unexplained symptoms for days before her death, with Craig administering the final fatal dose after she was hospitalized. The conviction carries an automatic sentence of life in prison without parole, bringing some measure of justice to the victim's family.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's official Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for July contracted more than expected, marking the fourth consecutive month of decline and signaling slower economic growth. The PMI fell to 49.3, missing forecasts, attributed by the National Bureau of Statistics to traditional off-season factors, extreme heat, and torrential rain. Analysts also point to Beijing's "anti-involution" efforts to address overcapacity and the shifting of some orders to lower-tariffed countries like Vietnam due to ongoing US trade tensions. This sustained contraction, coupled with a decline in the non-manufacturing PMI, suggests a worrying economic situation and potential tariff impact from August onwards. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A senior Chinese diplomat, Shi Mingde, former ambassador to Germany, has questioned whether the European Union's recent trade deal with the US will deepen its economic and security dependence on Washington, thereby hindering its pursuit of strategic autonomy. Speaking at an event marking 50 years of China-EU relations, Shi argued that the EU's "de-risking" policy, aimed at reducing reliance on China, is flawed if it leads to greater dependence on the US. Beijing supports Europe's strategic autonomy but views de-risking as an attempt to contain Chinese growth. This perspective highlights the complex geopolitical dynamics and differing interpretations of global trade relationships.</p>
