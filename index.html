          <p>President Donald Trump announced the immediate commutation of former Congressman George Santos' seven-year federal prison sentence, which he was serving for wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Trump justified the decision by citing Santos' alleged mistreatment in solitary confinement and his consistent Republican voting record. The commutation fully releases Santos from all further conditions, including fines, restitution, and supervised release, just months into his original sentence. This article highlights a controversial and high-profile act of clemency for a scandal-plagued former politician, drawing significant public and political attention.</p>

          <p>A leaked hot mic recording from Bill Belichick's former TV show, "Coach," captured him and his girlfriend Jordon Hudson criticizing the graphics team's work. Hudson suggested using "Adobe Photoshop" to improve visuals, while Belichick expressed frustration, stating "they can't do s---." The footage, obtained by "Pablo Torre Finds Out," adds to the ongoing drama surrounding Belichick's embattled season at North Carolina. NFL Films denied leaking the content, emphasizing their trust-based relationship with the coach, highlighting a minor but public gaffe.</p>

          <p>Hamas has handed over the remains of another deceased Israeli hostage to the Israel Defense Forces, which are now undergoing official identification at the National Institute for Forensic Medicine. This transfer is part of a broader Gaza peace plan requiring Hamas to return all remaining hostages, both living and deceased. While 20 living hostages were returned, the retrieval of all deceased remains has been delayed, with Hamas citing difficulties due to extensive rubble from Israeli strikes. This article highlights the ongoing, sensitive process of recovering victims and the complexities of the peace agreement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The North Pacific Ocean recorded its warmest summer ever, with sea surface temperatures significantly exceeding previous highs, according to a BBC analysis. Scientists are perplexed by the mysterious and prolonged marine heatwave, dubbed the "warm blob," despite understanding general climate change trends. This unusual warming could potentially lead to a colder start to winter in the UK due to atmospheric teleconnections. Researchers are exploring various contributing factors, including natural weather variability and recent changes in shipping fuel regulations, underscoring the complexities of climate science.</p>
