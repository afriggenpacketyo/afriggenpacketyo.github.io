        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Premier League has announced the 2025-26 season fixtures, acknowledging the increased likelihood of games being moved with little warning due to the participation of nine English teams in European competitions, including six in the Champions League. This scheduling complexity may cause headaches for managers as they juggle domestic and European commitments, especially with midweek away trips impacting weekend fixtures. England's national team manager will also need to consider Liverpool's challenging pre-international window schedule. Manchester City's new player Rayan Cherki will face Manchester United early in the season, and Arsenal has a tough matchday five with a north London derby and a trip to Chelsea.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid escalating conflict triggered by Israeli strikes on Iranian military and nuclear facilities, the destruction of Iran's nuclear program is a complex undertaking. Iran's hardened Fordow plant is buried deep inside a mountain, making it impenetrable except by the U.S.'s GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, delivered by the B2 Spirit stealth bomber. Experts suggest that even with such a strike, multiple bombing rounds and potential ground deployment would be necessary, and the risk of triggering retaliatory attacks on U.S. assets in the region exists. The situation is further complicated by the debate over whether to limit operations to nuclear sites or pursue broader regime change, adding to the uncertainty in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Iran's UN ambassador, Ali Bahreini, has issued a stern warning to both Israel and the United States, stating that Iran will respond strongly to any Israeli aggression and will not hesitate to defend its people, security, and land. Bahreini accused the U.S. of being complicit in Israel's actions and asserted that Israeli strikes on nuclear sites constitute a war against humanity. These comments come as thousands flee Tehran and other major cities amid ongoing strikes between Israel and Iran.

          <p>The Federal Reserve is anticipated to maintain its benchmark interest rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5% during its meeting, signaling a continuation of its cautious approach. This decision reflects ongoing uncertainty surrounding the economic impact of President Trump's tariffs, despite some improvement in consumer sentiment. While the labor market remains relatively strong, with payroll gains exceeding expectations, inflation ticked up slightly in May. The Fed's decision will be announced at 2 p.m. EST, followed by a press conference with Chairman Jerome Powell, where economic forecasts and potential future interest rate changes will be discussed.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Faced with rising tariffs, businesses are increasingly resorting to "tariff engineering" to reduce their duty liabilities by strategically altering product materials, dimensions, or compositions. This practice, which predates Trump's tariffs, involves reclassifying items under different harmonized system codes to incur lower rates. While most new tariffs are broad-based, exemptions for certain products provide opportunities for companies to benefit through tariff engineering. Companies must carefully navigate the line between redesigning products and misrepresenting classifications to avoid legal repercussions. (not investment advice)</p>

The new law does not change rules governing abortions in a clinical setting and leaves open the possibility of prosecutions for those who assist a woman in getting a late-term abortion. This change is the biggest shift in British abortion laws since the Abortion Act of 1967, which legalized abortion in England, Wales, and Scotland.</p>

          <p>Israel's attacks on Iran's nuclear program have raised questions about the potential use of the U.S. GBU-57 A/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb, also known as the bunker buster. This 20-foot-long, 30,000-pound bomb can penetrate 200 feet into a target before exploding, making it capable of damaging the Fordow facility, which is deep inside a mountain. The U.S. is the only country with access to this weapon and the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber, which can deliver it. The Air Force bombers would take 15 hours to reach Iran from their base in Missouri, though stealth capabilities are less critical due to the damage already inflicted on Iranian air defenses.</p>

Energy Transfer Partners, co-founded by Warren, has reported increased profits and praised the new administration's supportive regulatory environment. Trump's actions, such as ending the pause on liquefied natural gas exports and granting extensions for LNG projects, have boosted Warren's wealth. Appointing fossil fuel-friendly officials has further solidified Trump's allegiance to companies like Energy Transfer Partners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent poll indicates that women, across the political spectrum, are more worried about the state of the U.S. economy and inflation under President Trump than men. Pessimism is higher among women, including Republicans and independents, with 62% of women expressing concerns compared to 47% of men. This gender gap is attributed to women experiencing the direct impact of inflation on essential goods and services. The findings highlight potential challenges for the Trump administration, as women are more likely to vote, and their economic anxieties could influence future elections.</p>

          <p>In Lake Worth Beach, Florida, located near Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago, undocumented and temporary visa migrants are facing increased ICE activity. Since Trump's return to the White House, ICE cars have been patrolling the streets, raiding grocery stores, churches, and schools, leading to deportations and detentions. The Guatemalan-Maya Center, a vital community resource, has become eerily quiet as residents fear arrest or deportation.

However, the team's annual expectation of winning the World Series may override this preference, particularly if vulnerabilities such as the performance of left fielder Michael Conforto persist.
