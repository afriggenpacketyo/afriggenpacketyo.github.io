          <p>Following a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, former President Donald Trump announced he will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House. In a social media post, Trump stated that all parties determined a direct peace agreement is preferable to a ceasefire, which he claimed often fails to hold. This announcement came after a phone call with Zelenskyy and European leaders. The upcoming discussion in Washington D.C. is intended to finalize details of a proposal to end the war, with a potential follow-up meeting with Putin if successful. This development shifts the focus from achieving an immediate ceasefire to negotiating a comprehensive peace treaty.</p>

          <p>China's National Health Commission has disciplined 19 officials from several prestigious medical and educational institutions following a significant public scandal. The disciplinary actions, which include dismissals and severe warnings, were prompted by an incident where a doctor reportedly abandoned a surgery to address a personal matter. Institutions such as the China-Japan Friendship Hospital and Peking Union Medical College were censured and ordered to implement corrective measures. The state-run newspaper People’s Daily praised the swift and serious handling of the situation, stating that it helps restore public trust in the country's healthcare system and its practitioners.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have developed an innovative method to recycle discarded cigarette butts into asphalt, addressing both pollution and infrastructure needs. Cigarette filters, the most littered item globally, can be cleaned, shredded, and mixed with wax to create pellets that reinforce road materials. This process not only diverts toxic waste from the environment but also produces asphalt that is more resistant to heavy traffic and temperature fluctuations. The technique also lowers the energy required for asphalt production, reducing emissions. A city in Slovakia has already begun implementing this technology, demonstrating a practical application that turns a widespread pollutant into a valuable resource for building more durable roads.</p>

          <p>The Sierra Club, a leading U.S. environmental organization, has fired its executive director, Ben Jealous, following an evaluation of his conduct. His tenure was marked by internal conflict, including clashes with staff over major layoffs, criticism for hiring practices, and accusations of stifling dissent. Unionized workers had previously issued a vote of no confidence in his leadership. While the board cited conduct constituting cause for termination, they did not provide specific details. Jealous has defended his record, stating he strengthened the organization's finances and has vowed to contest the board's decision, adding to the ongoing upheaval within the prominent nonprofit group.</p>

This resource has become increasingly vital as the Trump administration has cut federal grants for school psychologists and proposed reductions to programs that fund mental healthcare.

Despite President Trump's earlier statements that he would not be happy without such a deal, he left the meeting empty-handed on that front. Analysts suggest Putin may offer minor concessions later to maintain Trump's goodwill, but for now, he has successfully delayed any immediate consequences while his military campaign continues. The meeting highlighted the challenge for the U.S., as any bilateral agreement between Trump and Putin would likely be unacceptable to Ukraine, which was not a party to the discussions.</p>

          <p>An opinion column in the Los Angeles Times posits that the Trump administration's federal takeover of the Washington D.C. police force is a deliberate distraction. The author suggests the move is intended to shift public attention away from recent revelations that President Trump was briefed on his name appearing in the Jeffrey Epstein files, despite his claims to the contrary. The article argues that the justification of a crime emergency in D.C. is baseless, as the city is experiencing a 30-year low in crime. Instead, the author frames the action as a politically motivated maneuver designed to protect one individual by creating a manufactured crisis, undermining democratic norms in the process.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's deployment of federal forces, including the National Guard and Border Patrol, in cities like Los Angeles and Washington D.C. is raising concerns about an unprecedented use of executive power. Recent events include a high-profile immigration raid in L.A. timed with a news conference by Governor Gavin Newsom, and the federal takeover of the D.C. police force, which the city is legally challenging. Critics and political scientists argue these actions are a test of presidential authority and a political show of force rather than a response to actual emergencies, creating fear and confusion among residents. The administration maintains it is enforcing laws and reducing crime in cities where local Democratic leaders have allegedly failed.</p>

          <p>New research on wild chimpanzees in Uganda suggests that young chimps acquire their combined vocal and gestural communication patterns through social learning from their mothers, not through genetics. Scientists observed that individuals related through their maternal line exhibited similar communication styles, while no such pattern was found with paternal relatives. This finding mirrors how human infants learn from their primary caregivers. The study proposes that this capacity for socially learned communication is an ancient trait that may date back at least six to eight million years to the last common ancestor shared by humans and chimpanzees, offering insights into the evolution of human language.</p>

          <p>Young residents of Washington D.C. are expressing fear and anxiety following the Trump administration's decision to deploy the National Guard and assume control of the city's police department. Teenagers interviewed by NPR stated that the increased presence of federal forces, rather than local crime, makes them feel intimidated and unsafe in their own neighborhoods. This sentiment comes as D.C. officials legally challenged the federal government's actions, which they termed a "hostile takeover." Youth advocates and justice experts argue that the crackdown punishes a wide swath of young people for the actions of a few and ignores the underlying issues that contribute to crime.</p>

          <p>John Cruickshank, the last living recipient of the Victoria Cross from World War II, has passed away at the age of 105. The Aberdeen native was awarded Britain's highest military honor for his valor during a 1944 mission where he piloted a Catalina flying boat. Despite sustaining 72 separate injuries from heavy enemy fire, he successfully destroyed a German U-boat and safely flew his damaged aircraft and injured crew back to base. After the war, he left the RAF for a career in banking and rarely spoke of his wartime experiences, viewing his actions as a matter of duty. His passing marks the end of an era for the 181 individuals decorated with the Victoria Cross during the conflict.</p>

          <p>China's space agency has successfully completed a crucial engine test for its new-generation Long March-10 rocket, a key milestone in its plan to send astronauts to the moon by 2030. The test confirmed that the rocket's 21 YF-100K engines can operate in sync, providing the necessary thrust for a lunar mission. The superheavy launcher is designed to carry a crewed spacecraft and a lunar lander into orbit in separate launches. The two vehicles will then rendezvous before attempting a moon landing. This progress keeps China on track to achieve its ambitious goal of a crewed lunar landing within the decade.</p>

          <p>The summit between Presidents Trump and Putin concluded with no ceasefire agreement, serving primarily as a diplomatic victory for the Russian leader, who was welcomed back onto the world stage. Putin used the platform to reiterate his maximalist demands for ending the war, which amount to Ukrainian capitulation. In contrast, Trump's remarks were brief and vague, failing to mention Ukraine or a ceasefire directly, admitting that while progress was made, "we didn't get there." The meeting ended with Putin extending an invitation to Trump for a future meeting in Moscow, leaving the path to peace in Ukraine more uncertain than ever.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's government is planning to tighten residency requirements for spouses from mainland China, a move described by critics as an "attack" but defended by officials as necessary for national security. The proposed amendment would require mainland nationals to provide notarized proof that they have relinquished their Chinese household registration and passport before being granted residency. President Lai Ching-te's administration has justified the policy by citing escalating threats from Beijing, including infiltration through cross-strait exchanges. The new rules aim to eliminate dual-status ambiguities that the government believes could pose a security threat to the self-governed island.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a crucial 3-2 victory over the San Diego Padres, moving back into a tie for first place in the National League West. The win came at a critical time, as the team had been struggling and had just lost star player Max Muncy to the injured list. Pitcher Clayton Kershaw delivered a strong performance over six innings, supported by solid defense and just enough offense to build a narrow lead. The Dodgers' often-unreliable bullpen managed to protect the lead through the final innings, providing a much-needed morale boost and halting the team's recent slide.</p>
