          <p>Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of Theranos, has lost her bid to have her 2022 fraud conviction reheard by the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. The court denied her request for a rehearing, and no judge requested a vote on a full court rehearing. This leaves the Supreme Court as her last option to undo her conviction for wire fraud related to defrauding investors in her blood-testing startup, Theranos, which shut down in 2018 after a Wall Street Journal story exposed its struggles. Holmes was sentenced to 11 years and 3 months in prison in January 2023.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced the broad outline of a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, marking the first deal since the implementation of 'reciprocal' tariffs in early April. While specifics are still being finalized, the deal aims to increase market access for American exports and reduce non-tariff barriers. Key provisions include maintaining a 10% tariff on UK imports, adjusting tariffs on UK autos, creating new export opportunities for US farmers, and establishing commitments on intellectual property, labor, and the environment. The deal also requires the US to negotiate an alternative arrangement to Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is set to unveil a plan to cut Medicare drug prices based on a "most favored nation" concept, according to sources. The policy, previously attempted during his first term, ties Medicare drug prices to the lowest prices drug manufacturers receive in other countries. The Biden administration abandoned the proposal in 2022 due to court orders and concerns from stakeholders. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suggested the policy's return, citing high prices for drugs like Ozempic in Europe, and defended the administration's decision not to cover weight loss drugs in Medicare and Medicaid due to cost concerns.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan are dangerously escalating their armed confrontation, with both countries reporting attacks on military sites and heavy shelling along their border. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has emphasized the need for immediate de-escalation in calls with leaders from both countries, reflecting international alarm. India claims to have thwarted Pakistani attempts to target Indian military sites with drones and missiles, while Pakistan accuses India of continued aggression and shooting down Indian drones. The conflict, rooted in competing claims over Kashmir, follows a terrorist attack that killed 26 civilians, further complicating efforts to de-escalate the situation.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers in swing districts are facing tough votes on legislation that would cut popular programs to finance President Trump’s agenda. Representative Gabe Evans, representing a swing district in Colorado, is involved in drafting legislation that could significantly impact Medicaid. The Republican budget resolution requires the Energy and Commerce Committee, where Evans sits, to slash spending by $880 billion over the next decade, largely through reductions to Medicaid, the government program providing health insurance for lower-income Americans. This creates a dilemma for Republicans who must balance supporting the president's agenda with the potential backlash from constituents who rely on these programs.</p>

          <p>Representative Buddy Carter of Georgia has announced his candidacy for the Senate, challenging Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff in 2026. This announcement comes after Governor Brian Kemp decided not to run for the seat. Carter is positioning himself as a staunch supporter of President Trump and focusing on cultural issues, including transgender rights, to appeal to voters. He has also invested significantly in TV advertising to highlight his stance and criticize Ossoff's voting record, particularly on border security and transgender athletes. The race is expected to be competitive, as Georgia has shifted back to its Republican roots after Ossoff's 2021 victory.</p>

The kangaroo was seen hopping down a busy road before being captured by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission with the assistance of a licensed kangaroo facility owner. Hickory was tranquilized and taken to a wildlife preserve until the owner's enclosure complies with local codes. This incident follows a similar event in Alabama where a kangaroo shut down an interstate highway, highlighting the challenges and regulations surrounding exotic animal ownership.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists are revising their forecasts for interest rate cuts as President Trump’s tariffs raise the risk of higher inflation and slower economic growth. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell has emphasized the need to wait and see how Trump’s policies impact the economy before adjusting interest rates. The Fed's decision to extend a pause on rate cuts reflects uncertainty about the effects of tariffs on inflation and growth. Economists now predict the Fed may hold off on cutting rates until September or later, potentially requiring more aggressive cuts later to support the economy. President Trump has criticized Powell, calling him a “fool” for not lowering rates.</p>

Boeing shares rose following the U.K.'s agreement to purchase airplane parts, including a $10 billion Boeing procurement. Goldman Sachs also performed well, possibly due to investor anticipation of increased dealmaking activity as trade uncertainty diminishes. Goldman Sachs president John Waldron expressed optimism about a potential rebound in capital markets activity due to a strong backlog and pipeline for deals.</p>

The deal does not alter the UK's digital services tax on US firms, but the UK and US have agreed to work on a digital trade deal.

          <p>Archer, a Southern California snack food company, is opening a new meat snacks factory in Vernon, in the former Farmer John plant, creating more than 200 jobs. The $30 million facility will focus on producing beef and turkey meat sticks, with plans to operate three shifts a day and produce 36 million pounds of meat sticks annually.

          <p>Donald Trump has withdrawn Ed Martin as his candidate for the top federal prosecutor role in Washington DC, following opposition from a key Republican senator. Martin, a staunch supporter of Trump's election fraud claims, faced criticism for his views on the January 6th insurrection and his association with controversial figures. Senator Thom Tillis cited Martin's support for pardoning January 6th rioters as a primary concern. The withdrawal was welcomed by Democrats, who questioned Martin's temperament and judgment. Martin's interim appointment is set to expire soon, prompting the search for a new candidate.</p>

          <p>President Trump unveiled a trade framework with the United Kingdom, adjusting tariffs on steel, aluminum, and automobiles. The agreement maintains a 10% tariff on imported goods from most foreign countries. In exchange, the U.K. will ease trade barriers targeting products such as ethanol, beef, and machinery, creating $5 billion in additional market access. The U.S. also secured a $10 billion purchase of Boeing airplane parts and a secure supply chain for pharmaceuticals. Trump described the agreement as beneficial for both countries, while acknowledging that final details are still being worked out.</p>

          <p>Graham Parsons, a philosophy professor at West Point, has resigned, citing the academy's shift away from core educational principles under the Trump administration. Parsons criticized the institution for censoring its curriculum to align with the administration’s ideological preferences, following directives prohibiting instruction on “un-American” theories. Courses dealing with race, gender, and power dynamics were removed, and influential authors were dropped from syllabi. A new policy also required professors to seek approval before publishing or speaking publicly about their academic work. Parsons argues that these changes prevent him from doing his job responsibly and compromise the academy's mission.</p>

          <p>New York City's tourism agency has revised its 2025 forecast, projecting a decline in visitors primarily due to negative sentiment among foreign travelers. The agency now estimates 64.1 million tourists, a decrease from the earlier forecast of 67.6 million, driven by 800,000 fewer international travelers. This decline is attributed to President Trump's trade policies, immigration crackdown, and comments about annexing other countries. While domestic travel is expected to increase, the decrease in foreign visitors is projected to reduce tourism spending by $4 billion. The agency is marketing the city abroad under the campaign “With Love + Liberty, New York City” to counter negative perceptions.</p>
