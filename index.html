          <p>This article discusses how Hong Kong can contribute to defending the rules-based international order amidst significant global shifts, particularly concerning the evolving relationship between the United States and China. It notes that some Western perspectives view China's economic practices as disruptive, citing an imbalance where China produces excessively while consuming too little, leading to manufacturing overcapacity. The article suggests Hong Kong, with its unique position and understanding of both Western and Chinese systems, can play a crucial role in mediating and promoting a more balanced global economic order. The author emphasizes the importance of Hong Kong leveraging its strengths to foster international cooperation and uphold the principles of fair trade and mutual respect.</p>

          <p>Oliver Widger, an Oregon man, completed a weeks-long sailing journey to Hawaii with his cat, Phoenix, after quitting his job and using his retirement savings. Widger, who gained a large online following documenting his trip, was greeted by cheering fans and Hawaii's Governor Josh Green at the Waikiki Yacht Club. Widger's decision to pursue his dream was motivated by a diagnosis of Klippel-Feil syndrome, a condition that carries a risk of paralysis, and a desire to escape his disliked managerial job. His journey was not without challenges, including a rudder failure, but he also experienced moments of tranquility and connection with nature.</p>

Unions have voiced concerns regarding outsourcing to private companies, while the opposition Conservatives are urging Labour to fulfill their promises.

It offered a comprehensive history of sexual assault across centuries and examined its use as a wartime tactic, significantly impacting society's attitude toward sexual assault and leading to legal reforms.</p>
