          <p>Ozzy Osbourne, the legendary frontman of the pioneering heavy metal band Black Sabbath, has passed away at the age of 76. His family confirmed his death, which came just weeks after a farewell concert and a public battle with Parkinson's disease. Known as the "Prince of Darkness," Osbourne's career spanned from the genre-defining albums of Black Sabbath to a highly successful solo career and later fame as a reality TV star. He leaves behind a monumental legacy, having been inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame twice for his profound influence on generations of musicians.</p>

          <p>For individuals struggling with high-interest credit card debt, debt forgiveness programs can offer significant relief by potentially reducing balances by 30% to 50%. However, qualifying for these programs requires specific actions and, just as importantly, avoiding certain missteps. This article advises against continuing to make minimum payments, as it signals an ability to pay, and warns against misplacing crucial paperwork that proves financial hardship. It also cautions individuals not to accumulate more debt simply to meet the minimum threshold required for program eligibility, as better alternatives may exist for smaller debt amounts.

Manager Sarina Wiegman supported the decision, emphasizing the need for different actions to address the issue. The crowd also showed support by applauding for Carter, who wears the number 16, in the 16th minute of the match.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Baltimore has permitted lawyers to pursue contempt proceedings against the Trump administration for failing to comply with a court order. The order required the return of a 20-year-old Venezuelan migrant, "Cristian," who was wrongfully deported to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador. Despite the order, the administration subsequently deported him from El Salvador to Venezuela as part of a prisoner swap without notifying the court. Judge Stephanie Gallagher, a Trump appointee, stated there is a basis for sanctions, calling the administration's actions an "egregious violation" of her directive.</p>

          <p>In a rare move, federal judges in New Jersey have used their judiciary power to sideline interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, a former personal lawyer for President Trump.

Habba was installed by Trump in March but had not been confirmed by the Senate, and her interim appointment period was expiring.

The rally was driven by chatter on social media forums like WallStreetBets, with massive trading volumes and heightened options activity. The stock's high short interest, with about 22% of its float sold short, likely contributed to the rapid price increase as short sellers were forced to cover their positions, a phenomenon known as a short squeeze.

According to Trump, the agreement includes a 19% U.S. tariff on Philippine goods, while Manila will not impose any tariffs on American imports. The announcement came shortly after a White House meeting with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who cited the need to modernize his country's military due to regional tensions. As of the announcement, the government in Manila has not officially confirmed the details of the deal, leaving some uncertainty about its final terms and implementation.</p>

          <p>DuPont received a significant boost after China's market regulator announced the suspension of its antitrust investigation into the company's Chinese operations. The probe, which began in April and was viewed as potential retaliation for U.S. tariffs, had created a major overhang on the company's stock. While the investigation concerned a relatively small portion of DuPont's business, it raised fears of broader implications for its electronics division and upcoming corporate breakup. The suspension of the probe removes a key uncertainty for investors ahead of the company's planned split in November, contributing to a rally in its shares. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russia's lower house of parliament, the State Duma, has approved a controversial bill that will impose fines on internet users for searching for online content deemed "extremist" by authorities. The legislation, which passed with a large majority, would fine individuals up to 5,000 rubles for accessing materials on a government list that includes thousands of items. The bill has drawn criticism from both opposition activists, who were arrested while protesting it, and some pro-government figures. It remains unclear how the law will be enforced and whether internet service providers will be responsible for monitoring user activity.</p>

          <p>Arsenal is reportedly on the verge of signing Swedish striker Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting in a deal valued at £63.5 million. While personal terms have been agreed upon for a five-year contract, negotiations between the clubs over the structure of add-on payments have slightly delayed the finalization. Gyokeres has been a top target for manager Mikel Arteta, who is eager to add an elite center-forward to his squad. The 27-year-old striker had an exceptional season in Portugal, scoring 54 goals in 52 games, and his signing would be a major boost to Arsenal's attacking options.</p>

          <p>While a Certificate of Deposit (CD) remains a reliable, fixed-rate savings option, the interest-earning potential has decreased over the past year. This article calculates the difference in earnings on a $20,000 deposit, showing that current rates, while still substantial, are lower than the highs of 2024. For example, a 3-year CD could have earned over $3,600 a year ago, compared to approximately $2,600 now. Despite the decline, today's rates are still significantly higher than they were a few years ago, making CDs an attractive option for savers seeking predictable returns before potential future rate cuts.

The move was met with anger by Welsh Conservative leaders, who said voters would feel "let down." The defection is a significant development in Welsh politics, where recent polls suggest Reform is gaining ground, and it comes amid an ongoing standards investigation into Jones.</p>

GM's CFO argued that while Tesla is dominant in a few narrow segments, its lack of diversity makes it vulnerable to volatile EV demand. In contrast, GM's ability to produce both gas and electric vehicles provides flexibility to meet customer needs as the market shifts, especially with the impending end of federal EV tax credits. While GM's EV sales doubled year-over-year, they still represent a small fraction of its total vehicle sales. (not investment advice)</p>

Set to be available by July 2026, the plan calculates monthly payments as a percentage of a borrower's adjusted gross income, ranging from 1% to 10%, with a $10 minimum. It offers loan forgiveness after 30 years. As the legislation also phases out several existing repayment plans, RAP may become the primary affordable choice for new borrowers, who will have to choose between it and a standard 10-to-25-year fixed payment plan.
