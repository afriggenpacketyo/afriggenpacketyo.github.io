          <p>Microsoft has significantly bolstered its artificial intelligence division by hiring approximately two dozen employees from Google DeepMind in recent months, including prominent figures like Amar Subramanya and Adam Sadovsky. These key individuals are integrating into Microsoft's consumer-oriented Copilot assistant and Bing search engine teams, which are led by former DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman. This aggressive talent acquisition highlights the intense competition among tech giants for top AI expertise, as companies offer substantial incentives to attract leading researchers and engineers. The strategic recruitment aims to accelerate Microsoft's advancements in artificial intelligence and solidify its competitive position in the rapidly evolving global market.</p>

          <h2>AARP Survey Shows Increasing Retiree Reliance on Social Security Amidst Program Challenges</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 12:52:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new AARP survey reveals that two-thirds of retirees now heavily depend on Social Security for income, a significant increase from 2005, highlighting the program's growing importance. This increased reliance comes as Social Security faces critical challenges, including recent staffing cuts and a projected payment reduction by 2034, which is leading to declining public confidence in its future reliability. Despite widespread concern about solvency, 96% of Americans view the program as essential, with younger generations expressing the most pessimism about its long-term outlook. The survey also found that many Americans lack a basic understanding of how to maximize their Social Security benefits.</p>

          <p>Howard Phillips, a 65-year-old British man from Essex, has been found guilty of attempting to spy for what he believed were Russian intelligence agents. Phillips, who reportedly "dreamt about being like James Bond," offered to provide personal information about former defence secretary Sir Grant Shapps to undercover British intelligence officers. He attempted to pass on a USB drive containing a document where he claimed he would be "invaluable" to a foreign power, offering "100% loyalty and dedication." Phillips will be sentenced at a later date, with prosecutors emphasizing their commitment to prosecuting anyone who poses a threat to the UK.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The High Court has ruled that the estate of deceased tech tycoon Mike Lynch and his business partner owe Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) £700 million. This decision stems from HPE's 2011 acquisition of Lynch's tech firm Autonomy, with the court finding that Autonomy's finances were misrepresented, leading HPE to overpay for the company. Lynch, who tragically died last year when his yacht sank, had consistently denied the claims, asserting that HPE had "botched the purchase." A further hearing in November will determine whether Lynch's estate can appeal the ruling and how damages will be divided.</p>

          <p>Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche is scheduled to meet with Ghislaine Maxwell, the convicted associate of Jeffrey Epstein, in the coming days. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that President Trump has directed the release of all credible evidence, and the Justice Department and FBI will hear any information Maxwell has regarding individuals who committed crimes against victims. This development follows growing calls from lawmakers for Maxwell to testify, even as the DOJ actively opposes her efforts to appeal her 2022 conviction for sex trafficking and aiding Epstein's sexual abuse of underage girls. Maxwell's legal team confirmed discussions, stating she will "always testify truthfully."</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump continued his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell but indicated he is backing away from any lingering plans to fire him, noting Powell's term ends in May 2026. Trump accused Powell of poor performance, particularly regarding interest rates, suggesting political motivations for keeping them "too high" and hindering home purchases. The White House also raised concerns about the Fed's $2.5 billion building renovation project, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent advocating for an internal investigation into the central bank's "mission creep" and spending beyond its core monetary policy.</p>

          <p>UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy has condemned Israel's conduct in Gaza, signaling potential further action if the war's pursuit does not change. While the UK is not a primary arms supplier, it has approved over £500 million in export licenses to Israel since 2015, including components for F-35 jets extensively used in Gaza. Despite some license suspensions, F-35 parts remain exempt due to their global manufacturing program, a decision critics call an "enormous loophole." The UK also co-developed the Hermes drone, though its RAF surveillance flights over Gaza are solely for locating hostages, with no military intelligence shared with the IDF.</p>

The piece argues that the current political climate fosters a form of humor where one laughs "with" powerful figures or out of fear, emphasizing a shift towards insular, self-referential humor where only certain laughter counts.</p>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has reshuffled her senior team, appointing Sir James Cleverly as shadow housing secretary, a prominent role where he will face Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner. This larger-than-expected shake-up also includes Kevin Hollinrake becoming party chairman and Stuart Andrew moving to shadow health. The reshuffle aims to reflect the party's "policy renewal program" and demonstrate unity under Badenoch's leadership, following poor local election results and consistent low polling for the Conservatives. This move signals an attempt to reinvigorate the party's image and policy direction.</p>

          <p>A four-year-old child was attacked by a mountain lion while hiking in Washington state's Olympic National Park, but was heroically saved by their father who pulled the child from the animal's jaws. The child was airlifted to a trauma center in Seattle and has since been discharged in satisfactory condition. Park rangers tracked and euthanized the collared cougar the following morning. Mountain lion attacks on humans are extremely rare, with experts noting that these animals generally avoid people, though sightings have increased as cougar populations rebound in the region.</p>

          <p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has described the level of destruction in Gaza as a "horror show," unprecedented in recent times, with the humanitarian system in its "last gasp." The UN reports over 1,000 Palestinians killed while trying to access food aid since the US and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation began operations. German Development Minister Reem Alabali Radovan and French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot have also strongly condemned Israel's actions, calling for an immediate and sustainable ceasefire and unimpeded aid flow into Gaza.

This crisis follows Israel's full blockade on Gaza, with aid organizations deeming current supplies vastly insufficient.

          <p>The Trump administration has announced the US will again withdraw from UNESCO, accusing the UN agency of supporting "woke, divisive cultural and social causes" and promoting "anti-Israel rhetoric." UNESCO's Director General Audrey Azoulay called the decision "regrettable but anticipated," noting the US's "America First" foreign policy is at odds with multilateralism. This move, effective December 2026, follows previous US withdrawals from international bodies like the WHO and Paris Climate Agreement. It also reverses a prior UNESCO rejoining under the Biden administration, highlighting a fluctuating US engagement with global cultural and educational cooperation.</p>

          <p>Shares of department store Kohl's surged over 30% in volatile trading, reminiscent of recent meme stock rallies, despite no apparent corporate announcements. The stock's dramatic rise, which saw it more immense before paring gains, is attributed to its characteristics as a heavily shorted legacy retailer with name recognition among retail investors on platforms like Reddit's Wall Street Bets. This activity suggests a potential short squeeze, where investors buying heavily shorted stock force those with short positions to cover, driving prices higher, even as Kohl's business struggles with falling sales and increased competition.
