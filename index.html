          <h2>German Parliament Report Questions Legality of Israeli Strikes on Iran</h2>

          <p>A report from the research services of the German parliament, the Bundestag, has raised "substantial doubt" about the legal justification for Israel's recent military strikes against Iran. The analysis, commissioned by a Left Party lawmaker, suggests that the strikes may not meet the criteria for self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter. According to the report, a majority of international law experts believe Israel has not sufficiently proven that Iran posed an imminent threat of a nuclear attack. The findings create a point of contention within Germany, as Chancellor Friedrich Merz had previously expressed strong support for Israel's actions.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of thousands of people gathered in Cologne for the annual Christopher Street Day (CSD) parade, one of Europe's largest LGBTQ+ pride events. Organizers anticipated around 60,000 active participants and 90 floats for the demonstration, which celebrates diversity and advocates for queer rights. The event, held under the motto "For queer rights. Many. Together. Strong," traces its origins to the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York. While the celebration in Cologne was massive, a smaller pride event in eastern Germany was met with peaceful counter-protests from far-right groups.</p>

          <h2>Republican Efforts Target Mail-In Ballots That Arrive After Election Day</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-06 07:40:16 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump and the Republican party are intensifying efforts to disqualify mail-in ballots that are received after Election Day, a practice currently allowed in many states. Citing unsubstantiated claims of fraud and a desire for faster election results, Republicans have pursued legislative changes and lawsuits to enforce a strict Election Day deadline. At least three states have already eliminated their grace periods for ballot receipt, while a related provision in Trump's executive order on elections is currently being challenged in court. Proponents of the grace period argue that it is a secure and necessary process, ensuring all valid, timely-cast votes are counted.</p>

          <p>China has implemented a retaliatory measure blocking European Union companies that do not have operations in China from participating in large government medical device contracts. The new restriction, which took effect Sunday, applies to contracts valued at over $6.3 million and also limits non-EU companies from allocating more than half of a contract's value to EU-imported devices. China's Ministry of Commerce described the move as a last resort, stating it followed repeated but unsuccessful attempts to resolve differences over government procurement through bilateral dialogue. This action signals escalating trade tensions between Beijing and the EU in the critical healthcare sector.</p>

Harrison, who co-hosts a new podcast called "Stall Talk," said she often felt uncomfortable with the "sex symbol" label during her career but viewed it as part of the job. By appearing clothed, she joined a small group of women, including Dolly Parton, who were featured in the magazine without being nude, asserting control over her own image.</p>

          <p>Far-right influencer Laura Loomer has emerged as a powerful, albeit unofficial, adviser to President Donald Trump, particularly on national security matters. Despite holding no formal government position, she has reportedly had direct access to Trump, influencing personnel decisions and pushing for ideological purges within the National Security Council, leading to the firing of several staffers. Her influence has been met with alarm by national security professionals and bipartisan critics, who view her as a conspiracy theorist. Loomer's strong support for Trump's recent strike on Iran is seen as a move to solidify her position, demonstrating that for many MAGA influencers, loyalty to Trump overrides previous "America First" isolationist stances.</p>

Kennedy Jr. Researchers fear his long-held, disproven theories linking autism to vaccines and "environmental toxins" are sidelining decades of established genetic research and fueling public distrust. Kennedy's rhetoric, which frames autism as a "catastrophic epidemic" and a "disease," has also been criticized by autistic advocates and parents for being stigmatizing and outdated.

          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has stated that the government's recent reversal on planned welfare reforms has made future spending decisions "harder." The statement comes as the government faces pressure to scrap the two-child benefit cap, a policy limiting benefits for families with more than two children. While a child poverty taskforce is considering the cap's removal, which could lift 500,000 children out of poverty, the significant cost is now a greater challenge after the government abandoned other welfare cuts that would have saved £5 billion annually. The situation highlights the fiscal constraints and difficult choices facing the new Labour government. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States has deported eight men, who had been convicted of various crimes, to South Sudan following a contentious legal battle. The move is notable as only one of the men is a South Sudanese national, with the others being from countries that reportedly refused to accept them. This action is part of the Trump administration's effort to expand deportations to third countries. The deportation proceeded after the Supreme Court overturned a lower court's ruling that would have granted the men due process hearings. The fate of the men is uncertain in South Sudan, a country the U.S. State Department warns against traveling to due to instability and conflict.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that California's aggressive environmental regulations are paradoxically leading to negative outcomes for both consumers and the environment. The closure of in-state oil refineries, driven by policy, is reducing supply and increasing reliance on imported fuel from countries with lower environmental standards, resulting in a net increase in global pollution. These policies also create higher, regressive gas prices that disproportionately harm working-class families who cannot afford electric vehicles. The author contends that the state's approach is creating an energy system that is both economically unjust and strategically vulnerable, urging for a more pragmatic and realistic transition away from fossil fuels.

          <p>An in-depth article examines the reasons behind the relative silence from the American evangelical community regarding the Trump administration's effective shutdown of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). The program, initiated by George W. Bush and credited with saving 26 million lives, has seen its operations hobbled, leading to clinic closures and an estimated 75,000 deaths so far. The analysis suggests that factors like political loyalty to Trump, a general distrust of government programs, compassion fatigue, and a historical framing of HIV/AIDS as a consequence of sin have contributed to the lack of outcry from a movement that often describes itself as "pro-life."</p>

          <p>Bobby Jenks, a former two-time All-Star pitcher for the Chicago White Sox, has passed away at the age of 44. His death was caused by a rare form of stomach cancer. Jenks was a key member of the 2005 White Sox team that won the World Series, ending an 88-year championship drought for the franchise. He famously threw the final pitch to secure the victory in game four of the series against the Houston Astros. The White Sox organization mourned his death, with chairman Jerry Reinsdorf calling him an "iconic member of the White Sox family."</p>

          <h2>French Intelligence Alleges Chinese Diplomatic Campaign to Discredit Rafale Fighter Jets</h2>

          <p>A French intelligence assessment concludes that China used its foreign embassies to actively undermine the reputation and sales of France's flagship Rafale fighter jet. The report alleges that Chinese defense attachés spread disinformation about the jet's performance following its use in the May clashes between India and Pakistan. This diplomatic lobbying reportedly targeted countries that have purchased or are considering purchasing the Rafale, encouraging them to opt for Chinese-made aircraft instead. The effort is seen by French officials as part of a broader campaign to damage France's strategic partnerships and national image, particularly in Asia where China's influence is growing.</p>

          <h2>Questions Arise Over Adequacy of Warnings Ahead of Deadly Texas Floods</h2>

          <p>Following the deadly flash floods in Texas that killed over 50 people, scrutiny has fallen on the timeliness and effectiveness of the warnings issued to residents. While forecasting agencies state they sent alerts hours in advance, some local officials and residents claim the predictions did not convey the extreme severity of the storm, which saw the Guadalupe River rise with unprecedented speed. Kerr County's top official noted that the community had no reason to expect such a catastrophic event, highlighting a disconnect between meteorological forecasts and on-the-ground preparedness. The incident has sparked a debate about the reliability of weather prediction technology and communication systems during extreme weather events.</p>

          <h2>Breakthrough Gene Therapy Jab Shows Promise in Reversing Congenital Hearing Loss</h2>

          <p>A new gene therapy has shown remarkable success in reversing a form of congenital deafness, with a single injection improving hearing in all 10 participants of a clinical trial. The therapy targets a genetic mutation in the OTOF gene, which prevents the transmission of sound signals to the brain. Researchers delivered a functional copy of the gene into the inner ear, with some patients, particularly children, experiencing rapid and significant hearing recovery within months. One seven-year-old participant regained nearly full hearing. The successful and safe trial represents a major step forward for treating genetic deafness, with researchers now aiming to target other common genes responsible for hearing loss.</p>

          <p>Thousands of followers, including actor Richard Gere, gathered in Dharamshala, India, to celebrate the 90th birthday of the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism. During the week-long festivities, he reassured followers of his good health and confirmed that the tradition of his reincarnation will continue after his death, a move seen as a challenge to China's insistence on controlling the selection process. The Dalai Lama, who has lived in exile since 1959, used the occasion to advocate for peace and compassion. The event highlights the ongoing tension between the Tibetan government-in-exile and Beijing over Tibetan autonomy and cultural preservation.</p>

          <h2>Durham Shopkeeper Questions Justice System After Shoplifter Avoids Criminal Charges</h2>

          <p>A shop owner in Durham who personally apprehended a shoplifter expressed frustration after the thief avoided a criminal conviction. The offender, who had attempted to steal a crate of beer, was dealt with through a community resolution, which required him to pay for the stolen goods and banned him from the store. The shopkeeper, Andrew Board, argues that this lack of formal punishment sends the wrong signal and fails to deter repeat offenses, a sentiment that reflects a national trend where a majority of reported shoplifting cases do not result in charges. The incident highlights the ongoing debate over how to effectively tackle rising retail theft.</p>
