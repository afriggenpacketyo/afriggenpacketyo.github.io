          <p>The U.S. maintains its August 1 deadline for imposing higher tariffs on the European Union, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirming the 30% baseline tariff will take effect. While talks can continue post-deadline, the U.S. insists on immediate tariff payments. The EU is preparing retaliatory measures, despite U.S. dismissal of their impact. Economists express skepticism about the EU securing a deal similar to the UK's, highlighting the bloc's complex relationship with the U.S. President. The EU is considering its most powerful trade tool, the anti-coercion instrument, signaling a tougher stance to secure a favorable agreement.</p>

          <p>Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche has publicly supported interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, urging New Jersey district court judges to extend her tenure beyond the upcoming 120-day deadline. Habba, nominated for a full term, faces opposition from Democratic senators and has a tumultuous record, including investigations into state Democrats and past statements about "turning New Jersey red." Despite controversy and no prior law enforcement experience, Blanche asserts her "steady leadership" and "sound judgment" are backed by the DOJ and the president. The judges' decision on her continued service is pending.</p>

          <p>A SkyWest Airlines pilot performed an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a potential mid-air collision with a U.S. Air Force B-52 bomber while on approach to land in Minot, North Dakota. The pilot, who had been cleared for landing, spotted the military aircraft on a converging course without prior notification from air traffic control, which lacks radar. Passengers described a sudden jolt, and the pilot later apologized for the unexpected action, calling it "not normal at all." Both SkyWest and the Federal Aviation Administration are investigating the incident, which underscores concerns about commercial and military flight communications.</p>

          <p>Russia and Ukraine have escalated their cross-border drone attacks, with both sides reporting high numbers of interceptions and impacts, as potential ceasefire talks loom. Russia claimed to have downed over 100 Ukrainian drones, causing airport disruptions in Moscow, while Ukraine reported intercepting over 400 Russian drones and missiles, resulting in at least two deaths and 15 injuries across multiple regions. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has called for renewed talks to achieve a ceasefire and address prisoner and child returns, while also ordering an expansion of Ukraine's offensive drone capabilities.

          <p>Lawyers for Kilmar Abrego Garcia have requested a 30-day delay in his potential release from criminal custody, should a judge deny the Justice Department's bid to keep him confined. This pause would allow him to assess legal options against likely deportation efforts by the Department of Homeland Security. Abrego Garcia, indicted on human smuggling charges, was previously deported to El Salvador in an administrative error despite a withholding of removal order. His return to the U.S. to face criminal charges has created a complex legal situation, with ongoing civil proceedings in Maryland also challenging his potential removal.</p>

          <p>Despite the growing popularity and increased investment in women's football across Europe, Eastern European nations, with the exception of Poland's recent debut, have largely failed to qualify for major tournaments like Euro 2025. Experts attribute this lag to a combination of historical factors, including a late start in establishing women's programs and a lack of investment compared to Western Europe. Societal norms, which often discourage female participation in sports, and the lingering effects of post-communist economic struggles also contribute to the disparity. UEFA initiatives are helping, but significant cultural and infrastructural changes are still needed for the region to catch up.</p>

While fixes are available for SharePoint Server 2019 and Subscription Edition, an older 2016 version remains vulnerable as engineers work on a patch.

Fare also urged regulator Ofcom to take stronger action against social media platforms under the Online Safety Act, which mandates protection against harmful content. This decision sparks debate on the effectiveness of symbolic gestures versus the need for concrete regulatory enforcement against online hate.</p>
