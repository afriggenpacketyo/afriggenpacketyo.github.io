          <p>A prominent immunologist warns that the United States is entering a 'post-herd-immunity world' due to declining vaccination rates, as a significant measles outbreak centered in west Texas spreads to neighboring states and impacts communities with low vaccination rates in Mexico and Canada. The article emphasizes the contagiousness of measles and the potential for increased infection rates due to the spread of misinformation about vaccines, fueled by figures like Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Despite the availability of a highly effective MMR vaccine, the outbreak underscores the importance of maintaining high vaccination coverage to prevent the resurgence of preventable diseases.</p>

          <p>This New York Times guest essay by psychiatrist Awais Aftab discusses the complexities surrounding antidepressant use, highlighting that while these medications can be transformative for some, many patients experience challenging side effects and severe withdrawal symptoms. Despite the widespread use of SSRIs, there is a lack of high-quality research guiding clinicians on safely tapering patients off these drugs, leaving many to seek guidance from online communities. The article emphasizes the need for more research into the long-term effects of antidepressants and better support for patients experiencing withdrawal, urging the medical community to engage seriously with patients' concerns.</p>

Reform UK aims to cut funding for climate change initiatives and Diversity, Equality, and Inclusion programs, focusing instead on essential services like social care and infrastructure.
