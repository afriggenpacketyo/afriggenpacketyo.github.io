            <p>The UK Supreme Court is set to rule on a landmark challenge concerning the legal definition of a woman, stemming from a dispute between a women's rights group and the Scottish government. The case centers on whether a transgender person with a gender recognition certificate can be legally considered a woman under equality laws, particularly regarding female representation on public boards. While the case focuses on Scottish law, its outcome could have wider implications for sex-based rights across the UK, impacting single-sex services and protections. The ruling is expected to address arguments around biological sex versus gender identity in legal contexts.</p>

            <p>A new report warns that increasing demand for data centers, driven by AI, could lead to higher utility bills for U.S. consumers due to special contracts and overbuilt infrastructure. In the U.K., proposed electricity market reforms may also raise wholesale prices, potentially benefiting data centers at the expense of consumers. Experts suggest tighter regulations and energy grid reforms are needed to manage energy prices and ensure data centers pay fairly for their energy usage. The discussion also includes the potential for data centers to benefit from zonal pricing depending on the flexibility of their operations.</p>
