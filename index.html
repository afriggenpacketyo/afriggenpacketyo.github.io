          <p>Central Texas is grappling with the devastating aftermath of flash floods that have claimed at least 81 lives, including 28 children, and left 41 individuals missing. Kerr County, where a riverside Christian girls' camp was deluged, accounts for the majority of fatalities and ongoing search efforts, with the Guadalupe River rising an alarming 26 feet in just 45 minutes. Rescue operations are now shifting towards recovery, complicated by forecasts of additional storms and hazardous conditions, including venomous snakes. President Trump has issued a major disaster declaration for Kerr County, mobilizing federal assistance, while local communities and international figures like Pope Leo XIV offer support and prayers for the affected.</p>

          <p>The United States has finalized the deportation of eight men, previously convicted of violent crimes, to war-torn South Sudan following weeks of complex legal challenges. These individuals, originating from various countries, were initially held at an American military base in Djibouti after a federal judge temporarily halted their removal. However, a Supreme Court ruling and a subsequent decision by a Boston judge ultimately cleared the path for their transfer. Homeland Security officials have characterized this completion as a significant victory for the rule of law and the safety and security of the American people, despite State Department advisories against travel to South Sudan due to conflict.</p>

          <h2>German Wildfires Under Control as Poland Implements Border Checks</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wildfires that wreaked havoc across Germany's eastern states, particularly Thuringia, are now reportedly under control after a tense weekend for firefighters, with the situation easing as cooler weather follows a major heatwave. Concurrently, Poland has initiated random border checks at 52 crossings with Germany and Lithuania, a move contrary to the Schengen zone's spirit. This action responds to Germany's stricter border controls, implemented to combat illegal immigration, which Polish nationalist and far-right politicians claim are overwhelming their country with migrants. German officials have already refused entry to many asylum-seekers at the Polish border, highlighting ongoing tensions over migration policy within the EU.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to amend the Employment Rights Bill, extending bereavement leave entitlements to parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy. This significant change will provide a legal right to at least one week of time off for grieving, expanding current provisions that only apply after 24 weeks or the death of a child under 18. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner emphasized that no one should return to work before they are ready after such a heartbreaking loss. Campaigners, including Labour MP Sarah Owen and the Miscarriage Association, have widely welcomed this as a crucial step towards recognizing early pregnancy loss as a bereavement, moving beyond the previous reliance on sick leave.</p>

          <p>A 14-member team of UK engineers has arrived in Thiruvananthapuram, India, to assess and repair a state-of-the-art British F-35B fighter jet that has been stranded at an airport for over three weeks. The advanced stealth jet, valued at $110 million, was diverted due to bad weather during a sortie in the Indian Ocean and subsequently reported a technical snag, preventing its return to the HMS Prince of Wales. Its prolonged presence on Indian soil has sparked public curiosity and become the subject of jokes and memes. Experts suggest that if the team is unable to repair the aircraft for flight, it will have to be dismantled and transported by a larger cargo plane.</p>

          <p>China is expected to increase production of its home-grown C919 aircraft and expand access to foreign markets, following the United States' removal of a ban on selling American jet engine parts and technology to Chinese buyers. This bilateral agreement allows Shanghai-based Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) to import crucial components from a GE-invested joint venture. Analysts emphasize that access to these engines, which China does not yet mass-produce domestically, is vital for Comac to fulfill its hundreds of aircraft orders at its current pace. The deal is crucial for Comac's ambitions in the European market, though past export restrictions by the Trump administration may still harden Beijing’s resolve to accelerate the development of indigenous engines and other critical components.

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened an additional 10% tariff on countries that align themselves with what he terms 'Anti-American policies of BRICS,' without elaborating on specific policies. This announcement came as the BRICS group, comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, and newly added members like Iran, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, held a meeting in Rio de Janeiro. The bloc's leaders implicitly criticized Trump's sweeping tariff policies in a joint statement, warning against 'unjustified unilateral protectionist measures' that distort trade. Trump's stance is likely a reaction to BRICS' stated goals of challenging Western-dominated institutions and the U.S. dollar's global role, signaling escalating trade tensions.

The primary focus for the two leaders is winding down the nearly two-year war with Hamas, a discussion bolstered by their recent collaboration in attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities. Trump previously indicated Israel's agreement to a 60-day ceasefire, to which Hamas has responded positively but seeks further details, particularly regarding a permanent end to the conflict. This meeting also presents an opportunity for Israel to forge new diplomatic ties, possibly including a security pact with Syria, amidst a rapidly transforming Middle East landscape following recent regional conflicts.</p>

Trump called the move 'ridiculous' and stated Musk had gone 'completely off the rails,' arguing that third parties only create disruption and chaos in a two-party system. This marks a significant falling out between the former allies, who previously collaborated on government efficiency initiatives. Trump also took aim at Musk's past advocacy for an 'Electric Vehicle Mandate,' which conflicts with the president's recent tax and spending bill that ended EV tax credits, claiming Musk had no issue with this during his endorsement.</p>

          <p>Leaders of the expanded BRICS group, now including Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Indonesia, met in Rio de Janeiro, reaffirming their commitment to multilateral diplomacy. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva emphasized the need for international governance to reflect the new multipolar reality of the 21st century, also criticizing NATO's defense spending targets. The bloc's joint statement voiced 'serious concerns' about U.S. President Donald Trump’s 'indiscriminate' tariff policy, which they believe distorts trade and threatens global economic development. Notably, Chinese President Xi Jinping opted out of attending in person, sending Premier Li Qiang, while Russian President Vladimir Putin participated via videoconference due to an International Criminal Court warrant.

          <p>A breakthrough gene therapy involving a single injection could reverse hearing loss in individuals within weeks, according to new research from Sweden’s Karolinska Institutet. Clinical trials, detailed in the journal Nature Medicine, demonstrated that injecting a healthy copy of the OTOF gene into the inner ear significantly improved hearing in all 10 participants, including children and adults with congenital deafness caused by OTOF mutations. One seven-year-old girl quickly regained almost full hearing, able to hold daily conversations after just four months. The treatment was found to be safe and well-tolerated, with researchers expressing confidence that similar therapies could eventually treat other common genetic causes of deafness.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick have announced that new U.S. tariffs will now take effect on August 1, extending a previously announced 90-day pause set to expire on July 9. This delay has sparked confusion among importers and financial markets, with Asian stock markets experiencing a slight slip on Monday. Trump stated that 'TARIFF Letters, and/or Deals' would begin delivery on Monday, including an additional 10% tariff on countries aligning with 'Anti-American policies of BRICS.' Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that many trade agreements are close to being finalized, with letters also sent to over 100 smaller countries, signaling continued pressure for new trade deals.

          <p>UK ministers are facing strong calls from campaigners, charities, and parents to maintain education, health, and care plans (EHCPs) for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND). EHCPs are legally binding documents ensuring vital support, and campaigners warn that abolishing them could deny thousands of children access to education. While the government acknowledges the 'complex and sensitive area' and states no decisions have been made, they have not explicitly ruled out scrapping EHCPs. Critics accuse the government of 'broken promises,' emphasizing that families cannot afford to lose these crucial legal protections, despite recent data showing a significant increase in the number of EHCPs in place and new plans initiated.</p>

          <p>South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa is addressing a 'grave national security concern' after a top police officer accused the police minister and other senior officials of interfering in political assassination investigations. Lieutenant General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi alleged obstruction of justice to shield politically connected individuals and impede organized crime work, specifically claiming the minister disbanded a task team that uncovered links between cartels, politicians, and police. Police Minister Senzo Mchunu has denied these 'insinuations made without evidence.' Lawmakers across the political spectrum are demanding swift action, with calls for an urgent parliamentary debate, charges against the minister, or an independent commission of inquiry, highlighting deep concerns about the integrity of the South African Police Service amidst high crime rates.</p>

          <p>Israel has launched airstrikes on three ports and a power plant in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, confirming targets included the commercial ship Galaxy Leader, which was hijacked by the rebel group in 2023. Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz stated the strikes were part of 'Operation Black Flag' and warned of severe consequences for those who harm Israel, equating Yemen's fate to Tehran's. Following the Israeli attacks, two missiles were launched from Yemen into Israel, triggering sirens in several areas, with interception results under review. The Israeli Air Force justified the strikes as a response to 'repeated attacks' by Houthis on Israel and its citizens, alleging the targeted ports were used for Iranian weapon transfers to carry out terror plans.</p>
