          <p>A new global report on rhinoceros populations reveals a varied outlook for the world's five species. The numbers of critically endangered Black rhinos and greater one-horned rhinos have shown encouraging growth, marking a positive step for conservation. However, the situation remains dire for Indonesia's Javan and Sumatran rhinos, whose populations are on the verge of extinction due to poaching and habitat loss. The report also notes a slight decline in white rhino numbers in Africa, underscoring the persistent and evolving threat of illegal poaching.</p>

          <p>An article from the BBC details the complex story of Margaret 'Big Mags' Haney, a Scottish grandmother who gained fame in the 1990s as a self-styled anti-paedophile vigilante. While celebrated by the media for her community activism, she was secretly the matriarch of a notorious crime family. Her public persona eventually crumbled when an undercover investigation exposed her as the head of a massive heroin dealing operation, leading to a 12-year prison sentence. The report explores her dual identity and lasting, complicated legacy, questioning why her drug empire operated for so long.</p>

          <p>Israel's Security Cabinet has officially approved a military proposal to expand its operations and take control of Gaza City, one of the last areas in the territory not fully occupied by its forces. The decision comes amid widespread international condemnation and a worsening humanitarian crisis, with the UN reporting a state of famine. While the government outlined long-term goals including the disarmament of Hamas and the release of hostages, the plan has deepened divisions within Israel and drawn pleas for a ceasefire from hostage families who fear for their loved ones' safety.</p>

          <p>Brandon Russell, the founder of a Florida-based neo-Nazi group, has received a 20-year federal prison sentence for conspiring to attack the power grid in Baltimore, Maryland. The plot, which he planned with his girlfriend, aimed to cause widespread blackouts and societal chaos to advance their white supremacist ideology. During sentencing, the judge described Russell as the "intellectual horsepower" behind the plan to target a majority-Black city. The case highlights ongoing federal efforts to combat right-wing domestic terrorism, a threat that officials have increasingly prioritized.</p>

          <p>The agency that runs courts in England and Wales, HMCTS, is facing accusations of a cover-up over a persistent IT bug that caused legal evidence to be lost or overwritten for years. A leaked internal report reveals that management knew about the software flaw but chose not to inform judges or lawyers, fearing it would cause "more harm than good." Sources claim this could have led to miscarriages of justice in thousands of civil, family, and tribunal cases. The situation has drawn comparisons to the Post Office Horizon scandal, raising serious concerns about transparency and accountability within the justice system.</p>

The controversy, dubbed France's "Water-gate," involves allegations of a cover-up between parent company Nestlé and the French government. The affair raises questions about the sustainability of the bottled water industry amid climate change and could force Perrier to lose its "natural mineral water" label.</p>

In some regions like the Cascade Range, the season now starts 46 days sooner than it did in the early 1990s. Researchers linked this trend to rising average temperatures, which lead to earlier snowmelt and drier conditions for flammable vegetation.

          <p>President Trump announced he will host the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan at the White House for a historic peace summit to formally end their long-running conflict. The meeting is expected to result in the signing of a peace agreement between the two nations, which have been at war for years over the Nagorno-Karabakh region, resulting in thousands of deaths. The Trump administration stated it has been engaged with both sides for some time to broker the deal. This represents a significant diplomatic breakthrough in a protracted and violent regional dispute.</p>

          <p>The Southern Small White butterfly, a species historically found only in Southern Europe, has been officially recorded in the United Kingdom for the first time. A volunteer photographed the butterfly in Suffolk, confirming its rapid northward expansion across the continent, which has seen it move hundreds of kilometers in just over a decade. While a warming climate is believed to be a contributing factor, scientists say the species' migration has been far faster than predicted. The sighting is a notable event for conservationists tracking the impact of environmental changes on wildlife distribution.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has directed the Commerce Department to develop a new census that would exclude undocumented immigrants from the official population count used for congressional apportionment. This move reignites a contentious debate from his first term, as the Constitution mandates an "actual enumeration" of all persons. Changing the census is a lengthy process with massive political and economic repercussions, as it determines the allocation of congressional seats and federal funding. The announcement signals a renewed effort to reshape how the U.S. population is counted, a move certain to face significant legal challenges.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly called for the immediate resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, causing the company's stock to fall. In a social media post, Trump labeled the CEO "highly CONFLICTED" but did not provide specific details. The demand follows a letter from Senator Tom Cotton, who raised concerns about Tan's alleged business ties to Chinese companies, including some with links to the Chinese military. The president's intervention injects significant political pressure into the corporate leadership of one of America's most critical technology companies, highlighting tensions over national security.

          <p>Police records from Las Vegas show that the man who killed four people in a New York City shooting had a history of mental illness and was twice placed on emergency psychiatric holds. However, these incidents did not legally prevent him from purchasing firearms, including the AR-15-style rifle he used in the attack. In Nevada, temporary mental health holds are not automatically reported to the national background check system. The case highlights a significant gap in gun control laws, sparking a debate over whether "red flag" laws are being used effectively to prevent individuals in crisis from accessing weapons.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is auctioning off the Amadea, a 348-foot superyacht valued at over $300 million that was seized from a sanctioned Russian oligarch. The vessel, which features a helideck, a mosaic pool, and a marble fireplace, is being sold via a sealed-bid auction with a starting deposit of $10 million. The seizure and sale are part of a broader U.S. strategy to put financial pressure on Russian elites close to President Vladimir Putin in response to the war in Ukraine.

          <p>A growing number of people, particularly millennials and Gen Z, are moving away from dating apps and seeking romantic connections through old-fashioned, in-person events. Organizers of singles events report a surge in attendance, driven by a widespread fatigue with the impersonal nature of swiping and the potential for misrepresentation online. Many users crave face-to-face interaction and the chance to gauge chemistry in real time. This trend is reflected in the declining market value of companies like Bumble, signaling a potential shift in the modern dating landscape back towards more traditional methods of meeting people.</p>

          <p>According to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Americans get an average of 55% of their daily calories from ultra-processed foods. These foods, such as sweetened beverages, packaged snacks, and burgers, are typically high in salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats while being low in fiber and whole foods. The consumption rate is even higher among young people, at nearly 62%. The findings are concerning as previous research has linked high consumption of ultra-processed foods to a greater risk of 32 adverse health outcomes, including cancer, heart disease, and early death.</p>

Tonka, a former celebrity animal actor, was found in a small cage and has since been relocated to a sanctuary.
