            <p>A US judge has ruled that Google holds an illegal monopoly in online advertising technology, stating the tech giant engaged in anticompetitive practices. The ruling marks Google's second antitrust case loss in a year, following a similar ruling on online search dominance. The US Department of Justice argued Google abused its position, stifling innovation and harming publishers. Google plans to appeal the decision, contesting the findings related to its publisher tools while claiming victory on other counts, arguing that its acquisitions and advertiser tools do not harm competition.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump has criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, urging the central bank to lower interest rates and expressing impatience for the end of Powell's term.

            <p>Tax attorneys report that the IRS is struggling due to staff cuts, leading to fewer audits of wealthy individuals and corporations. Recent firings and buyouts have significantly reduced the agency's capacity to investigate complex tax returns.

A Yale Budget Lab study estimates that enduring IRS staff cuts could result in a substantial loss of tax revenue over the next decade.</p>

            <p>A Pew Research Center survey indicates that American attitudes towards China have softened for the first time in five years. The percentage of Americans viewing China as an “enemy” has decreased from a record high of 42% to a third, although overall negative attitudes remain prevalent at 77%. This shift occurred after President Trump announced new tariffs on Chinese imports, but before a further escalation of tariffs. Christine Huang from Pew notes that this is the first significant year-over-year decline in negative sentiment since 2020.</p>

            <p>Precision Neuroscience, a rival to Elon Musk's Neuralink, announced that its Layer 7 Cortical Interface has been cleared by the FDA. This marks the first full regulatory clearance granted to a company developing a wireless brain-computer interface (BCI). The device, a microelectrode array thinner than a human hair, can record, monitor, and stimulate electrical activity on the brain's surface. The FDA authorized the implant for use in patients for up to 30 days, allowing Precision to market the technology for clinical use and collect data for longer periods.</p>

            <p>Campaigners warn that the UK Supreme Court's ruling on the definition of a woman could have dire consequences for the safety and well-being of trans people.

            <p>A Turkish PhD student at Tufts University, Rümeysa Öztürk, has been denied bail after being detained by ICE for co-authoring an op-ed about Gaza. The DHS case against Öztürk is based solely on a State Department memorandum revoking her visa due to her co-authorship of the op-ed. Her legal team argues that her detention is unconstitutional as she is being punished for protected speech. They have filed a petition in federal court seeking her immediate release, citing concerns about her health in detention.</p>

            <p>Hungary's parliament has passed a constitutional amendment that allows the government to label LGBTQ+ gatherings as a threat to children and revoke the citizenship of dual nationals deemed a risk to national sovereignty. This move is seen as a crackdown on dissent and an attempt to ban Budapest Pride, the largest recurring human rights demonstration in Hungary. Critics view this as another step in Orbán's dismantling of democracy and a cynical political ploy to distract from domestic crises. Organizers of Budapest Pride have vowed to continue with the event despite the threats.</p>
