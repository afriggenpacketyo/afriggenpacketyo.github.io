        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Honda's operating profit for the first quarter fell by half, significantly missing analyst estimates due to the impact of U.S. auto tariffs and a stronger yen. Despite the profit plunge, the company's revenue exceeded expectations, and it raised its full-year profit forecast, anticipating that the negative effects of the tariffs will be less severe than previously thought. Honda plans to mitigate the tariffs by leveraging its existing U.S. manufacturing presence and potentially increasing stateside production, including for its new energy vehicles. The company's motorcycle division, however, posted a record quarterly profit, buoyed by strong sales in markets like Brazil and Vietnam. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Global mining and trading firm Glencore has concluded its review and decided to maintain its primary stock market listing in London, providing a significant boost to the London Stock Exchange. The company determined that a move to New York would not create additional value for shareholders at this time, despite a trend of other major firms leaving London for higher U.S. valuations. This decision comes as Glencore reported a first-half net loss of $655 million, nearly triple the previous year, citing lower commodity prices and tariff uncertainties. The company has initiated a $1 billion cost-cutting program to address the financial downturn. (not investment advice)</p>

The announcement from organizers and Benn's promoter comes after a previously agreed-upon September date was cancelled due to concerns about Eubank's readiness.

          <p>Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk reported a 67% increase in sales for its popular weight-loss drug, Wegovy, in the second quarter, though this figure fell slightly short of analyst expectations. The company is facing challenges from increased competition, disappointing trial results for a new obesity drug, and pressure from the U.S. government to lower prescription drug prices. In response to recent stock price declines, Novo Nordisk has announced plans to implement cost-cutting measures and enhance its commercial focus. The company has reiterated its full-year financial outlook despite slashing its U.S. sales growth forecast for Wegovy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The BBC has proceeded with broadcasting a new series of MasterChef that was filmed before its hosts, Gregg Wallace and John Torode, were fired over misconduct allegations. The decision has faced backlash from groups like the broadcast union Bectu, although the BBC stated it was the right choice for the contestants involved. The new episodes have been edited to minimize the hosts' banter and one contestant was removed at her own request. UK Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy commented that she would not be watching, reflecting the public controversy surrounding the show's return under these circumstances.</p>

          <p>Authorities in the eastern German city of Dresden have ordered the evacuation of approximately 17,000 people to facilitate the defusal of a 500-pound British bomb from World War II. The unexploded ordnance was discovered during demolition work on the Carola Bridge, which partially collapsed last year. The evacuation zone includes several hotels and the city's historic Frauenkirche, a major landmark. This marks the second such mass evacuation in Dresden this year, highlighting the persistent danger of unexploded bombs in Germany even 80 years after the war's end. The city was heavily bombed by Allied forces in February 1945.</p>

          <p>Meghan Markle faces a renewed legal challenge from her estranged half-sister, Samantha Markle, who is appealing the 2024 dismissal of her defamation lawsuit. An oral argument has been scheduled for September, bringing the family feud back into the public eye. Royal experts suggest this ongoing legal dispute could hinder Prince Harry's reported efforts to reconcile with the British royal family, who are said to be wary of further public controversies. The original lawsuit, which Samantha Markle lost, centered on claims that Meghan defamed her in interviews, including the 2021 special with Oprah Winfrey, by stating she grew up as an only child.</p>

JPMorgan analysts raised their price target for HSBC's stock, suggesting it could reach HK$122 by the end of 2026. The report indicates that HSBC's strong capital buffer will protect its dividend payments from potential impairments related to its stake in China's Bank of Communications.

          <p>In a recent interview, U.S. President Donald Trump used a sports analogy to describe the large-scale investment pledges from the European Union and Japan, likening them to a "signing bonus" a baseball player receives. Trump claimed he secured a $550 billion "signing bonus" from Japan and a $600 billion investment from the EU that he can use as he wishes. This rhetoric is part of his framing of recent trade deals, which lowered tariffs on EU and Japanese imports in exchange for these financial commitments. When pressed for details, the president asserted the funds were a "gift" and that failure to deliver would result in higher tariffs.</p>

          <p>A BBC Verify analysis reveals that Russia has more than doubled its missile and drone attacks on Ukraine since President Donald Trump took office in January, despite his calls for a ceasefire. The escalation followed a sharp increase in attacks that began in late 2024. This intensification of Russia's air campaign coincides with its expanded domestic production of munitions and two temporary pauses in U.S. military aid to Ukraine ordered by the Trump administration. Critics, including some U.S. senators, suggest these factors may have emboldened Moscow, while Ukrainian civilians face the growing daily threat of aerial bombardment.</p>

          <p>Despite growing awareness and some national restrictions, global production of new plastic is projected to potentially triple by 2050, continuing a rapid expansion. Derived almost entirely from fossil fuels, the plastic industry's growth serves as a lifeline for oil and gas companies and significantly contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. This article highlights that while the European Union has seen a slight decrease, production capacity is increasing in the U.S., China, and Southeast Asia. International efforts to cap production have been met with resistance from a small group of petro-states, creating a major obstacle in global negotiations to address the plastic pollution crisis.</p>

          <p>A leading economic think tank, NIESR, has warned that UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves must implement tax increases to cover a projected £41.2 billion shortfall in public finances. The report suggests that without such measures, the government will fail to meet its self-imposed borrowing rules, which require debt to be falling as a share of national income within five years. NIESR recommends a sustained tax increase, potentially through council tax reform or extending the freeze on income tax thresholds, to stabilize the UK's finances. This puts the Chancellor in a difficult position, caught between her fiscal rules and Labour's manifesto promise not to raise key taxes on working people. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Great Barrier Reef has suffered its most significant annual decline in live coral cover on record, according to a new report from the Australian Institute of Marine Science. The massive loss is attributed to an unprecedented mass coral bleaching event in early 2024, driven by extreme ocean heat stress linked to climate change. Surveys revealed that the northern and southern regions of the reef were hit hardest, with coral cover dropping by as much as one-third. Scientists warn that the reef is showing increased volatility, a clear sign of an ecosystem under severe stress from the impacts of global warming.</p>

A primary obstacle is the complexity of the NFL playbook, which one former player described as more difficult to learn than law books. Another major factor is the 'planet theory,' which posits that for skill positions like running back, there is a vast pool of athletically gifted players, making it hard for newcomers to stand out. Unlike linemen, whose rare size is a premium, skill players must possess unparalleled athleticism and rapidly develop a high 'football IQ' to succeed.</p>

          <p>Ranchers in northern Mexico are struggling with a severe economic crisis following the United States' suspension of live cattle imports due to concerns over the New World Screwworm. This flesh-eating parasite, found in southern Mexico, has prompted the U.S. to halt imports for the third time in eight months, devastating a cattle export business worth $1.2 billion last year. Compounded by a punishing two-year drought, the ban has forced ranchers in the state of Sonora to sell cattle domestically at significant losses and diversify into other ventures like beekeeping to survive. The situation highlights the vulnerability of the cross-border agricultural economy.</p>

          <p>In a first-person account, 87-year-old Buscarita Roa shares her story as one of the last two active members of the Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo (Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo). For nearly 50 years, the group has searched for the hundreds of babies stolen during Argentina's 1976-83 military dictatorship. Roa recounts the disappearance of her son, his wife, and their eight-month-old daughter Claudia in 1978, and the desperate, decades-long search that followed. She was reunited with Claudia in 2000 and now reflects on the group's legacy, as the next generation continues the search for the nearly 300 grandchildren who remain missing.</p>

          <p>A 39-year-old man is bringing a High Court challenge against London's Metropolitan Police after he was wrongly identified as a wanted suspect by live facial recognition (LFR) technology. Shaun Thompson described the experience of being stopped and aggressively questioned outside a Tube station as "stop and search on steroids." The case, supported by the privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, is the first of its kind in the UK. It comes as the Met Police plans to double its use of LFR, arguing the technology is crucial for catching dangerous offenders, including those accused of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed a 41% tariff rate on Syria, the highest for any country, creating a new economic obstacle for the war-torn nation. This move comes less than three months after President Trump announced the lifting of long-standing U.S. sanctions, a step intended to aid Syria's recovery under its new transitional government. While bilateral trade is minimal, analysts say the steep tariff sends a calculated message and psychologically undermines the international effort to support Syria's reconstruction. The policy is seen as a way for Washington to retain economic leverage over the new government as it navigates immense challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks continued their strong performance, securing a 100-91 victory over a surging Indiana Fever team that was playing without its injured star, Caitlin Clark. The win marks the Sparks' seventh in their last eight games, a streak fueled by the team's return to full health after more than a year of roster instability. Guards Kelsey Plum and Rickea Jackson led the Sparks with 25 points each, while the team's defense was bolstered by the return of Cameron Brink, who recorded five blocks. The game was briefly interrupted when a sex toy was thrown onto the court from the stands.</p>

The agreement, which still requires final negotiations and regulatory approval, marks a major strategic partnership between the two sports media giants. This framework concludes nearly five years of discussions and positions ESPN to further solidify its market dominance by integrating more of the NFL's valuable and popular programming.</p>

          <p>China is encountering a significant challenge in its race to build a satellite internet network to rival SpaceX's Starlink due to a shortage of domestic rocket launch capacity. The state-backed Guo Wang project has recently accelerated its launches, signaling it has national priority for the limited supply of Long March rockets. This has left competing private projects, like Shanghai's Qianfan, to seek launches from emerging private rocket companies to deploy their own constellations. This divide between national projects and ambitious private ventures highlights the infrastructure bottleneck that could force Beijing to favor one candidate in its quest to compete in the low-Earth orbit internet race.</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened to place Washington, D.C., under federal control if the city does not address its crime problem, following an alleged attempted carjacking involving a former government staffer. The incident involved Edward Coristine, a former member of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), who was allegedly assaulted by a group of teenagers. Two 15-year-olds were arrested for the unarmed carjacking attempt. In response, Trump posted on social media that crime in the capital is "totally out of control" and that he would "exert my powers, and FEDERALIZE this City" if the situation does not improve quickly.</p>

The decision has been condemned by infectious disease experts, who called the move dangerous and short-sighted, warning it will hinder the ability to respond to future pandemics.

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has filed a lawsuit with the state's Supreme Court seeking to remove Democratic Caucus Chair Gene Wu from office. Abbott accuses Wu of being the "ringleader" of a legislative walkout where dozens of Democrats fled the state to deny Republicans the quorum needed to vote on a contentious redistricting plan. The governor argues that the lawmakers abandoned their duties and forfeited their positions. In response, Wu stated that denying the quorum was a fulfillment of his constitutional oath to oppose a "racist gerrymandered map," not an abandonment of his office, which belongs to his constituents.</p>
