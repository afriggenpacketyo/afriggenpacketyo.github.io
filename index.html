          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has signed a bill that critics argue significantly weakens the country's independent anti-corruption bodies, such as NABU and SAPO. The new law has sparked public protests in major cities, including Kyiv, with demonstrators expressing fears of a regression in democratic progress. The move has also drawn concern from international partners like the European Union, as robust anti-corruption measures are a critical requirement for Ukraine's potential EU membership.</p>

          <p>The International Court of Justice is preparing to deliver a historic advisory opinion regarding the legal obligations that countries have to protect the climate from human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. The case was initiated by a group of vulnerable island nations, led by Vanuatu, that face existential threats from rising sea levels. While the court's decision is non-binding, it is poised to set a significant legal precedent that could shape future climate litigation and international environmental policies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has announced a new trade framework with Japan, establishing a 15% tariff on Japanese imports, which is a reduction from a previously threatened 25% rate. The agreement reportedly includes a $550 billion investment from Japan into the U.S. and a commitment to open its markets further to American products like automobiles and rice. This deal is part of a broader push by the administration to secure new trade agreements, though concerns persist about the wider economic effects of tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

Researchers successfully matched the bite marks to an extinct, five-meter-long crocodilian species known as Purussaurus neivensis. This rare fossil provides direct evidence of predator-prey interaction in the ancient ecosystem, revealing that even apex predators like the giant flightless bird were vulnerable to ambush attacks.</p>
