          <p>The Scottish Parliament is preparing for a crucial vote on a bill that would legalize assisted dying for terminally-ill adults, marking the third time such proposals have been debated. The bill, championed by Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur, includes strict eligibility criteria, requiring mental fitness assessments by two doctors and raising the minimum age to 18. While supporters argue it eases suffering, opponents, including First Minister John Swinney and former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, voice concerns about safeguarding vulnerable individuals and potential coercion. The vote is expected to be closely contested, with MSPs granted a free vote on the matter.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has ruled that the IRS can share immigrants' tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to identify individuals illegally in the U.S. This decision follows a lawsuit by nonprofit groups arguing that undocumented immigrants deserve the same privacy protections as citizens and legal residents. The judge stipulated that DHS and the IRS must adhere to strict limitations, requiring ICE to provide the name and address of the person, the time span of the information, and the relevance of the data to criminal investigations. This ruling comes after controversy and resignations within the IRS over the Trump administration's decision to share taxpayer data.</p>

          <p>Following a surprise trade truce between the U.S. and China, several investment banks are increasing their growth outlooks for China's GDP. The agreement involves temporarily halting the majority of tariffs on each other's products for 90 days, with mutual tariffs reduced from 125% to 10%. UBS, Morgan Stanley, and ANZ Bank have all adjusted their forecasts upwards, anticipating increased exports and production due to the lower tariffs. This revision marks a significant shift after earlier tariff escalations had prompted banks to lower their China growth projections. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following trade talks between the U.S. and China, tariff rates have been lowered, reducing the triple-digit duties imposed since April. While the headline changes include reduced tariffs for the next 90 days, the new effective tariff rate for Chinese exporters is estimated to be around 50%, factoring in previous tariffs and the new duties still in force. This reduction is expected to provide some relief to Chinese manufacturers and exporters, particularly for products destined for the U.S. market, but the overall impact will vary depending on the specific product.</p>

The UN and leading aid groups reject Israeli claims that Hamas steals and controls food, and the commissioner states that food and humanitarian assistance is indeed being used to meet the political or military objective in the context of Gaza.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Liquid Water Exists in Martian Crust Based on 'Marsquake' Data</h2>

          <p>Research analyzing seismic waves from "marsquakes" detected by NASA's InSight lander suggests that liquid water may exist in rock a few kilometers beneath the surface of Mars. The study reveals a mysterious zone in the planet's crust best explained by a layer of water-saturated rock. If confirmed, this underground layer could contain a substantial amount of water, potentially matching what scientists believe to be Mars' missing water. The findings offer insights into Mars' water cycle and the potential for habitable environments on the planet.</p>

          <p>German companies, which invest heavily in the United States, are rethinking their strategy due to President Trump's tariffs. A survey by the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry indicates a decline in sentiment among German manufacturers with U.S. factories. Many German firms are keeping investments at home, hoping to capitalize on infrastructure investments and a new government focused on reducing bureaucracy. The automotive sector, particularly BMW and Mercedes-Benz, has been significantly affected by the tariffs, prompting them to consider shifting production.</p>

          <p>Australian pension funds, managing A$4.2 trillion, are reconsidering their long-held strategies of investing in U.S. assets and the dollar due to waning confidence in American growth. Volatility surrounding Sino-U.S. trade tensions and the dollar's failure to act as a safe haven have prompted the reassessment. Currency dealing desks have noted modest changes in hedging demand from some pension funds. Industry-wide hedging on foreign equities was roughly 22% in the December quarter, according to the most recent regulatory data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India has proposed levying import duties on some products made in the United States to counter Washington's tariffs on steel and aluminum products. The proposed suspension of concessions would take the form of increased tariffs on selected U.S. products. India's move comes as the two countries are set to potentially finalize a trade deal, with New Delhi offering to reduce the tariff gap by two-thirds. U.S. President Donald Trump has unleashed sweeping global tariffs since taking office earlier this year, including imposing levies on steel and aluminum imports.</p>

          <p>The second Trump administration is facing increased scrutiny for allegedly blurring the lines between public office and personal benefits, surpassing concerns raised during his first term. The plan to accept a $400 million luxury jet from the Qatari royal family exemplifies this trend. The administration's actions reflect a disregard for traditional legal and political guardrails, including ethical norms and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The president's personal business dealings, such as the $TRUMP meme cryptocurrency, are under scrutiny as well.</p>

          <p>President Trump's offer to mediate the Kashmir dispute between India and Pakistan has placed India in a tight spot. India has historically opposed third-party mediation in the dispute, treating Kashmir as an integral part of its territory.

While Pakistan has welcomed Trump's offer, India has remained firm in its stance against third-party involvement, reaffirming its commitment to bilateral negotiations.</p>

He said China was willing to work with countries in the face of rising geopolitical tensions and bloc confrontations and the “surging undercurrents of unilateralism and protectionism”.</p>

          <p>One of the most anticipated auctions of the season proved to be anticlimactic, reflecting the economic uncertainty surrounding President Trump’s tariffs and their potential impact on the global art market. Louise Riggio consigned nearly 40 works from the collection she built with her husband, the Barnes & Noble founder Leonard Riggio. The top lot of the Riggio sale was a 1922 gridded painting by Mondrian that had once greeted visitors in the grand entryway of the bookstore tycoon’s Park Avenue apartment. It sold for $47.6 million, including fees.</p>
