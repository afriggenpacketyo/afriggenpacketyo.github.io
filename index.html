          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested an Iranian father in the parking lot of his child's preschool in Oregon, sparking community outrage. ICE stated the man overstayed his visa and resisted arrest, necessitating breaking a car window to detain him. However, an immigration lawyer claims the man was in legal status, having applied for a green card after marrying a U.S. citizen and awaiting a final decision. The incident has drawn criticism for its chaotic and traumatic nature, occurring just feet from where children were playing.</p>

          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, gaining a crucial stake in Guyana's extensive offshore oil reserves. The deal was finalized after an international arbitration panel ruled against Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the region. The decision affirms that such rights at the asset level do not apply to corporate-level mergers, a significant precedent for the industry. Chevron's CEO indicated that the integration of the two companies will likely result in some headcount reductions.</p>

          <p>The price of ether and shares of companies like Coinbase and Robinhood climbed significantly following the passage of the GENIUS Act, the first major cryptocurrency legislation in the United States. While Bitcoin's value remained steady, Ether saw its strongest two-week gain since 2021, suggesting a potential shift in crypto market leadership. The new law, which now heads to the president, establishes a regulatory framework for stablecoins and is seen as a symbolic and foundational step for the industry's integration into the U.S. financial system. This development is expected to provide more stability and clarity for the digital asset market. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent deadly sectarian violence in southern Syria highlights a major strategic disagreement between the United States and Israel regarding the country's new government. The U.S., through its special envoy, has advocated for a strong, centralized Syrian state under President Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former jihadist leader. In contrast, Israel remains distrustful of Sharaa and has supported local rivals like the Druze minority, fearing a unified Syria could pose a threat. This divergence in policy contributed to a bloody conflict in Sweida province, which escalated to include Israeli airstrikes on Damascus, complicating diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <p>A CBS News investigation revealed that TikTok's platform makes hundreds of videos promoting extreme weight loss, restrictive diets, and cosmetic surgery easily accessible to users under 18. This occurs despite the company's own policies designed to restrict such content from minors. After interacting with a few such videos, the test account for a hypothetical 15-year-old was recommended similar harmful content on its "For You" feed. Critics argue this demonstrates a systemic failure to protect young users, as the platform's algorithms can amplify dangerous messages about body image and eating disorders.</p>

The move is intended to offer competition and backup for star player Bukayo Saka and bolster an attack that struggled with injuries last season.

          <p>U.S. consumer sentiment saw a slight increase in July, while expectations for future inflation fell to their lowest levels since February, according to the University of Michigan's consumer survey. The one-year inflation outlook dropped to 4.4% from 5% in June, and the five-year outlook also declined, suggesting that consumers' worst fears about tariff-induced price hikes have subsided. Despite this improvement, expectations remain above pre-2025 levels, indicating that consumers still perceive a risk of future inflation. Economists view the trend as encouraging for the Federal Reserve, as well-anchored inflation expectations are a key factor in monetary policy decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For retirees who are "house rich but cash poor," a reverse mortgage can be a tool to supplement Social Security benefits and improve monthly cash flow. Homeowners aged 62 and older can convert home equity into a steady income stream, a lump sum, or a line of credit without having to make monthly repayments. This can help cover daily expenses, manage unexpected healthcare costs, or even allow a retiree to delay claiming Social Security to receive a larger future benefit. While it can provide financial flexibility, it's a significant decision that requires careful consideration of its terms and long-term implications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from her new book "Me, But Better," author Olga Khazan describes her decision to tackle her introversion and social anxiety by enrolling in an improv comedy class. As a self-described introvert, she found the experience of "yes, and" and warm-up games like "Zip Zap Zop" to be both foreign and terrifying. Despite her initial discomfort and skepticism, she recognized the class as a "rehab for perfectionists," where making mistakes was encouraged. The experience served as a commitment device to force her out of her comfort zone as part of a larger project to actively change aspects of her personality.</p>

          <p>A CNBC study on America's competitiveness has identified the ten states with the weakest infrastructure, with Maine ranking as the worst overall. The study evaluated factors including road and bridge conditions, power grid reliability, broadband access, and resilience to severe weather. Maine suffers from the nation's least reliable power grid, while Alaska is plagued by poor internet connectivity, and Hawaii has some of the country's worst roads. Despite recent federal investments, many states, including West Virginia, Mississippi, and Louisiana, continue to struggle with decades of neglect, impacting their economic competitiveness.

          <p>Delta Air Lines and United Airlines are increasingly separating themselves from the rest of the U.S. airline industry, accounting for over 86% of major carrier profits last year. Analysts attribute their success to strong networks, a focus on lucrative international routes, and an emphasis on premium cabin sales and loyalty programs. While the domestic market faces an oversupply of coach seats and falling fares, both airlines have found strength in higher-margin offerings. This strategy has allowed them to better weather challenges like weaker domestic demand and air traffic control issues, positioning them for a stronger year than their competitors.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's harvests of asparagus and strawberries have fallen to their lowest levels in 15 and 30 years, respectively, according to new data. The decline is driven by farmers planting less of these crops, as rising costs, particularly for labor, make production increasingly unprofitable. As a result, Germany's self-sufficiency in strawberries has dropped significantly, and both items are becoming more of a luxury for consumers, with prices rising. The trend highlights the economic pressures on farmers growing seasonal, labor-intensive produce, threatening the availability of these culturally beloved foods.</p>

His posts aim to quell intrigue among his supporters, whom he has recently called "foolish" for believing in a "Democratic hoax" surrounding the case. This messaging comes as Trump also ordered his Attorney General to seek the release of grand jury material related to Epstein, a move following a week of intense pressure from his base to disclose more information.</p>

She was interviewed on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and has been bailed until October. The Crown Prosecution Service had previously suggested the driver may have suffered an epileptic seizure, but the families of the victims, Nuria Sajjad and Selena Lau, have stated they still seek clarity on the devastating event.</p>

          <p>As part of a new law, visitors to the United States requiring a nonimmigrant visa will now have to pay a "visa integrity fee" of at least $250. This new charge is in addition to existing visa application fees and applies to tourists, business travelers, and international students. The provision states the fee may be reimbursed after the visa expires if the holder complies with all visa conditions, such as not overstaying.

          <p>A provision in President Trump's recently enacted "big beautiful bill" creates a new tax break for tipped workers, but its implementation details remain unclear. The "no tax on tips" measure is not a full exemption but rather a federal income tax deduction of up to $25,000, available from 2025 through 2028. The IRS is expected to issue guidance in October on which specific occupations qualify for the break. Tax professionals note that questions remain about how the deduction will work with reporting requirements, especially for cash tips and for workers who may not receive standard tax forms like a 1099-K.</p>
