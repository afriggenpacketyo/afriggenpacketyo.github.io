        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ryan Garcia's defeat against Rolando Romero in New York City has jeopardized a highly anticipated rematch with Devin Haney. Romero secured a unanimous decision victory after Garcia struggled with his timing and punch output, having just returned from a year-long suspension. Garcia admitted that the layoff took a toll on his physical and mental state. Romero's win earned him the WBA's secondary welterweight title, potentially opening doors for a fight with Haney. Haney, who also fought on the card, won against Jose Ramirez by unanimous decision, but his fight with Garcia is unlikely to happen in the near future as a result of Garcia's loss.</p>

          <p>Representative Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat from New Jersey, hinted at the possibility of a third impeachment of President Donald Trump during a campaign event while running for New Jersey governor. Sherrill, who voted for both of Trump's previous impeachments, suggested that further action might be necessary to counter Republican efforts following the 2026 midterms. She emphasized the importance of states challenging Trump's agenda and blocking attempts to meddle in elections, underscoring the role of federalism in safeguarding against potential overreach. Sherrill is competing in the Democratic gubernatorial primary against other prominent figures, with the election scheduled for June 10.</p>

The intervention occurred ahead of a US Federal Reserve meeting where potential interest rate cuts are expected to be discussed. The HKMA indicated that the Hong Kong dollar's strength was driven by equity investment activities and regional currency appreciation, and they will continue to monitor market conditions to ensure orderly market operations.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has initiated a lawsuit against the state of Colorado, the city of Denver, and several local leaders, challenging their "sanctuary" policies. The lawsuit argues that these policies obstruct federal efforts to enforce immigration laws, citing the controversial apartment complex in Aurora allegedly controlled by a Venezuelan gang as an example. The suit seeks to invalidate state and city laws that prevent local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration authorities, claiming they violate the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Local officials have defended their policies, asserting that they comply with all applicable laws.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 25% import tax on key car parts has been implemented in the US, intensifying pressure on the automotive industry amidst policy changes. This tariff, along with the existing tax on imported cars, aims to incentivize domestic manufacturing. However, analysts predict this will likely lead to higher costs for businesses and consumers. While companies have been temporarily shielded by a sales surge, General Motors anticipates billions in new costs due to the tariffs. The policy has caused turmoil, with some car companies withdrawing financial guidance for the year due to uncertainties.</p>

The exemption, which allowed goods under $800 from China and Hong Kong to enter the U.S. without tariffs, fueled the growth of online retailers like Temu and Shein. These companies spent heavily on digital advertising to attract American shoppers, creating a windfall for tech giants. With the exemption now eliminated, these retailers are reducing their advertising spending, which is projected to cause a slight headwind for the ad businesses of companies like Meta and Google.</p>

          <p>Russian forces launched drone strikes on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, injuring nearly 50 people. The strikes hit 12 locations in four key districts, causing fires and damaging residential buildings and civilian infrastructure. The attack came hours after a similar strike in Zaporizhzhia wounded over 20 people. President Zelenskyy criticized the attacks and called for increased air defense capabilities from allies. Russia announced a three-day ceasefire coinciding with Moscow's World War Two commemorations, but Kyiv denounced it as a manipulation.</p>

The elections also included six mayoral contests, with Reform UK winning both newly-created mayoralties. The results suggest a potential loosening of the traditional main parties' grip on voters.</p>

          <p>Top-ranking officials in the Trump administration have criticized Germany's domestic intelligence agency for designating the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party as a "right-wing extremist" entity. The agency said the party's positions on ethnicity were incompatible with democracy, noting that the AfD "aims to exclude certain population groups from equal participation in society." The US Vice President JD Vance accused Germany of rebuilding a "Berlin Wall." The German Foreign Ministry replied directly to Rubio on X to say: "This is democracy." The ministry said that the "decision is the result of a thorough and independent investigation to protect our constitution" and could be appealed.</p>

          <p>A reservoir intended to serve as an alternate water supply for the Pacific Palisades neighborhood in Los Angeles was not available when a major fire broke out, exacerbating water shortages.

This resulted in firefighters facing depleted water tanks and dry hydrants while battling the blaze.

          <p>Analysts suggest that China faces significant challenges in transitioning from a bystander to a credible mediator in the Middle East, particularly regarding its engagement with Syria's new government. China's support for the ousted Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad has created a "reputational crisis," especially among local authorities in Syria. China now faces a difficult dilemma in Syria, where it must deal with a new government dominated by UN-identified "terrorists." China's limited experience in the region and complex political landscape present considerable obstacles to its mediation efforts.</p>
