          <p>A massive tax and spending bill passed by Republicans will introduce significant changes, but many effects will be delayed until after the 2026 elections. The legislation imposes new work requirements for Medicaid and cuts program funding, which experts predict could cause millions to lose insurance coverage, particularly impacting rural hospitals. It also alters work requirements for the SNAP food assistance program and adjusts tax policies, including the SALT deduction and credits for electric vehicles and green home upgrades, with various provisions taking effect over the next several years.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to proceed with deporting a group of migrants with criminal records from a naval base in Djibouti to South Sudan. This ruling clarifies a previous order, effectively lifting an injunction that had required the government to provide the migrants a chance to contest their removal based on fears of persecution. Dissenting justices expressed grave concerns for the deportees' safety, highlighting that South Sudan is plagued by violence and political instability.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson celebrated the passage of President Trump's major legislative package, attributing the success to the effectiveness of "unified government." He highlighted the close collaboration between the White House and congressional Republicans, noting that the president, vice president, and cabinet secretaries were deeply involved in addressing lawmakers' questions. Johnson framed the bill, which passed narrowly along party lines, as a crucial step in reversing the policies of the previous administration.</p>

          <p>A Cessna aircraft carrying 14 skydivers and a pilot crashed shortly after takeoff from Cross Keys Airport in Williamstown, New Jersey, injuring all 15 people on board. Three individuals are in critical condition following the crash, which occurred after the pilot reported engine trouble at an altitude of approximately 3,000 feet. The pilot attempted an emergency landing but overran the runway into a wooded area.

          <p>In a satirical column, The Atlantic imagines the Founding Fathers observing the chaotic and partisan process behind the passage of a recent 940-page spending bill. The piece humorously contrasts the founders' vision of careful deliberation with the modern reality of late-night threats, record-long votes, and last-minute deals for special interests. Through this imagined dialogue, the article critiques the current state of the U.S. legislature, suggesting it has strayed far from its intended function as a coequal branch of government.</p>

          <p>A new grand jury indictment against Barry Morphew reveals startling details in the murder case of his wife, Suzanne, whose remains were found in a shallow grave in 2023. The indictment alleges that her body was moved to that location after decomposing elsewhere, indicating it was relocated at least twice. Furthermore, toxicological analysis found a tranquilizer compound used on wildlife in her bone marrow, a substance authorities say Barry Morphew had access to and experience using. He was recently re-arrested and charged with first-degree murder.</p>

The study also confirms that the ministry's data is a conservative minimum, not an exaggeration, and that women and children account for over half of the violent deaths.</p>
