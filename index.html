          <p>A driver in Tengzhou, Shandong province, eastern China, was arrested after a car struck a crowd at a bus stop during the May Day holiday. The incident, which occurred on Sunday afternoon, raises questions about potential casualties and whether it was a deliberate attack. Initial reports were slow to emerge, with local authorities facing criticism for their delayed response and lack of official statements, prompting concerns about transparency and public information dissemination in such events. The former editor-in-chief of Global Times, Hu Xijin, also expressed his concerns regarding the local authority's lack of official information regarding the incident. </p>

          <p>Ahead of Arsenal's crucial Champions League match against Paris Saint-Germain, goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma's form is under scrutiny. Questions arise whether Arsenal will face the confident and capable shot-stopper from the first leg or the error-prone version seen earlier in the season. Donnarumma's performances have been inconsistent, with recent mistakes in Ligue 1 raising doubts about his reliability, however, his form has improved alongside the rest of the PSG team during their Champions League campaign. His ability to perform well could determine Arsenal's Champions League fate.</p>

          <p>Gaza is facing a dire humanitarian emergency with two million Palestinians surviving on minimal meals due to an ongoing aid blockade by Israel. The organization American Near East Refugee Aid is reporting signs of starvation in urine samples tested, with food, fuel, and medicine running out. Sean Carroll argues that Israel is exploiting aid as a tool of war, violating international law and potentially aiming to expel Palestinians. He calls for open humanitarian corridors and a plan for recovery, emphasizing that true recovery requires a political agreement guaranteeing Palestinian security and self-determination.</p>

          <p>A dental practice in Sheffield, Darnall Dental Clinic, is at risk of closing its doors to 4,000 NHS patients due to funding cuts, despite having recently taken on extra patients. The clinic, which invested £466,000 in expanding its premises, now faces a loss of £544,000 in funding. Staff have reported experiencing verbal abuse from patients unable to secure appointments. The South Yorkshire Integrated Care Board had provided extra funding in 2023 and 2024, but the current situation has led to difficult decisions regarding patient care and staff wellbeing.</p>

          <p>Eighty years after World War II, Germany is still painstakingly searching for its fallen soldiers, with a recent internment of 107 Wehrmacht soldiers near Berlin. The German War Graves Commission (Volksbund) continues to find, exhume, and rebury remains across Europe, offering a dignified burial regardless of their role in the war. Despite some controversy, the effort is seen as a way to close a chapter of history, identifying the dead and ensuring they are not left nameless in the earth. The Volksbund estimates that over 2 million German soldiers remain unaccounted for.</p>
