        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a psychiatrist who has worked with over 3,000 young adults, parenting doesn't need to be complicated. The article suggests trusting your instincts and cultural traditions, rather than over-relying on influencers or clickbait. Parents should focus on enjoying the process and supporting their child's individual interests, rather than obsessing over developmental milestones. The most important thing is to be your real self and provide love and attention, as children need to learn how to manage their own emotions. The advice is intended to alleviate anxiety and encourage a more intuitive approach to parenting.</p>

          <p>The European Union has criticized President Trump's decision to double tariffs on steel imports to 50%, stating that it undermines efforts to reach a negotiated solution in the ongoing trade war. The EU spokesperson said they are prepared to impose countermeasures in response to the tariff increase. The United Steelworkers union also criticized the move, highlighting the risk to Canadian industries and workers. The EU had previously paused countermeasures to allow for negotiations, but they are now finalizing consultations on expanded countermeasures that could take effect as early as July 14.</p>

          <p>Germany's radical right-wing AfD party is attempting to align itself with traditional Christian culture and values, particularly in its opposition to Islam. While the AfD doesn't have many devout Christians within its ranks, it exploits Christian traditions to appeal to a broader audience and capitalize on social uncertainty. The party stokes fears about immigration and claims that other political parties are deliberately flooding Germany with Muslims to destroy their own culture. Critics argue that the AfD's relationship with Christianity is instrumental and opportunistic, as the party primarily uses Christian values to further its political agenda.</p>

          <p>Grupo Firme, a popular Mexican band, canceled their performance at a California music festival after the U.S. government suspended the musicians' visas. This action follows a series of moves by the Trump administration targeting Mexican artists who play music that glorifies cartel violence. The band said their visas are under administrative review by the U.S. Embassy, making it impossible for them to perform. The suspension comes amid concerns about the genre of "narco-corridos" and the safety of musicians in cartel turf wars, with the recent deaths of five musicians from Grupo Fugitivo highlighting the dangers.</p>

          <p>Ukraine urgently needs access to the â‚¬300bn of frozen Russian assets, primarily held in Euroclear, to bolster its fight against Russia. Confiscating these funds would shock Putin, undermine domestic support for the war, and provide Ukraine with a psychological boost. While some fear that seizing the assets would undermine Europe's reputation as a safe haven for investors, the author argues that the situation with Russia is an extreme case and should not deter the EU from taking decisive action. The author also notes that military spending is the focus and governments are promising to ramp up their commitments.</p>
