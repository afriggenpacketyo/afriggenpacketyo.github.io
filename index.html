          <p>Lenders address frequently asked questions about home equity borrowing, including the differences between HELOCs and home equity loans, borrowing limits, rates, fees, and permissible uses of funds. HELOCs offer flexible credit lines with variable rates, while home equity loans provide lump sums with fixed rates. Borrowing amounts depend on home value and lender guidelines, with rates influenced by credit score and loan-to-value ratio. Funds can be used for various purposes, but borrowers should be aware of the risk of foreclosure if payments are missed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Glendale announced it will terminate its contract to hold Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainees, ending an 18-year agreement amid rising tensions over immigration raids in Los Angeles. The decision reflects the city's core values of public safety, transparency, and community trust, despite maintaining compliance with state law. The move comes after reports that Glendale continued the contract despite California's SB 54, which prohibits local funds from being used for federal immigration enforcement. The city acknowledges that public perception of the ICE contract had become divisive.</p>
