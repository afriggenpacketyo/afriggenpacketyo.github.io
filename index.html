          <p>This article summarizes various newspaper headlines, focusing on the new US-UK trade deal and the selection of a new Pope. The trade deal, described as 'historic' by both leaders, aims to reduce tariffs and boost trade, but its scope is limited and leaves Britain in a worse position than before the US trade war. The deal includes a clause allowing the US to object to Chinese firms investing in Britain, a claim disputed by the government. In Vatican news, Cardinal Robert Prevost was swiftly chosen as the new Pope, Leo XIV, sending a message of unity and a commitment to building bridges.</p>

          <p>China's overall exports experienced a surprising surge in April, despite a significant 21% drop in shipments to the U.S. due to tariffs. Imports saw a smaller decline as Beijing implemented stimulus measures. The increase in overall exports is partially attributed to transshipment through third countries and contracts signed before the tariffs were announced. The Chinese government is encouraging exporters to focus on the domestic market, potentially leading to deflation. The article notes that trade data is expected to weaken in the coming months.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade deal framework with Britain aimed at reducing tariffs and boosting trade, marking his first trade deal of his second term. The agreement will increase U.S. access to the U.K. market, especially for agricultural products, and fast-track American imports through U.K. customs. However, a 10% tariff on U.K. imports will remain, although the first 100,000 vehicles imported annually will be subject to this rate. This framework is seen as a political victory for Prime Minister Keir Starmer.</p>

          <p>President Trump has appointed Fox News host and former New York prosecutor Jeanine Pirro as interim U.S. attorney for Washington D.C. This appointment follows the withdrawal of his initial pick due to Republican opposition in the Senate. Pirro, a long-time ally of Trump, replaces Ed Martin, who will now direct the Justice Department's 'weaponization working group.' Pirro's appointment raises legal questions and could face challenges due to her past controversial statements and lack of recent law enforcement experience.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is set to immediately remove up to 1,000 transgender military members following a Supreme Court decision. A new directive instructs the Pentagon to identify and involuntarily force out trans individuals, using medical records to identify those diagnosed with gender dysphoria. This move follows the rescinding of VA healthcare directives for LGBTQ+ veterans and aligns with the Defense Secretary's views on women in combat roles. The decision has sparked criticism and concerns about the well-being of affected service members.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the new trade deal between the US and the UK, examining its benefits for America. While President Trump touts the deal as a significant achievement, analysts suggest the substantive benefits are limited. The 10% import tax on most UK goods remains in place, with the White House agreeing to roll back some import taxes on strategic sectors in exchange for expanded access for American agricultural products in the UK. The deal has drawn mixed reactions, with some praising it as a breakthrough and others noting its narrow scope.</p>

          <p>Some Chinese academics are advocating for a revision of World War II history, proposing that the start date be moved back to 1931, when Japan invaded Manchuria, rather than the traditionally recognized 1939 invasion of Poland. They argue that marking 1939 as the beginning of the war diminishes China's role in the conflict. This perspective emerges as countries commemorate the 80th anniversary of the war's end, with President Xi Jinping attending a Victory Day parade in Moscow.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reportedly asked House Speaker Mike Johnson to include a tax increase on rich Americans in the upcoming fiscal package. The proposal involves creating a new top income bracket for individuals earning over $2.5 million per year, taxing income above that level at 39.6 percent. This move would partially reverse the 2017 tax cuts and aims to offset the cost of other tax cuts while potentially protecting Medicaid. The idea has faced opposition from Republicans, but Trump believes it would help with optics.</p>
