          <p>National security advisor Mike Waltz and his deputy, Alex Wong, are leaving their positions in the Trump White House, according to sources familiar with their departure. Waltz faced scrutiny in March after mistakenly including a journalist in a Signal chat where plans for a military strike on Houthi targets in Yemen were discussed. Wong, who served as deputy special representative for North Korea in the first Trump administration, helped negotiate Trump's summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The White House debated whether Waltz should resign after admitting the authenticity of the reporting, but Trump signaled his support for Waltz by calling him a "good man" who "learned a lesson."</p>

          <p>Elon Musk is scrutinizing the $2.5 billion Federal Reserve building renovation, calling the price tag "high." The project, which began in 2021 with an initial cost of $1.9 billion, aims to address overdue upgrades, building codes, technology, and energy efficiency. Musk, who initiated the Department of Government Efficiency advisory board, suggests the cost overruns should be examined as part of broader government waste reduction efforts. Fed officials argue the changes will save money by consolidating staff and reducing leasing costs, providing a modern workspace for employees. The Fed is funded by interest on securities and fees from supervised banks, with excess earnings typically returned to the Treasury.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is requesting the Trump administration implement a tariff exclusion process to prevent a recession and protect small businesses. In a letter to key trade officials, the chamber's CEO, Suzanne Clark, asked for tariffs to be lifted on small business importers and products not domestically available. Clark emphasized the urgency of the situation, noting that many small businesses face irreparable harm if relief is not immediate. White House deputy chief of staff Steven Miller indicated the administration is not considering tariff exemptions, suggesting tax cuts as the solution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is intensifying its collaboration with local law enforcement to accelerate deportations. A six-day immigration sweep in Florida led to over 1,100 arrests, with ICE working alongside state agencies. ICE has signed over 400 agreements with local authorities since January, expanding the 287(g) program to allow local law enforcement to make immigration arrests. Critics, including the ACLU, warn of potential civil rights violations and financial burdens on localities. A former ICE official suggests this expansion could free up ICE officers for other crucial deportation tasks, but its effectiveness depends on the willingness of local areas to participate.</p>

          <p>Automakers such as Ford, Hyundai, and Kia reported significant U.S. sales increases in April due to consumers buying vehicles ahead of potential tariff-related price hikes. This "tariff fear-buying" was supported by automaker discounts and promises to hold prices. However, demand slowed in late April as inventories tightened and prices rose, according to J.D. Power and Cox Automotive. President Trump's 25% tariffs on imported vehicles took effect April 3, with additional levies on auto parts expected soon. Ford CEO Jim Farley said recent tariff modifications are helpful but further actions are needed to support the U.S. auto industry.</p>

The US had sanctioned entities trading Iranian oil and petrochemicals, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth warned Iran of repercussions for backing the Houthis, who have been attacking ships near the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.</p>

Despite the domestic challenges, McDonald's is implementing strategies such as value meals and new menu items to attract diners.

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board asserts that President Trump's first 100 days in his second term have inflicted more damage on American democracy than any period since Reconstruction. The board accuses Trump of attempting to establish a presidency unrestrained by Congress or the courts, overriding laws at will. They argue that this autocratic approach threatens the foundations of American government, potentially leading future presidents to similarly abuse power. The board calls for a broad coalition of Americans to oppose Trump's undemocratic actions while acknowledging his legitimate election and the legality of some of his policies.</p>

Since Governor Abbott increased immigration operations in 2021, over 39,000 migrants have been arrested in border counties for trespassing and other state violations. Kinney County officials say their residents felt under siege and they had an obligation to act, using the funds to bolster the sheriff's department and increase salaries for county officials. Some judges expressed discomfort with forfeiting bail when migrants were deported, but the county attorney argues that migrants are responsible for ensuring their presence in court.</p>

          <p>Robert F Kennedy Jr., the health secretary, and his department have made misleading statements about vaccines, including the false claim that the MMR vaccine contains "aborted fetus debris." Health department officials also released statements about altering vaccine testing and building new "surveillance systems," alarming vaccine experts. Kennedy has been a prominent anti-vaccine advocate, spreading misinformation and profiting from referrals to law firms suing vaccine makers. Experts consider new placebo-controlled trials for long-time vaccines unethical and argue that the administration is especially targeting the Covid-19 vaccine.</p>

          <p>"The Surfer," directed by Lorcan Finnegan and starring Nicolas Cage, is a sunny beach noir that captures a scenic unease. Cage plays an unnamed surfer who returns to his childhood spot in Australia only to be bullied by local surfers. The film amplifies the absurdity of the situation, with Cage's character sacrificing everything to stay put and facing escalating suffering. Inspired by a real-life surf gang, the film delivers mental damage rather than a bloodbath, focusing on Cage's descent into lunacy.</p>

The total number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits climbed to 1.92 million, the most since November 2021. Concerns persist about a global economic slowdown due to tariffs, despite President Trump's actions to pause or pull back on many tariff threats. The U.S. economy contracted at a 0.3% annual pace in the first quarter, with rising imports attributed to companies trying to bring in foreign goods before tariffs were imposed.</p>

          <p>With persistent inflation, saving money can be a challenge, but a certificate of deposit (CD) can help by offering higher returns. CDs allow you to lock in today's high rates for the term, providing a safe investment with FDIC or NCUA insurance on balances up to $250,000. Short-term CDs often have higher interest rates than longer terms due to the inverted yield curve. Online banks typically offer more competitive rates than traditional banks with branches.</p>
