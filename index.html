          <p>Negotiations between the UK and EU are ongoing before a summit, aiming to address issues like youth mobility, airport e-gate access for UK passport holders, trade, security, and fishing rights. The minister for UK-EU relations emphasizes a focus on jobs, lower household bills, and stronger borders, but declines to provide specific details. A potential youth mobility scheme, allowing young people to move abroad for up to two years, is under discussion, drawing mixed reactions from opposition parties. Concerns are raised about potential compromises on fishing rights and access to EU defense funds, with some describing the deal as a 'surrender'.</p>

          <p>Michael Posner, former Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, argues that the Trump administration's planned overhaul of the State Department will cripple its capacity to promote American values abroad. The proposed cuts to the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, which advances soft power, will undermine America's ability to challenge authoritarianism and support democratic movements. Eliminating offices overseeing grants and promoting internet freedom, along with staff cuts, will compromise the bureau's ability to act as a counterweight to regional State Department bureaus. The long-term result will be a weaker, less principled United States, sidelined by authoritarian powers.</p>

          <p>The House Budget Committee is attempting to push President Trump's domestic policy bill forward after conservatives initially blocked it due to insufficient spending cuts. The bill includes extending tax cuts from Mr. Trump's first term, temporarily ending taxes on tips and overtime, and increased spending on the military and border security. These measures are offset by cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, and clean energy subsidies. Conservatives are pushing for Medicaid work requirements and an end to clean energy subsidies, while Republicans from blue states seek to raise the cap on state and local taxes.</p>

          <p>Recent armed clashes between India and Pakistan have revealed a proving ground for competing military technologies, particularly Chinese military hardware facing off against Western and Russian systems. Pakistan's arsenal, shaped by defense cooperation with China, increasingly incorporates advanced Chinese air and missile systems, drones, and multirole fighters. The price differential between Chinese and Western military systems is substantial, potentially reshaping global defense procurement and strategic alignments. The battlefield testing of Chinese weapons systems may signal a paradigm shift in global military dynamics, challenging the long-held dominance of Western military technology.</p>

          <p>Consumers are being warned about a 'brushing' scam where they receive unsolicited packages, often containing low-value items, which are used by third-party sellers to manipulate online product reviews.

Postal inspectors caution against scanning any QR codes included in these packages, as they can lead to malicious websites that steal personal data or install malware.

With no candidate securing a majority, a runoff election is scheduled for June 1. The Polish presidency holds veto powers that can influence the government's agenda, making this election a crucial test for Prime Minister Donald Tusk's efforts to reverse hard-right policies and restore judicial independence and media pluralism.</p>

          <p>Exit polls in Portugal indicate that the ruling Democratic Alliance (AD) is likely to win the most votes in Sunday's election, but will fall short of an outright majority. The center-left Socialist party and the far-right Chega party are expected to follow closely behind. AD leader Luis Montenegro has ruled out a coalition with Chega, meaning the AD will need to forge deals with smaller parties to secure a majority in parliament. This election is the third in as many years, raising concerns about long-term political instability in Portugal.</p>

          <p>Ari Aster's new film, “Eddington,” a paranoid thriller set in New Mexico, is dividing audiences at Cannes with its exploration of pandemic anxieties and political unease. Aster describes the film as a horror movie about free-floating political anxiety and the breakdown of truth in a world where nobody agrees on what is happening. The film touches on the gulf between politics and policy, reflecting the director's own fears and anxieties about the current state of the world. Aster wanted to make a good western too, and westerns are about the country and the mythology of America and the romance of America.</p>

          <p>New Jersey is experiencing widespread transportation disruptions due to a locomotive engineers' strike, sinkholes on Interstate 80, and ongoing issues at Newark Liberty International Airport.
