          <p>The Trump administration has implemented a proclamation that suspends travel to the United States for citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, citing national security concerns related to insufficient vetting processes. The restrictions, set to take effect on June 9, also partially limit entry for nationals of Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. Certain travelers, such as U.S. permanent residents and athletes attending major sporting events, are exempt from the ban. Democratic lawmakers have criticized the policy, labeling it as discriminatory and ineffective for enhancing U.S. safety. The policy mirrors a similar travel ban announced in January 2017, one week into Trump's first term, which banned travel from seven Muslim-majority countries.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate whether Joe Biden's aides conspired to deceive the public regarding his cognitive state by using an autopen to sign presidential documents. Trump alleges that Biden's advisors concealed his cognitive decline by restricting his media appearances and scripting conversations, while still issuing over 1,200 presidential documents and appointing numerous judges. The investigation will examine any efforts to shield the public from information about Biden's health and the use of the autopen for policy documents, clemency grants, and executive orders. House Republicans are also investigating Biden's mental fitness to authorize the use of the autopen during his presidency.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has signed a proclamation to restrict foreign student visas at Harvard University, citing national security concerns. The order suspends the entry of foreign nationals seeking to study or participate in exchange programs at Harvard for an initial six months. Trump declared that Harvard's connections with China and history of radicalism make it an unsuitable destination for foreign students. Harvard has denounced the proclamation as retaliatory and a violation of its First Amendment rights, stating that it will continue to protect its international students. This action is part of a broader standoff between the Trump administration and Harvard, which includes freezing grants and proposing to end its tax-exempt status.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has signed a new ban on travel to the US from 12 countries, citing national security risks. The ban affects nationals from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, with partial restrictions for Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. The White House stated that these restrictions would protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors. Democrats have condemned the move, with some calling it an expansion of Trump's previous "Muslim ban."</p>

          <p>Negotiations over Iran's nuclear program are in doubt as the US and Iran clash over the terms of an interim agreement proposed by the Trump administration. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, rejected the proposal, stating that Iran would not agree to stop enriching uranium on its soil. President Trump has stated that any agreement would not allow any enrichment of uranium. A possible meeting between delegations from Iran and the US remains unclear, although a meeting in the coming days is under discussion.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers found trapped in Burmese amber has shed new light on the evolution of flight feathers, an essential step that allowed early birds to surpass their dinosaur relatives in conquering the skies. The researchers studied feathers dating back 99 million years to the Cretaceous period, gaining insight into how feathers evolved during this era. An essential feature of the evolution of birds was the development of feathers that helped generate thrust and lift. While modern birds are the direct descendants of dinosaurs, scientists believe that most feathered dinosaurs did not have the same ability to fly.</p>
