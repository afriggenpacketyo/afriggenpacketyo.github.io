          <p>David Challen campaigned for years to free his mother, Sally Challen, after she killed his father, Richard, with a hammer, an act for which she was initially jailed for life for murder in 2011. Sally had endured decades of coercive control and abuse by her husband, which had become normalized within their family home in Surrey. A 2015 law recognizing psychological manipulation as domestic abuse helped secure her release in 2019 after her conviction was quashed and she pleaded guilty to manslaughter. David has written a book, 'The Unthinkable,' about their experiences and continues to advocate for domestic abuse victims, hoping to bring awareness to the insidious nature of non-physical violence and to protect others from similar intergenerational trauma. The author hopes to bring awareness and prevent such tragedies from happening again. The optimism score is based on the fact that the story highlights the importance of understanding and addressing domestic abuse.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senator Cory Booker is facing criticism from conservatives for allegedly delivering a gesture resembling a 'Nazi salute' at a California Democratic Party convention. This comes months after Elon Musk received similar scrutiny for a comparable gesture towards MAGA supporters. Booker addressed the convention, urging supporters to stand up to President Donald Trump and echoing messages from his 25-hour speech against Trump, Musk, and alleged attacks on American safety and democracy. Critics are questioning whether media outlets will apply the same level of condemnation to Booker as they did to Musk, who was accused of making a Nazi-style salute in January, and conservatives are accusing the media of bias. The optimism score reflects the fact that this is a political controversy with no violence or deaths involved.</p>

He also addressed concerns about China's military threat to Taiwan and visa revocations for Chinese students, stating that the administration is not intentionally escalating tensions but seeking to de-risk and ensure China is a reliable partner.

Roth expressed concern about the chilling effect on free speech and the importance of defending academic freedom. He acknowledged legitimate criticisms of higher education, such as a lack of intellectual diversity, but cautioned against conforming to the ideologies of those in power.

Key events include the JOLTS report, ADP private payrolls, jobless claims, and the nonfarm payrolls report, all influencing the likelihood of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.
