          <p>The U.S. Senate has passed President Trump's signature domestic policy package with a tie-breaking vote from the Vice President. The bill, which enacts major parts of Trump's "America First" agenda, now returns to the House for final approval, with Republican leaders aiming to have it signed by July 4. During a roundtable in Florida, Trump expressed confidence in the bill's passage in the House, despite some Republican opposition to Senate changes and CBO projections of millions losing health insurance due to Medicaid cuts. The legislation's passage marks a significant step for the administration's key policy goals.</p>

          <p>The Senate's newly passed Republican spending package introduces significant changes that could affect millions of Americans' finances. Key provisions include making the 2017 tax cuts permanent, increasing the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap, and boosting the child tax credit. The bill also proposes substantial cuts to social programs like Medicaid and SNAP, potentially leaving millions uninsured and reducing food benefits. Additionally, it overhauls student loan programs, eliminates clean energy tax credits, and introduces new savings accounts for children and tax deductions for auto loans and tip income.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study presented at the SLEEP 2025 conference indicates a potential link between frequent, long, or irregular daytime naps and an increased risk of death among older adults. Researchers monitored nearly 87,000 participants over eight years, finding that those who napped longer, particularly in the early afternoon, had higher mortality rates. While the study shows an association rather than a direct cause, experts suggest excessive napping could signal underlying health issues or chronic poor nighttime sleep. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends healthy adults limit naps to 20-30 minutes.</p>

The proposed tax would have applied to projects using components from foreign entities of concern, primarily China, adding a significant financial burden to the industry. Following the news, the Invesco Solar ETF saw a 4% increase, and shares of companies like NextEra Energy and Array Technologies jumped. Despite this positive development, industry groups caution that the overall legislation remains harmful to the renewable energy sector's future growth. (not investment advice)</p>

The report also highlights cities excelling in specific areas, such as Santa Clara, California, for employee health coverage, and Wichita Falls, Texas, for having one of the nation's shortest commutes.

The Senate's bill proposes deeper cuts, totaling over $930 billion over a decade compared to the House's $800 billion, and would result in nearly 12 million more uninsured people by 2034 according to the CBO. Both versions introduce new work requirements for beneficiaries and mandate more frequent eligibility checks.

At his peak in the 1980s, Swaggart's broadcasts reached millions and generated over $140 million annually, funding a media empire and a large church in Baton Rouge. His career was permanently damaged in 1988 after he was photographed with a sex worker, leading to a tearful, televised confession. A subsequent scandal three years later further tarnished his reputation, from which his ministry never fully recovered, marking a dramatic fall for the influential preacher.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, the man accused of murdering four University of Idaho students in 2022, has accepted a plea deal to avoid the death penalty, according to prosecutors. In a letter to the victims' families, the Latah County Prosecutor's Office stated Kohberger will plead guilty to four counts of murder in exchange for four consecutive life sentences without the possibility of appeal. The decision has brought mixed reactions from the victims' families, with some expressing relief at avoiding a lengthy trial and others fury over the state's handling of the deal.

          <p>A new, White House-approved portrait of Donald Trump now hangs in the Colorado state capitol, replacing a previous painting that the president had publicly criticized as "purposefully distorted." The original portrait was taken down after Trump's outburst, and the new one, which he reportedly requested have a "glimmering" golden border, was donated by the White House. The replacement painting depicts a more glowering and older-looking Trump, similar to his official second-term photograph. The incident highlights the president's well-known sensitivity regarding his public image and personal depictions in art.</p>

In response, the BBC called the antisemitic sentiments "utterly unacceptable" and regretted not cutting the live stream.
