          <p>The second named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, Barry, made landfall on Mexico's east coast as a tropical depression. The system is expected to bring significant rainfall, with forecasts predicting three to six inches and isolated totals up to ten inches across several states. While the storm is projected to weaken and dissipate as it moves inland, the associated heavy rains pose a continued threat of flooding and mudslides. The National Hurricane Center had issued a tropical storm warning as the system approached, noting it would still bring tropical storm conditions near the coast before weakening.</p>

          <p>A report from Dessau, in the eastern German state of Saxony-Anhalt, highlights a troubling trend of rising right-wing extremism and nationalism among young people. This cultural shift has normalized extremist symbols and slogans, with some youths viewing right-wing affiliations as "cool." The article explores the city's complex history of economic hardship post-reunification, alongside significant investment and cultural heritage, as a backdrop for this radicalization. Despite efforts by civic groups to counter this movement, activists face hostility, and the political landscape has seen the far-right AfD party gain significant ground.</p>

          <p>China's official manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) indicated a third straight month of contraction in June, settling at 49.7, just below the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction. Despite some stabilization in production and new orders due to stimulus efforts, factories continued to see declines in inventory and employment. The data reflects ongoing economic pressures from a supply glut, sluggish consumer demand, and deflationary trends, prompting officials to emphasize boosting domestic consumption and consider further fiscal stimulus.

          <p>China has conditionally resumed imports of some Japanese seafood, partially lifting a ban that was implemented in response to the release of treated water from the Fukushima nuclear power plant. The measure, effective immediately, allows for the import of aquatic products from most of Japan but maintains the suspension for ten prefectures, including Fukushima and Tokyo. Beijing had first suspended food imports from these areas in July 2023 before expanding it to a full ban on all Japanese seafood a month later, citing safety concerns.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has rescinded its planned digital services tax on large technology companies just one day before the first payments were due. The reversal came after U.S. President Donald Trump announced he was terminating all trade discussions with Canada over the tax, which would have applied a 3% levy retroactively. Canadian officials stated the move was made in anticipation of a new comprehensive trade agreement and would support a resumption of negotiations. The tax had been a point of contention, with the U.S. arguing it unfairly discriminated against American firms.</p>

The protest movement was initially sparked by a deadly train station roof collapse in November 2024, which critics blame on government corruption.

The author argues that Russia's deep involvement in the war in Ukraine has drained its military and economic resources, leaving it unable to effectively support its allies. Despite a strategic partnership with Iran, which included supplying drones for the Ukraine war, Russia offered only platitudes and mediation efforts instead of tangible military or diplomatic support when Iran was attacked, revealing the limits of its geopolitical power.</p>

The Congressional Budget Office estimates the legislation would add nearly $3.3 trillion to the national deficit over the next decade. The bill's passage relies on the budget reconciliation process, requiring only a simple majority and leaving Democrats with few tools to block it.</p>

          <h2>Researchers Investigate Why Electric Vehicles May Induce Motion Sickness</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 22:00:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a growing number of passengers are reporting motion sickness, a phenomenon researchers are now studying. Studies suggest that the unique acceleration and deceleration characteristics of EVs, particularly the low-frequency deceleration from regenerative braking systems, are more likely to induce queasiness than conventional cars. This system, which converts kinetic energy back into battery power when slowing down, can create sensations that provoke motion sickness symptoms. Researchers are exploring solutions to mitigate this uncomfortable side effect of the new technology.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026, a decision that followed his opposition to President Trump's major spending bill. Tillis cited his objection to Medicaid cuts that would be "devastating to North Carolina" as his reason for not supporting the legislation. His announcement came just hours after President Trump criticized him on social media and threatened to support a primary challenger against him. In his statement, Tillis lamented the decline of bipartisanship and compromise in Washington.</p>

          <p>The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Mariano Grossi, has stated that recent U.S. airstrikes inflicted "severe damage" but not "total damage" on Iran's nuclear facilities. His assessment appears to counter more absolute claims from U.S. officials about the program's destruction, suggesting Iran retains industrial and technological capacities to restart its activities. Grossi emphasized the urgent need for IAEA inspectors to regain access to Iranian sites to verify the status of nuclear materials and equipment, noting that knowledge and industrial capacity cannot be eliminated militarily.</p>

The inquiry will investigate key decisions, including the rapid discharge of hospital patients into care homes in early 2020 without testing, which is blamed for seeding the virus in vulnerable populations. Other critical issues to be explored include the use of blanket "do not resuscitate" notices and restrictive visiting policies that left families separated from their loved ones during their final days.</p>

In a press conference, she described how Kitagawa allegedly assaulted her in 2018 and later pressured her to remain silent. After she filed a formal report, she says she was subjected to a "secondary assault" through a slander campaign by a colleague. Kitagawa was indicted and initially admitted guilt but has since changed his plea to not guilty, prolonging the legal and personal ordeal.</p>
