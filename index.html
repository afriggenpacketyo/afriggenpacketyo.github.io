            <p>The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has decided to keep its loan prime rates unchanged, with the 1-year LPR at 3.1% and the 5-year LPR at 3.6%. This decision comes as the central bank focuses on stabilizing the yuan amid ongoing trade tensions with the United States. China's economic data has shown better-than-expected growth, allowing the PBOC to maintain steady rates. The move aligns with economists' expectations, as a Reuters poll indicated that most anticipated the PBOC to hold rates steady. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba of Japan sent a ritual offering to the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, a controversial site viewed by neighboring countries as a symbol of Japan's past militarism, as the shrine began its three-day spring festival. Ishiba is not expected to visit the shrine personally, apparently due to diplomatic considerations, especially as Japan's relations with China and South Korea have been improving. The Yasukuni Shrine honors Japan's wartime leaders, including those convicted as war criminals by a post-World War II international tribunal, along with millions of war dead. This year marks the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II.</p>

In Mykolaiv, explosions were reported, but immediate details regarding casualties were unclear.

India hopes to secure a trade deal within a 90-day pause on tariffs declared by President Trump, who has previously labeled India a "tariff abuser."

            <p>China has cautioned countries against appeasing the United States in trade talks related to President Donald Trump's tariffs. A Chinese commerce ministry spokesperson stated that "appeasement cannot bring peace, and compromise cannot earn one respect," in response to reports that Washington plans to pressure governments to restrict trade with Beijing in exchange for exemptions from US import taxes. The Trump administration has initiated tariff negotiations with trading partners, including Japan and South Korea. Since returning to the White House, Trump has imposed substantial tariffs on Chinese imports, while other countries have also been affected.</p>

            <p>Season 2 of HBO's The Last of Us diverges from the game's storytelling by expanding on characters and subplots, but it focuses on the fracturing of bonds rather than the building of them. The season explores the cyclical nature of violence and the moral ambiguity of characters. While the show includes moments of ingenuity, it has become more relentlessly bleak and less insightful than the first season, presenting examples of undiluted pain rather than a careful observation of animosity.</p>

            <p>US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth is facing renewed calls for his dismissal after being linked to a second group chat where sensitive military operations were reportedly shared with his wife, brother, and personal lawyer. The messages, sent via the Signal messaging app, allegedly contained details of an attack on Yemen's Houthis. Democrats have criticized Hegseth's actions, while the White House defends him, claiming no classified information was shared. This follows an earlier incident where sensitive military details were leaked from a separate Signal chat.</p>

            <p>In Japan, "friendship marriages," defined as nonsexual unions primarily for companionship and practical benefits, are gaining traction as an alternative to traditional matrimony. These arrangements often cater to individuals who may not conform to societal expectations regarding relationships or sexual orientation. A Tokyo-based marriage agency has facilitated over 300 such unions in the past decade. These marriages offer social security benefits and can provide a sense of stability without romantic or sexual involvement, appealing to those seeking partnership outside conventional norms.</p>

            <p>An opinion piece argues that President Trump's tariffs may inadvertently strengthen China's economy by forcing it to address its internal weaknesses. China recognizes that the US aims to systematically strangle its economic rise, not just rebalance trade. Resolving domestic market fragmentation is key, as is focusing on innovation and technological self-reliance. The author suggests that by adapting and overcoming these challenges, China could emerge as a more resilient and competitive economic power.</p>

            <p>Despite government efforts to reform the childcare system in England, many parents still struggle to find nursery places, particularly in deprived areas. The rollout of the "free hours" scheme, offering eligible working parents 30 hours of childcare per week, is nearing completion, but challenges persist. These include a widening gap between those eligible for funded hours and those missing out, and concerns about the sustainability of private nurseries. A Labour pledge to create more school-based nurseries offers a potential solution, but the system remains under strain.</p>

The airport attributes the delays to ATC restrictions in Europe and its own control tower. Belfast City Airport recorded the best punctuality performance in the UK for the second year running.</p>

            <p>The article explores the reasons why men are less likely to visit the doctor compared to women, citing data showing fewer GP appointments, dental registrations, and pharmacy usage. Factors contributing to this include societal pressures to "tough it out," concerns about appearing weak, and appointment systems that don't fit working patterns. Additionally, men are more likely to self-manage conditions and view healthcare as treatment rather than prevention, leading to delayed help-seeking and potentially worse health outcomes. Support groups and tailored services can encourage men to seek medical help.</p>

Chaotic traffic mixes, poor road design, and inadequate enforcement of safety standards exacerbate the problem. While the government is upgrading highways, experts argue that road designs often ignore the country's unique traffic needs, and better enforcement of existing safety standards is crucial.</p>
