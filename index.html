          <h2>Parallels Drawn Between Kenya's Historic 'Saba Saba' Protests and Modern Youth-Led Demonstrations</h2>

          <p>This article explores the legacy of Kenya's "Saba Saba" (July 7th) protests of the 1990s, which were pivotal in moving the country toward multi-party democracy. It draws parallels to the recent Gen Z-led demonstrations against tax hikes and government overreach, highlighting similar grievances like corruption and a lack of accountability. While the modern protests are leaderless and technologically driven, they echo the same spirit of defiance against state power. Analysts note that despite the different eras, the government's forceful response, including extrajudicial killings and abductions, remains a troubling constant.</p>

          <p>As Denmark assumes the EU Council presidency, it seeks to refocus the bloc on its green transition, a priority that has been overshadowed by war, inflation, and economic competition. The article notes a backlash against climate policies and a pivot towards security and defense across Europe. Danish officials are framing green initiatives as essential for strategic autonomy, arguing that reducing fossil fuel dependence strengthens Europe's security. However, they face resistance from member states like Poland and Italy, who are concerned about the economic costs of ambitious emissions targets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 04:00:58 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Marine Corps has initiated a pilot program stationing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents at three major bases: Camp Pendleton, Quantico, and MCB Hawaii. This collaboration aims to bolster force protection by improving threat awareness and coordination at access points, particularly concerning unauthorized access by foreign nationals. The move follows high-profile incidents, including a breach attempt at Quantico by two Jordanian nationals and reports of Chinese nationals trying to access military sites. Some defense experts question the move's transparency and whether it implies the Marine Corps cannot sufficiently handle its own security.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to amend the Employment Rights Bill to grant parents who suffer a miscarriage at any stage of pregnancy the legal right to bereavement leave. Currently, this entitlement is only available for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the change will provide people with necessary time to grieve without having to use sick leave. Campaigners and MPs have lauded the move as a significant step in recognizing early pregnancy loss as a true bereavement, helping to dismantle the long-held taboo surrounding the topic.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced he would impose an additional 10% tariff on any country that aligns with what he termed the 'Anti-American policies of BRICS,' with no exceptions. The threat came as the BRICS nations—which include China, Russia, and India—issued a joint statement criticizing unilateral protectionist measures and the 'indiscriminate increase of reciprocal tariffs.' While the specific 'anti-American' policies were not defined, analysts suggest it could refer to the bloc's desire to move away from a U.S.-led global financial order.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores why chocolate from the United States often tastes different to consumers from other parts of the world, particularly Europe. The distinct flavor of many popular American brands is partly due to the use of butyric acid, which imparts a slightly sour note, and a higher sugar content for a longer shelf life. In contrast, European chocolate production is more strictly regulated, requiring higher cocoa solids content and prioritizing traditional methods like conching for a creamier texture. The piece also touches on emerging chocolate markets in India and Africa, each with unique preferences and production challenges.</p>

This marks a historic low for the century and represents a drop of more than half since the Obama administration. Data analyst Harry Enten noted that this trend is particularly pronounced among Gen Z voters, with 32% reporting little or no pride in being American.

CCTV footage captured the moment the lion leaped over a wall and chased the woman, who sustained injuries along with her children. The owners face charges of negligence and keeping a wild animal without a proper license. Keeping big cats as pets is a status symbol in Pakistan, and while legal with a permit, they are required to be housed outside city limits, a rule that was violated in this case.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has strongly criticized Elon Musk's announcement of a new 'America Party,' calling the idea 'ridiculous' and a source of 'disruption and chaos.' In a social media post, Trump stated he was saddened to see Musk go 'completely 'off the rails'' and become a 'train wreck.' The public falling out follows a period of close alliance and stems from disagreements over a recent tax and spending bill that ended EV tax credits, a policy Musk had championed. Trump claimed Musk had previously told him he had no issue with the termination of the EV mandate.</p>

          <p>After a nine-week trial that captivated Australia, Erin Patterson was found guilty of murdering three relatives and attempting to murder a fourth by serving them beef Wellington laced with poisonous death cap mushrooms. This article provides a detailed narrative of the case, focusing on key pieces of evidence that swayed the jury. Prosecutors highlighted her lies to police, the disposal of a food dehydrator containing mushroom traces, and a false claim of having cancer to lure the victims to the meal. Despite the defense's argument of a tragic foraging accident, the jury concluded her actions were deliberate and intentional.</p>

          <p>A federal trial has commenced in Boston to address a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's policy of arresting and deporting noncitizen students and faculty involved in pro-Palestinian activism. University associations allege this campaign violates the First Amendment by creating a chilling effect on free speech, causing individuals to self-censor and withdraw from public engagement. The government denies the existence of a formal policy, arguing its actions fall within its immigration enforcement powers. The plaintiffs will present testimony from scholars who claim they abandoned their activism due to fear of reprisal.</p>

          <p>Hopes for a new Gaza ceasefire are growing as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meets with U.S. President Donald Trump, who has been pressing for a deal. Indirect talks between Israel and Hamas have resumed in Qatar over a U.S.-sponsored proposal for a 60-day truce and hostage release. However, significant obstacles remain, particularly Hamas's demand for a permanent end to the war, a condition Israel has consistently rejected. The recent conflict with Iran is seen by some analysts as having shifted the political landscape, potentially making both sides more amenable to reaching an agreement to end the 21-month-long war.</p>

          <p>This article examines the accelerating global trend of declining fertility rates, with women worldwide now having fewer than half the children they did in the 1960s. In the U.S., the fertility rate has hit a record low, driven by women having more economic independence, delaying parenthood, or choosing not to have children at all. Economists and demographers warn this shift poses significant challenges, including future labor shortages and threats to the viability of social safety nets like Social Security. While some conservatives advocate for pronatalist policies, others argue the trend reflects greater individual freedom. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the increasing financialization of housing across Europe is a primary driver of the continent's severe housing crisis. Since the 2008 financial crisis, institutional investors like private equity firms have treated housing as a lucrative asset class, buying up vast portfolios and driving up prices and rents to maximize profits. This has made homeownership unattainable for many and fueled political discontent, contributing to the rise of the far right. The author contends that decades of privatization and deregulation have empowered investors at the expense of residents, creating a system that fails. (not investment advice)</p>

Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly noted the county does not have a river warning system and that there was no reason to believe the storm would be so severe.
