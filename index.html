          <p>Salt Lake City police are investigating two self-described "peacekeepers" after a fatal shooting at a "No Kings Day" protest. The incident occurred when the peacekeepers confronted Arturo Roberto Gamboa, who allegedly pulled out a rifle. One of the peacekeepers opened fire, killing Arthur Folasa "Afa" Ah Loo and wounding Gamboa, who was later arrested. The protest, organized by 50501, did not have authorized security, and the shooting prompted a reaction from state leadership, with Utah Gov. Spencer Cox calling it a "deeply troubling act of violence." The investigation is ongoing to determine if the use of deadly force was lawful. Optimism regarding the situation is low due to the loss of life and potential for further unrest.</p>

          <p>G7 leaders met in Canada to discuss global trade amid divisions stemming from U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff war and unilateralism. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney warned that the world is "more divided and dangerous," emphasizing the importance of cooperation and economic prosperity. Trump reiterated his complaint about Russia's expulsion from the group and suggested including China, overshadowing the meeting. The leaders focused on the world economy and economic security, with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stressing the need for a "free, fair and rules-based economic order." The summit concluded with brief, action-oriented statements, reflecting the difficulty in reaching a consensus. The general situation is not particularly optimistic, considering the tariff disputes and geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>Shares of South Korea's SK Hynix reached a two-decade high after reports that SK Group plans to build the country's largest AI data center in partnership with Amazon Web Services. SK Hynix, a leading supplier of dynamic random access memory (DRAM), has seen its shares surge almost 50% this year due to the AI boom. SK Telecom and SK Broadband are reportedly leading the initiative, with support from other affiliates. Samsung, a DRAM rival, also saw a boost in trading but lags behind SK Hynix in capitalizing on AI-led demand. The market's response to AI developments is very optimistic.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump made little progress in bridging gaps over tariffs at their summit, casting doubt on a quick deal to protect Japan's auto sector. Ishiba emphasized that any deal should serve the interests of both countries, with bilateral ministerial talks continuing. The U.S. has given Japan a 90-day reprieve from tariffs, but it is uncertain whether this will be extended. Japan is urging the U.S. to rethink its tariff policy, particularly the 25 percent tariff on autos. The lack of progress creates uncertainty for the Japanese economy. There is limited optimism for a quick resolution given the persistent disagreements.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani made his long-awaited pitching debut for the Dodgers, marking his return to the mound after nearly two years due to Tommy John surgery. Ohtani pitched one inning, giving up a run on two hits while reaching 100 mph with his fastball. The Dodgers had initially planned to delay his pitching debut, but Ohtani expressed concerns about the toll of simulated sessions on his body. He will likely continue to serve as an opener once per week, gradually building up his workload, which will depend on his response to the two-way duties. There is optimism surrounding Ohtani's return, as it brings excitement and hope for the Dodgers' season.</p>

          <p>Members of Parliament are set to vote on a law change aimed at decriminalizing abortion, with two Labour MPs, Tonia Antoniazzi and Stella Creasy, proposing rival amendments to the Crime and Policing Bill. Antoniazzi's amendment seeks to prevent women from being investigated for terminating their own pregnancies, while maintaining punishments for medical professionals and violent partners. Recent law changes have allowed women to access pills to terminate pregnancies at home, but abortion providers have reported an increase in police inquiries related to suspected abortion offenses. The debate over decriminalization highlights ongoing tensions and concerns about women's reproductive rights. The outcome of the vote is uncertain, reflecting a mix of hope and concern.</p>

          <p>The number of Americans 55 and older experiencing homelessness is growing, with over 140,000 individuals unhoused on any given day. This number is projected to nearly triple by 2030, driven by factors such as the death of a spouse, job loss, eviction, and medical issues. Health workers express concern for this vulnerable population, citing complex chronic conditions and unmet needs. Experts note the trend has been ongoing for 30 years, with the Baby Boomers generation being particularly affected.

Nearly 4% of children in this age group have tried a nicotine pouch, prompting calls for the government to prioritize the Tobacco and Vapes Bill, which will ban marketing and sales to under 18s. Nicotine pouches are small rectangles containing nicotine and are considered less harmful than smoking but highly addictive. A teacher started a petition for greater regulation after witnessing a 17-year-old being offered a free can of pouches. The increased awareness and use of nicotine pouches among children is concerning.</p>

          <p>Japan, known for its pacifist constitution, is increasing its focus on arms exports to deepen ties with allies and enhance the interoperability of its forces. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has signaled a sharper focus on the defense sector, attending the country's largest defense exhibition. This shift is driven by security concerns rather than profiting from global arms demand. Exports will allow Japan to develop its defense industrial base and achieve economies of scale. Veteran investor David Roche suggests building domestic capacity is crucial, given the potential for a more transactional approach from the U.S. government. The move towards increased arms exports suggests a cautious but optimistic approach to national security.</p>

          <p>The Senate Finance Committee's version of President Donald Trump's megabill sets up a potential clash with the House due to key differences in provisions. Senate Republicans face challenges in passing the bill, as several senators raise serious concerns, particularly regarding Medicaid changes and provider taxes. The Senate bill would keep the cap on state and local tax deductions at $10,000, while the House bill offers deductions up to $40,000. The Senate version also includes a $5 trillion hike to the federal debt limit, higher than the House's $4 trillion. There is uncertainty regarding the bill's passage due to disagreements and potential defections. The political climate is tense.</p>

          <p>The Society of Radiographers has warned that patients filming their medical treatment for TikTok or Instagram could put themselves and NHS staff at risk. Patients are increasingly videoing procedures without permission, distracting staff and potentially publicizing private medical data. NHS staff wear identity badges, and their names and job titles may be visible in videos posted online. The union said one member of staff was inserting a cannula when a patient's daughter started filming without asking. The filming raised concerns about privacy and professional conduct.

          <p>In response to immigration raids by masked federal officers, California lawmakers have proposed a bill to ban law enforcement from concealing their faces while on the job. The bill aims to increase transparency and accountability by requiring officers to wear identification.

The deal includes a 10% levy on most UK goods, including cars, and did not address the removal of charges on steel imports. The order allows up to 100,000 cars into the US at a 10% tariff, instead of the 25% import tax imposed earlier this year. The UK government said it would "continue to go further and make progress towards 0% tariffs on core steel products as agreed." The agreement is a sign of strength between Britain and America.
