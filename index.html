          <p>A supporter of Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic was shot and wounded outside the parliament building in Belgrade. The incident occurred within a tent encampment set up by Vucic's followers to counter long-running anti-government protests. The 70-year-old gunman, who was apprehended, stated he was annoyed by the "occupation of the city center" and had intended to commit arson. President Vucic described the attack as an act of terrorism, while opposition figures criticized the provocative nature of the encampment itself amid heightened political tensions.</p>

          <p>The NFL has officially approved Julia Koch's acquisition of a 10% stake in the New York Giants, establishing a record valuation for an NFL team sale at $10.3 billion. The league also sanctioned two other minority stake sales involving the New England Patriots and the San Francisco 49ers. These transactions reflect the soaring value of NFL franchises, driven by expectations of lucrative new media rights deals and the recent introduction of private equity investment into the league. The deals required approval from at least three-quarters of the league's owners.</p>

          <p>A prominent child abuse expert has withdrawn from chairing the UK's national inquiry into grooming gangs, citing concerns that the process is being undermined by political "point scoring." This marks the second candidate to pull out, following several survivors who also quit the inquiry's oversight panels. The departing expert expressed frustration over misinformation and adversarial debates, warning that victims are being left with the feeling that the issue will never be resolved. Survivors have voiced fears that the inquiry's focus could be diluted or steered away from addressing the specific issue of grooming gangs.</p>

          <p>A migrant who was removed to France less than a month ago under the UK's "one in, one out" exchange scheme has reportedly returned to the UK on a small boat. The Iranian national, who has since been detained, claimed he fled France due to fears for his life after being victimized by smuggling gangs. The incident highlights challenges facing the new bilateral agreement, which is intended to deter Channel crossings by returning some migrants to France. The man's return coincided with the total number of small boat arrivals for the year surpassing the previous year's figures.</p>

          <p>The White House has confirmed that the "entirety of the East Wing will be modernized" to accommodate President Trump's planned $250 million ballroom, a project more extensive than previously described. Photographs show significant demolition of the wing, which housed the first lady's office, prompting criticism from figures like Hillary Clinton and preservation groups. The National Trust for Historic Preservation has called for a pause, expressing concern that the new structure will overwhelm the White House's design. The administration defended the renovation as a necessary improvement, dismissing backlash as "fake outrage."</p>

          <p>Violent clashes broke out between protesters and police in Dublin after an illegal migrant, who was under a deportation order, was arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting a 10-year-old girl. The unrest occurred outside a former hotel now used as a migrant center, where protesters set a police car on fire and attacked officers with bottles and bricks. The incident has intensified ongoing tensions in Ireland regarding mass immigration policies, which have been a point of contention for months. Six people were arrested, and one police officer was injured during the clashes.</p>

          <p>The UK government has postponed its planned reforms for the Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) system in England until the new year. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson stated the delay allows for a "further period of co-creation" to test proposals with families and experts. The decision has been met with mixed reactions; while some welcome the additional consultation, others express deep frustration, calling the delay "massively disappointing." The current SEND system has been described as "broken" and financially unsustainable, with local authorities facing significant deficits due to support costs.</p>

The settlement resolves a lawsuit over Trump's ban from the YouTube platform following the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot. This contribution accounts for nearly 10% of the project's estimated $250 million cost, which the president has promised will be covered by private donors rather than taxpayers.

          <p>A new study from investment firm Schroders reveals that nine out of ten working Americans plan to claim Social Security benefits before the recommended age of 70, despite understanding that waiting ensures higher monthly payments. Many financial experts advise delaying claims to maximize lifetime income, but the survey suggests this advice is widely ignored. The primary reasons for claiming early include the immediate need for income to cover expenses upon retirement and concerns about the long-term financial stability of the Social Security program. Only 10% of respondents plan to wait until age 70 to begin receiving their benefits.</p>

          <p>Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai is sharing a more personal side of her story in a new memoir, "Finding My Way," which details her life over the past decade. In a recent interview, she discussed her journey of navigating college life, making friends, and addressing her mental health through therapy after surviving the Taliban attack in 2012. Yousafzai explained that she is reintroducing herself to the world, moving beyond the single narrative of her activism to include her experiences with anxiety, finding love, and overcoming her initial fears of marriage. She hopes the book shows her evolution as a person.</p>

          <p>Newly appointed Nottingham Forest manager Sean Dyche has stated that his primary focus is on securing wins, asserting that an effective playing style is more important than adhering to a particular football "fashion." His appointment follows the short, unsuccessful tenure of Ange Postecoglou, who was brought in to implement a more expansive, attacking approach. Dyche, whose direct style has been criticized in the past, argues that the goal is simply to play "effective football" to stabilize the club's situation. Forest is currently in the Premier League's relegation zone after a difficult start to the season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent, massive liquidation event in the cryptocurrency market, which saw over $19 billion in leveraged positions erased, had a more severe impact on smaller tokens than on Bitcoin and Ether. While the two largest cryptocurrencies have recovered some of their losses, alternative coins like XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin remain significantly down from their pre-crash highs. Analysts attribute this to the lower liquidity and higher volatility of these "long-tail" tokens, which are often used for highly leveraged trading. The event was triggered by a broader market shock, creating a "doom loop" of forced liquidations on crypto derivatives exchanges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent cyberattack that forced Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to halt production for weeks has been labeled the most economically damaging cyber event in UK history, according to a new report. The incident is estimated to have cost the UK economy £1.9 billion, primarily due to lost manufacturing output at JLR and its extensive network of suppliers. The report from the Cyber Monitoring Centre highlights the growing threat of disruptive attacks on operational technology, as opposed to simple data theft. It also warned that the incident severely impacted smaller companies in the supply chain that are heavily dependent on JLR for revenue.</p>

          <p>Shares of plant-based food company Beyond Meat saw their dramatic gains sharply reduced as a meme stock-fueled rally appeared to falter. The stock, which had surged over 100% at one point, fell back to a more modest gain after being added to the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF earlier in the week. The sudden interest triggered a short squeeze, as investors with bets against the struggling company rushed to cover their positions. The volatile trading is reminiscent of the pandemic-era meme stock craze, with some observers viewing the comeback of a heavily shorted stock like Beyond Meat as a sign of market frothiness.

          <p>All residents of the seven landmark 1960s tower blocks in Rochdale, known as the "Seven Sisters," are being ordered to vacate their homes due to significant safety concerns. The social landlord, Rochdale Boroughwide Housing (RBH), made the decision after surveys revealed structural and electrical issues, problems with the water system, and roof damage. RBH stated the move was necessary to ensure the long-term safety of its tenants and will provide financial and logistical support to help all 229 households find new homes.

          <p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has confirmed that the league is not reconsidering its choice of Bad Bunny as the Super Bowl halftime show headliner, despite backlash from President Trump and his supporters. Goodell defended the decision, stating that the Grammy-winning Puerto Rican artist is one of the most popular entertainers in the world and that some criticism is expected for any performer chosen. Bad Bunny has been an outspoken critic of Trump and his policies. The commissioner expressed confidence that the performance will be a "great show" and a "united moment" for the hundreds of millions of viewers.</p>

          <p>Walmart, the largest private employer in the U.S., is pausing the hiring of most job candidates who require H-1B visa sponsorship. The decision follows the Trump administration's move to increase the application fee for these skilled-worker visas to $100,000, a policy intended to encourage hiring American workers. While exceptions may be made in some cases, the policy shift illustrates how changes in immigration rules are directly influencing corporate hiring strategies. The H-1B program is frequently used by companies to fill roles in science, technology, engineering, and math, and the fee hike has been challenged in court by business groups.</p>
