          <p>Elon Musk's efforts to cut government spending as part of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have resulted in unexpected costs. While Musk initially pledged significant savings, actual savings are projected to be far less.

The exodus of employees from the Internal Revenue Service is expected to cost about $8.5 billion in revenue in 2026 alone.</p>

          <p>A Trump-appointed federal judge in Maryland has ordered the administration to facilitate the return of a Venezuelan man deported to El Salvador. The judge ruled that the deportation violated a previous court settlement protecting individuals who entered the U.S. as unaccompanied minors and sought asylum. The man was deported under the Alien Enemies Act, but the judge stated that this did not exempt him from the settlement agreement. The court is also considering the case of another Venezuelan man facing imminent deportation.</p>
