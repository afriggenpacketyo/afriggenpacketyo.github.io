          <p>This article examines President Trump's approach to opposition, using the conflict with Harvard University over federal funding as a prime example. Trump believes that any negative consequences faced by those who challenge him are their own fault, not his. This worldview extends to institutions and individuals, with the aim of discouraging dissent through punitive measures. The White House sees Harvard as a test case, suggesting that cooperation is the only acceptable path, as illustrated by Columbia University's more compliant approach. The article highlights the administration's aggressive pressure campaign, including investigations and funding suspensions, which goes beyond what many critics initially sought.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Court of International Trade blocked President Trump's reciprocal tariffs, which were unilaterally imposed on numerous countries to address trade imbalances. The court ruled that Trump exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) by levying universal import duties. The ruling, which the Trump administration immediately appealed, could significantly impact Trump's economic agenda and trade negotiations. The court also struck down specific tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China related to drug trafficking, stating they didn't address the threats outlined in the orders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CBS secured a victory in its legal dispute with Sony Pictures Television, allowing the network to continue distributing "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy!" during the appeal process. A Los Angeles judge had previously ruled that Sony was no longer obligated to provide episodes to CBS, but an appellate panel paused the order. CBS maintains that Sony lacks the legal right to unilaterally sever ties, arguing that Sony's claims are based on dissatisfaction with the existing deal. CBS has distributed the shows for decades and earns a significant portion of the fees paid by TV stations.</p>

          <p>President Trump commuted the sentence of Larry Hoover, the co-founder of the Gangster Disciples, who was serving multiple life sentences. Hoover was convicted on federal charges in 1997 while already serving a 200-year state sentence for a 1973 murder. It is unclear when he will be released from federal custody, as he still faces the remainder of his state sentence. Hoover's attorneys expressed their gratitude, highlighting his rehabilitation efforts and the courts' unwillingness to consider his growth. The lead prosecutor in Hoover's federal trial voiced disappointment, emphasizing the severity of Hoover's crimes.</p>

          <p>A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending legal protections for migrants who entered the U.S. through Biden-era programs. The judge ordered the government to restart processing applications for migrants seeking to renew their status, extending protections to Ukrainians, Afghans, and military members' families. The decision is a victory for immigrant rights groups who sued to stop the administration's effort to strip legal status from various groups. The judge emphasized that it is not in the public interest to render hundreds of thousands of individuals unlawfully present in the country.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer accused Nigel Farage of promoting "fantasy" economics, likening him to former PM Liz Truss. Starmer warned that Reform's policies would lead to increased mortgage costs and spark an economic meltdown. Reform made significant gains in recent local elections, positioning itself as a challenger to Britain's main parties. Farage pledged generous benefits for pensioners and parents, but economists questioned the funding of his proposed tax cuts. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimated the policy could cost between Â£50bn and Â£80bn a year.</p>
