          <p>The Metropolitan Police are "actively" looking into media reports alleging that Prince Andrew attempted to use his police protection detail to gather personal information on his accuser, Virginia Giuffre. The claims suggest he provided an officer with her confidential social security number to "dig up dirt" on her shortly before a key photo was published in 2011. This development comes just after the prince voluntarily relinquished his royal and military titles amid the ongoing scandal surrounding his association with Jeffrey Epstein. The allegations raise serious questions about the potential abuse of state resources.</p>

          <p>Montie Quinn, a running back for Curry College, made college football history by rushing for an NCAA-record 522 yards in a single game against Nichols College. Quinn achieved this remarkable feat on just 20 carries and scored seven touchdowns, five of which were on runs of 50 yards or more. His performance shattered the previous Division III record of 465 yards and also surpassed the Division I FBS record of 427 yards set by Samaje Perine in 2014.

          <p>Thieves executed a swift, seven-minute robbery at the Louvre Museum in Paris on Sunday morning, stealing jewelry of "inestimable heritage and historical value." Using a basket lift and disc cutter to breach a window while tourists were inside, the perpetrators smashed display cases in the Galerie d'Apollon before escaping on motorcycles. The incident, described as the work of professionals, prompted an immediate museum closure and a major police investigation to recover the priceless items, which include pieces from Napoleon's collection. The event has raised concerns about security measures at the world-renowned institution.</p>

          <p>Israel conducted airstrikes in southern Gaza, stating its forces were attacked by Hamas with sniper fire and a rocket-propelled grenade in an Israeli-controlled area. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered "strong action" in response to what his office called a "bold violation of the ceasefire." Hamas's military wing denied involvement, reaffirming its commitment to the truce and stating it had lost contact with its fighters in the specified Rafah area. The exchange marks a significant test for the fragile, U.S.-brokered ceasefire that was recently implemented to halt the conflict.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has issued a warning based on "credible reports" that Hamas may be planning an imminent attack against Palestinian civilians within the Gaza Strip. The statement emphasized that such an act would be a grave violation of the recent ceasefire agreement and could undermine significant diplomatic progress. This alert follows the emergence of a video reportedly showing Hamas fighters executing Palestinians accused of collaborating with Israel. Hamas has since rejected the U.S. claims as "false allegations," accusing Israel of supporting rival armed groups in the region.</p>

          <p>In a commentary piece, former New York Times columnist Charles M. Blow highlights the severe crisis facing local news in the United States, with thousands of newspapers having vanished since 2005. He argues that these outlets provide not just accountability journalism but also the "connective tissue" of community life, from high school sports coverage to wedding announcements. Blow contends that as local news disappears, political polarization grows because communities lose a sense of shared identity and common ground. He concludes by reframing local news not as a struggling industry but as an essential public good.</p>

In an interview, Johnson clarified he was criticizing the "hateful messages" of the protesters, not the entire Democratic Party, citing what he called "violent rhetoric." When pressed on his lumping of anarchists, antifa, and pro-Hamas activists with the modern Democratic party, he pointed to what he claims is a "rise of Marxism" within the party.

          <p>An excerpt from Tim Curry's forthcoming memoir, "Vagabond," illustrates his complicated relationship with his most iconic role, Dr. Frank-N-Furter. He recounts being amusingly denied entry to a "Rocky Horror Picture Show" screening in 1976 by a ticket booth worker who accused him of being an imposter, as two other "Tim Currys" had already called. The anecdote serves as a jumping-off point for Curry to define himself as a "vagabond," an actor who roves, reinvents, and resists being pinned down by any single identity. The passage sets a witty and reflective tone for his life story.</p>

The agreement, mediated by Qatar and Turkey, aims to establish mechanisms for lasting peace and stability in the region. The clashes had escalated after the Taliban accused Pakistan of carrying out attacks in Kabul, leading to cross-border strikes that caused dozens of casualties. Under the new deal, both sides have agreed to end hostile actions and refrain from targeting security forces or civilians, with further talks planned.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The decision to move retirement savings from a 401(k) into an annuity involves a significant trade-off between control and certainty. While an annuity can provide a guaranteed, lifelong income stream, shielding retirees from stock market volatility, it also comes with drawbacks like high fees, loss of liquidity, and limited growth potential. Once the funds are in an annuity, they are locked into a contract with an insurance company, making it difficult to access large sums for emergencies. The choice depends heavily on an individual's risk tolerance, health, and existing sources of guaranteed income. (not investment advice)</p>

The U.S.-brokered peace plan calls for a technocratic committee to manage Gaza's public services, overseen by an international board.

          <p>UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has hinted that the government is exploring the possibility of cutting the 5% VAT rate on household energy bills to address the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. While declining to speculate ahead of the November Budget, he acknowledged the affordability crisis and stated that officials are "looking at all of these issues." The potential tax cut comes as the government faces pressure to fulfill its pledge to lower average energy bills. The move would offer direct relief to households but would need to be balanced against what Miliband described as "difficult fiscal circumstances."</p>

          <h2>Legal Experts Distinguish Federal Case Against John Bolton from Other Trump Critic Probes</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Legal analysts suggest the federal indictment of former national security adviser John Bolton for allegedly mishandling classified information differs significantly from cases against other Trump critics. While the timing has raised questions of political motivation, experts note the charges against Bolton appear to be based on more serious and sustained misconduct. The case highlights the strict procedures governing classified documents, a challenge for prosecutors but not an unprecedented one for a high-ranking official. The indictment is seen as potentially stronger than others, focusing on specific alleged violations of national security law.</p>

          <p>Six months after President Trump's administration implemented sweeping tariffs, American consumers are reporting significant financial strain from rising prices on everyday goods. A Guardian report compiled interviews with nearly 40 people who described smaller grocery lists, higher costs for items from baby formula to car tires, and a general sense of economic anxiety. Recent economic studies suggest that U.S. households could bear the brunt of these costs, potentially amounting to thousands of dollars more per year. The personal accounts starkly contrast with administration promises that the policy would make living more affordable.</p>

          <p>Georgia's primary utility, Georgia Power, is requesting a massive increase in energy generation capacity, largely to meet the surging demand from new AI datacenters being built in the state. The proposal seeks nearly $16 billion to generate about 10 additional gigawatts, 80% of which is for datacenters, raising concerns among consumer and environmental groups about rising electricity bills and reliance on fossil fuels. The state's Public Service Commission will hold hearings to decide on the plan, which has become a contentious issue.

          <p>AI safety-focused startup Anthropic finds itself in a challenging position, competing with the larger, well-funded OpenAI while also clashing with the U.S. government over AI regulation. David Sacks, President Trump's AI czar, has publicly accused Anthropic of "fear-mongering" to promote its preferred regulatory vision, which supports state-level rules that the administration opposes. This policy divergence highlights a fundamental split in the AI industry, with Anthropic advocating for more guardrails while the administration prioritizes rapid innovation to compete with China.

Consequently, some experts recommend that individuals wait until the government reopens before finalizing their 2026 coverage decisions to ensure they have all necessary information.

          <p>Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, once a steadfast MAGA loyalist, has recently surprised observers by breaking with her party on several key issues, including the war in Gaza and Affordable Care Act subsidies. This streak of independence has earned her unlikely praise from some Democrats and fueled speculation about her motives, as she challenges the party line while carefully avoiding direct criticism of President Trump. Some analysts suggest she is staying true to her populist roots, while others posit it could be a reaction to being sidelined for higher office. Her actions challenge the narrative of a monolithic Republican party.</p>

          <p>A joint investigation has uncovered a coordinated campaign by major soft-drink and snack-food corporations to undermine Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s "Make America Healthy Again" movement. The industry is reportedly using a network of Republican-tied strategists and pollsters to frame health-focused policies, such as restricting soda purchases with SNAP benefits, as an attack on the working-class MAGA base. The effort involves obscure research groups, paid social media influencers, and conservative media outlets to create a narrative pitting consumer freedom against government overreach.
