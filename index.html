          <p>Former NFL quarterback Mark Sanchez is now facing a felony charge for battery involving serious bodily injury following a physical altercation in Indianapolis. Prosecutors upgraded the charges from misdemeanors after learning the 69-year-old victim sustained significant injuries over an alleged parking dispute. The incident, which was captured on surveillance footage, allegedly involved Sanchez entering the victim's truck and preventing a call for help before the confrontation turned physical. Sanchez, who was in the city for a broadcasting assignment, was arrested and could face one to six years in prison if convicted on the new felony count.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Census Bureau has started recruiting temporary workers for its 2026 Census Test, a crucial field trial for the upcoming 2030 national head count. The test aims to improve methods for counting historically underrepresented populations, but it faces significant challenges. Government watchdogs and lawmakers have raised concerns about potential delays, uncertain congressional funding, and a lack of transparency from the bureau regarding its preparations. These issues have created apprehension about the agency's ability to conduct a complete and accurate test, which is vital for the success of the decennial census.</p>

          <p>Downing Street has firmly denied any government interference in the recent collapse of a prosecution against two men accused of spying for China. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) dropped the charges under the Official Secrets Act, sparking criticism from MPs who suspect political motives aimed at improving relations with Beijing. Officials insist the decision was made independently by the CPS because the evidence no longer met the required legal threshold. However, critics, including the MP who formerly employed one of the accused, argue that the government may have undermined the case by withholding evidence or witnesses.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown has entered its sixth day, with Senate Democrats holding firm on their demand to extend expiring Obamacare tax credits as a condition for reopening the government. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has made this a central point in negotiations, arguing that Republicans must address the healthcare subsidies before a deal can be reached. Republicans have expressed willingness to discuss the credits but insist the government must be reopened first, leading to a political stalemate. With another vote on a continuing resolution expected to fail, the standoff continues without a clear resolution in sight.</p>

          <p>Nike CEO Elliott Hill stated that the company's turnaround strategy is showing early signs of success but will take time to restore profitable growth. In an interview, Hill acknowledged the process is not linear and involves revitalizing multiple brands and sports categories across different global markets. Since taking over, he has shifted focus back towards wholesale partners, reversing his predecessor's direct-to-consumer strategy, and restructured the company to focus on individual sports to spur innovation.

          <p>The state of Illinois and the city of Chicago have jointly sued the Trump administration to block the planned deployment of federalized National Guard troops. The lawsuit argues that such a deployment is unconstitutional and amounts to a military occupation of American cities. This legal action follows the release of a federal memo indicating that up to 300 Illinois National Guard members and 400 from Texas would be sent to Chicago and Portland, Oregon, to protect federal property. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Attorney General Kwame Raoul contend the move is an unlawful overreach of presidential authority.</p>

          <p>Argentina's government has implemented stricter quality standards for sorghum exports, a strategic move designed to secure and expand its market share in China. The new regulations, which define grading rules based on weight and impurity limits, align Argentine standards with the demands of key international buyers. This policy shift comes after China became Argentina's primary sorghum destination, a role previously held by the United States before tariffs disrupted global trade patterns. The measure aims to prevent cargo rejections and enhance Argentina's reputation as a reliable supplier, potentially creating new trade tensions with the U.S.</p>

          <p>Despite a widespread corporate push for returning to the office, many employees are resisting mandates through passive strategies like 'coffee badging,' where they appear at the office for just a few hours. Research from Stanford professor Nick Bloom indicates that work-from-home rates have remained stable since spring 2023, suggesting a growing gap between official policies and actual employee compliance. Workers are maintaining flexibility by making brief office appearances or adopting 'micro-shifting' schedules to fit personal needs. This trend highlights a persistent desire for autonomy, even as employers try to reassert control over the workplace.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts predict that mortgage interest rates will likely remain stable throughout October, despite recent fluctuations and an anticipated rate cut from the Federal Reserve. After dipping in September in anticipation of the Fed's move, rates have slightly increased, with the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage currently around 6.34%. Analysts suggest that future rate movements are highly dependent on incoming economic data, such as inflation and employment reports, which have been delayed by the government shutdown. This uncertainty makes it difficult to forecast significant drops, leading to a consensus that rates will hold steady for the month. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent tax legislation signed by President Trump is set to alter the landscape for charitable donations, potentially impacting how taxpayers approach their year-end giving. A key change, effective in 2026, will introduce a new charitable tax break of up to $2,000 for non-itemizers, which may incentivize delaying smaller donations until then. Conversely, higher earners could see their charitable deduction benefits reduced in 2026 due to a new deduction floor and a cap on the benefit for top income brackets. Financial experts suggest that these changes warrant a multi-year approach to giving, with some recommending strategies like donor-advised funds to accelerate donations.</p>

          <p>Bubba, one of two trained Harris's hawks stolen from outside SoFi Stadium during a Rams game, has been safely recovered in Hacienda Heights. The hawks, used for bird abatement at the stadium, were taken along with their transport vehicle, which was later found abandoned. The hawk's owner and falconer, Charles Cogger, was able to retrieve Bubba after a homeowner spotted the bird in her backyard. The second hawk, Alice, is still missing, and Inglewood police have released a photo of the suspect. A reward is being offered for Alice's safe return.</p>

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has convicted former Janjaweed militia commander Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-Al-Rahman on 27 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The charges, including murder, rape, and persecution, relate to atrocities committed during the Darfur conflict in the early 2000s, which resulted in the deaths of up to 300,000 people. Presiding judges found that Abd-Al-Rahman, also known as Ali Kushayb, encouraged and personally participated in the brutal attacks carried out by the militia.

          <p>Professional butchers have identified several cuts of beef that they consider underrated, offering excellent flavor and value for consumers. Among the top picks are the chuck roast, praised for its affordability and rich flavor in slow-cooked dishes, and boneless short ribs (also known as Denver steak), which are noted for their tenderness and versatility. One butcher also highlighted the porterhouse steak as a value proposition, as it provides both a New York strip and a large tenderloin section in a single cut. These expert recommendations encourage home cooks to explore beyond premium steaks for delicious and economical meal options.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has refused to hear an appeal to revive a controversial Missouri law that prohibited state and local police from enforcing certain federal gun laws. The 2019 law, which imposed heavy fines on officers who enforced federal regulations without a state equivalent, had been blocked by lower courts for violating the Constitution's Supremacy Clause. The law was motivated by concerns over potential new federal gun restrictions and had disrupted a federal-state law enforcement partnership aimed at combating violent crime. The Supreme Court's decision leaves the lower court rulings in place, keeping the state law blocked.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to hear Ghislaine Maxwell's appeal, cementing her 2021 conviction and 20-year sentence for sex-trafficking offenses related to the late financier Jeffrey Epstein. This decision effectively ends her legal avenues for overturning the verdict, leaving presidential clemency as her only remaining hope for an early release. Maxwell's appeal centered on the argument that she was covered by a 2008 non-prosecution agreement Epstein made with Florida prosecutors, but lower courts had already ruled that the agreement did not apply to federal prosecutors in New York.

          <p>This article analyzes the political rhetoric of Stephen Miller, a key figure in the Trump administration, arguing that he consistently frames political opposition as illegitimate and akin to terrorism. Miller's recent statements on social media, which describe the Democratic Party as a 'domestic extremist organization,' are presented as part of a broader strategy to justify using state power to suppress dissent. The analysis contends that this worldview, which blends with President Trump's own, treats any unfavorable judicial ruling, news story, or protest as an illegal rebellion. This approach rejects neutral standards of conduct in favor of a post-liberal framework.</p>
