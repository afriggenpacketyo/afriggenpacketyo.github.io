          <p>Sophie Lloyd, a magician who initially gained entry to the Magic Circle in 1991 by disguising herself as a man named Raymond Lloyd, is finally being granted official membership after being expelled when her deception was revealed. At the time, women were not allowed to be members, and Lloyd's stunt, orchestrated with Jenny Winstanley, aimed to challenge this exclusion. The Magic Circle has now apologized and is presenting Lloyd with a membership certificate, recognizing her as a role model for women in magic and acknowledging Winstanley's legacy. Lloyd expresses her excitement and honors Winstanley, while the Magic Circle acknowledges its need for greater inclusivity, as only 5% of its 1,700 members are women.</p>

          <p>Shares of Kering, the French luxury goods group owning brands like Gucci, experienced a significant drop after reporting lower-than-expected first-quarter sales. Revenues fell by 14% year-on-year, with Gucci sales declining by 25% as the brand undergoes a turnaround effort. The company attributed the weakness to a decline in sales in Asia, North America, and Europe, citing macroeconomic headwinds. Despite the challenges, Kering's CEO remains focused on executing strategic plans and strengthening the positioning of its brands, amidst broader concerns about a downturn in the luxury market due to inflation and economic conditions.</p>

This statement comes ahead of a meeting between Bessent and Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato, where currency policy is expected to be a key topic. Japan has consistently denied manipulating its currency and remains committed to G7 agreements on exchange rate stability. The U.S. seeks to address trade deficits by focusing on tariffs, non-tariff barriers, currency manipulation, and government subsidies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gold prices have surged as investors seek safe-haven assets amid trade turmoil, while U.S. Treasuries and the dollar have declined. This shift is attributed to a waning faith in the U.S. economy and its assets, driven by uncertainties surrounding trade policy and geopolitical tensions. Gold's traditional inverse relationship with Treasury yields has broken down, with its inflation-hedging qualities making it particularly attractive. Analysts anticipate further rallies in gold prices, with J.P. Morgan projecting an average of $3,675 per ounce by the fourth quarter of 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

Social media platforms and websites must prevent children from accessing content that promotes self-harm, suicide, or eating disorders, or risk facing fines. Algorithms must also filter out harmful content from children's feeds, and platforms must establish streamlined reporting systems and appoint a designated person accountable for children's safety. While some critics argue the measures don't go far enough, others view them as a positive step towards creating a safer online environment for children.</p>

          <p>Vehicles trapped in a central London mechanical stacked car park are finally being released after being stuck for over two years due to a malfunction. Owners are being given three-hour slots to retrieve their vehicles, but concerns remain about the condition of the cars after the prolonged storage. The incident has caused significant financial losses and frustration for the affected owners, who criticize the management company's poor communication. While the car park system has been repaired, questions remain about compensation for the owners' losses.</p>

          <p>The WHO, UNICEF, and Gavi vaccine alliance are warning of a global rise in vaccine-preventable diseases, including measles, meningitis, and yellow fever. Funding cuts to global health, misinformation, and humanitarian crises are contributing to the problem. Measles cases have increased significantly, and many children are missing routine vaccinations. The organizations are calling for increased funding to protect vulnerable children and prevent further outbreaks, as the cuts in humanitarian aid are having a significant impact.</p>

          <p>Victims of murder, manslaughter, and stalking are advocating for perpetrators to be restricted to specific zones after release from prison, rather than exclusion zones around victims' homes. They argue that victims often feel trapped and restricted even with exclusion zones, and that the focus should shift to ensuring their freedom and safety. Some experts raise concerns about potential breaches of perpetrators' human rights, but victims argue that their rights should be prioritized. The Ministry of Justice maintains that exclusion zones and strict license conditions are in place to protect victims.</p>

While speaking out against Hamas is dangerous, some residents feel compelled to voice their discontent, despite the risk of punishment. Recent protests and incidents suggest that civilians are losing their fear of Hamas, driven to the edge by ongoing conflict and hardship.</p>

          <p>An economist evaluates the increasing probability of a U.S. recession, citing indicators like an inverted yield curve, declining consumer confidence, and prediction market trends. The author notes that while these indicators suggest a heightened risk, they don't guarantee a downturn. The impact of Trump's tariffs on the economy is a major concern, leading to business uncertainty and reduced investment. The official arbiter of recessions, the National Bureau of Economic Research, typically declares a recession well after it has begun, making it difficult to navigate the current economic climate.
