          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, has been downgraded to a Category 3 storm but is expected to regain strength as it moves north of the Caribbean. While its direct path is forecast to remain offshore of the U.S. East Coast, its increased size poses a significant risk of life-threatening surf and rip currents along the Southeast. The storm is bringing heavy rain and tropical storm warnings to islands like the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos, with officials urging residents to monitor its progress. This event occurs as the hurricane season approaches its peak, with NOAA forecasting an above-normal season with up to five major hurricanes.</p>

          <p>World number one Scottie Scheffler won the BMW Championship in Maryland, overcoming a four-shot deficit in the final round to finish two strokes ahead of overnight leader Robert MacIntyre. Scheffler's steady play, culminating in a three-under-par 67, contrasted with MacIntyre's difficult start, which included several early bogeys. The Scottish golfer struggled to find fairways and ultimately carded a 73, securing the runner-up position. The victory at Caves Valley Golf Club marks another significant title for Scheffler, who demonstrated resilience and skill under pressure to claim the championship with a final score of 15 under par.</p>

          <p>Jon Rahm has been crowned the LIV Golf individual champion for the second year in a row, earning the season-long award and an $18 million prize. Despite losing a play-off to Sebastian Munoz in the Indiana event, Rahm's overall performance was sufficient to edge out competitor Joaquin Niemann for the title. Munoz won the tournament with a birdie on the first extra hole after both he and Rahm finished at 22 under par. The event also saw former Ryder Cup players Lee Westwood and Ian Poulter secure their positions in LIV for the 2026 season, avoiding relegation.</p>

          <p>As part of the Trump administration's ongoing crime crackdown in Washington, D.C., 68 suspects were arrested on a single Saturday night, with officials seizing 15 illegal firearms. The arrests are part of a broader federal operation that has resulted in over 300 arrests in less than ten days, targeting what the administration calls a "crime plague." Charges from the recent sweep included aggravated assault, assault on a police officer, and grand larceny. A White House spokesperson stated that President Trump's leadership is making the capital safer and delivering on his promise to restore order, a sentiment echoed by Attorney General Pam Bondi.</p>

          <p>In an exclusive interview, Jing Qian, a vice-president at the Asia Society, provides an analysis of the recent U.S.-China trade talks, framing them as a continuation of principles established at a prior summit in Geneva. He notes that the initial goal was de-escalation to calm rattled markets and provide both nations with economic breathing space. The discussions involved high-level officials, including U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng, who were supported by veteran negotiators. Qian's research focuses on the interplay between domestic politics and foreign policy in both countries, suggesting the current rivalry, while tense, is being handled as a manageable issue by both sides.</p>

          <p>The D.C. National Guard has stated that its members involved in the Trump administration's policing surge in the capital "may be armed," a shift from earlier statements that they would not carry weapons. This development is part of a federal takeover of the D.C. police, which has been met with significant criticism from local officials like Mayor Muriel Bowser and civil rights advocates. While the White House touts over 300 arrests as a success, critics express alarm over the militarization of city streets and the potential for confrontations, citing the Posse Comitatus Act which generally bars federal troops from civilian law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Massive protests have erupted across Israel, with hundreds of thousands gathering to demand the government secure a deal for the release of hostages held by Hamas and bring an end to the war in Gaza. The largest demonstration took place in Tel Aviv's "Hostages Square," where organizers voiced fears that an expanded military operation in Gaza City could endanger the remaining hostages. The protests were accompanied by a one-day national strike that closed roads and universities in some areas. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the demonstrations, claiming they would harden Hamas's position, while families of hostages insisted on a comprehensive agreement to bring their loved ones home.</p>

          <p>A Texas judge has issued an expanded restraining order preventing former congressman Beto O’Rourke and his organization, Powered by People, from sending funds to Democratic lawmakers outside of Texas. The ruling stems from a complaint by Attorney General Ken Paxton regarding fundraising for state Democrats who left Texas to block a Republican-led redistricting session. The judge found that the group's fundraising constituted deceptive acts and that financial institutions are now barred from moving funds belonging to O'Rourke's group out of the state. O'Rourke stated his group had already donated over $1 million to support the lawmakers during their walk-out.</p>

          <p>Manchester United suffered a 1-0 opening day defeat to Arsenal at Old Trafford, with a critical error from goalkeeper Altay Bayindir leading to the decisive goal. Bayindir, selected over the recently fit Andre Onana, failed to handle a corner, allowing Riccardo Calafiori to score for Arsenal in the 13th minute. The mistake has renewed debate over United's goalkeeping situation, a position the club did not prioritize during its £200m summer spending spree focused on attackers. Despite a more threatening attack, United could not find an equalizer, placing early-season pressure on manager Ruben Amorim and his choice of goalkeeper.</p>

The discrepancy may be explained by changes in consumer behavior, as persistent inflation and economic uncertainty are causing Americans to slash their travel budgets, particularly for big-ticket items like lodging. This trend suggests that while people are still visiting the state, they are spending less, impacting local economies in popular tourist destinations.

While some Democrats are already back in Texas, the caucus is still determining if enough members will be present to establish a quorum on Monday.</p>

          <p>Acclaimed Irish novelist Sally Rooney has publicly stated she will continue to support the direct-action group Palestine Action, even after it was proscribed as a terrorist organization by the UK government. Writing in the Irish Times, Rooney declared her intention to use her earnings and public platform to support the group's actions, stating, "if this makes me a supporter of terror under UK law, so be it." Her comments come as UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper defended the ban, citing the group's targeting of arms companies and a manual providing guidance on how to attack targets and evade law enforcement.</p>

          <p>As President Trump reportedly plans to press Ukraine to surrender the Donbas region to Russia, Ukrainians are grappling with the potential consequences of such a deal. For many, ceding the territory, for which tens of thousands have died defending, would feel like a tragic betrayal and a violation of their constitution. Polling shows about 75% of Ukrainians object to any formal land cessation, fearing Russia would use it as a springboard for future attacks. However, after years of brutal conflict, some citizens are deeply fatigued and express a willingness to trade land for life, provided any peace deal includes ironclad, internationally enforced security guarantees.</p>

          <p>Legendary investor Peter Lynch recently offered advice on retirement planning, stressing the importance of a long-term perspective when investing in the stock market. He cautioned that while the market has historically been the best place for wealth growth, it is not suitable for those who need their money within one or two years due to its volatility. Lynch also shared his strategy of finding excellent companies within struggling industries, as these often attract less competition and can yield better returns than popular, fast-growing sectors. His guidance serves as a reminder that patience and unconventional thinking are key to successful investing. (not investment advice)</p>

During a preseason game, Gabriel distinguished between "entertainers" and "competitors," leading to social media speculation that he was referencing Sanders, who has garnered significant media attention. Gabriel later clarified his remarks, stating he would never make such a comment about a teammate and that he considers the media to be the entertainers while he and his teammates are the competitors.

          <p>Air Canada has been forced to delay its plans to resume operations after its striking flight attendants' union defied a government-issued back-to-work order. The strike, involving 10,000 cabin crew members, began Saturday and has stranded over 100,000 travelers globally. The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) stated its members will remain on the picket lines, demanding a fair, negotiated contract and urging the airline to return to the bargaining table. Key issues in the dispute include pay and compensation for time spent on the ground, with the union rejecting the airline's latest offer as insufficient.</p>

While data on expected goals suggests some bad luck and poor finishing, the result raises early questions about the team's creativity and goal-scoring ability. Manager Enzo Maresca acknowledged the team is still gelling and pointed to a truncated preseason as a factor, but scrutiny will mount if the expensive squad fails to perform.</p>

          <p>A sniper from Ukraine’s elite “Ghost” unit has reportedly killed two Russian soldiers with a single bullet from a distance of 2.5 miles (4,000 meters), potentially setting a new world record for the longest confirmed sniper kill. The shot was allegedly made with a Ukrainian-made 14.5mm Snipex Alligator anti-materiel rifle in the eastern Donetsk region, an area seeing some of the war's fiercest battles. If confirmed, this would surpass the previous record of 3,800 meters, also set by a Ukrainian sniper in late 2023. The feat highlights Ukraine's innovative use of military technology, often combining drones and AI to push weaponry beyond its designed limits.</p>
