          <p>Taiwan is reportedly facing demands from Washington to commit to a massive investment package, potentially around $400 billion, to avoid the highest tiers of new U.S. tariffs. This move is seen by analysts as a strategic effort by the U.S. to manage trade relations and ease tensions with Beijing. The proposed investment, equivalent to four years of Taiwan's central government budget, has sparked considerable anxiety on the island as it weighs the economic cost of blunting the impact of the impending trade duties. The situation highlights the delicate balance Taiwan must maintain amid escalating U.S.-China trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>A 36-year-old high school teacher in Gulf Breeze, Florida, has been arrested following an investigation into an alleged inappropriate relationship with a 17-year-old female student. Molly Mersereau, who taught hospitality and tourism and coached girls' soccer, faces multiple charges including contributing to the delinquency of a minor and engaging in a romantic relationship with a student. The investigation was initiated after the Gulf Breeze Police Department received a tip from CrimeStoppers. The Santa Rosa County Sheriff's Office has since taken over the case, which remains an active investigation.</p>

          <p>A statue of Robert Smalls, who escaped slavery by commandeering a Confederate ship and later became a U.S. congressman, will be erected on the grounds of the South Carolina State House. This will be the first monument dedicated to an individual African American at the location, which is currently surrounded by statues of White men, many with Confederate ties. The bipartisan initiative aims to provide a more complete narrative of the state's history. Sculptor Basil Watson is creating the 12-foot statue, which will symbolize Smalls' courageous journey from slavery to statesmanship.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formalized new tariffs on imports from over 60 countries, signing an executive order that sets duties ranging from 10% to 41%. The new rates are scheduled to take effect in seven days, largely concluding a period of intense trade negotiations. While the administration secured deals with partners like the EU and UK, it fell short of its ambitious "90 deals in 90 days" goal, with major partners like Canada and Mexico still without finalized agreements. Experts note that while some deals lack traditional detail, they have generated significant revenue for the U.S. Treasury. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An office cleaner at 345 Park Avenue has described her terrifying encounter with the gunman who killed four people in the Midtown Manhattan high-rise. Sebije Nelovic, 65, stated that the shooter, Shane Tamura, pointed his AR-15-style rifle at her after shattering a glass door on the 33rd floor. She identified herself as a cleaning lady and managed to run and hide in a closet, where she remained for hours while the attack continued. Investigators believe the gunman, a former football player, may have been targeting the NFL headquarters in the building but went to the wrong floor.</p>

          <p>In a landmark federal trial, plaintiffs are seeking approximately $345 million in damages from Tesla over a 2019 crash in Florida that resulted in a fatality. The lawsuit alleges that defects in Tesla's Autopilot system and misleading marketing about its capabilities contributed to the collision. The driver, who believed the system would brake for obstacles, crashed into a parked car, killing 22-year-old Naibel Benavides and severely injuring her boyfriend. Tesla's defense argues that the driver was at fault and that the company provides clear instructions on the system's proper use.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order modifying U.S. tariff structures, notably imposing an additional 40% duty on all goods determined to be transshipped to evade original tariffs. The order also updates rates for dozens of countries, ranging from 10% to 41%, and raises tariffs on non-USMCA Canadian goods to 35%. Countries not explicitly listed will face a 10% duty. This move represents a significant step in the administration's "reciprocal" trade policy, aiming to close loopholes and increase pressure on trading partners to comply with U.S. terms ahead of new trade agreements.

          <p>After an 18-month endeavor to transition to American football, Welsh winger Louis Rees-Zammit has announced he is leaving the NFL to return to rugby union. The 24-year-old, who had spells with the Kansas City Chiefs and Jacksonville Jaguars practice squads, never played in a regular-season NFL game. In a social media post, he described his time in the NFL as a great experience but stated it was time to come home and do what he does best. Before his departure for the NFL, Rees-Zammit was a prominent player for Wales, having earned 32 caps.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Trump's Tariff Strategy Aims for Short-Term Wins with Long-Term Risks</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent implementation of tariffs and trade deals is being framed as a victory, having avoided the market panic of his initial announcement while still reshaping global commerce. However, this analysis suggests the strategy carries significant long-term risks. While the U.S. has secured some agreements and increased tariff revenue, the approach has raised prices, created uncertainty, and prompted traditional allies to seek new economic partnerships. The ultimate success of revitalizing domestic manufacturing remains uncertain, and American consumers and businesses may ultimately bear the costs of the new trade landscape.

          <p>China's on-demand delivery war is intensifying as major players Meituan and JD.com invest heavily in central kitchen infrastructure. Meituan plans to launch 1,200 "Raccoon Restaurants," which are takeaway-only food court hubs designed to lower costs and boost efficiency for its restaurant partners. In response, e-commerce giant JD.com announced a 1 billion yuan investment to establish 10,000 of its own self-operated kitchens over the next three years. These strategic moves signal a new phase of competition focused on controlling the food production and delivery supply chain.</p>

          <p>Colombia experienced a significant 43% increase in deforestation in 2024 compared to the previous year, reversing a recent downward trend. The government reported that the Amazon rainforest was the most affected area, accounting for over 65% of the nearly 114,000 hectares of forest destroyed. Authorities attribute the surge to factors including land-grabbing for cattle ranching, illegal construction, cultivation of illicit crops, and wildfires exacerbated by drought. Despite the spike, the overall loss remains below 2021 levels, but the reversal is a major setback for the biodiverse nation.</p>

          <p>Design software company Figma experienced a massive 250% surge in its stock price during its first day of trading, resulting in a market capitalization of nearly $68 billion. The blockbuster IPO is a major win for its early venture capital backers, including Index Ventures and Sequoia, who now hold billions in paper gains. The successful debut comes after Figma's planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe collapsed due to regulatory pressure. This event marks a bright spot in the tech IPO market, which has been subdued for several years, signaling renewed investor appetite. (not investment advice)</p>
