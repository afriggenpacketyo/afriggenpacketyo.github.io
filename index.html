          <p>Following continued missile exchanges between Israel and Iran, numerous American students and tour groups in Israel are making arrangements to evacuate. The U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem has indicated that the State Department is planning for potential assistance with departures, likely to nearby safe countries. Birthright Israel has already evacuated around 1,500 program participants via cruise ship to Cyprus, with efforts ongoing to secure solutions for those remaining. Despite the dangers, some Americans expressed feeling connected and safe in Israel, highlighting the complex emotions surrounding the situation, as some families are still waiting for evacuation plans from the U.S. government to be finalized. The situation remains tense as individuals navigate evacuation logistics and grapple with mixed feelings about leaving. Optimism surrounding the situation is fairly low.</p>

          <p>Flights related to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportations have more than doubled in the Los Angeles area in the month leading up to Sunday, following multiple raids including one in the Fashion District. ICE has arrested 330 people as of June 11, some of whom have been flown out of the area. The majority of these flights originate from the Southern California Logistics Airport in Victorville, near the Adelanto ICE Processing Center, with destinations including Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport and El Paso. ICE maintains that it does not provide details about future flights for security reasons, as the agency regularly flies deportees to Central America and other parts of the world. The events are causing great distress in the targeted communities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government has brokered a peace deal between the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda to end the conflict in eastern DRC, which is largely driven by competition over mineral resources. The agreement, which is set to be signed in Washington, aims to end the fighting and potentially bring billions of dollars of American investment into the region. Critics are skeptical of the deal's success, as the M23 rebel group, believed to be backed by Rwanda, is not a signatory and has not been involved in negotiations. If implemented, the deal could provide the U.S. access to critical resources and counter China's dominance in the region's cobalt reserves, but the success of the deal hinges on the M23 group adhering to the terms.</p>

          <p>This article emphasizes the importance of public pools for mental, physical, and social health, referencing historical perspectives and current needs. Swimming is presented as a mood-boosting exercise that offers a unique sense of buoyancy and embrace, providing a form of transcendence. The article highlights the historical role of pools as community hubs and the tragic impact of desegregation, which led to the decline of public pools and the rise of private alternatives. The author advocates for reinvesting in public pools to promote health, happiness, and community, especially in the face of increasingly hot summers. The author's tone is generally positive and hopeful.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wales will ban plastic wet wipes starting in December 2026 to reduce environmental harm caused by plastic and microplastic pollution. The ban, which follows a vote in the Senedd, makes Wales the first UK nation to implement such a measure, adding plastic wet wipes to a 2023 law prohibiting single-use plastic products. Medical-grade wipes are exempt, and the ban does not extend to business-to-business supply, with an 18-month transition period for manufacturers to adapt. Research has found that wet wipes pose a significant risk to the environment, contributing to sewage blockages and overspills, thus decisive action will encourage a shift towards reusable and non-plastic alternatives.</p>

          <p>An analyst close to the Iranian regime acknowledges that Iran's power in the region has been weakened, but insists that Iranians remain united against Israel despite ongoing attacks. The analyst claims that social cohesion is strong and that only a small percentage of Iranians would support the government's downfall, contradicting independent surveys that indicate widespread opposition. The analyst also repeated warnings against U.S. intervention, stating that American military bases in the region would be easy targets. Despite the bluster, the admission of weakened regional power suggests a growing strain on the Iranian government amid ongoing conflict and internal unrest.</p>

The bill, which allows terminally ill adults to get medical assistance to end their own lives, has faced increasing debate, with some MPs switching sides to oppose it due to concerns about insufficient safeguards. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer supports the bill, while Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch opposes it, citing concerns about the NHS's readiness to carry out assisted suicide. Broadcaster Esther Rantzen, who is terminally ill, has voiced support for the bill, arguing it would help those with unbearable suffering shorten an agonizing death.</p>

          <p>New Zealand's Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has suspended millions of dollars in funding to the Cook Islands, citing a lack of transparency regarding its strategic partnership agreements with China. The funding pause, amounting to an $11 million development assistance payment, is due to concerns over the scope of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership agreement signed in February, which covers deep-sea mining, regional cooperation, and economic issues. New Zealand's Foreign Minister Winston Peters stated that the agreements with China demonstrate a "gap in understanding" about the special relationship between the two countries, with New Zealand seeking to restore trust. The move underscores growing friction between New Zealand, Australia, and Pacific island nations as China expands its influence in the region.</p>

Trump has approved attack plans but is awaiting potential negotiations from Iran, causing a rift among his Republican base, with some urging aggressive action and others calling for restraint. Democrats in Congress are raising concerns over Trump's war power authority, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is pressing Trump to join the conflict.

The video-sharing app has been under scrutiny due to concerns over its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, and potential national security risks. Trump, who had previously vowed to save TikTok, signed an executive order to postpone the enforcement of a law requiring the app to be banned unless sold. TikTok expressed gratitude for Trump's support in keeping the app available for its 170 million US users, as the situation remains fluid amid ongoing negotiations and regulatory hurdles.</p>

The first trial ended in a mistrial due to a hung jury, leading to the second trial which included testimony, evidence scrutiny, and legal battles over evidence and witness credibility.

Hegseth has been a vocal proponent of ending DEI programs, claiming they put military service members at risk, despite evidence to the contrary. The Pentagon has stated that it may still engage in activities that build camaraderie, support mission-related outreach, and recognize historical events, but it has provided no additional comment on the Juneteenth directive.

          <p>Police in Hungary have banned the annual Budapest Pride march, prompting a defiant response from Mayor Gergely Karacsony, who vowed that the city council would organize the event as a local gathering. The ban is the latest development in a confrontation between the nationalist government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban and the LGBTQ community, with the government citing child protection laws restricting the public promotion of homosexuality. Karacsony argues that the police have no right to ban the event, as it falls under the city council's authority and does not violate freedom of assembly. The situation remains tense as authorities and organizers clash over the event's legality and the rights of the LGBTQ community.</p>

          <p>President Trump has been briefed on the potential risks and benefits of bombing Fordo, Iran's most secure nuclear site, and views disabling it as necessary due to the risk of weapons production. Trump approved attack plans but has not made a final decision, hoping Iran will agree to abandon its nuclear program, he is willing to involve the U.S. if necessary, and has discussed using bunker-buster bombs. Diplomatic efforts are underway to find a resolution, with the UK and other European allies engaging with Iran. Intelligence reports indicate the estimated speed at which Iran could produce bombs, with the CIA claiming Iran is very close to possessing nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>As the conflict between Israel and Iran escalates, questions arise about the UK's potential involvement, particularly if the US commits military forces to help Israel eliminate Iran's nuclear program. While Britain is not a central player and has called for de-escalation, it still has a diplomatic role to play with its European allies. The UK also possesses military and strategic assets in the Middle East and Indian Ocean, including the Diego Garcia base, RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, and naval presence in the Gulf. The Attorney General has advised that any UK military involvement must be purely defensive, as the situation remains fluid.</p>

Citing national security concerns, Congress passed the law last year, requiring ByteDance to sever ties with TikTok or face being cut off from U.S. app stores.

Trade tensions have led to downward revisions in most indicators of foreign direct investment (FDI), including GDP, capital formation, and investor sentiment. Manufacturing investments, which had seen growth due to supply chain diversification, are now stalling due to tariffs.

The cost of the expansion could be covered by raising fees on all customer bills, but the government says savings will be made by cutting energy companies' expenditure.

It references research on the stages of offense, common triggers, and differing reactions based on gender. The author argues that learning to be less offended is more beneficial than trying to control others' behavior, and recommends laughing off minor offenses, using the prefrontal cortex to manage emotions, and tuning out offense-making media. It is suggested that a proclivity to be offended can be associated with narcissism, urging sensitivity and empathy but also cautioning against assuming bad faith from those claiming offense.</p>

The sugary beverage is believed to be particularly appealing to spirits, especially child ghosts like Kuman Thong, who can grant wishes in exchange for offerings.

Undocumented workers make up a significant portion of the workforce in states that supported Mr. Trump in the 2024 election, as research indicates that deportations can lead to fewer jobs for native-born workers and a decrease in U.S. GDP.

          <p>The opening round of Club World Cup group matches in the United States has seen low attendance, with more than 400,000 seats left empty.
