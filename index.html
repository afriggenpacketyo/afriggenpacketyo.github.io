          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military conducted strikes on three nuclear sites in Iran: Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, marking a significant escalation in the conflict between Israel and Iran. Trump declared the operation a "tremendous success" aimed at destroying Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity. He warned Iran to "make peace" or face further attacks, stating that key uranium enrichment sites were "completely and totally obliterated." The Iranian Atomic Energy Organization condemned the strikes as a violation of international law, while U.S. officials reported using B-2 stealth bombers and Tomahawk cruise missiles in the operation, which was preceded by notification to Israel and House Speaker Mike Johnson. This action follows days of missile barrages between Israel and Iran after Israel launched a preemptive strike against Iran's nuclear program, fearing they were close to producing a nuclear weapon. Optimism regarding de-escalation is diminished with the U.S.'s direct involvement.</p>

          <p>Congressional leaders have expressed mixed reactions to President Trump's order to strike three Iranian nuclear sites. Republicans like Sen. Lindsey Graham praised the move, while Democrats, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, questioned the president's authority and the constitutionality of the action. Jeffries stated that Trump "misled the country" and failed to seek congressional authorization, raising concerns about entanglement in a disastrous war. Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders criticized the action as unconstitutional, emphasizing that only Congress has the power to declare war, while some Republicans, such as Rep. Thomas Massie, echoed these concerns. House Speaker Mike Johnson, however, was briefed ahead of the strikes and endorsed the action as preventing terrorism.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. military has attacked three nuclear sites in Iran, marking America's direct involvement in the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. Trump stated that the strikes, conducted on sites in Fordo, Natanz, and Esfahan, were a "very successful attack." He demanded that Iran agree to end the war, adding that it was a "historic moment" for the world. The U.S. action follows a week of mixed signals from Trump, during which Israel reportedly requested U.S. assistance in airstrikes targeting Iran's nuclear program. The move is expected to escalate tensions, potentially leading to strikes on American troops and military bases in the Middle East, as Iranian leaders had previously warned that U.S. military participation would have irreparable consequences.</p>

          <p>Reps. Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie have criticized President Trump's decision to launch strikes on Iranian nuclear sites without congressional authorization, invoking the War Powers Resolution. They argue that the strikes are unconstitutional and call for Congress to convene to prevent further escalation in the Middle East. The War Powers Resolution aims to limit the president's ability to engage in military actions without congressional approval. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have expressed concerns about the legality of Trump's actions, emphasizing Congress's constitutional role in declaring war. Sen. Tim Kaine has also introduced a war powers resolution, highlighting growing opposition to U.S. military involvement in Iran.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, the U.S. has initiated diplomatic contact with Iran, assuring them that the strikes represent the extent of U.S. plans and that regime change is not the objective.

The U.S. also informed Israel in advance of the strikes, and Trump spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu afterward.

He warned of "far greater" attacks if Iran does not "make peace," emphasizing that the objective was to end the nuclear threat posed by Iran. The strikes targeted three Iranian nuclear sites at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, with Trump stating that these were the "most difficult of them all, by far, and perhaps the most lethal." He thanked the Israeli military for their cooperation and indicated that other sites could be targeted in the future. The remarks were delivered with Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth present.</p>

Jessi recounts the impact of the tragedy, her struggles with identity, and her journey toward healing, including reconnecting with a childhood friend and writing a book about her life. The article details the investigation, trial, and eventual conviction of Jeff Pelley, as well as Jessi's efforts to rebuild her life and find peace after enduring immense loss.

The decision follows over a week of Israeli attacks aimed at dismantling Iran's offensive missile capabilities and damaging its nuclear enrichment facilities.

The effectiveness of the strikes in destroying Iran's nuclear research facilities remains uncertain, and failure to achieve this goal could increase pressure for further action. The move has also prompted criticism from both Democrats and members of Trump's own "America First" movement, highlighting domestic political concerns. The situation is a waiting game to see how Iran responds, with Trump hoping to force greater concessions at the negotiating table, though this seems unlikely given Iran's previous unwillingness to negotiate under attack.</p>
