          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz defended his government's decision to partially suspend arms exports to Israel, specifically weapons that could be used in a Gaza offensive. Merz clarified that while Germany's solidarity with Israel is unchanged, it cannot supply arms for a conflict where civilian casualties are a major concern. The decision has drawn criticism from within Merz's own conservative party and from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who claimed Merz "buckled" under pressure. This move marks a significant policy shift for Germany, one of Israel's most steadfast allies.</p>

          <p>During a preseason game against the Los Angeles Rams, Dallas Cowboys star receiver CeeDee Lamb was involved in an unusual incident on the sideline. While celebrating a play, Lamb, who was not playing in the game, inadvertently collided with a sideline official. Neither person was injured, but the Cowboys received a penalty for sideline interference because Lamb was standing in the restricted area. The referee explained that the contact resulted in an automatic foul, adding a bizarre moment to the preseason matchup.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators marched through central London to show support for Israel and demand the release of hostages held in Gaza. Led by the UK's chief rabbi, protesters carried Israeli flags and placards with hostages' faces, with some expressing anger over the UK government's intention to recognize a Palestinian state. The march was largely peaceful, although police made one arrest and managed minor scuffles with a few counter-protesters. Many attendees voiced concerns about rising antisemitism in Britain since the conflict's escalation.</p>

          <p>Firefighters have made significant progress battling the Canyon fire in Ventura County, California, achieving 62% containment as of Sunday morning. The blaze, which has burned 5,370 acres near the Los Angeles County line, has stopped spreading, allowing evacuation orders for 2,700 residents to be lifted. The fire destroyed seven structures and resulted in injuries to three firefighters. Crews remain vigilant due to high temperatures and potential wind gusts, focusing on strengthening containment lines and monitoring the area.</p>

          <p>Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser responded to former President Trump's threats of a federal takeover of the city's law enforcement, defending the capital's ability to manage its own police. Bowser asserted that despite a spike in 2023, violent crime has dropped significantly over the past two years, contradicting White House claims of rampant violence. She argued that any federal surge would not be due to a crime spike and that the city's actual needs are for more federal prosecutors and infrastructure repairs. The mayor also expressed concern over the potential deployment of the National Guard.</p>

          <p>Police in Downpatrick, Northern Ireland, have launched a murder investigation after a man's body was discovered in a house on Sunday. A 30-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder. Authorities suspect the death may be connected to a separate, serious assault on a local priest, Fr. John Murray, who was attacked with a bottle in his church earlier the same day. The priest was hospitalized in serious condition, and the linked events have deeply shocked the local community.</p>

          <p>Executives from Frontier Airlines and United Airlines have warned that reductions in domestic flight capacity may be on the horizon. Frontier CEO Barry Biffle stated that many domestic routes are unprofitable for the industry due to an oversupply of flights relative to demand. This sentiment was echoed by United CEO Scott Kirby, who previously noted that many airlines are losing money on a significant portion of their routes. These warnings suggest that travelers could face fewer flight options and potentially higher fares for domestic travel in the future as airlines adjust their schedules for economic viability.

          <p>Apple's stock experienced a remarkable 13% weekly rally, its best in over five years, which this article attributes to a significant short squeeze. Despite negative sentiment from short-sellers, who bet against the company due to its perceived lack of a clear AI strategy and potential antitrust issues, the stock soared. The rally was so powerful it masked negative trends in the broader market, as indicated by the disparity between the market-cap-weighted and equal-weight S&P 500 indexes. The squeeze was intensified by positive developments, such as former President Trump's endorsement of Apple's U.S. investment plans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A growing movement on social media is promoting skepticism about sunscreen, causing alarm among dermatologists and public health experts. Influencers and users are making claims against the safety of chemical ingredients like oxybenzone and promoting unproven DIY alternatives, with some advocating for avoiding sunscreen entirely. This trend is fueled by a broader distrust in conventional health advice and federal regulators. Health professionals counter these claims by emphasizing that ultraviolet radiation is a known carcinogen and that decades of scientific data confirm sunscreen's critical role in preventing skin cancer.</p>

          <p>A review of Frances Wilson's new biography, "Electric Spark: The Enigma of Dame Muriel," highlights the often-overlooked religious dimension of the celebrated comic novelist's work. While known for her wit, Muriel Spark was a devout Catholic convert whose writing was deeply influenced by the Bible, particularly the Book of Job. The article posits that Spark explored theological themes of divine judgment and human fallibility through her narrative structure, often playing God with her characters by revealing their fates early in her stories. This technique forced readers to focus not on what would happen, but on the complex interplay of providence and free will.</p>

          <p>An environmental scientist on TikTok effectively dismantled a common climate change myth by clarifying the role of human activity in the planet's current warming trend. Responding to a comment, she acknowledged that the Earth naturally goes through warming and cooling cycles but emphasized that scientific consensus shows human emissions have drastically accelerated the current cycle. Using charts from the EPA, she demonstrated that the rapid increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane far exceeds natural patterns. This accelerated greenhouse effect is causing more extreme weather and threatening global stability.</p>

          <p>Allies of the late Alex Salmond have rejected suggestions made in Nicola Sturgeon's upcoming memoir that Salmond himself may have leaked details of a 2018 sexual misconduct investigation against him. In her book, Sturgeon denies she or her team were the source of the leak, adding it would have been "classic Alex" to have orchestrated it. Salmond's allies in the Alba party have called the claim a "fabrication" and "hypocrisy," reigniting the bitter feud that fractured the Scottish independence movement. The journalist who broke the original story also stated he found the theory that Salmond was the source not to be credible.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US fashion designer Willy Chavarria has issued an apology following criticism that a shoe he designed with Adidas culturally appropriated a traditional Mexican sandal. The "Oaxaca Slip-On" was inspired by the huarache, a leather sandal made by Indigenous artisans, but was reportedly produced without partnership or credit to the originating communities. The controversy drew comments from Mexico's president, who supported legal action. Chavarria expressed deep regret that the design was not developed in a meaningful partnership with the Oaxacan community, and promotional images for the shoe have been removed.</p>

          <p>A 34-year-old man from Ohio, Jason Lee, and his family saved $60,000 over five years to quit their jobs and move to Taiwan for a 13-month sabbatical. The primary motivation was to allow their young son to bond with his paternal grandparents and for the family to immerse themselves in the culture. The career break has been transformative, allowing them to focus on health, family, and re-evaluating their professional goals, leading them to prioritize happiness over high salaries. The experience has been so positive that they are now expecting their second child, born in Taiwan, before returning to the U.S.</p>
