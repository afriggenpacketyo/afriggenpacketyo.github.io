          <p>The Trump administration has discontinued funding for mental health services for children, which were authorized by Congress following the Uvalde, Texas, school shooting. The Education Department cited potential violations of federal civil rights law related to diversity initiatives, specifically the recruitment of nonwhite counselors. Senator Christopher Murphy criticized the move as illegal and called on Republican supporters of the original legislation to object. The department claims the grant recipients used the funding to implement race-based actions like recruiting quotas, but Mary Wall, a former deputy assistant secretary for education, argued that the application process favored programs that reflected the communities they served, which is a common-sense practice with proven results.</p>

          <p>Former New Mexico Judge Joel Cano and his wife, Nancy Cano, have been released on bond after being accused of harboring an alleged member of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.

Joel Cano admitted to destroying Ortega's cellphone, believing it contained incriminating photos. The Canos face up to 15 years in prison, and Joel Cano has been permanently barred from holding judicial office in New Mexico.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a plan requiring placebo-controlled studies for all new vaccines, including updated COVID shots, raising concerns about potential delays. This move marks a shift from current practices, particularly for COVID boosters, which have been authorized without human trials to target new strains. The announcement also included a National Institutes of Health effort to develop new vaccine technologies beyond mRNA. While some experts support thorough vaccine evaluation, they warn that delaying approval of lifesaving shots could endanger public health. Dr. Peter Marks, former Food and Drug Administration’s top vaccine official, has stated that the claim that they have not done randomized trials for pediatric vaccines aside from Covid is not correct.</p>

          <p>Apple is set to report its fiscal second-quarter earnings, with Wall Street analysts closely watching for the company's response to President Trump's tariffs. Investors are keen to understand the potential impact of these tariffs on Apple's sales, earnings, and product prices, as the company generates about three-quarters of its revenue from products made in China. Analysts at TD Cowen estimate that the current tariffs could cost Apple 6% of its earnings per year. Additionally, investors will be scrutinizing Apple's sales in China amidst concerns of rising economic rivalry.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that semaglutide, known as Ozempic and Wegovy, may effectively treat metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a fatty liver condition linked to obesity and diabetes. The research, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, demonstrated significant improvements in liver health among patients treated with semaglutide. Dr. Celine Gounder noted that almost two-thirds of people had a reduction in liver inflammation, and over a third had a reduction in liver scarring. While the results are promising, Gounder cautioned that longer-term studies are needed to fully assess the benefits and side effects.</p>

          <p>The Ford display is seen at the New York International Auto Show on April 16, 2025.\n\nDETROIT — Automakers such as Ford Motor , Hyundai Motor and Kia on Thursday reported significant year-over-year U.S. sales increases in April as consumers rushed to purchase new vehicles ahead of potential price hikes due to tariffs.\n\nThe tariff fear-buying began in late March and continued into April, buoyed by several automakers offering special discounts or promising not to raise prices in the near term due to President Donald Trump's auto tariffs.\n\n"April results are dominated by the prospect of future vehicle price increases due to tariffs," said Thomas King, president of the data and analytics division at J.D. Power.\n\nBut the good times may not last. King and Cox Automotive chief economist Jonathan Smoke note that demand slowed in late April as new vehicle inventories tightened and prices increased following the earlier consumer rush to purchase.\n\n"The economy and auto market are transitioning to a world with higher tariffs on imports," Smoke said Tuesday. "The first phase of frenzy in the retail vehicle market seems to have already passed as April is ending with less momentum than it began."\n\nSmoke said the higher costs and lower vehicle inventories are what are likely "sapping momentum and could lead to lower sales in future weeks."\n\nAutomakers enjoyed the consumer rush while it lasted, though.\n\nFord reported a 16% year-over-year increase in its April sales, buoyed by consumers and an ongoing "employee pricing" program the company launched as Trump's 25% auto tariffs on imported vehicles took effect in early April. Ford said Wednesday that it was extending that program through the Fourth of July weekend.\n\nHyundai, which promised not to increase prices through at least early June, reported a 19% increase in sales last month of its namesake brand compared with April 2024.\n\nKia, which is owned by Hyundai's parent company but operates separately in the U.S., said its sales last month increased roughly 14% compared to a year earlier.\n\nGeneral Motors reports U.S. auto sales on a quarterly basis, but the automaker on Thursday confirmed it saw a 20% increase last month compared to April 2024.\n\nToyota Motor on Thursday said its year-over-year sales increased 10% last month.\n\nTrump's 25% tariffs of imported vehicles into the U.S. took effect April 3. Although he modified some tariffs this week, additional levies of 25% on auto parts are expected to begin by Saturday.\n\nThis week's changes included reimbursing automakers for some U.S. parts and reducing the "stacking" of tariffs upon one another for the industry.\n\nFord CEO Jim Farley on Wednesday said this week's changes to the tariffs are helpful, but more actions need to be taken to assist automakers and grow the U.S. auto industry.</p>

          <p>Automakers like Ford, Hyundai, and Kia reported significant year-over-year U.S. sales increases in April as consumers rushed to purchase new vehicles ahead of potential price hikes due to tariffs. The tariff fear-buying began in late March and continued into April, buoyed by several automakers offering special discounts or promising not to raise prices in the near term due to President Donald Trump's auto tariffs. However, analysts note that demand slowed in late April as new vehicle inventories tightened and prices increased following the earlier consumer rush to purchase.</p>

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board argues that President Trump's first 100 days of his second term have inflicted more damage on American democracy than any period since Reconstruction. The board accuses Trump of attempting to establish a presidency unrestrained by Congress or the courts, potentially altering the character of American government. The editorial calls for a broad coalition of Americans to oppose Trump's undemocratic actions while acknowledging his legitimate election and legal policies. The editorial highlights five pillars of democracy under attack: separation of powers, due process, equal justice under law, free speech, and government for the people.</p>
