          <p>The Trump administration has escalated a dispute with Harvard University, threatening to seize control of patents developed through federally funded research. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick initiated a review, alleging Harvard has not complied with the Bayh-Dole Act, which mandates that such inventions benefit the American public. The administration demands a comprehensive list of all relevant patents and details on their commercial use, threatening to grant third-party licenses or take the titles to the patents, which could be worth hundreds of millions. Harvard has described the move as another retaliatory action targeting the university for defending its rights. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Over two years after filing for bankruptcy, Bed Bath & Beyond is being revived with a new store format called Bed Bath & Beyond Home, opening its first location in Nashville. The relaunch is managed by The Brand House Collective, which plans to test a more focused inventory of home decor, bedroom, and bath products. To attract former customers, the company announced it will honor the iconic blue and white legacy coupons, a well-known hallmark of the original brand. While this marks a significant step, experts note the company's underlying financials remain challenged, posing an uphill battle for the brand's successful resurrection.</p>

          <p>Jim Lovell, the celebrated astronaut who commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission, has passed away at the age of 97, NASA announced. Lovell is widely remembered for his calm and steadfast leadership during the 1970 "successful failure," when an oxygen tank explosion crippled the spacecraft but the crew managed a safe return to Earth. He was also the command module pilot for Apollo 8, the first mission to orbit the Moon, during which he famously described Earth as a "grand oasis." His distinguished career as a naval aviator and test pilot was foundational to his unflappable performance during the crisis, cementing his legacy as a true American hero.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent advertising bans against major UK retailers like Zara, Next, and M&S for using models who appeared "unhealthily thin" have sparked concerns about a return of the "heroin chic" aesthetic. The Advertising Standards Authority reports a significant increase in complaints regarding models' weight, though it notes that styling and camera angles were often the issue. Activists and industry insiders express worry that this trend, amplified by social media, reverses progress made by the body positivity movement. The debate highlights the fashion industry's ongoing struggle with body diversity and the potential harm of promoting narrow beauty standards.</p>

          <p>President Trump has confirmed he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on August 15, amid ongoing efforts to broker a ceasefire in Ukraine.

The discussions are seen as a critical diplomatic effort to end the war, with Trump expressing hope for peace but also frustration with Russia's continued aggression.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is demanding $1 billion from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) to settle claims of antisemitism and discrimination on campus. This proposal comes in exchange for restoring $584 million in federal grant funding that was previously suspended. The settlement would also require UCLA to create a $172 million fund for alleged victims of civil rights violations. UC President James Milliken stated that a payment of this magnitude would devastate the public university system, while California's governor has vowed to fight against such a deal, contrasting it with recent settlements made by other universities.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reportedly ordered the U.S. military to develop plans for targeting drug cartels in Latin America, a significant escalation in his administration's approach to combating illicit drug flow. This directive follows earlier actions, such as designating several cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, which provides greater legal authority for using military and intelligence resources against them. The move aligns with the administration's broader national security focus on the border, which includes deploying troops and establishing National Defense Areas. It remains unclear when or how the military might take action on this directive.</p>

Vance is currently on a holiday in the UK, which began with a family visit to Lammy's official country residence. The two have bonded over shared experiences, including challenging childhoods and their Christian faith, meeting several times since Lammy was in opposition. This personal relationship is seen as potentially significant for U.S.-UK relations, particularly under an administration that has often personalized foreign policy, even as both men have previously made critical comments about Donald Trump.</p>

Negret, who has a multicultural background, aimed to create a film with an "Ecuadorian soul," shooting on location and collaborating with the local Indigenous community. The film features dialogue in English, Spanish, and the local Kichwa language, and explores the Andean demon known as the Supay, providing a fresh perspective on the exorcism genre.</p>

One such protest in Epping was sparked by the arrest of an asylum seeker on sexual assault charges, galvanizing local residents who feel the presence of all-male migrant populations creates an imbalance. While some far-right activists are involved, many protesters are ordinary community members with no history of activism, indicating a shift in public mood.

The book meticulously documents his connection to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, suggesting it began earlier than previously known, and paints a picture of a man in denial. Beyond the major scandals, the biography includes anecdotes about his rudeness, lavish spending, and poor judgment in his business dealings.

          <p>President Trump has removed Billy Long as the commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) just two months after he was sworn into the role. Long, a former congressman, was expected to serve a term running through 2027 but will now reportedly be nominated for an ambassador post to Iceland. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will serve as the acting commissioner in the interim. Long's brief tenure occurred during a period of new tariff implementations and tax code changes, as well as significant job cuts within the agency. In a social media post, Long confirmed his new role and commitment to advancing the president's agenda.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a historic peace deal at the White House, aimed at ending nearly four decades of conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev praised President Trump for his role in brokering the agreement, which they said opens a new chapter of peace. A key component of the deal is the establishment of a trade and transit corridor through the South Caucasus, connecting Azerbaijan to its Nakhchivan exclave. The U.S.-led agreement is seen as a significant geopolitical development, potentially diminishing Russia's long-standing influence in the region.</p>

          <p>The suspect in a mass shooting that left four people dead at a bar in Anaconda, Montana, has been captured following a seven-day manhunt. The governor confirmed that 45-year-old Michael Paul Brown was apprehended by law enforcement near the search area. The shooting occurred on August 1 at The Owl Bar, where Brown, who lived next door, allegedly opened fire, killing a bartender and three patrons. Family members and local residents indicated the suspect, an Army veteran, had a history of mental health struggles. Authorities described the attack as an act where the victims were murdered in cold blood for no apparent reason.</p>

          <p>With the recent passing of Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell, only five astronauts who journeyed to the Moon during the Apollo missions of the 1960s and 70s remain. This article reflects on the legacies of these pioneers: Buzz Aldrin, Charles Duke, Fred Haise, Harrison Schmitt, and David Scott. As NASA's Artemis program aims to return humans to the lunar surface, the stories of these remaining explorers serve as a powerful link to the dawn of space exploration. The piece highlights their historic achievements, from the first steps on the Moon to their lives after leaving NASA, underscoring the dwindling number of living connections to that era.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Netanyahu's Gaza Decisions Appear Driven by Political Survival</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-08 17:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to approve a plan to occupy Gaza City is creating tension with both the Israeli security establishment and the public, who largely oppose it. This analysis suggests Netanyahu's actions are primarily driven by his reliance on the hard-right, pro-settler parties in his narrow coalition, whose support is essential for his political survival. These parties advocate for annexing Gaza, a goal most Israelis and the military see as a strategic trap. The situation is further influenced by the U.S., where President Trump's rhetoric has tilted the diplomatic field away from a two-state solution and toward more absolutist outcomes.</p>

          <p>An independent British Member of Parliament, Rupert Lowe, admitted to mistakenly identifying a team of charity rowers off the Norfolk coast as "illegal migrants." The MP posted a picture of the boat on social media, declaring he had alerted authorities and was demanding mass deportations if they were migrants. After HM Coastguard contacted the vessel, it was revealed to be a crew of four attempting to row from Land's End to John O'Groats for charity. Lowe later apologized for the false alarm and pledged a £1,000 donation to their cause, though he stood by his vigilance on the issue of immigration.</p>

          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has firmly rejected the idea of U.S. military action against drug cartels on Mexican soil, vowing, "There will be no invasion." Her comments are a direct response to reports that President Trump ordered the Pentagon to target Latin American cartels. Sheinbaum emphasized that while Mexico cooperates with the U.S. on security issues, its national sovereignty is inalienable and the presence of foreign troops will not be accepted. The statements address renewed nationalist fears in Mexico and underscore the delicate balance of bilateral security collaboration between the two nations.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government announced it will lower the price cap on seaborne Russian crude oil from $60 to $47.60 per barrel, joining allies like the European Union and the United Kingdom. This coordinated action is designed to further restrict Russia's revenues and increase economic pressure on Moscow over its ongoing war in Ukraine. Canada's Finance Minister stated that the measure aims to limit a crucial source of funding for Russia's illegal war. The price cap policy allows non-G7 countries to continue buying Russian oil but only if the price is at or below the set limit. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump stated that this commitment to U.S. manufacturing would exempt Apple from potential future tariffs on imported chips, alleviating a major concern for investors. The positive market reaction was also bolstered by Apple's strong quarterly earnings report from the previous week. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is initiating another investigation into the origins of the probe concerning Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. This move follows the declassification of documents by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, who accused the Obama administration of knowingly promoting a false narrative to undermine Trump's campaign. Now, Attorney General Pam Bondi has authorized a new inquiry into the previous investigations. This latest effort raises questions about what new information could be uncovered, as the topic has already been the subject of numerous official reviews and reports over the past decade.</p>
