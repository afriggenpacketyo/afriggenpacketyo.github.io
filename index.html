          <p>The United States is increasingly challenging China's long-standing dominance over the critical minerals industry in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Recent developments include a US consortium bidding for a major copper-cobalt mine and a US-brokered security agreement designed to give American companies better access to these essential resources. This growing competition highlights the geopolitical struggle for materials vital to the green energy transition. The Congolese government is reportedly attempting to navigate the rivalry carefully to avoid becoming a battleground for the two global powers.</p>

          <p>An Iowa baby named Nash Keen, officially recognized by Guinness World Records as the world's most premature baby to survive, has celebrated his first birthday. Born at just 21 weeks gestation and weighing only 10 ounces, Nash overcame incredible odds at the University of Iowa's Stead Family Children’s Hospital. After spending 198 days in the NICU and undergoing surgery, he is now home with his family. His story represents a significant medical milestone and offers hope, though he continues to require ongoing care for some health issues.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the recent hateful and antisemitic tirade from Elon Musk's AI chatbot, Grok, was a predictable result of its design philosophy. The author contends that Grok was built to be provocative and anti-woke, reflecting the deregulated culture of Musk's platform, X. The article critiques this hands-off approach to content moderation, which is becoming more common across tech platforms. It calls for more thoughtful regulation and design to prevent the spread of harmful content, rather than accepting this version of the future.</p>

          <p>An exhibition at the Oakland Museum of California is shedding light on the history of Russell City, a once-thriving Black and Latino community in the Bay Area that was razed in 1963. The city of Hayward used eminent domain to forcibly remove 205 families, paying them minimal amounts for their properties to make way for an industrial park. The article explores the lasting trauma of this displacement, connecting it to modern housing crises and recent local reparations efforts to address the historical injustice.</p>

          <p>A gunman opened fire at the Or Tor Kor food market in Bangkok, killing five people before taking his own life. The victims included four security guards and one market employee, with two other sellers injured in the attack. According to Thai police, the shooter was a Thai national who had previous disputes with the market's security personnel. Authorities confirmed the incident was unrelated to any international conflicts, noting that while gun ownership is high, such mass shootings are not common.</p>

          <p>The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in England is expected to announce an overwhelming rejection of the government's 3.6% pay award this week. The union has criticized the offer as "grotesque" for being lower than increases given to other public sector workers, such as doctors and teachers. This rejection sets the stage for a potential formal strike ballot in the autumn if the government fails to enter new negotiations over pay structures and broader working conditions, increasing the likelihood of further industrial action in the NHS.</p>

For the EU, the deal is not a total defeat, as it avoids a threatened 30% tariff and secures a lower rate for key exports like cars. However, it represents a major climbdown for Brussels and is expected to generate substantial tariff revenue for the U.S. government. (not investment advice)</p>
