        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials have agreed to a framework deal regarding the ownership of TikTok, with a final agreement pending a call between Presidents Trump and Xi. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed the development, suggesting a move toward U.S.-controlled ownership for the popular social media app. This follows a 2024 law, upheld by the Supreme Court, that mandated TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, either divest its U.S. operations or face a ban, a measure President Trump had repeatedly delayed. The agreement aims to resolve national security concerns while allowing the app to continue operating in the United States.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested that U.S. companies should move from quarterly to semiannual earnings reports, a change that would require SEC approval. He argued on Truth Social that this shift would save money and allow corporate managers to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term profits. The idea echoes previous suggestions by figures like Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon, who have criticized the short-term focus prompted by quarterly guidance. Current regulations mandate quarterly reports, a system praised for its transparency, while practices in Europe often require only semiannual reporting. (not investment advice)</p>

The event featured remarks from prominent Republican figures, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, who urged attendees to honor Kirk's legacy by living as he did, without despair. Other speakers, such as Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., reflected on Kirk's profound impact and shared personal stories of grief and resilience. The faith-filled service emphasized themes of family, freedom, and continuing Kirk's mission in the face of tragedy.</p>

          <p>Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has become the fourth company to achieve a market capitalization of $3 trillion, following Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. The company's stock surged over 4% on Monday, partly driven by a recent antitrust ruling that imposed lighter-than-feared penalties. Despite facing increased competition from AI startups and regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. and Europe, Alphabet's shares have risen more than 30% this year. This milestone reflects investor confidence in the company's ability to navigate challenges, including leveraging its Gemini AI models for future growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Five years after their signing, the Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between Israel and several Arab nations, are being tested by a dramatically altered regional landscape. Initially aimed at countering Iranian influence, the accords now exist in a context where Israel's protracted war in Gaza and other regional military actions have shifted perceptions, with some viewing Israel as a destabilizing actor. The conflict has stalled further expansion of the accords, notably with Saudi Arabia, and has strained relations with existing partners like the UAE. The article suggests the current Israeli government's policies risk eroding what was a significant foreign policy achievement.</p>

Albanese's comments add to growing international criticism of Israel's military tactics, which the UN and other bodies have described as forced mass displacement.

The piece contrasts Carpenter's perspective with the "manosphere's" narrative, suggesting her work highlights the emotional labor placed on women. Ultimately, the album is framed as a sharp commentary on gender power dynamics and the widening social gap between young men and women.</p>

          <p>Documents related to a condominium purchase by Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook could weaken the Trump administration's case for her dismissal on grounds of mortgage fraud. A loan estimate from 2021 reportedly described the property as a "vacation home," which may contradict allegations that she improperly claimed it as a primary residence to secure better loan terms. The administration has sought to fire Cook "for cause" amid President Trump's efforts to influence the central bank's interest rate policy. Cook has sued to block her removal and secured a temporary injunction, while the Justice Department has opened an investigation.</p>

          <p>Homeowners looking for affordable borrowing options may find them in home equity loans and HELOCs, which currently feature lower interest rates than personal loans or credit cards. As of mid-September 2025, the average interest rate for a HELOC is around 8.10%, while 10-year home equity loans average about 8.38%. These products allow homeowners to tap into their home's equity, which currently averages over $300,000 nationally. With the potential for the Federal Reserve to cut rates, these borrowing costs may decrease further, making them an attractive option for financing large expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Community leaders and violence prevention workers in Chicago are pushing back against the Trump administration's threats to send in the National Guard to address crime. They argue that such shows of force are not serious solutions and will only lead to further harassment in already over-policed communities. Instead of politicizing their pain, organizers say the White House should invest in community-based support services, improve crime clearance rates, and address gun trafficking. They contend that the city's long-standing issues with violence stem from decades of policy failures and require investment, not military intervention.</p>

Hall, who is backed by several prominent establishment figures, argues that Mejia has focused more on "social media theatrics" than on his duties as the city's chief auditor. The race sets up a classic confrontation between a veteran politician representing the Democratic establishment and a young leftist incumbent who won office as an outsider. Mejia gained popularity by demystifying city finances on social media, while Hall is campaigning on his long track record of government service.</p>

Burrow was injured during Sunday's game against the Jacksonville Jaguars when he was sacked. This marks another significant injury for the talented quarterback, who has struggled to stay healthy throughout his career, having suffered season-ending injuries in both 2020 and 2023. The loss of Burrow, who led the team to a Super Bowl appearance in 2021, is a huge blow to the Bengals' championship aspirations.</p>

The article details how City manager Pep Guardiola focused attacks down the left flank, using clever positioning to create a midfield overload and pull United's defenders out of position. By "pinning" United's wing-back wide, City's winger Jeremy Doku was free to move inside, creating confusion and space. This disjointed United's press and allowed City players like Phil Foden time on the ball, directly leading to the opening goal and setting the tone for a dominant performance.</p>

The conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) performed respectably, but the environmentalist Greens and center-left Social Democrats (SPD) both saw their support fall. The AfD's success, particularly in former SPD strongholds, is being interpreted as a protest vote driven by public uncertainty over issues like migration, the economy, and domestic security.

          <p>An opinion article uses the killing of Charlie Kirk to explore the volatile nature of modern nationalism, particularly in the United States and China. The author argues that American nationalism is deeply personal and rooted in individual grievance, making political identity existential and eroding compromise. This is contrasted with China's more collective, state-driven nationalism, which enforces unity but can suppress dissent. The piece suggests that Kirk's assassination highlights a dangerous trend where political divisions become so intense that they are perceived as matters of personal and national survival, echoing a warning from Winston Churchill.</p>
