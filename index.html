          <p>Following reports that President Trump fired Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden via email, Democratic leaders voiced strong opposition to the decision, calling it unjust and a disgrace. Hayden, the first woman and African American in the role, was praised for modernizing the Library of Congress and making it more accessible. Conservative groups had criticized her for promoting 'woke' content. Democratic leaders like Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer decried the firing as an attack on American history and knowledge. The Library of Congress holds a vast collection of books, historical documents, and artifacts.</p>

          <p>Shoji Nishida, a hawkish lawmaker from Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, apologized for and retracted his controversial comments regarding exhibits at the Himeyuri Peace Museum in Okinawa. Nishida initially criticized the museum's portrayal of wartime history, suggesting it implied Japanese soldiers caused the deaths of female students during the Battle of Okinawa. Following backlash from Okinawans and fellow lawmakers, Nishida deemed his comments inappropriate. The museum commemorates over 200 female students and teachers who died during the Battle of Okinawa in 1945, a tragic event where over 200,000 people perished.</p>

According to Verisk CargoNet, cargo theft incidents increased by 26% in 2024, with total reported losses nearing $455 million, though the true toll is likely higher. A more sophisticated form of theft, called strategic theft, is also on the rise, where criminals deceive shippers, brokers, or carriers to divert cargo or payments. Experts warn that the current system lacks deterrents, allowing criminals to operate with little risk, and leading to higher prices for consumers.</p>

The author recounts her experience with cold capping during chemotherapy and the subsequent uneven regrowth of her hair. Hair loss is described as deeply tied to identity and confidence, especially for women, and the regrowth process can be slow and demoralizing. The article highlights the prevalence of hair loss, its causes, and the limited scientific backing for many regrowth treatments. It also emphasizes the importance of a root cause approach and the need for doctors to take patients' distress seriously.</p>

          <p>Neuroscientist Mark Blumberg challenges the traditional concept of animal instinct, arguing that the term is too broad and confusing to be scientifically useful. He prefers the term 'species-typical' behavior, which avoids assumptions about the origins or control mechanisms of these actions. Blumberg emphasizes that behaviors are shaped by a complex interplay of genetics, environment, and learning, rather than being solely determined by innate programming. He uses the example of the tailorbird's nest-building to illustrate how intricate behaviors arise from interactions within a system, involving the animal, its body, and available materials.</p>

However, all other goods from the U.K. will still be subject to a 10% baseline tariff, signaling that tariff-free trade is unlikely under Trump's administration.

          <p>Vladimir Putin led Russia's Victory Day commemorations in Red Square with heightened security following Ukrainian strikes targeting the capital. China's Xi Jinping joined Putin as he told thousands of soldiers and more than 20 international leaders that Russia remembered the lessons of World War Two. Putin used his speech to tie the war to today's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and said all of Russia was behind what he called the 'special military operation' - now well into its fourth year. A unilateral, three-day ceasefire was announced by Russia to coincide with the lavish 80th anniversary event, which Ukraine rejected as a 'theatrical show'.</p>

Kenmochi drew inspiration from a visit to Hong Kong and the atmosphere of the anime, blending it with his experiences from the summer of 2024. Utaha found the melody challenging and unlike anything she would create herself, particularly the chorus, but she nailed the rap part. They emphasize the unique phrasing and melodic turns in the song, hoping listeners enjoy the contrast between rap sections and the chorus.</p>
