          <h2>Federal Judge Blocks Release of Florida Grand Jury Transcripts in Epstein Case</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 18:46:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Florida has denied a Justice Department request to unseal grand jury transcripts related to the 2006 investigation of Jeffrey Epstein. Judge Robin Rosenberg ruled that the request did not meet the high legal standard required for releasing such secret materials, stating her "hands are tied" by existing precedent. This decision is a setback for the Trump administration's push for transparency in the case, which has seen renewed public interest and involves calls to release documents that may name high-profile individuals. The ruling is separate from similar requests pending in New York courts concerning Epstein's 2019 sex-trafficking probe.</p>

          <p>A House Oversight subcommittee has voted to subpoena the Department of Justice for its complete files on the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. The motion, which saw several Republicans join Democrats in support, compels the DOJ to release the documents, a move that committee Chairman James Comer plans to approve. This congressional action intensifies the pressure on the Justice Department to provide transparency regarding the handling of the case and the individuals involved. The vote occurred alongside the committee's separate subpoena for Ghislaine Maxwell to provide a deposition from prison.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has unveiled a comprehensive AI Action Plan designed to maintain U.S. dominance in artificial intelligence. The plan includes over 90 federal policy actions aimed at accelerating AI innovation and infrastructure development. Key pillars of the strategy involve expediting the construction of data centers and semiconductor plants, modernizing the electric grid, and establishing rules to eliminate perceived ideological bias in AI systems. The initiative also seeks to streamline regulations that could hinder AI development and create export packages to support U.S. allies in the global AI race.</p>

          <p>Six months into his second term, President Trump has implemented an aggressive immigration enforcement strategy, described as a "shock and awe" campaign. Fueled by a historic level of congressional funding, the administration is pursuing a mass deportation effort targeting migrants living in the U.S. without legal authorization. This push represents a significant shift in federal policy and fulfills a key campaign promise to conduct the largest deportation in U.S. history. The approach has upended established immigration protocols and continues to be a central focus of the administration's domestic agenda.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's campaign to pressure or fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is not about monetary policy but a move toward "fiscal dominance." The author contends that the administration wants to subordinate the central bank to accommodate government borrowing, a practice historically linked to inflation and economic instability. While acknowledging Powell's past policy missteps, the piece warns that undermining the Fed's independence to secure lower interest rates is a dangerous strategy. The real solution to surging debt costs, the article concludes, is to address excessive government spending, not to politicize the central bank. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A coalition of more than 100 international humanitarian and human rights organizations has issued a dire warning about mass starvation in Gaza, urging global governments to take immediate action. The joint statement says that people, including their own aid workers, are "wasting away" due to a severe siege and blockade that has depleted essential supplies. The groups report record rates of acute malnutrition, especially among children, and the spread of disease as the crisis deepens. They are calling for an immediate ceasefire, the opening of all land crossings, and the restoration of a UN-led humanitarian response.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The universally understood word "OK" has its roots in a 19th-century American political campaign and a linguistic fad for playful misspellings. Scholars trace its origin to the Boston Morning Post in 1839 as an abbreviation for "oll korrect," a joking version of "all correct." The term gained widespread popularity during President Martin Van Buren's 1840 reelection campaign, where his supporters formed "O.K. Clubs," referencing his nickname "Old Kinderhook." From this political beginning, the simple, versatile term spread globally, becoming an indispensable part of communication in countless languages and technologies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has indicated that his administration is considering the elimination of capital gains taxes on the sale of primary residences to stimulate the housing market. Under current law, profits from home sales are tax-exempt up to $250,000 for single filers and $500,000 for married couples, with gains above these thresholds subject to taxation. The proposal follows the introduction of a bill by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene aimed at unlocking equity for long-term homeowners, particularly seniors. While the move could benefit many homeowners, experts note the potential high cost and uncertain congressional support for a full elimination. (not investment advice)</p>

As part of a new AI action plan, the White House intends to revise federal guidelines to remove references to diversity, equity, and inclusion, and will require government contractors to ensure their AI systems permit free expression. This move formalizes a conservative critique of Silicon Valley, treating AI safety guardrails as a form of censorship and making the technology a new front in the culture wars.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of senators, including Republicans Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, is backing legislation to exempt U.S. small businesses from President Trump's tariffs on Canadian imports. The bill, named the CANADA Act, aims to shield small enterprises from the economic impact of the duties, which include a threatened 35% tariff. The sponsors argue that the tariffs harm small businesses that rely on cross-border trade, driving up costs and threatening jobs, particularly in northern border states. This legislative effort represents a pushback against the administration's aggressive trade posture toward Canada, a major economic partner. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Six months into President Trump's second term, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is on track to carry out the most deportations in a single year since 2014. Internal data shows nearly 150,000 deportations in the first half of the year, projecting an annual total over 300,000 if the pace continues. This significant increase is fueled by expanded funding and a sweeping mandate to crack down on illegal immigration.
