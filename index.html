          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food costs, decreased to 3.1% in July, a slight cooling from the previous month but still higher than economists' forecasts. This marks the lowest inflation level since November 2024, largely attributed to the easing of significantly high rice prices that had previously more than doubled. Despite this moderation, the Bank of Japan has recently upgraded its inflation forecasts for the upcoming fiscal year, signaling expectations of sustained price pressures. The data presents a mixed economic picture, as it follows better-than-expected GDP growth but also sluggish trade numbers. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, has permitted the Trump administration to proceed with cutting over $783 million in National Institutes of Health (NIH) research grants. These grants were associated with diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs and LGBTQ-related studies, aligning with the administration's broader policy of rolling back such initiatives across the federal government. The ruling overturns lower court injunctions that had previously blocked the cuts, with opponents arguing the move is ideological and could devastate biomedical research. While the court allowed the termination of existing grants, it left a partial block on new restrictive directives in place.</p>

          <p>An eyewitness, who worked as a truck driver for an American logistics company, has alleged that U.S.-hired security personnel, along with the IDF, indiscriminately fired upon Palestinian civilians at aid sites operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The individual provided secretly recorded videos to CBS News, capturing the sound of gunfire at the locations where he claims shootings were a daily occurrence. The GHF, a U.S.-backed organization, has categorically denied these allegations as "baseless," while the IDF stated it is investigating reports of harm to civilians. The U.N. reports that over 1,800 Palestinians have died trying to access food since May.</p>

          <p>Colombia has been struck by two separate, deadly attacks, resulting in at least 17 fatalities. In the western city of Cali, a car bomb targeting a military aviation school killed at least five people and injured dozens more, with the defense minister blaming a narco cartel for the "terrorist attack." In a separate incident near Medellin, a police helicopter on a mission to eradicate coca crops was downed by a drone, killing at least 12 officers. These events highlight a recent surge in violence across the country involving security forces, dissident rebels, and drug gangs.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has determined that Alina Habba, the acting U.S. Attorney for New Jersey and a former personal lawyer for Donald Trump, was not lawfully appointed to her position. The ruling states that Habba has been exercising the duties of her office without legal authority since July 1, 2025, and her actions since then could be declared void. As a result, the judge has disqualified her from participating in ongoing criminal cases handled by her office. The Trump administration has announced its intention to immediately appeal the decision, which has been temporarily stayed to allow for that process.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a legislative plan to redraw the state's congressional districts, a move aimed at making five Republican-held seats more favorable to Democrats. The plan, which must now be approved by voters in a November special election, is a direct response to a Trump-backed initiative to redraw maps in Texas to benefit the GOP. Democrats in California argue this "tit-for-tat" strategy is necessary to neutralize the Republican effort and ensure voters, not political maneuvering, decide control of the U.S. House. The move represents a rare mid-decade redistricting effort with significant national implications for the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>A fourth-generation Texas cotton farmer, facing persistent financial losses, has successfully pivoted his family's business to solar grazing. Instead of traditional farming, he now rents out his flock of sheep to graze on vegetation at large-scale solar farms, effectively acting as natural lawnmowers that keep the areas around solar panels clear. This innovative approach has proven highly profitable, turning a potential six-figure loss from cotton farming into a significant profit. The trend of solar grazing is growing as it provides a steady, reliable income stream for farmers struggling with the volatility of conventional agriculture.</p>

          <p>An active shooter alert that prompted a lockdown and a massive law enforcement response at Villanova University on Thursday has been declared a "cruel hoax." The university's president confirmed that there was no shooter, no injuries, and no evidence of firearms on campus, though the false report caused significant panic and terror. The incident is being investigated as a "swatting" call, a criminal act involving a fake emergency report designed to provoke a large police deployment. The FBI is assisting local authorities in the investigation to find and hold accountable the individual or group responsible for the threat.</p>

          <p>The Kennedy Center has terminated its entire dance programming team, a move that comes amid a broader reshaping of the cultural institution under President Trump's leadership. A spokesperson confirmed that three individuals were fired and that an announcement about a "new direction" for dance programming is forthcoming. This decision follows President Trump naming himself as the Center's Chairman and surprising staff with his unconventional picks for this year's Kennedy Center Honors. The changes in leadership have coincided with a significant increase in the Center's federal funding, which was sextupled in the President's "Big Beautiful Bill."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is escalating its campaign for the removal of Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, whom officials have accused of mortgage fraud. After Cook stated she would not be "bullied" into resigning, a top administration official sent a letter to Fed Chair Jerome Powell urging him to remove her from the board. This action is part of a broader, unprecedented effort by the administration to undermine the Federal Reserve's independence. While the Justice Department is reportedly investigating the unconfirmed allegations, the Fed chair does not have the legal authority to fire another board member.</p>

          <p>President Trump has voiced strong support for the Resolution Copper mine, a massive project planned on a sacred Apache site in Arizona known as Oak Flat. After meeting with mining executives, Trump criticized a recent court decision that temporarily halted the transfer of the federal land to the mining companies. The San Carlos Apache Tribe, which considers the site essential to its religious and cultural practices, is fighting the project in court, arguing it will destroy the sacred land. The project highlights a major conflict between economic interests, environmental concerns, and the religious freedom of Indigenous peoples.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent commitment to provide U.S. "security guarantees" to Ukraine, a significant shift from his previous isolationist rhetoric, has been met with confusion and skepticism. The move, initially seen as a victory for European leaders, was immediately and publicly undermined by Russia, which reiterated that any foreign troop presence in Ukraine is unacceptable. This Russian defiance has made the American president appear weak and has cast doubt on the feasibility of any forthcoming peace deal. This article suggests a mismatch between the administration's desired image of strength and the geopolitical reality of the situation.</p>

          <p>A New York appellate court has thrown out the massive financial penalty, which had grown to over $500 million with interest, imposed on Donald Trump in his civil fraud trial. While the judges upheld the ruling that Trump was liable for fraud, they deemed the fine excessive and a likely violation of constitutional protections against severe punishment. Non-monetary penalties, such as a ban on Trump serving as a company director in the state, were left in place. The New York Attorney General's office, which brought the case, plans to appeal the decision on the fine to the state's highest court.</p>

          <p>The Florida Department of Transportation has removed a rainbow crosswalk in Orlando that served as part of a memorial to the 49 victims of the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting. Orlando's mayor condemned the action as a "cruel political act," while state officials defended it as enforcing a policy against using state roads for political messaging. The move is part of a broader push by the state agency to remove such crosswalks, aligning with Governor Ron DeSantis's stance against what he terms "political purposes" on public roads. The removal has sparked outrage from LGBTQ advocates and local officials.</p>

          <p>The Pueblo County Coroner is under criminal investigation after state inspectors discovered "several bodies in various stages of decomposition" hidden behind a barricaded door at the mortuary he operates. The mortuary's designee, Brian Cotter, allegedly admitted to inspectors that some bodies had been stored in the room for up to 15 years while awaiting cremation. He also reportedly confessed to potentially providing fake cremains to next-of-kin. The discovery was made during the first annual inspection under a new state law, and the facility's license has been suspended.</p>

          <p>Ahn Hak-sop, a 95-year-old former North Korean prisoner of war, was turned away from the border in his attempt to return to North Korea to be buried. Captured in 1953, he spent over 42 years in a South Korean prison for refusing to renounce his communist ideology and has lived near the border ever since. Despite his long and difficult life in the South, his unwavering belief in the North Korean regime and his anti-American sentiment have remained. His thwarted final journey highlights the deeply entrenched and personal divisions that still scar the Korean peninsula decades after the war.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance visited Georgia to promote President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," framing it as the largest tax cut for families in U.S. history. Speaking at a refrigeration company, Vance highlighted provisions such as an increased child tax credit and the elimination of taxes on tips and overtime, setting the stage for the Republican midterm election messaging. The event also served as a platform to attack Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff, who voted against the bill. Vance's appearance signals the administration's strategy to use the tax cuts as a key campaign issue in swing states.</p>

          <p>China is seeking to amend its 1998 pricing law in an effort to curb the destructive, cutthroat price wars plaguing industries like solar panel manufacturing. The proposed revision targets "involution," a term for hyper-competition that often leads to companies selling products at a loss simply to maintain market share. A draft of the amendment is currently open for public feedback, with business leaders in affected sectors expressing support for tighter regulations. The move reflects a broader effort by Chinese authorities to establish a more sustainable and less chaotic competitive equilibrium in the economy.</p>
