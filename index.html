        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts compare traditional and hybrid long-term care insurance policies. Traditional policies offer comprehensive coverage but premiums can increase and benefits are lost if unused. Hybrid policies combine life insurance with long-term care coverage, offering a death benefit even if long-term care isn't needed. The best choice depends on individual needs and financial circumstances.</p>
