          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-15 02:00:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Tsinghua University study reveals that China has produced over one gigatonne of textile fibers since 1978, an amount roughly equivalent to twice the total human mass on Earth. This massive output has positioned China as a dominant force in the global textile industry, accounting for over half of the world's processing capacity. The research also highlights significant environmental challenges, noting that China's textile waste recovery rate is only 17 percent, with most of it being downcycled into lower-quality products, pointing to a need for improved sustainability practices.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge in Maryland has struck down two directives from the Trump administration that aimed to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in educational institutions. The ruling found that the Department of Education acted unlawfully by threatening to withhold federal funding from schools with DEI initiatives, stating the move represented a significant change in policy without following proper procedures. Judge Stephanie Gallagher, a Trump appointee, clarified that her decision was based on procedural grounds and not on the merits of DEI policies themselves, providing a victory for educational groups who argued the guidance was a form of government censorship.</p>

          <p>New home prices in China's 70 major cities fell for the second consecutive month in July, matching the sharpest decline seen since last October and indicating that government support measures have failed to revive buyer sentiment. The data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed prices dropped 0.3% from the previous month and were down 3.4% year-on-year. Despite various stimulus efforts, including eased purchasing restrictions and lower mortgage rates, the property sector's prolonged downturn continues to weigh on the nation's economy.

          <p>Following a successful first season where he led Liverpool to a Premier League title, manager Arne Slot now faces heightened pressure after the club's significant summer spending spree, which could exceed £300 million. The club has made several high-profile signings, including Florian Wirtz for £116m and striker Hugo Ekitike, transforming expectations from a transitional period to demands for sustained success. This substantial investment means Slot's performance will be under intense scrutiny, as anything less than winning major trophies like the Premier League and Champions League would now be considered a failure.</p>

After Newcastle rejected a £110m offer from Liverpool, Isak remains keen on the move, and Rooney notes that selling him could benefit Newcastle financially under current regulations, allowing them to strengthen their overall squad. Rooney also discussed other major Premier League transfers, including Manchester United's signing of Benjamin Sesko and Arsenal's acquisition of Viktor Gyokeres, offering his perspective on their potential impact.</p>

The article suggests that societal scripts for masculinity often discourage emotional intimacy, and calls for a shift away from an identity based on 'domination' towards one grounded in community and care to combat this damaging trend.</p>

The strategy may involve offering apparent concessions, such as a potential future meeting with President Zelenskyy, or tempting Trump with economic deals and a new nuclear arms control pact.

          <p>An Australian man convicted of murdering Emma Lovell, a British woman, during a home invasion in 2022 will be eligible for release sooner after a successful appeal. The Queensland Court of Appeal reduced his non-parole period from 70% to 60% of his 14-year sentence, cutting his minimum time served by 17 months. The judges cited the man's early guilty plea, which spared the victim's family the trauma of a trial, as well as his genuine remorse and troubled upbringing, as reasons for the change. The attack had previously sparked public outrage and led to stricter youth crime laws in the state.</p>

          <p>A man was struck by a vehicle and killed on a Los Angeles freeway while attempting to flee an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid at a Home Depot. The incident occurred in Monrovia, where ICE agents were conducting an operation targeting day laborers, resulting in the detention of ten people. The man's death has intensified criticism of the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement tactics, which advocates say terrorize communities and create dangerous situations. This was one of several recent raids targeting Home Depot locations in Southern California.</p>

          <p>A Minnesota man accused of murdering one state politician and wounding another while impersonating a police officer is now facing upgraded charges. A new indictment charges Vance Boelter with two counts of first-degree murder and four counts of attempted first-degree murder, which Hennepin County's attorney said better reflect the severity of his crimes. Boelter is alleged to have shot Representative Melissa Hortman and Senator John Hoffman in their homes after approaching them in a disguise. This state case is separate from a federal case against him that could carry the death penalty.</p>

          <p>President Trump made false claims that crime in Washington, D.C., is 'the worst it’s ever been' as his administration's federal takeover of the city's police force continues. The assertion comes as National Guard troops and federal agents are deployed across the city and homeless encampments are being cleared. In reality, violent crime in D.C. reached a 30-year low in 2024 after a spike the previous year. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and other local leaders have pushed back against the administration's portrayal of the city as a 'cesspool of crime.'</p>

          <p>Air Canada has started canceling flights as a potential strike by its 10,000 flight attendants looms, threatening to ground the country's largest airline and disrupt travel for approximately 130,000 passengers daily. The airline began a gradual suspension of operations after the flight attendants' union issued a 72-hour strike notice, with a full shutdown expected by Saturday if no deal is reached. The main points of contention in the contract negotiations are wages and compensation for unpaid time when planes are not in the air. Customers with canceled flights are being offered full refunds.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced a plan for Democratic lawmakers to redraw the state's congressional maps, a direct response to a Republican effort in Texas to gerrymander districts in their favor. Newsom's 'election rigging response act' would override California's independent redistricting commission and would only take effect if a Republican-led state advances a partisan mid-cycle redistricting plan. The governor stated the move is necessary to 'neuter and neutralize' attempts to rig elections and vowed that California would not 'unilaterally disarm' while democracy is under threat. The proposal will be put to voters in a special election.</p>

          <p>The series finale of 'And Just Like That' provides a conclusion for its protagonist, Carrie Bradshaw, that sees her single once again, echoing the start of her journey in 'Sex and the City.' After the death of her husband Mr. Big and a failed romance with Aidan Shaw, the show ends with Carrie embracing her independence, supported by her friends. This ending is seen by some critics as more true to the original show's core theme: that female friendships can be the most powerful and enduring 'soulmates' in a woman's life.</p>

          <p>A man in a Van Nuys neighborhood of Los Angeles has been arrested after repeatedly blaring a loud train horn that he had affixed to a palm tree in his backyard. For two months, Gary Boyadzhyan had set off the window-rattling blasts at irregular intervals, drawing numerous complaints from neighbors. After promising police he would stop, he sounded the horn again and was arrested for disturbing the peace. In an interview before his arrest, Boyadzhyan described the disruptive behavior as a 'cry for help' related to personal and legal issues.</p>

Benjamin Marcelo Guerrero-Cruz, who was set to begin his senior year at Reseda Charter High School, is now being held by the Department of Homeland Security pending removal from the U.S. for overstaying his visa.

          <p>A growing number of Instagram users are expressing frustration after their accounts were suspended by parent company Meta, often with erroneous accusations of breaching rules related to child sexual exploitation. Many users have lost access to cherished photos and seen their businesses disrupted, with little recourse or explanation from the company. While Meta has acknowledged some issues, it has not commented on the wider problem, though it has frequently reinstated accounts after being contacted by media outlets. Users suspect that flawed AI moderation is to blame for the unfair bans.</p>
