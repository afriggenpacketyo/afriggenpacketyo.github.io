          <p>The Pentagon is investigating Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's office for allegedly using a system that bypasses standard security protocols to access Signal messages.

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that he will not reduce tariffs on China unless they provide something "substantial" in return. He specified that he wants China to be more open to U.S. businesses and products. Trump suggested that a potential deal could involve allowing the U.S. to freely operate in China and sell its goods. He expressed uncertainty about whether he would even ask for this concession, as China may be unwilling to open its markets.</p>
