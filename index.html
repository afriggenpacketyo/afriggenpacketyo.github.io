          <p>China is preparing for a major military parade on September 3rd to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. While not officially focused on Taiwan, the event is expected to showcase the Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army's most advanced weaponry, including new fighter jets and carrier-based aircraft, many of which were developed with a potential Taiwan conflict in mind. President Xi Jinping's speech is anticipated to provide insights into China's military and foreign policy direction, with analysts noting that Beijing is already sending strategic signals to the self-ruled island through recent military deployments and state media commentary.</p>

          <p>The Chinese yuan has shown significant gains against the US dollar, reaching its strongest level since last November, with appreciation continuing through the first half of the year. Analysts, including those at Goldman Sachs, attribute this trend to China's resilient economic data and a growing lack of confidence in the US dollar due to concerns over US government debt and fiscal policy. The investment bank predicts the yuan will continue to strengthen, potentially breaking the 7 per dollar mark within six months and reaching 6.9 in a year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Panelists at CNBC's East Tech West conference emphasized the importance of nations developing "sovereign AI" to maintain strategic autonomy and cater to local languages and cultures. Experts noted that many current large language models are English-centric, failing to capture cultural nuances. They argued that leveraging open-source AI models and accessible cloud computing services can democratize AI development. This approach allows emerging economies, particularly in regions like Southeast Asia, to build their own AI ecosystems and prevent the benefits of the technology from being concentrated in just a few nations.</p>

          <p>The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI for China unexpectedly rose to 50.4 in June, indicating a return to growth, which contrasted with the official government survey that showed a contraction. This divergence is attributed to the Caixin survey's focus on smaller, export-oriented firms and its mid-month timing, possibly reflecting a delayed response to a US-China tariff reduction. While production and new orders increased, new export orders declined and employment remained weak, with businesses expressing weakened optimism due to fierce market competition and unresolved issues with domestic demand.

Democrats are using the process to force votes on controversial topics, while GOP leaders work to secure support from holdouts, with some key amendments on issues like Medicaid cuts still pending.

          <p>The Trump administration has withheld an estimated $6.8 billion in federal education funds that Congress had already appropriated for the current fiscal year. The move affects programs nationwide that support teacher training, after-school activities, and aid for English learners and students from migrant families, with California alone losing at least $811 million. State education leaders, like California's Tony Thurmond, have condemned the action as illegal, warning it will immediately harm students and disrupt school budgets that had already accounted for the funds.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has successfully pushed through significant housing reform legislation aimed at speeding up construction by easing requirements under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Newsom ensured the bills' passage by linking them to the state budget, a move that compelled reluctant lawmakers to approve the measures despite opposition from some labor and environmental groups. The new laws exempt most urban housing projects from CEQA and also streamline the process for other developments like health clinics.

          <p>A federal judge has delayed the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was mistakenly deported and then returned to the U.S. to face human smuggling charges. His lawyers requested the delay, citing conflicting statements from the Trump administration about whether he would be immediately detained by immigration authorities and deported again upon his release from federal custody. Abrego Garcia had been granted a legal status protecting him from deportation to El Salvador due to likely persecution, making his initial removal an administrative error. He will now remain in U.S. Marshals' custody until at least mid-July.</p>

Despite holding a large majority, the government is engaged in a major persuasion effort to win over dozens of its own MPs who are concerned about the impact on disabled people. Critics within the party argue the review timeline for Pip is too short to influence the changes and that the policy is driven by fiscal targets rather than need.

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has discovered that betaine, a compound naturally produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise, plays a key role in slowing the ageing process. The research, published in the journal Cell, found that betaine acts as a messenger that prevents inflammation and organ ageing by inhibiting a specific enzyme. This finding helps explain the molecular mechanisms behind the anti-ageing benefits of physical activity. The discovery could also pave the way for new anti-ageing strategies that simulate the effects of exercise.</p>

Campaign groups have welcomed the review as a generational opportunity to create a system that better supports working families.</p>
