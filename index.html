          <p>President Trump, addressing reporters on Air Force One, discussed judicial nominations and immigration policies, asserting the need for judges who won't demand trials for every illegal immigrant. He claimed his immigration overhaul was his top campaign issue, blaming judges for delays and warning of dire consequences if the Supreme Court doesn't support his policies. Trump also mentioned meetings with various countries, including China, regarding trade deals, hinting at potential announcements but providing no specifics. This comes amid ongoing trade disputes and tariffs imposed on several nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In Romania, nationalist George Simion secured a significant lead in the presidential election rerun, causing concern in European capitals, Washington, Kyiv, and Moscow. Simion, skeptical of EU support and against military aid to Ukraine, is an admirer of Donald Trump. His victory could impact Romania's role as a crucial transit route for weapon systems and ammunition to Ukraine. Simion has expressed belief in a strong NATO but emphasizes that the war is not going anywhere, hoping that the Trump administration's peace talks would result in a ceasefire and peace negotiations.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article reports that Pakistan's army chief, General Syed Asim Munir, is taking a more assertive stance on Kashmir, heightening tensions with India following a deadly terrorist attack. Munir's hard-line views, shaped by his intelligence background and belief in the religious nature of the conflict, are influencing Pakistan's tone. He has invoked the ‚Äútwo-nation theory‚Äù and described Kashmir as Pakistan‚Äôs ‚Äújugular vein,‚Äù drawing strong condemnation from India. The article suggests that whether the crisis escalates depends on international diplomacy, as both countries possess nuclear weapons, and domestic politics.</p>

          <p>Three Bulgarians convicted of spying for Russia were found to have attended a Brexit debate in the Palace of Westminster in May 2016. The BBC News investigation revealed that Orlin Roussev, Biser Dzhambazov, and Katrin Ivanova were present at the event with representatives of European political parties. The spies, directed by Jan Marsalek, conducted surveillance operations across Europe targeting enemies of Vladimir Putin's regime. The use of the room was sponsored by a former MP, now Baroness Brown of Silvertown, who has no memory of the event and denies knowing the individuals.</p>

          <p>Japan's official development assistance (ODA) ranking fell to fourth among OECD members in 2024, with Britain reclaiming third place. The United States remained the top donor, followed by Germany. Japan's decline was attributed to the yen's depreciation and a contrast with sharp increases in previous years when development projects resumed after COVID-19 suspensions. Despite the decline, Japan views ODA as a crucial diplomatic tool amid China's growing influence.</p>
