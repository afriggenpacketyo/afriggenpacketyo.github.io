          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s revamped vaccine advisory panel will review long-approved vaccines in the U.S., starting with the childhood vaccination schedule. Kennedy replaced all members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) with vaccine critics, including Dr. Robert Malone. ACIP will create new work groups to review the childhood vaccine schedule and shots not reviewed in over seven years. The American Academy of Pediatrics views the new ACIP as illegitimate and will continue providing vaccine schedules independently of the CDC. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Housing Finance Agency has directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to assess cryptocurrency as an asset for single-family mortgage loans. This move signals a potential shift in the U.S. housing finance system, allowing borrowers to use digital assets without liquidating them into U.S. dollars before closing. FHFA Director William J. Pulte stated this aligns with President Trump's vision to establish the U.S. as the crypto capital of the world, marking a significant integration of crypto into traditional finance. Historically, crypto has been excluded from underwriting due to volatility and regulatory uncertainty, but this directive aims to change that. The transition to incorporating crypto in mortgage loan risk assessments may bring new opportunities and challenges to the housing market. </p>

The UK government's Online Safety Act requires technology firms to protect young people from harmful content, and several England women's football team members plan to abstain from social media during their upcoming European Championship defense. </p>

Micron forecasts revenue in the current period to be about $10.7 billion, up 38% from the previous year, surpassing the average analyst estimate of $9.9 billion. The surge in data center revenue, which more than doubled in the third quarter, is attributed to high demand in the high bandwidth memory market driven by artificial intelligence.

Cammack says hospital staff hesitated to expel the pregnancy due to fear of prosecution, despite the embryo having no heartbeat and a doctor telling her she could die. She claims the left's messaging around abortion bans made doctors paranoid. Critics point to the fall of Roe v. Wade, which has led to abortion bans and restrictions that cause delayed or denied care because providers fear severe penalties. </p>

Mamdaniâ€™s victory demonstrates the power of youth, charisma, and the support of a mass-membership political organization. His success may also indicate a shift in the Democratic Party's views on Israel, as attacks focusing on his stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict did not resonate as expected. While some suggest his win proves Democrats don't need to moderate, others emphasize the importance of charismatic communication and populist messaging about affordability. </p>
