          <p>New York Yankees outfielder Jazz Chisholm Jr. faced significant criticism for a baserunning error during a game against his former team, the Miami Marlins. In the second inning, Chisholm was caught too far off first base on a pop-up and was easily doubled off to end the inning, a move that drew ire from broadcasters and fans. Despite the backlash and the Yankees' eventual 2-0 loss, Chisholm defended his action, stating he was attempting to be aggressive and force a mistake.</p>

          <p>A Palestinian-American man, Khamis Ayyad, has died from smoke inhalation in the West Bank village of Silwad after Israeli settlers allegedly set fire to homes and vehicles. The U.S. State Department confirmed the death, offered condolences, and condemned the "criminal violence by any party." This incident follows the recent killing of another Palestinian-American in the West Bank, highlighting a rise in settler attacks amid the broader regional conflict. Israeli authorities are investigating the incident, but no suspects have been detained.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has begun its August recess without reaching an agreement to advance dozens of Donald Trump's presidential nominees, following a contentious standoff between Republicans and Democrats. Negotiations broke down after Trump publicly told Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer to "GO TO HELL!" on social media. Democrats have been systematically blocking quick confirmations, forcing lengthy roll-call votes on each nominee, prompting Republicans to consider changing Senate rules upon their return in September to expedite the process.</p>

He also defended the use of tariffs for geopolitical reasons, citing actions against Canada and Brazil as responses to non-trade issues, blurring the lines between economic and foreign policy.

          <p>Germany is grappling with a continued decline in its birth rate, which fell to an average of 1.35 children per woman in 2024, raising concerns about future economic prosperity and the stability of its social systems.

          <p>Divorce lawyers recommend two key strategies for individuals to protect their finances if their marriage is facing difficulties and a prenuptial agreement is not in place. The first is to gather comprehensive information about all joint financial accounts, assets, and liabilities while still married, as access is easier. The second is to consider a postnuptial agreement, which defines how assets, particularly those from a business started during the marriage, would be divided in a divorce. These proactive steps can provide security and clarity.</p>

          <p>The FIRE movement, which stands for Financial Independence, Retire Early, is inspiring a growing number of people to pursue aggressive saving and investing strategies to leave the workforce decades ahead of traditional retirement age. Adherents focus on high savings rates, frugal living, and a philosophy of valuing time and freedom over material consumption. Proponents advocate for defining what is "enough" to live a happy life, allowing them to buy their freedom with their frugality. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This commentary argues that focusing on high-profile cases of sexual abuse like those of Jeffrey Epstein, Sean Combs, and Harvey Weinstein as individual aberrations misses the larger, systemic issue of violence against women. The author, Rebecca Solnit, posits that this violence is a constant, global pandemic fueled by misogyny and intended to maintain female subordination. The article criticizes society for normalizing this violence and for failing to address its root causes, instead treating a ubiquitous problem as a series of isolated, exceptional crimes.</p>

          <p>NBA star Stephen Curry recently stated he does not know his exact net worth, focusing instead on building a portfolio of investments he is proud of. Financial professionals have praised this mindset, arguing that obsessing over a net worth figure can be less productive than focusing on tangible goals and healthy financial habits.
