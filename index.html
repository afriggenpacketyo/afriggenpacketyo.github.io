          <p>Former President Trump's social media post claiming a deal with Coca-Cola to replace high-fructose corn syrup with cane sugar caused a drop in producer ADM's stock. Coca-Cola's response was noncommittal, appreciating Trump's enthusiasm but not confirming the change. The Corn Refiners Association warned of potential job losses from such a switch, highlighting the economic implications for American farmers and manufacturers. The event underscores the influence of political statements on market behavior and corporate policy.</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other board members have settled a multi-billion dollar shareholder lawsuit related to the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal. The class-action suit, which sought $8 billion, alleged that the company failed to disclose the risks of user data misuse, violating a 2012 FTC consent order. The settlement was reached just as the trial entered its second day, avoiding further court proceedings. Meta itself was not a direct defendant in the suit, which targeted the directors personally.</p>

          <p>United Airlines surpassed second-quarter earnings estimates and provided a new, more confident forecast for 2025, citing a less uncertain global environment. CEO Scott Kirby noted that travel demand is strengthening after a weak start to the year, although domestic unit revenue saw a decline. The airline's updated earnings guidance of $9 to $11 per share reflects this renewed optimism. Operational constraints at its Newark hub, however, continue to impact profit margins.</p>

The gap persists into the second generation at 7.7%, higher than the international average.

          <p>Germany's national rail operator, Deutsche Bahn (DB), is experiencing a severe crisis, with punctuality plummeting and compensation payouts soaring. Only 62% of trains are now considered on schedule, a stark contrast to past reliability, due to decades of underinvestment in the country's aging track network. A massive refurbishment program has been launched, but it is already facing significant cost overruns and delays, extending its timeline to 2036. The German government's Federal Audit Office has warned that money alone will not solve DB's "permanent crisis."</p>

          <p>The city of Minot, North Dakota, is struggling to control a burgeoning population of Richardson's ground squirrels, whose extensive tunneling damages property and infrastructure. The rodents, which may now outnumber the city's nearly 50,000 residents, thrive in the urban environment where their natural predators are scarce. Officials acknowledge that eradication is impossible and are focusing on population control through trapping and other means. The issue highlights the challenges of managing wildlife in urbanized areas, with some residents viewing the animals as pests while others see them as cute.</p>

The reform package also includes proposals for automatic voter registration and allowing bank cards as a valid form of voter ID. This represents the most significant expansion of the electorate since the voting age was reduced to 18 in 1969.</p>
