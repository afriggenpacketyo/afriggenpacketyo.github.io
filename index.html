          <p>Police in Boulder, Colorado responded to an attack at the Pearl Street Mall, resulting in multiple injuries and the apprehension of a suspect. The FBI Director Kash Patel initially described the incident as a targeted terror attack, however Boulder police refrained from using that label at the time of the initial report. An incendiary device was reportedly thrown at participants in the Run for Their Lives walk, an event raising awareness for Israeli hostages in Gaza, causing burns to several individuals. Colorado Governor Jared Polis condemned the attack as a heinous act of terror, emphasizing that hate-filled acts are unacceptable. The investigation is ongoing to determine the motive and circumstances surrounding the incident. Optimism that the injuries were not more serious and a suspect was caught is tempered by the serious nature of the attack.</p>

          <p>UCLA's softball team was defeated by Tennessee in a 5-4 extra-innings heartbreaker, ending their Women's College World Series run.

The Bruins struggled to capitalize with the bases loaded in the ninth, while the Volunteers delivered the decisive hit. Despite solo home runs from Alexis Ramirez and Sofia Mujica, UCLA's season concluded with a 55-13 record.

DiMaggio develops fake online personas to gain trust and extract information from hackers, including those in leadership positions. He highlights the human element behind these crimes, revealing the motivations and backstories of cybercriminals. DiMaggio's work led to insights into the LockBit gang, responsible for numerous high-profile attacks, and he advocates for more aggressive measures to combat ransomware. The successful takedown of LockBit's servers is tempered by the continued threat of ransomware and the need for more resources to combat it.</p>

          <p>Poland's presidential election is too close to call, with exit polls suggesting a tight race between conservative historian Karol Nawrocki and Warsaw's liberal mayor, Rafal Trzaskowski. Initial exit polls were overturned by later results, leading to uncertainty and conflicting claims of victory. The final outcome will have significant implications for Poland's relationship with the European Union and its domestic policies. The close contest reflects the deep divisions within Polish society and the challenges facing the country's political landscape.</p>

          <p>A law professor at USC, Angela Zhang, discusses how US tech curbs are pushing China to innovate, especially in artificial intelligence. Tariffs make it harder for Chinese tech products to compete in the US market, but also force Chinese companies to cut costs and scale up. Many Chinese tech firms started open-sourcing their AI models, which is a more cost-effective and collaborative way to keep developing advanced technologies when resources are tight. Chinese companies are looking more aggressively to other markets and deepening trade with Europe, including offering technology transfers in exchange for market access. Despite challenges, Chinese firms are going to keep pushing hard to make their products even more competitive.</p>
