            <p>Abouzar Rahmati, a naturalized U.S. citizen and former FAA contractor, pleaded guilty to conspiring with Iranian government officials to act as an agent of Iran in the U.S. Rahmati, who previously served in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), obtained sensitive, non-public information about the U.S. aviation sector and open-source materials about the solar energy industry. He provided this information to Iranian intelligence operatives, including sensitive FAA documents relating to the National Aerospace System, during trips to Iran and through his brother.

            <p>The Trump administration is proposing a rule to narrow the definition of 'harm' under the Endangered Species Act, potentially limiting protections for vulnerable plants and animals. The proposed redefinition would restrict 'harm' to direct actions that kill or injure wildlife, excluding habitat destruction. Conservationists argue this change would undermine the act's reach and flout a Supreme Court ruling encompassing habitat modification.

He believes consumers are already resistant to high prices, and companies are not prepared for the impact of tariffs. Cramer points to LVMH's sales decline as evidence that even luxury retailers will struggle to maintain prices. He suggests that companies may need to consider mergers to create cost-cutting opportunities and avoid gross margin decline. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has effectively shut down the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, a small agency responsible for coordinating federal homelessness policy, by placing all staff on administrative leave. This move is part of a broader effort to reduce the federal bureaucracy, despite the agency's authorization continuing until 2028. The agency played a key role in coordinating efforts to reduce homelessness among veterans and assisting cities in managing record-high homelessness. Critics argue the shutdown will hinder effective policy and allow for a shift away from 'housing first' approaches.</p>

            <p>This article examines the troubling trend of individuals who received pardons or commutations from President Trump finding themselves in legal trouble again. Examples include Jonathan Braun, a convicted marijuana smuggler rearrested for assault, and several January 6th rioters who have committed further offenses. The author argues that Trump's clemency decisions, often based on personal connections or political loyalty, lacked the careful administration typically associated with presidential pardons. The article contrasts this with the administration's aggressive pursuit of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, highlighting a perceived double standard in the application of justice.</p>

            <p>A federal judge has found probable cause to hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt for allegedly defying an order to halt the deportation of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador. Judge James Boasberg stated that the administration's actions demonstrated a 'willful disregard' for his order under the Alien Enemies Act. The ruling marks a significant rebuke amid escalating tensions between the Trump administration and the federal judiciary over immigration policies. The judge is seeking to determine who ordered the planes to continue to El Salvador despite the court order.</p>
