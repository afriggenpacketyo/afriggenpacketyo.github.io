          <p>Quemoy, a Taipei-controlled island just miles from mainland China, serves as a unique case study in cross-strait relations. Once a heavily militarized front line in the conflict, the island has transformed into a quiet community caught between two political systems. On-the-ground interviews reveal the distinct limitations both Beijing and Taipei face in exerting their influence over the island's 130,000 residents. The island's status highlights a complex dynamic where neither side holds complete sway, showcasing a practical boundary to their respective political powers.</p>

          <p>In response to the perceived threat from Russia, five eastern NATO countriesâ€”Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Polandâ€”have announced their withdrawal from the 1997 Ottawa Convention, which bans anti-personnel mines. This move paves the way for the potential production and deployment of land mines along their borders with Russia and Belarus to create a significant deterrent. The plan has sparked intense debate, pitting national security concerns against the long-term dangers that indiscriminate land mines pose to civilians for decades after conflicts end.</p>

Despite his strong performance on the mound, Ohtani went hitless in four at-bats, and the Dodgers' five-game winning streak was snapped in a 9-5 loss.

          <p>France has enacted a comprehensive ban on smoking in many public outdoor areas, including beaches, parks, and near schools and swimming pools. The new rules are designed to protect children from the dangers of passive smoking and are part of a broader national strategy aiming for a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032. While e-cigarettes are not included in the ban, violators face fines up to â‚¬700. The policy reflects growing public support for such measures, despite France having one of Europe's higher smoking rates.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation details the harrowing experience of Jay Hulme, a poet and church volunteer who was stalked by a Church of England lay preacher, Venessa Pinto, after he declined her romantic advances. The report reveals a systemic failure within the Leicester diocese, where the bishop initially disbelieved Hulme and accused him of witchcraft. After a prolonged campaign of online harassment and threats, police intervention eventually led to Pinto's conviction for stalking, prompting apologies from both the police and the bishop for their initial mishandling of the case.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has narrowly voted to advance a massive Republican spending and tax-cut package, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill," after a tense, hours-long session. The procedural hurdle was cleared after leadership secured the votes of a few conservative holdouts, including Senator Ron Johnson, who changed his vote to yes. The senators were reportedly promised future votes on amendments aimed at further deficit reduction and changes to Medicaid, though their support for the bill's final passage remains uncertain.

          <p>A growing number of local-level civil servants in China are reportedly avoiding dining out due to unpredictable and increasingly stringent local austerity measures. This lifestyle change is prompted by what is known in Mandarin as "ceng ceng jia ma," or the practice of adding extra layers of control, where local rules become even stricter than those mandated by the central government.

          <p>After a six-year wait, the family of Blaze Bernstein saw his killer, former classmate Samuel Woodward, convicted of first-degree murder with a hate crime enhancement. Bernstein, a 19-year-old gay and Jewish college student, was stabbed to death in 2018. Prosecutors successfully argued that the murder was motivated by hate, linking Woodward to the violent neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen Division. The verdict brings a painful chapter to a close for the family, who have since founded a kindness movement in their son's name.</p>

Under the voluntary plan, food businesses are encouraged to make healthy food more appealing and accessible through promotions, loyalty point incentives, or by reformulating products. Retailers will report on their sales of healthy food to increase accountability, as part of a broader government strategy to improve public health and relieve pressure on the NHS, which is expected to be detailed next week.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the science behind the "urban heat island" effect, a phenomenon where cities and built-up areas become significantly hotter than surrounding rural landscapes. The primary cause is the prevalence of hard, dark surfaces like asphalt roads and buildings, which absorb and retain the sun's energy instead of reflecting it. This stored heat is slowly released, raising ambient temperatures, especially overnight. As climate change makes heatwaves more frequent and intense, this effect makes growing urban populations particularly vulnerable to extreme heat.</p>
