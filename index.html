        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has backtracked on its initial decision to revoke Harvard University's certification to enroll international students, giving the school 30 days to challenge the decision. This notice comes after Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem cited Harvard's refusal to provide pertinent information and alleged promotion of an unsafe campus environment. A U.S. District Judge plans to issue a preliminary injunction to protect Harvard's international students during this period, despite the administration's change of course. Harvard argues that the SEVP revocation is retaliation for the school's exercise of its First Amendment rights, claiming the administration is trying to coerce the university into surrendering its academic independence.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering seeking emergency relief from the Supreme Court to pause a federal court ruling that blocked many of President Trump's tariffs, arguing that the ruling poses national security and economic harms. This action follows criticism from top aides who accused the trade court judges of judicial tyranny and globalist bias. The ruling invalidated dozens of country-specific tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, determining that the law does not grant presidents unbounded authority. The administration is also requesting the trade court judges to pause enforcement of their ruling while the case is appealed.</p>

Rockefeller Wing after a four-year, $70 million renovation, showcasing Indigenous art from Africa, the Pacific islands, and the Americas. The wing, originally opened in 1982, celebrates the legacy of Nelson and Michael Rockefeller, whose passion for Indigenous art led to its elevation in the art world. Michael Rockefeller's twin sister, Mary Rockefeller Morgan, played a key role in preserving and displaying the family's collection, emphasizing the art's connection to humanity's basic needs and desires.

Trump is facing increasing pressure from foreign policy experts and members of Congress to adopt a tougher stance against Russia, with some suggesting he is being manipulated by Putin.

          <p>A massive landslide triggered by a partial glacier collapse has engulfed a village in southern Switzerland, leaving one man missing and causing extensive damage. The village of Blatten was largely destroyed, with State Councilor Stephane Ganzer estimating that 90% of it was destroyed. Authorities have suspended the search for the missing man due to unsafe conditions and are monitoring the blocked River Lonza for potential flooding. Climate change is believed to have contributed to the glacier collapse, raising concerns about future incidents.</p>

The author posits that lab-grown meat offers the best hope for eliminating torture from the food system, given the moral issues with industrial agriculture. Conservatives' concerns are seen as irrational, particularly the fear that lab-grown meat could lead to bans on factory-farmed animal products. The author argues that such a scenario is unlikely unless lab-grown meat comprehensively outcompetes farmed meat in the marketplace, emphasizing the potential benefits of this technology for the environment and animal welfare.</p>

The wrangling in New Jersey is being watched for signs of how Democrats will answer Trump's agenda and, for Republicans, as a fresh test of the president's popularity.

          <p>A U.S. trade court has ruled President Trump's sweeping tariffs illegal, halting the tariffs he assessed on almost every other country on April 2. This ruling raises questions about the future of Trump's trade agenda, which hinges on tariffs to bring back U.S. manufacturing jobs and raise federal revenue. While the administration plans to appeal, the court decision provides relief to American businesses and consumers, who typically bear the cost of tariffs. However, the uncertainty remains as Trump could pursue alternate routes to impose additional tariffs.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer noted that Jefferies downgraded GE Vernova from a buy to a hold rating, prompting a drop in the stock's price after a significant rally. Cramer suggested that this dip may present a buying opportunity for new investors looking to start a position in GE Vernova. He emphasized that the stock has been consistently rising since the CNBC Investing Club initiated it about two weeks ago. Cramer's Charitable Trust is long GE Vernova, and he waits 45 minutes after sending a trade alert before making any trades. (not investment advice)</p>
