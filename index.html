          <p>Four people were killed and eight injured in a mass shooting and fire at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints chapel in Grand Blanc, Michigan. The suspect, 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford, drove his vehicle into the church and fired an assault rifle at approximately 100 attendees before dying himself. The FBI is investigating the incident as an act of targeted violence, with the White House press secretary stating the individual hated people of the Mormon faith. Authorities praised first responders and church attendees for their immediate actions during the tragic event.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto, a powerful Category 3 storm, is expected to generate life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along much of the U.S. East Coast and Bermuda this week. The storm rapidly intensified to Category 5 over the weekend before weakening, with its center forecast to pass west and north of Bermuda. Forecasters warn of significant swells affecting the northern Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and Bermuda. This article emphasizes the ongoing danger despite the hurricane's weakening trend.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Imelda is projected to strengthen into a hurricane, though its path is expected to move away from the southeastern U.S. and approach Bermuda by Wednesday. The storm is anticipated to bring significant rainfall, 4 to 8 inches, to the northwest Bahamas and 2 to 4 inches to eastern Cuba, with flash flooding and mudslides possible. This article notes that swells generated by both Imelda and Hurricane Humberto will cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the U.S. East Coast.

          <p>US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have announced a new peace plan for Gaza, calling on Hamas to accept its terms. The proposal includes an immediate end to military operations, the release of 20 living Israeli hostages and remains of over two dozen deceased, in exchange for hundreds of detained Gazans. The plan stipulates no governance role for Hamas and outlines an economic development plan to rebuild Gaza, while leaving the door open for an eventual Palestinian state. International leaders have largely welcomed the initiative as a significant step towards peace.</p>

          <p>Thousands of British military personnel have begun legal proceedings against the US industrial giant 3M, alleging that faulty combat earplugs caused life-changing injuries like tinnitus and deafness. The earplugs, supplied to the Ministry of Defence, were designed to offer reversible protection but are claimed to have had a design flaw. This article highlights that 3M previously settled similar claims with 240,000 US servicemen and women for $6 billion, though without admitting liability. The veterans seek justice and compensation for the long-term impact on their health and daily lives.</p>

This article highlights the political blame game and the White House's memo outlining plans to permanently shutter "nonessential" programs during a closure.
