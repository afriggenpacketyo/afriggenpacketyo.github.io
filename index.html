          <p>Sources indicate that former U.S. President Donald Trump is interested in visiting China in the autumn, although a potential September trip is no longer being considered. Officials in both Washington and Beijing are reportedly working to arrange a visit for October or November, possibly in conjunction with the APEC summit in South Korea. This potential high-level engagement follows what was described as a positive meeting between the top diplomats of both nations. The discussions suggest a continued effort to maintain dialogue and manage the complex relationship between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>A Russian woman, Irina Krynina, has founded a project in Ukraine called "Our Way Out" to help relatives of Russian prisoners of war connect with their captured family members. After her own partner was captured fighting for Russia, Krynina moved to Kyiv and began visiting prison camps, recording interviews, and facilitating communication. Her initiative aims to provide proof of life to families in Russia, where captured soldiers are often officially listed as missing or deceased. Despite facing mixed reactions, Krynina's work also serves to inform Russians about the realities of the war.</p>

          <h2>China Announces Global AI Action Plan Amidst Intensifying Tech Competition with US</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 09:54:40 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has launched a global action plan for artificial intelligence, emphasizing international cooperation just days after the U.S. announced its own AI strategy. Speaking at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, Premier Li Qiang proposed a global AI cooperation organization and highlighted the country's "AI plus" plan to integrate the technology across industries. This move is seen as intensifying the tech race, with analysts suggesting the formation of two distinct camps: a multilateral approach led by China and a U.S.-led bloc with its allies. China aims to extend its technological assistance, particularly to nations in the Global South.</p>

          <p>A significant security operation is underway in Scotland for former U.S. President Donald Trump's four-day private visit to his Turnberry golf resort. The visit includes planned meetings with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Scottish First Minister John Swinney, prompting road closures and a heavy police and military presence. While some protests have occurred in Edinburgh and Aberdeen, the atmosphere around the resort remains controlled. The visit has also drawn attention to the Scottish government's recent funding for a golf tournament at another of Trump's courses in the country.</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber's surprise new album, "Swag," is being seen by critics as a potential savior for a summer music season lacking a definitive upbeat anthem. The album departs from his previous pop sound, embracing a more subtle, R&B-influenced style with aqueous, muffled production that reflects a more reserved and melancholic cultural mood. The lead single, "Daisies," has already reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100, and its success suggests listeners are responding to its gentle and stable tone. This article suggests the album's downtempo yet detailed sound is resonating in a year marked by widespread anxiety.</p>

          <p>The U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) recently avoided a $400 million funding cut, providing a moment of relief for global health advocates. However, the program's future remains precarious as its congressional authorization has expired and the Trump administration has proposed major cuts for the upcoming fiscal year. Since its creation in 2003, PEPFAR has been credited with saving 26 million lives, but recent disruptions have already impacted services in recipient countries. Experts worry that even with funding, a shift in focus away from prevention could diminish the program's long-term effectiveness.</p>

          <p>Brazil is scaling up a novel public health initiative by releasing millions of mosquitoes modified with Wolbachia bacteria to combat the spread of dengue fever. This bacteria prevents the dengue virus from replicating inside the Aedes aegypti mosquito, effectively stopping its transmission to humans. A pilot program in the city of Niterói demonstrated remarkable success, reducing dengue cases by approximately 90% and significantly lowering instances of Zika and chikungunya. The Brazilian government is now investing heavily in this strategy, opening a new factory capable of producing billions of these "good mosquitoes" annually.</p>

          <p>A 74-year-old man, Christopher Kennedy, has received a new lease on life after a successful double-lung transplant for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a terminal disease discovered incidentally during a pre-surgery X-ray. Initially given less than a year to live, Kennedy was resistant to the idea of a transplant but eventually agreed and was placed on the national waiting list. After his condition severely deteriorated, he received the transplant at Cleveland Clinic and has since made a strong recovery, with his lung capacity now at 98%.

He maintained his identity as a "common man" from Oklahoma, never losing touch with his roots even as he gained global fame as an actor, columnist, and author.

These refusers, like 19-year-old Itamar Greenberg who recently served six months in a military prison, face significant consequences, including incarceration and being labeled as traitors by friends and society. The movement highlights a deep ideological divide within Israel, with activists risking their social standing and family relationships to protest what they describe as immoral military actions.

          <p>The Trump administration's broad use of tariffs is facing a significant legal test in a federal appeals court, which will hear arguments challenging the president's authority to impose them under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). A lower court previously ruled that Trump exceeded his authority, but that decision was paused pending appeal. The outcome of this case could invalidate many of Trump's major trade actions, including tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada, potentially unraveling the core of his economic and foreign policy agenda.

          <p>This opinion article reflects on the life of Ozzy Osbourne, who passed away at age 76, celebrating his journey from a troubled youth to a global music icon and unlikely television star. It highlights his role as a founding member of Black Sabbath, a band that pioneered heavy metal, and his subsequent, even more successful solo career. The piece acknowledges his notorious struggles with addiction and reckless behavior but also points to his reinvention as a beloved, bumbling father on the reality show "The Osbournes." The author concludes that Osbourne succeeded in his goal of not dying an ordinary man.</p>

          <p>Two years after a military coup ousted Niger's democratically elected president, conditions in the country have deteriorated, according to analysts. The junta, which cited insecurity and economic hardship as justification for its takeover, has overseen a crackdown on civil society, media, and political opposition, leading to job losses and human rights abuses. The nation has also withdrawn from the regional ECOWAS bloc, deepening its isolation. With the coup leader recently sworn in for a five-year term, prospects for a return to civilian democratic rule appear increasingly remote.</p>

          <p>A five-day strike by resident doctors in England has led to the cancellation of numerous surgeries and appointments, causing distress for patients. Several individuals, including a man with kidney cancer and the father of a three-year-old needing lung surgery, have shared their stories of frustration and fear that the delays could worsen their conditions. The walkout stems from a pay dispute between the doctors' union and the government. While the British Medical Association stated that striking is a last resort, affected patients are grappling with the immediate and potentially severe consequences of the industrial action.</p>

          <p>An attack on a court building in Zahedan, the capital of Iran's restive Sistan and Baluchestan province, has left at least six people dead, including a child, and 20 wounded.

A semi-official news agency has blamed the militant group Jaish al-Adl for the violence. The southeastern province, which borders Pakistan and Afghanistan, has a history of deadly clashes involving militant groups, drug smugglers, and Iranian security forces.</p>

          <p>During a private visit to his Scottish golf resort, Donald Trump urged European leaders to "get your act together" on immigration, warning they would not "have Europe any more" otherwise. The comments come just before a critical meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen aimed at averting a trade war. Intensive negotiations are ongoing to find a compromise on tariffs for key exports like cars and pharmaceuticals. Trump, who also criticized Europe's use of wind turbines, rated the chances of reaching a trade deal with the EU as "a good 50-50."</p>

          <p>In a significant government reshuffle, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has appointed Yulia Svyrydenko as the country's new prime minister, a rare instance of a woman leading a former Soviet state. The 39-year-old Svyrydenko, who previously served as deputy prime minister, faces the immense tasks of managing a wartime economy and securing international support. Her appointment has been met with some skepticism and sexist criticism, with some observers questioning her independence from Zelensky. However, her supporters point to her extensive experience in negotiating international trade and investment deals as a key asset for Ukraine's future.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on the cultural impact of Sean Combs, arguing that for a generation growing up in the 1990s, he was a formidable ambassador of "Black cool." The author recalls how Combs, then known as Puff Daddy, represented a new model of ambitious, unapologetic success that made Black culture feel at home in previously exclusive spaces. The recent revelations of Combs's alleged cruelty and abuse are framed as a profound betrayal of that aspirational image. The essay posits that seeing this childhood icon fall has curdled the dreams he once inspired into something rancid.</p>

          <p>As climate change leads to hotter and more frequent heat waves, more Americans are spending their summers indoors to escape the heat, a phenomenon that may be contributing to mental health challenges. This article explores the concept of summer-pattern seasonal affective disorder (SAD), which, unlike its winter counterpart, is associated with insomnia, restlessness, and reduced appetite. Experts suggest that avoiding the sun and the resulting social isolation could be creating a pattern of effects similar to winter SAD. The trend highlights a growing public health concern as extreme heat forces a choice between enduring dangerous temperatures or facing the psychological effects of confinement.</p>

          <p>As the MLB trade deadline approaches, veteran closer Kenley Jansen, currently with the Anaheim Angels, could be a candidate for a trade back to his former team, the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Dodgers are in need of right-handed relief pitching, and Jansen is having a strong season, converting 17 of 18 save opportunities. While Jansen expressed a desire to help the Angels win, the team's poor performance makes trading pending free agents for prospects a logical move. Jansen stated he would be willing to pitch in any role for a contending team to pursue another World Series ring.</p>

To restore federal research funding, Columbia agreed to pay a $200 million fine and allow a Trump-approved monitor to review admissions and academic departments, concessions the author likens to an extortion scheme. The piece contends that this capitulation, driven by political pressure over pro-Palestinian campus protests, sacrifices academic independence and sets a dangerous precedent.
