          <p>Siarhei Tsikhanouski, a Belarusian opposition leader jailed in 2020 after challenging Alexander Lukashenko, has been released from prison. Rights group Viasna reported that Tsikhanouski was pardoned. Tsikhanouski's wife, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who ran against Lukashenko in her husband's place, released a video thanking the U.S. for its efforts in securing his release. His release coincided with a visit by U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine, General Keith Kellogg, who was in Minsk for talks with Lukashenko to facilitate an end to the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Despite publicly condemning Israel's attacks on Iran, Jordan and Saudi Arabia have taken actions that indirectly support Israel. Jordan shot down Iranian missiles and drones to protect its airspace, while Saudi Arabia likely allowed Israel to use its airspace for defense. These actions are complicated by domestic tensions due to historical antipathy towards Israel among their populations. Jordan emphasized its actions were for self-defense, while Saudi Arabia's cooperation is influenced by its security dependence on the U.S. and its delicate relationship with Iran.</p>

          <p>Experts and dermatologists suggest that US sunscreens are less effective than those available overseas, particularly in UVA protection. Regulatory differences, where sunscreen is classified as an over-the-counter drug, limit the approval of new UV-filtering ingredients in the US. Other countries, like France and South Korea, have approved a wider range of ingredients, allowing for more advanced sunscreens. Despite this, dermatologists stress the importance of wearing sunscreen, suggesting broad-spectrum options with an SPF of 30 or higher.</p>

          <p>A senior Iranian official stated that proposals by European powers at talks in Geneva regarding Iran's nuclear program were "unrealistic." The official suggested that adhering to these proposals would hinder reaching an agreement. Despite this, both sides expressed readiness to continue discussions, although no new date was set. French President Emmanuel Macron spoke with his Iranian counterpart, emphasizing the need for Iran to provide assurances of peaceful intentions. The Iranian official dismissed negotiating defensive capabilities and reiterated that zero uranium enrichment was not an option.</p>

          <p>A federal appellate court has ruled that a Louisiana law requiring the Ten Commandments to be posted in public school classrooms is unconstitutional. The ruling favors civil liberties groups who argued the mandate violates the separation of church and state and isolates non-Christian students. Louisiana's Attorney General plans to appeal the ruling, potentially taking it to the U.S. Supreme Court. Similar laws have been challenged in Arkansas and await signature in Texas, setting up a potential legal battle over religion in schools.</p>

Despite the ongoing conflict, oil prices have remained relatively stable, but the risk of supply disruption and price spikes is increasing. Destabilization in Iran could lead to higher oil prices sustained over extended periods. Historically, regime changes in major oil-producing countries have resulted in significant oil price spikes, potentially triggering economic recessions. (not investment advice)</p>
