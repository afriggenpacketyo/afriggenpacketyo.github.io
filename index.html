          <p>The annual World Dog Surfing Championships recently took place in Pacifica, California, drawing crowds to watch canine competitors ride the waves. Dogs of various breeds and sizes, equipped with life vests, competed in heats based on their size, with some even surfing in tandem. Owners and participants described the event as a joyful experience that strengthens the bond between humans and their pets, celebrating unique talents and defying expectations for both the animals and their handlers.</p>

          <p>Following the British and Irish Lions' 2-1 series victory over the Wallabies, this article provides a detailed performance rating for each player who participated in more than one game. While the team secured a series win, the analysis suggests it was a good team with great players but not a truly great team, as the Wallabies won four of the six halves of rugby played. The ratings cover individual contributions, from standout performers like Tadhg Beirne to those who struggled to find form during the tour.</p>

          <p>The Krasheninnikov Volcano in Russia's far eastern Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted for the first time since the 15th century, sending an ash plume miles into the sky. Experts suggest the eruption may be linked to a massive 8.8 magnitude earthquake that struck the region last week. Following the eruption, another strong 7.0 magnitude earthquake hit the nearby Kuril Islands, prompting tsunami warnings for parts of the peninsula, though no immediate threat to populated areas was reported from the volcano itself.</p>

          <p>Chile is experiencing a dramatic decline in its birth rate, which has fallen to just over one child per woman, a rate lower than most of Europe and Japan. This demographic shift, driven by the high cost of living and changing societal norms for women, may foreshadow future trends in the United States, where fertility rates also recently hit a record low. Experts note that this transformation presents significant challenges for social systems like pensions and labor markets, which are built on the assumption of generational replacement.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reversing a previous policy to more aggressively collect on the tens of billions of dollars owed in Social Security overpayments. This change increases the garnishment rate on beneficiaries' monthly checks from 10% to 50%, a move that could create significant financial hardship for over a million Americans. The article outlines legal options available to affected individuals, such as requesting waivers or payment plan adjustments to mitigate the impact of these clawbacks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russian authorities have attributed a large fire at an oil depot near the Black Sea resort of Sochi to a Ukrainian drone attack. Debris from a drone reportedly struck a fuel tank, igniting a blaze that required over 100 firefighters to control and led to the suspension of flights at the nearby airport. This incident was part of a broader wave of Ukrainian drone attacks over the weekend, which also targeted installations in other southern Russian cities, while Russia simultaneously launched its own missile and drone strikes against Ukraine.</p>

          <p>A new climate study indicates that significant reductions in air pollution in East Asia over the past decade may have had an unintended side effect: accelerating global warming. Researchers found that the removal of aerosols, such as sulphur dioxide, reduced a cooling effect that these particles provided by reflecting sunlight. The study estimates that the 75% drop in sulphur dioxide in the region since 2013 may have contributed up to 0.05 degrees Celsius to the global surface warming rate, suggesting polluted air was masking some effects of climate change.</p>

          <p>Political analysts are discussing the potential for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to attend China's upcoming World War II victory parade and what it could mean for regional geopolitics. One expert suggests that Modi's attendance could provide an opportunity for a tripartite meeting with China and Russia, potentially helping to resolve ongoing border disputes between Beijing and New Delhi. However, other observers believe that despite a recent thaw in relations, Modi is unlikely to participate in the event in Beijing.</p>
