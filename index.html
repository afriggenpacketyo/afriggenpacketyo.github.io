          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Jon Meacham discusses the dangerous state of American democracy. He argues that political violence historically erupts when there are fundamental disagreements over national identity and who is included in "We the people." Meacham warns that the nation is breaking its covenant of peaceful debate and contention, urging leaders to draw on historical examples of unity to navigate the current crisis. He emphasizes that if the country resorts to violence over disagreement, it risks becoming something other than the America its citizens aspire to.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian military forces have successfully targeted one of Russia's largest oil refineries, the Kirishi facility in the Leningrad region, causing a significant fire. This attack is part of a sustained campaign by Ukraine to disrupt Russia's oil infrastructure, which Kyiv states is crucial to Moscow's war effort. The strike comes as Russia faces domestic gasoline shortages, prompting a temporary ban on exports to stabilize its market. The incident highlights the strategic use of drones by both sides and occurs amidst broader international discussions, including calls from former President Trump for NATO to cease purchasing Russian oil.</p>

          <p>Historians Jill Lepore and Jeffrey Rosen explore the history of the U.S. Constitution, emphasizing its design as an evolving framework rather than a static text. The article notes that the founders anticipated frequent revisions, with the Bill of Rights itself emerging from over 200 state-proposed amendments. It delves into the document's historical compromises, particularly regarding slavery, and the "second founding" through post-Civil War amendments. Rosen expresses concern that the modern political system, with an inactive Congress and an overly powerful Supreme Court, is not functioning as the founders intended, undermining the principles of deliberation and checks-and-balances.</p>

          <p>Utah Governor Spencer Cox has stated that Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old suspect in the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, is not cooperating with authorities. While Robinson has not confessed, Cox noted that the suspect's family and acquaintances are providing information. The governor also confirmed that Robinson's roommate, who is cooperating with the investigation, is a boyfriend who is transitioning from male to female. Officials have not yet identified a motive, though Cox mentioned that information from those close to the suspect suggests he was influenced by "leftist ideology."</p>

          <p>The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) has reported that the 16-year-old who opened fire at a Colorado high school was an active user of a "violent gore" website known for extremist content. The report links the shooter, Desmond Holly, to a network that glorifies violence and white supremacist ideas, a space also frequented by other recent school shooters. According to the ADL, Holly showed admiration for past mass murderers on his social media accounts and posted images of weapons shortly before the attack. The findings highlight the role of nihilistic online platforms in the radicalization of young individuals.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has arrived in Israel for discussions with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as tensions rise following an Israeli strike in Qatar that targeted Hamas leaders. Rubio stated that President Trump was "not happy" about the strike on the key U.S. ally but emphasized the strength of the U.S.-Israel relationship. The visit coincides with ongoing Israeli military operations in Gaza City, where the destruction of residential buildings has forced thousands to flee. The situation is further complicated by criticism from hostage families who accuse Netanyahu of sabotaging ceasefire deals.</p>

          <p>This opinion article criticizes what the author describes as inaccurate "postmortem hagiographies" of Charlie Kirk following his assassination. The author argues that while political violence is always wrong, it is dishonest to recast Kirk's career as one of good-faith debate and civic virtue. The piece details Kirk's history of promoting hateful rhetoric against various minority groups, his opposition to the Civil Rights Act, and his endorsement of the "great replacement theory." The author contends that honoring Kirk's humanity does not require rewriting the history of his divisive and harmful political activism, which stood in opposition to democratic equality.</p>

          <p>This analysis argues that Israeli society has become largely detached from the suffering in Gaza, with the war becoming a normalized part of life for many. The article describes a "media bubble" where Palestinian suffering remains abstract, allowing daily life to continue amidst the conflict. It critiques the failure of the peace process, suggesting it misunderstood the deep-rooted historical narratives and existential needs of both Israelis and Palestinians. The author contends that this detachment and a turn toward mythical thinking, which frames the conflict as an eternal battle, obscure the political reality of occupation and prevent meaningful progress toward a resolution.</p>

          <p>Immigrant communities in Los Angeles are experiencing heightened fear following a Supreme Court decision that allows federal agents to conduct warrantless raids and potentially engage in racial profiling. The ruling overturned a temporary restraining order, and the Department of Homeland Security has vowed to increase its presence in the city. Many undocumented workers face a difficult choice between risking deportation by going to work and facing eviction for not being able to pay rent. In response, volunteer groups are mobilizing to monitor for raids, inform residents of their rights, and provide support to a community on edge.</p>

Captain Luke Donald has provided players with virtual reality headsets that simulate the sights, sounds, and abusive comments they might face from the American crowd. McIlroy explained that the goal is to desensitize the team as much as possible before the tournament, noting that players can have the VR simulation "go as close to the bone as you like." This unique approach underscores the team's detailed preparations for their first win on U.S. soil since 2012.</p>

          <p>With the 2025 WNBA playoffs set to begin, sports analysts are weighing in on major questions, from top contenders to potential upsets. A key discussion is whether the postseason is better off without the intense rivalry between Angel Reese and Caitlin Clark, whose teams did not qualify. Experts are also identifying high seeds at risk, with the Phoenix Mercury and Las Vegas Aces mentioned as teams facing tough matchups. While the expansion Golden State Valkyries are considered a long shot, the Minnesota Lynx emerge as a popular pick to win the championship, driven by a "revenge tour" narrative after narrowly losing the previous year.</p>

          <p>Top-performing Wall Street analysts are recommending three technology stocks—Broadcom, Zscaler, and Oracle—as strong long-term investments, largely due to their alignment with the artificial intelligence boom. Broadcom's stock is favored due to accelerating AI-related demand and a new $10 billion customer believed to be OpenAI. Cybersecurity firm Zscaler is recognized for strong growth driven by its Zero Trust and AI security solutions. Oracle has seen its stock rise after reporting massive growth in its contracted cloud revenue, signaling high demand for its AI infrastructure, which has significantly boosted investor confidence.

Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein, alleged that Prince Andrew abused her three times when she was 17. The prince has consistently denied the claims and reached an out-of-court settlement in 2022, but Roberts argued that being stripped of titles and publicly shamed is not sufficient accountability.</p>

          <p>The fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University has brought new attention to a state law that permits individuals with concealed-carry permits to have firearms on college campuses. The bill, passed shortly before the incident, added to Utah's already permissive gun laws, which include permitless carry and a lack of "red flag" laws. While it is not yet clear if the suspected shooter legally possessed the weapon on campus, the event has intensified the debate over campus safety. Proponents of such laws argue they deter crime, but critics suggest they are inadequate for preventing politically motivated violence.</p>

          <p>Amidst a rapid decline in popularity for the UK's Labour government, this analysis looks to the success of New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani for potential lessons. Mamdani's campaign has resonated with voters through a sharp focus on affordability, offering clear, compelling policies like free bus transport and a rent freeze, funded by taxes on the wealthy. Observers note that Mamdani has crafted a strong, overarching narrative that clearly identifies who he is fighting for, a quality critics say is lacking in Keir Starmer's government. His savvy use of social media to connect with voters also provides a stark contrast.</p>

          <p>A team of doctors at the Kyiv Heart Institute performed a successful heart transplant on a 12-year-old girl, Kira Skliarova, during one of the most severe Russian missile and drone attacks on the city. The donor heart came from a 4-year-old who had died in an accident. The surgical team, led by Dr. Borys Todurov, risked their lives, driving through the bombarded city to retrieve the organ and conducting the delicate surgery as explosions shook the hospital. Kira, whose own heart was severely weakened by illness, is now recovering and has met the donor's mother in an emotional encounter.</p>

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein, has stated that Lord Mandelson should never have been appointed as the UK's ambassador to the United States due to his relationship with the disgraced financier. Giuffre's brother, Sky Roberts, called the appointment a sign of "deep corruption." Mandelson was recently dismissed from the post by Prime Minister Keir Starmer after emails revealed he sent supportive messages to Epstein while he faced sex offense charges in 2008. A government minister acknowledged that had the full extent of the relationship been known, the appointment would have been "highly unlikely."</p>

          <p>The release of a scrapbook gifted to Jeffrey Epstein for his 50th birthday has renewed scrutiny of his relationships with powerful figures, including Donald Trump. The book, compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell, contains numerous entries with sexual innuendo, including an alleged message from Trump stating, "We have certain things in common." Trump, who has sued over previous reporting on the note, denies its authenticity. The book's contents have intensified calls for transparency and the full release of government files related to Epstein, as his victims and the public seek accountability for his network of enablers.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, UN Special Rapporteur Mary Lawlor shares the direct words of Palestinian human rights defenders working in Gaza, who describe living "on death row." These individuals document atrocities while struggling for their own survival, facing daily searches for food and water, displacement, and the constant threat of being killed. They speak of a "broken moral compass" and a loss of faith in international law, which they feel has failed to protect them. The defenders stress the vital importance of their work for future accountability and urge the world not to wait until they are killed to act.</p>

          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk is occurring amid a significant rise in political violence and terrorism plots across the United States. Data from the University of Maryland shows a nearly 40% increase in such incidents in the first half of 2025 compared to the previous year. Experts see parallels to the turbulent 1960s but note that modern social media and the availability of lethal weapons make the current era potentially more dangerous. As prominent political figures react to Kirk's death, there are growing fears that the event could mark the beginning of an even "darker chapter" of civil unrest.</p>

          <p>A proposal by Florida's Surgeon General, Joseph Ladapo, to eliminate all vaccine mandates in the state has faltered following criticism from public health experts and prominent Republicans, including Donald Trump. Ladapo initially announced his department would work to end every mandate, but the plan was quickly met with resistance. Trump defended the efficacy of traditional childhood vaccines for diseases like measles and polio, calling them uncontroversial. In response, the Florida Department of Health has scaled back the plan, now proposing to remove only mandates for vaccines not required for school entry, such as for chickenpox and hepatitis B.</p>

          <p>In this advice column, a reader struggling with moral scrupulosity—a constant and paralyzing worry about being a good person—asks for guidance ahead of Yom Kippur. The author advises moving away from an "optimizing" mindset, which seeks to do "The Most Possible Good," arguing it's an unrealistic standard for imperfect humans. Instead, the column suggests adopting self-compassion and reframing moral shortfalls as "missing the mark" rather than "sinning," a perspective rooted in rabbinic teachings. This approach, supported by psychological research, can lead to greater personal accountability and action rather than the paralysis caused by fear of not being perfect.</p>

The unrest was initially sparked by a social media ban from the previous government but quickly expanded to encompass broader economic frustrations. Karki, whose name was put forward by activists, has promised to hold new elections by March 5 and not remain in power for more than six months.</p>

          <p>The main advocacy group for families of Israeli hostages held in Gaza has publicly accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of being the "one obstacle" to their loved ones' return. In a statement, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum claimed that every time a potential deal for the hostages' release approaches, Netanyahu sabotages it. The accusation follows a recent Israeli strike in Qatar that targeted Hamas leaders, a move the families argue proves the prime minister is prioritizing other objectives over securing a deal. They assert that his "stalling" is costing lives and is designed to prolong his hold on power.</p>

          <p>According to a Chinese research paper, a new AI-powered anti-submarine warfare (ASW) system could reduce a submarine's chance of escaping detection to just 5%. The system moves beyond traditional search patterns by acting as an intelligent commander, integrating real-time data from a wide array of sources. It analyzes information from sonar buoys, underwater sensors, radar, and even oceanographic data like temperature and salinity. This allows the AI to create a comprehensive, dynamic picture of the undersea environment, enabling it to predict a submarine's location and movements with unprecedented accuracy.</p>
