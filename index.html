          <p>Apple's stock suffered its steepest drop since 2020 following President Trump's tariff announcement.  The tariffs impact Apple's diversified manufacturing across countries like Vietnam and India, leaving the company with limited options to avoid increased production costs. Analysts predict Apple may need to raise prices by 17-18% to offset the tariff impact, creating significant uncertainty for the company.</p>
