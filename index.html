          <p>Competitive eater Joey Chestnut made a triumphant return to the Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest, winning his 17th title by consuming 70.5 hot dogs and buns. After being banned from the previous year's event over a sponsorship dispute, Chestnut handily defeated the defending champion. In the women's competition, Miki Sudo secured her 11th victory, eating 33 hot dogs, though falling short of her world record. The annual Fourth of July event in Coney Island continues to be a major spectacle, drawing large crowds to witness the ten-minute eating competition.</p>

          <h2>Former President Trump Faces Criticism for Using Antisemitic Slur in Iowa Speech</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump has drawn condemnation from Jewish advocacy groups for using the antisemitic term "Shylocks" during a speech in Iowa. The term, which references a villain from Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice," was used while discussing tax changes in his spending bill. The Anti-Defamation League described the language as "extremely offensive and dangerous," underscoring how harmful stereotypes persist. When questioned, Trump claimed he was unaware of the term's antisemitic connotations, stating he only knew it to mean a money lender charging high rates. The article notes that then-Vice President Joe Biden also apologized for using the same term in 2014.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal prosecutors have filed a complaint alleging that scammers fraudulently obtained over $250,000 in cryptocurrency by impersonating the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee. The perpetrators used deceptive email addresses, substituting a lowercase 'l' for an 'i', to trick a victim into sending USDT stablecoin, believing it was a donation. The emails, sent in December, purported to be from a co-chair of the inaugural committee. The U.S. government is now seeking the permanent seizure of nearly $40,400 of the stolen funds that were recovered from a Binance account, aiming to deter future criminal activity and potentially compensate victims.</p>

          <p>The seven-year custody sentence for a 15-year-old boy who killed 80-year-old Bhim Kohli in Leicestershire is being reviewed for being potentially too lenient. Mr. Kohli died after being racially abused and physically assaulted in a park, an attack that was filmed and encouraged by a 13-year-old girl. The boy was convicted of manslaughter, while the girl received a non-custodial youth rehabilitation order, which will not be reviewed. The victim's family expressed disappointment with the original sentences, arguing that they do not reflect the severity of the crime and fail to hold young offenders accountable for their actions.</p>

          <p>Russia conducted its largest aerial attack on Kyiv since the war began, using approximately 550 drones and 11 missiles, resulting in at least one death and over 20 injuries. The assault occurred shortly after President Trump held an unproductive phone call with Vladimir Putin but a more "useful" conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. This escalation comes as the Trump administration has paused a critical weapons shipment to Ukraine, raising concerns in Kyiv about its ability to defend against intensified Russian strikes. Zelenskyy and Trump reportedly discussed enhancing Ukraine's air defense capabilities and agreed to have their teams meet.</p>

          <p>Immigrant advocates and the ACLU have filed a class-action lawsuit alleging that U.S. immigration agents in Southern California are engaging in widespread racial profiling during deportation crackdowns. The suit claims agents are targeting individuals based on their appearance and occupation, raiding known hubs for Latino workers and making arrests without reasonable suspicion. Advocates argue that ambitious arrest quotas are pressuring agents to cut constitutional corners. The Department of Homeland Security has denied the allegations, stating that their operations are highly targeted and not based on race. The lawsuit seeks to have the raids declared unconstitutional, highlighting cases where even U.S. citizens were wrongfully detained.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement of a new trade pact with Vietnam, which includes a 40% tariff on goods transshipped from other countries, has raised questions about its implementation. The measure is aimed at curbing the practice of Chinese manufacturers rerouting goods through Vietnam to evade U.S. tariffs. However, economists and trade experts are uncertain how Vietnam will enforce this, as it requires defining what constitutes a "made in Vietnam" product versus a transshipped one. The difficulty lies in determining the acceptable threshold of Chinese components in a product before the hefty tariff applies, creating significant potential for disruption.

          <h2>Pop Mart's Success Continues Despite Chinese State Media Warning on 'Blind Box' Toys</h2>

          <p>Despite a Chinese state media editorial calling for tighter regulation on "blind box" toys to protect children, analysts believe Pop Mart, the maker of the popular Labubu dolls, will remain resilient. The company's primary demographic consists of young adults, not the minors targeted by the proposed regulations. Furthermore, Pop Mart's significant and growing overseas sales, particularly in Southeast Asia and North America, provide a cushion against potential domestic headwinds. While facing challenges like production delays and counterfeit products, the brand's popularity reflects a consumer desire for "affordable exclusivity" amid a sluggish Chinese economy.</p>

          <p>Russia has officially become the first country to formally recognize the Taliban's government in Afghanistan since the group seized power in 2021. The move, which involved removing the Taliban from Moscow's list of outlawed organizations, was confirmed when Russia's Foreign Ministry accepted credentials from a new Afghan ambassador. China welcomed the decision, stating Afghanistan should not be excluded from the international community. The recognition provides a degree of legitimacy to the Taliban regime, which has been largely isolated on the world stage due to its severe restrictions on the rights of women and girls.</p>

          <p>Three years after its launch, the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline is handling about 20% more contacts, but a specialized service for LGBTQ youth is being discontinued due to a lack of funding. The "Press 3" option, operated in part by The Trevor Project, will be cut after its Congressionally directed funding was expended. The move has drawn criticism from advocacy groups and bipartisan members of Congress, who note the service fielded over 1.3 million contacts and served a high-risk population.

Musk had previously labeled the bill the "DEBT SLAVERY bill." The legislation, which includes large tax cuts and significant new spending, is projected by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to add $3.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, a figure the White House disputes.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article argues that the American Revolution was transformed from a tax protest into a full-scale rebellion by Britain's imposition of martial law in Boston. Following the Boston Tea Party, Parliament's Coercive Acts of 1774 effectively shut down the colony's self-governance and brought in an occupying army. This military overreach, rather than the initial tax disputes, galvanized colonial resistance and led directly to the convening of the Continental Congress. The article draws a parallel to modern times, cautioning that deploying military forces in domestic affairs can provoke unpredictable violence and lasting civil discord, as history has shown.</p>

          <p>An international security expert has suggested that collaboration with China's hi-tech sector could help reinvigorate former industrial areas in the U.S. and stabilize relations between the two superpowers. The proposal points to the "Wuhan model," where second-tier Chinese cities have successfully integrated university research with private industry to create advanced manufacturing clusters. This model could potentially be replicated in American rust-belt cities, fostering economic growth outside of traditional tech hubs like Silicon Valley. The idea is floated amid a temporary de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, suggesting a possible path for constructive engagement.</p>

          <p>The United States has confirmed a pause on a scheduled arms shipment to Ukraine, a move that a State Department spokesperson described as a "one event" situation and not a cessation of aid. However, the decision to withhold critical supplies like Patriot air defense missiles creates significant uncertainty for Kyiv as it faces intensified Russian attacks. The pause comes after President Trump's unproductive call with Vladimir Putin and has prompted Ukraine's President Zelenskyy to seek clarity.

Sweden has been struggling with a surge in gang-related violence, including bombings and shootings, often orchestrated by leaders operating from other countries.
