          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently indicated a potential interest rate cut, citing a significant slowdown in U.S. job growth over the past three months. Labor experts concur, warning of further pain for job seekers due to factors like new tariffs and AI adoption, which are delaying hiring and could lead to increased layoffs. The number of long-term job seekers and unemployed young workers is also on the rise, signaling a cooling labor market despite a low overall unemployment rate. This trend suggests a challenging outlook for employment in the coming months.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an El Salvador native, was taken into ICE custody after his release from criminal detention, despite being on electronic monitoring. His lawyer argues this detention is punitive, challenging the move and a potential deportation to Uganda, which follows a mistaken deportation to El Salvador earlier. Senator Chris Van Hollen and Maryland Governor Wes Moore have advocated for due process, criticizing the administration's actions as a malicious abuse of power. Abrego Garcia's family denies claims of his affiliation with the MS-13 gang, highlighting ongoing legal battles over his immigration status.</p>

          <p>Leaders of South Korea and Japan met, pledging to forge "stable, future-oriented" ties, marking a significant shift after years of strained relations. This rapprochement, driven by an "increasingly difficult strategic environment" including an unpredictable US foreign policy under Donald Trump and closer China-Russia ties, aims to build a united front. Both nations plan to enhance cooperation in AI, industry, and denuclearization, with defense ministers set to meet soon. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expressed optimism for renewed partnership, though the stability of this alliance may hinge on future political changes in Japan.</p>

          <p>Former Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe was arrested on corruption charges, accused of misusing state funds for a personal stopover during a diplomatic trip. This marks the first time a former head of state in Sri Lanka has faced such charges, sparking both support and criticism for President Anura Kumara Dissanayake's administration. While some view it as a crucial step against corruption, opposition leaders, including three former presidents, condemn it as a "political witch hunt" designed to silence critics. The incident highlights deep divisions within the country's political landscape and raises questions about the impartiality of the justice system.</p>

          <p>Some National Guard units deployed in Washington D.C. under President Donald Trump's directive have started carrying firearms, escalating the military presence in the capital. This move follows a defense department order and comes as Trump considers expanding similar deployments to other Democratic-led cities like Chicago and New York. The armed presence, intended to establish a law enforcement presence, has drawn protests and raised concerns about federal overreach and public safety. Local leaders, including Maryland Governor Wes Moore, have criticized the unprecedented federal intervention, while Trump defends his actions as necessary to combat crime.</p>

          <p>Numerous European postal services, including those from France, Germany, and Italy, have suspended most parcel shipments to the U.S. due to uncertainty surrounding new import tariffs announced by President Donald Trump. The tariffs, set to abolish a tax exemption for small packages, will impose a 15% duty on goods previously entering duty-free, significantly impacting small and medium-sized European businesses. Operators cite a lack of clear guidance on tariff collection and insufficient time to prepare for the regulatory changes. This widespread suspension is expected to last only a few days, but highlights the disruptive nature of the new trade policies.</p>

          <p>A new report identifies 'quiet cracking' as a pervasive feeling of workplace unhappiness that precedes disengagement and poor performance, potentially leading to 'quiet quitting.' Unlike burnout, it doesn't always manifest as exhaustion, and its impact on performance isn't immediately visible, making it a subtle but dangerous trend. Over half of surveyed employees report experiencing quiet cracking, driven by factors like unclear goals, heavy workloads, and poor relationships. Experts note that with a slowing job market, employees feel more 'stuck' in their roles, making it harder to remedy this detachment and resulting in significant lost productivity for organizations.</p>

Scientists estimate at least 49 species, including manatees and Florida panthers, are at risk of disappearing if these revisions are implemented.

The 1970s saw a boom in activities like running, aerobic dancing, and the rise of yoga and weightlifting, popularized by icons such as Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jane Fonda.

          <p>Washington, D.C. students are returning to school amidst President Trump's deployment of over 2,000 National Guard troops and federal agents, though Mayor Muriel Bowser asserts their presence is not needed for school safety. Despite a reported decrease in crime rates, the surge raises new questions about student safety, particularly with military vehicles and troops at Metro stations. While Bowser emphasizes D.C.'s existing safe passage programs, some residents and parents express heightened anxiety due to the federal presence. Philadelphia, facing its own public transit cuts, is also investing in community patrols and school safety officers to ensure a secure return to classes.</p>

          <p>The search for Natalia Nagovitsyna, a Russian climber stranded for nearly two weeks on Kyrgyzstan's 24,406-foot Victory Peak, has been suspended indefinitely due to severe weather conditions. This tragic development follows the death of Italian climber Luca Sinigaglia, who perished on August 15 while attempting to rescue her from an altitude of around 23,000 feet. Despite a drone confirming Nagovitsyna was alive earlier, there has been no sign of life since Thursday, and rescue officials now believe she is likely deceased. The extreme altitude, coupled with sub-zero temperatures and blizzards, makes rescue operations virtually impossible.</p>

Collaborating with historian Jorell Meléndez-Badillo, his latest album, "DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS," fuses modern Latin trap with traditional sounds, embedding historical narratives into its visualizers and concert experience. This artistic endeavor aims to educate a global audience on issues like surveillance, colonial governance, and the ongoing fiscal crisis imposed by the U.S. federal oversight board. Bad Bunny's platform amplifies the politicization of a generation that knows only crisis, inspiring pride and a renewed push for self-determination.</p>

          <p>The UK hospitality industry has experienced over half of the nation's job losses since the last budget, totaling around 89,000 positions. Industry leaders attribute this decline to higher taxes, including increased business rates and National Insurance contributions, which have stifled investment and hiring. With rising inflation impacting consumer spending and other operational costs like energy and ingredients soaring, businesses are forced to cut hours and staff, with predictions of reaching 100,000 job losses by the next budget. UKHospitality is urging urgent government action to alleviate these pressures and prevent further closures, highlighting the severe economic strain on the sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent surge of federal agents into Washington D.C. has intensified immigration enforcement, leading to arrests and widespread fear among undocumented families and childcare workers. Reports of unmarked cars and checkpoints near daycares have prompted new safety protocols, including requiring photo identification for entry.

Experts question the efficacy of involuntary commitments without concurrent housing solutions, noting that states with high rates of such interventions, like California, also have significant unsheltered populations. Critics argue that Trump's policy represents a cruel version of a broadly supported shift towards institutional responses, often reframing coercion as compassion.</p>
