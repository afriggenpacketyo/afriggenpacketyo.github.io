          <p>Residents of Russian-occupied Mariupol are refuting the portrayal of a rebuilt and normalized city presented on Russian television, describing it as a deceptive facade. According to locals, while central building facades are repaired for propaganda, much of the city remains in ruins, with severe shortages of clean water, electricity, and medicine. The BBC spoke with multiple residents who detailed the harsh realities of life under occupation, including the indoctrination of children with pro-Russian propaganda in schools. Despite the risks, a local resistance movement continues to operate, providing intelligence to the Ukrainian military and symbolizing hope for liberation.</p>

          <p>A controversial provision to mandate the sale of up to 1.2 million acres of public land in 11 Western states has been withdrawn from a Republican reconciliation bill following significant bipartisan backlash. Spearheaded by Senator Mike Lee, the measure was intended to address housing affordability but faced opposition from fellow Republican senators and House members, as well as conservation and recreation groups. Lee stated he pulled the provision due to an inability to secure safeguards preventing the land from being sold to foreign interests. Conservation advocates celebrated the decision as a victory but remain vigilant against future attempts to privatize public lands.</p>

          <p>North Carolina Republican Senator Thom Tillis has announced he will not seek re-election, a day after voting against President Trump's signature budget package. Tillis cited the diminishing space for bipartisanship and independent thinking in Washington as a key reason for his departure. His decision followed sharp criticism and threats from Trump, who promised to back a primary challenger against him for opposing the bill due to its deep cuts to Medicaid. The retirement of the moderate senator could create a more competitive race for his seat in 2026, with speculation already arising about potential candidates, including Lara Trump.</p>

          <p>The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the Republican budget bill, championed by President Trump, could cause nearly 12 million Americans to lose their health insurance. The sprawling legislation, which also projects an increase to the national debt by almost $3.3 trillion, faces a critical vote in the Senate. The bill's proposed cuts to Medicaid have been a major point of contention, leading to opposition from some Republicans like Senator Thom Tillis. Democrats have heavily criticized the plan, arguing it prioritizes tax cuts for the wealthy at the expense of essential healthcare and nutrition programs for vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is engaged in a weekend debate over President Trump's major tax and spending package, known as the "One Big, Beautiful Bill," with a final vote anticipated after a marathon session. Having narrowly passed the House, the bill includes increased funding for border security and defense, offset by cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs. The legislation advanced through a procedural vote late Saturday after GOP leaders worked to secure support from holdouts.

Iravani stated that while Iran is ready for negotiations, the recent "aggression" has created improper conditions for talks, and he denied any threats against IAEA inspectors, whose access to sites is currently suspended.

Warner stated that Ryan was threatened with immediate cuts to university jobs, research funding, and student aid if he did not resign by a specific deadline. The pressure was related to a federal investigation into the university's diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies. Warner warned that this action sets a dangerous precedent, suggesting that if the federal government can target UVA, other public universities could face similar political pressure.</p>

This article explores the complex social and historical factors contributing to this trend, including the economic collapse following German reunification and a sense of disenfranchisement. Despite the city's rich cultural heritage, including its Bauhaus legacy, it has been plagued by racist violence, and the far-right AfD party has gained significant political ground, raising concerns among local civic groups and residents.</p>

          <p>The health effects of common seed oils like canola, soybean, and sunflower oil are a subject of ongoing debate, with prominent figures like Health Secretary RFK Jr. labeling them as harmful. This article examines the controversy, noting that many nutrition researchers and scientific evidence do not support the claim that these oils are inherently toxic for the general population. While some concerns focus on the high levels of omega-6 fatty acids and the chemical processes used for extraction, mainstream health organizations continue to recognize their benefits when consumed as part of a balanced diet. The discussion highlights the complexity of nutritional science and public health messaging.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has ordered new evacuations for Palestinians in parts of northern Gaza, including Gaza City and Jabalia, signaling an intensification of military operations in the area. This comes as US President Donald Trump continues to push for a ceasefire and hostage release deal.

          <p>This article provides a detailed analysis of how to assess the damage from the recent U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, cautioning against premature conclusions. Drawing on historical examples from WWII and the Gulf War, it explains that Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) is a complex process that considers munition type, delivery accuracy, and the distinction between physical and functional effects. While President Trump declared the program "obliterated," a full assessment takes time and integrates various intelligence sources. The analysis suggests that given the sophisticated weaponry used and ideal operational conditions, the cumulative damage is likely severe, a view shared by many external experts.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that he has secured a buyer for the popular video-sharing app TikTok, which faces a U.S. ban over national security concerns. In a recent interview, Trump stated that a group of "very wealthy people" is prepared to acquire the platform from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, with more details to be revealed in the coming weeks. A potential sale would require approval from the Chinese government, which Trump believes is likely. This development comes after Trump repeatedly delayed the enforcement of a law mandating TikTok's sale, a reversal from his earlier stance on the app.</p>
