          <p>Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's former first minister, has released a memoir titled "Frankly," offering candid reflections on her political and personal life. The book details her regrets over the handling of transgender rights legislation, the breakdown of her relationship with predecessor Alex Salmond, and the emotional toll of leading during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sturgeon also discusses her arrest amid the SNP finance probe, which she calls "the worst day" of her life, and opens up about personal struggles, including a miscarriage and the impact of misogyny in politics. She concludes by reaffirming her belief in future Scottish independence.</p>

          <p>A strategically placed Red Bull can helped solve the three-year-old mystery of a missing cyclist in Scotland. The case of Tony Parsons, who vanished during a charity ride in 2017, was cracked after Alexander McKellar confessed to his new girlfriend, Dr. Caroline Muirhead, that he had killed Parsons in a hit-and-run. After McKellar showed her the remote burial site, Muirhead secretly dropped the can as a marker and alerted police. Parsons' body was recovered, and his family expressed immense gratitude for Muirhead's quick thinking, which was crucial for bringing them closure and justice.</p>

          <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia has cut its benchmark interest rate to 3.6%, the lowest level since April 2023, in response to slowing economic conditions. Alongside the rate cut, the RBA downgraded its annual economic growth forecast from 2.1% to 1.7%, citing weaker public demand and a lower outlook for productivity growth. While inflation has substantially decreased from its 2022 peak, the central bank noted that the impact of recent global trade developments has been minimal so far, but risks remain. Analysts anticipate further rate cuts later in the year to support the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent polling indicates a growing majority of Israelis favor a deal with Hamas to secure the release of all hostages, even if it means ending the war in Gaza. Surveys show a significant shift in public opinion since the conflict began, with 74% now supporting an agreement. However, the same research reveals that most Jewish Israelis are not significantly troubled by reports of Palestinian suffering and famine in Gaza, believing the military is doing enough to avoid civilian harm. This highlights a complex public sentiment focused primarily on the return of hostages and the safety of Israeli soldiers rather than the humanitarian crisis.</p>

According to interviews with escaped workers and South Korean intelligence, these laborers face grueling 18-hour workdays, are confined to their sites, and have most of their earnings confiscated by the North Korean state. This influx of workers, often arriving on student visas to bypass UN sanctions, is part of a deepening relationship between Moscow and Pyongyang. The North Korean regime is also tightening controls to prevent escapes as it prepares to send even more workers.</p>

          <p>Spain is creating friction with the Trump administration by pursuing an independent foreign and defense policy, notably by renouncing U.S. F-35 aircraft purchases and resisting NATO's 5% defense spending target. The Spanish government, led by Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, is also fostering closer economic ties with China, including awarding a contract to Huawei, which has drawn criticism from both the U.S. and EU. Analysts suggest Spain's minority leftist government may be using these high-profile foreign policy stances to distract from domestic issues. Despite threats from President Trump, Spain has largely avoided direct consequences due to the EU's collective trade bargaining power.</p>

          <p>A specific knee-replacement implant used by the UK's National Health Service had a concerning failure rate that was known for eight years before its withdrawal, a BBC investigation found. Patients who received the NexGen implant, manufactured by Zimmer Biomet, reported severe pain and mobility issues after the device slipped out of place, leading to hundreds of corrective surgeries. Surgeons and registry data first flagged problems as early as 2014, but the company was slow to acknowledge the issue with the component.

          <p>During a trial over President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles, a commanding general testified that he never heard the situation described as a "rebellion." The trial stems from a lawsuit by California Governor Gavin Newsom, who argues the deployment violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits domestic use of the military. The Trump administration justified the action under a law allowing federal intervention during a "rebellion." Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman's testimony challenges a key premise of the administration's legal argument for federalizing the state's National Guard troops to respond to protests.</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated E.J. Antoni, an economist from the conservative Heritage Foundation, to head the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The appointment follows the controversial firing of the previous commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, after a weaker-than-expected July jobs report, which Trump claimed without evidence was manipulated. Antoni has been a vocal critic of the BLS's methodology and has defended Trump's economic policies. The move has raised concerns among some economists and former BLS leaders about the potential politicization of the independent federal agency responsible for crucial economic data, including employment and inflation figures.</p>

          <p>A prominent Chinese economist and central bank adviser, Wang Yiming, has called for government guidance to manage the fierce competition in China's "quick commerce" sector. He argued that instead of stifling competition, officials should curb excessive cash burn and guide the industry towards high-quality development through innovation and an improved industrial ecosystem. Wang emphasized that the rapid delivery sector, which provides food and goods often within 30 minutes, creates new consumption opportunities vital for long-term economic growth. His comments address concerns about the unsustainable, zero-sum competition prevalent in China's tech-driven retail markets.</p>

          <p>An 11-year-old girl was attacked by a mountain lion outside her family's home in Malibu and is currently hospitalized with injuries to her arm, leg, and back. The incident occurred while she was doing chores in the backyard, and the animal fled after her mother and sibling rushed out upon hearing her screams. Officials from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife later located and killed a mountain lion found hiding on the property. DNA samples are being tested to confirm it was the same animal involved in the attack, which is a rare but possible occurrence in areas close to wildlife habitats.</p>

          <p>In an effort to promote tourism in its more remote regions, Nepal has made 97 of its Himalayan peaks free to climb for the next two years. This initiative targets mountains in the country's less-developed western provinces, which see very few visitors despite their beauty. The move contrasts with a recent fee increase for summiting Mount Everest, which will now cost $15,000 during peak season. Officials hope the fee waiver will create jobs and strengthen local economies, while also providing training grounds for climbers, as a new law may soon require Everest aspirants to first summit a 7,000-meter peak.</p>

          <p>Two armed thieves orchestrated a chaotic, two-hour pursuit across Los Angeles County, stealing three different vehicles and ultimately evading capture. The chase began in Lancaster with the carjacking of a pickup truck and involved the suspects firing shots at the victim. They later abandoned the truck, stole a big rig which they drove the wrong way on a freeway, and then carjacked a third vehicle before disappearing. Authorities recovered a loaded firearm from the first stolen truck and believe additional suspects may have assisted in the final escape, prompting an ongoing investigation into the brazen crime spree.</p>

According to the documents, the staffer, who was interviewed by the FBI, attended a 2017 meeting where Schiff allegedly stated the group would leak derogatory information to be used for an indictment. The whistleblower reportedly called the plan "treasonous" and "illegal."

The president stated he would be "getting rid of the slums" and warned that other Democratic-led cities could face similar federal intervention.

A domestic variant, the GJ-2, serves as a cornerstone of the People's Liberation Army's uncrewed capabilities, conducting patrols around Taiwan and in the South China Sea.

          <p>The city of Huntington Park, California, a predominantly Latino community, is experiencing a severe economic downturn as residents live in fear of increased Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids. Local officials report that the main commercial street, once vibrant, has become a "ghost town," with many businesses locking their doors during operating hours to protect customers. This climate of fear is causing a sharp decline in sales tax revenue, which impacts the city's ability to provide essential services. The situation highlights the profound effect that federal immigration enforcement policies are having on the daily life and economy of local communities.</p>

The unusual move to overturn a jury conviction for excessive force came after a new U.S. Attorney was appointed, triggering resignations from several prosecutors. Judge Stephen V. Wilson ruled that dismissing the case was "contrary to the public interest" and an attempt to subvert the court's prior sentencing. The deputy, Trevor Kirk, was convicted of violently throwing a woman to the ground and pepper-spraying her during a 2023 arrest.</p>
