          <h2>Nvidia Responds to Anthropic's Claims Regarding AI Chip Export Restrictions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia has publicly criticized Anthropic's defense of U.S. AI chip export restrictions on China, dismissing Anthropic's claims of smuggling tactics as "tall tales." Anthropic had suggested that Chinese entities were attempting to circumvent chip restrictions by hiding them in creative ways. Nvidia stated that American firms should focus on innovation instead of alleging smuggling. The "AI Diffusion Rule," which imposes global export controls on advanced AI chips and model weights, is set to take effect on May 15, aiming to prevent China from advancing in AI. </p>

          <p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is pressing the Trump administration to implement a "tariff exclusion process" to prevent a recession and protect small businesses. The Chamber's CEO, Suzanne Clark, requested that tariffs be automatically lifted on small business importers and products not domestically available, citing concerns about irreparable harm to small businesses. White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller indicated the administration is not considering tariff exemptions, instead focusing on tax relief for small businesses. Clark explained that the Chamber is not challenging the tariffs in court due to the lengthy legal process, seeking more immediate relief for businesses.</p>

          <p>Right-wing commentators like Candace Owens and Joe Rogan are questioning Harvey Weinstein's guilt as he faces a retrial in New York for sexual assault charges, signaling a shift in cultural perception. Owens is promoting a series of jailhouse interviews with Weinstein, while Rogan says Owens's series convinced him to change his mind on Weinstein. This support is part of a broader anti-Me Too backlash, challenging the movement's impact on holding sexual abusers accountable. The article argues that these defenses rely on debunked myths about sexual assault, undermining the progress made in educating the public about such violence.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is discontinuing $1 billion in federal grants used by school districts to hire mental health professionals, citing violations of federal civil rights law. The grants were part of the 2022 Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, aimed at addressing student mental health. The administration claims the funds were used to implement race-based actions unrelated to mental health. School districts that relied on the grants now face the prospect of cutting mental health services, leading to concerns about the well-being of students.</p>

          <p>Kinney County, Texas, has collected approximately $1.7 million in bail from migrants who were deported before their court appearances, refusing to return the money. The county's aggressive enforcement of trespassing laws is part of Governor Abbott's Operation Lone Star, aimed at increasing border security. Migrants, often unaware of their deportation status affecting their bail, have forfeited significant sums. The county's attorney defends the policy, arguing that migrants are responsible for their inability to appear in court, while critics claim it is unjust.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing significant changes to student loan repayment options under the Student Success and Taxpayer Savings Plan. The plan would offer two repayment options: fixed payments over 10 to 25 years, or an income-driven repayment plan called the "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP). Under the RAP plan, monthly bills would be a percentage of borrowers' income, ranging from 1% to 10% depending on earnings. The proposal aims to reduce costs and contribute to President Trump's tax cut plans, altering the landscape of student loan repayment for millions of Americans.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to raise tariffs on Chinese imports to a minimum of 145 percent is expected to cause significant disruptions to U.S. supply chains. The number of container ships departing China for the United States has already declined, and consumers may soon see empty shelves and higher prices. The elimination of the "de minimis" treatment for Chinese goods will further increase costs for consumers. Experts warn that the U.S. economy could slip into a recession by the summer of 2025 if the trade situation is not resolved quickly.</p>
