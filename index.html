          <p>Child development experts are expressing alarm over the rise of AI-powered stuffed animals, warning they could negatively affect children's brain development. These toys, marketed as screen-free companions, may replace crucial human interaction, hindering the growth of empathy and critical thinking. Psychologists and pediatricians also highlight significant privacy risks, as the toys often record and store conversations, potentially exposing sensitive family information. The article suggests that while these toys might offer some educational benefits, the potential long-term emotional and social costs for children are substantial and largely unmeasured.</p>

          <p>Israel's military has announced the death of Abu Obeida, the prominent spokesman for Hamas's armed wing, in an airstrike on Gaza City's al-Rimal neighborhood. The operation was described as a "flawless execution" based on prior intelligence, though Hamas has not yet confirmed his death. The strike is part of an intensified Israeli campaign in Gaza, which has drawn international warnings about catastrophic consequences for civilians. Local reports indicate the attack caused numerous civilian casualties, highlighting the ongoing and devastating human cost of the conflict.</p>

          <p>The UK has secured its largest-ever warship export agreement, a £10 billion deal to supply Norway with at least five new Type 26 anti-submarine frigates. The Ministry of Defence stated the deal will support thousands of UK jobs, particularly at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be built. This strategic partnership aims to strengthen NATO's northern flank by creating a combined fleet to operate in the North Atlantic. The agreement is seen as a major success for the British defense industry, chosen over competitors from France, Germany, and the United States.</p>

          <p>A protest against the use of hotels for housing asylum seekers in London's Canary Wharf resulted in three arrests on Sunday. The Metropolitan Police reported that while the demonstration began peacefully, some masked protesters entered a shopping center and became aggressive, leading to one officer being punched. The arrests were for offenses including common assault, drug possession, and assault on police. Authorities implemented a Section 35 dispersal order and a Section 60 AA order, allowing them to require the removal of masks in the area to prevent further escalation.</p>

          <p>At 39 years and 239 days old, Brighton's James Milner has become the second-oldest goalscorer in Premier League history after converting a penalty against Manchester City. This achievement adds to his record as the league's second-youngest scorer, a feat he accomplished for Leeds in 2002. Milner's longevity and versatility are widely praised, with colleagues and pundits calling him a "legend of the game" for his fitness and experience. The goal, which helped secure Brighton's first league win of the season, marked his first in six years and highlighted his continued importance to his team.</p>

          <p>A flotilla carrying humanitarian aid and prominent activists, including Greta Thunberg, has set sail from Barcelona with the goal of breaking the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip. The mission, named the Global Sumud Flotilla, aims to deliver essential supplies like food and medicine to the territory, where food experts have warned of famine conditions. Organizers state the convoy consists of around 20 boats from 44 countries, which will be joined by others en route. This effort occurs as Israel continues its military offensive in Gaza City and follows previous attempts by activists to reach the strip by sea.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington D.C. has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from deporting 10 unaccompanied children to Guatemala. The order, which lasts for 14 days, came after immigration advocacy groups argued the removals would violate U.S. laws designed to protect vulnerable minors. The administration had recently finalized an agreement with Guatemala to facilitate such deportations. The legal challenge contends that returning these children, aged 10 to 17, could expose them to abuse, persecution, or torture, against their best interests and established legal protections.</p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has confirmed the death of a baby from whooping cough, the first such fatality in the UK this year. The infant's mother had not been vaccinated against the illness during pregnancy, a key measure recommended to protect newborns. This tragic event highlights growing concerns over declining vaccination rates, with officials noting that none of the main childhood vaccines in England met the 95% uptake target last year. The UKHSA is urging pregnant women and parents of young children to adhere to vaccination schedules to prevent further severe cases of the highly contagious bacterial infection.</p>

Moore stated he has no interest in fighting the president but is focused on "fighting for my communities," highlighting recent drops in crime while acknowledging more work is needed. The governor criticized Trump's offer of federal intervention as "performative" and cynical, suggesting federal funds would be better spent supporting local law enforcement.

          <p>Dr. Céline Gounder, a CBS News medical contributor, has voiced significant concern over a "leadership vacuum" at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) following the ouster of its director and other key officials. She warned that these departures directly affect the public, particularly regarding vaccine policy, which she says is now being driven by "political fiat" rather than a transparent scientific process. Dr. Gounder highlighted upcoming meetings where long-standing childhood vaccine recommendations could be revisited, a move she described as unprecedented.

Celtic's performance was particularly feeble, failing to create any significant chances and recording an expected goals (xG) value of nearly zero in the first half. The result leaves both managers with significant work to do, as Celtic's lack of creativity and Rangers' poor start to the season were starkly evident.</p>

The court found that the president overstepped his authority by using a 1977 law to justify the sweeping levies. While the tariffs remain in effect pending a Supreme Court appeal, the ruling places a key component of the administration's economic policy on uncertain legal ground. (not investment advice)</p>

Colleagues from both sides of the political aisle and within the press corps relied on his encyclopedic knowledge of presidential statistics, from speeches given to trips taken. His dedication, distinctive radio voice, and generosity made him a universally respected and beloved figure who chronicled the presidency with unparalleled accuracy for over three decades.</p>

          <h2>Fecal Bacteria Warnings Issued for Numerous U.S. Beaches Ahead of Labor Day</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Popular beaches across the United States are under swimming advisories for the Labor Day weekend due to high levels of fecal bacteria in the water. From Florida to Maine and California, health officials are warning beachgoers to avoid swimming to prevent illnesses such as gastrointestinal issues and rashes. A recent report from Environment America found that over 60% of U.S. beaches tested had at least one day of potentially unsafe fecal contamination last year. The pollution is primarily attributed to sources like urban runoff, failing sewer systems, and industrial livestock operations, posing a persistent threat to public health.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major U.S. retailers and food companies are warning that President Trump's tariffs are leading to higher prices on store shelves for consumers. Companies like Walmart, Target, and J.M. Smucker have indicated that costs for groceries, electronics, and home goods are increasing as they replenish inventory at post-tariff prices. This pricing pressure is forcing businesses to decide how much of the increased cost to absorb and how much to pass on to shoppers. The trend is contributing to a "K-shaped" economy, where lower-income consumers are disproportionately squeezed by inflation and rising costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has condemned a reported plan by the Trump administration to send military forces to Chicago, calling the potential move an "invasion." Pritzker stated that the White House has not communicated with his office about the plan, which he believes has aims beyond fighting crime, possibly related to influencing future elections. The comments come after President Trump criticized Chicago as a "mess" and suggested federal intervention was imminent, similar to deployments in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. A White House spokesperson dismissed Pritzker's concerns, attacking his record on crime in the city.</p>

          <p>Two climate activists were arrested in Barcelona after smearing the iconic Sagrada Familia basilica with red and black paint. The protest, organized by the group Futuro Vegetal, was intended to express outrage over devastating summer forest fires in Spain, which they link to government inaction and the livestock industry. The group posted a video of the demonstration, calling for "climate justice." This act is one of many similar protests staged by the group, which has previously targeted famous artworks and property to draw attention to what they call a "climate emergency."</p>

          <p>Quarterback Arch Manning took responsibility for his performance after No. 1 ranked Texas suffered a 14-7 season-opening loss to Ohio State. Manning, in his debut as the full-time starter, completed 17 of 30 passes for 170 yards with one touchdown and one interception, calling his play "not good enough." Head coach Steve Sarkisian defended his young quarterback, stating that external expectations were "out of control" and urged patience.

          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships suggests that building long-term cooperation is more effective than demanding immediate obedience. The key is creating emotional safety, where children feel respected, heard, and connected. The article outlines six "magic phrases," such as "I believe you" and "Let's figure this out together," which help calm a child's nervous system and shift the dynamic from conflict to collaboration. Using this approach validates a child's feelings and makes them more receptive to listening, fostering genuine accountability rather than fear-based compliance.</p>

          <p>A Guardian investigation reveals the shocking reality of indoor heat deaths in Arizona, where residents are dying in their homes due to malfunctioning or unaffordable air conditioning. The article profiles several victims, including a 52-year-old man who died just two days after his central air failed, as his family could not afford immediate repairs. These preventable deaths highlight a growing crisis of "energy poverty," where low-income households, particularly the elderly and sick, are unable to afford essential cooling during extreme heatwaves. Experts warn the situation will worsen amid rising energy costs and cuts to social safety nets.</p>

The pet sitter, Rhian Boxall, described the event as a "rollercoaster of emotions," which included having to save one newborn pup that was born outside in the garden. Despite the unexpected drama, 12 of the puppies survived and are healthy, providing a happy, albeit chaotic, conclusion to the family's vacation.</p>

          <p>This personal essay argues that hunting, often viewed with disdain by those on the political left, can be a more honest and sustainable way to consume meat than relying on factory-farmed products. The author, a self-described liberal, recounts her journey into hunting and the profound connection she feels to the animals and ecosystems involved. She contends that responsible hunting is a vital conservation tool, funded by taxes on firearms and licenses, which helps manage wildlife populations and preserve habitats. The article challenges preconceived notions by aligning the values of conservation-minded hunters with those who care deeply about ethical food systems and animal welfare.</p>
