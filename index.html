          <p>Following a contentious Senate hearing where Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faced bipartisan criticism for his views on vaccines, Donald Trump has publicly defended the importance and effectiveness of certain vaccines. This break from his appointee is viewed as an effort to protect the legacy of "Operation Warp Speed," a key achievement of his presidency. Kennedy's performance at the hearing, where he appeared unprepared, has led to calls for his resignation from his own family and Democratic senators.</p>

          <p>Thailand's Supreme Court has ruled that former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra must serve a one-year prison sentence, determining that his previous six-month stay in a hospital did not legally count as time served. The decision relates to a commuted sentence for corruption convictions following his return from self-imposed exile in 2023. The court found his hospital transfer was unlawful as he was not in a critical condition, addressing public criticism that the influential figure received preferential treatment.</p>

          <p>The long-running succession battle within the Murdoch family's media empire has concluded with an agreement that solidifies Lachlan Murdoch's control over Fox Corp and News Corp. The deal ensures the conservative direction of outlets like Fox News and The Wall Street Journal will continue after Rupert Murdoch's death. His other children, James, Elisabeth, and Prudence, will cease to be beneficiaries of the trust holding company shares, instead receiving cash from the sale of their holdings, effectively ending their influence over the conglomerate.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has announced an enhanced immigration enforcement action in Chicago, dubbed "Operation Midway Blitz," targeting individuals with criminal records. Chicago's Mayor Brandon Johnson stated the city received no prior notice and opposes such operations due to concerns about due process and potential human rights violations. The move has drawn sharp criticism from Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who accused the Trump administration of focusing on political scare tactics rather than genuine public safety coordination.</p>

          <p>This article examines why large orders for Boeing aircraft frequently feature in bilateral trade deals negotiated by the Trump administration. Experts suggest that high-value, high-profile airplane purchases serve as a visible symbol for the president and allow partner countries to show they are addressing trade surpluses with the U.S. without impacting sensitive domestic industries. Additionally, with a growing global demand for air travel and long production backlogs, these deals are often pragmatic for airlines, despite ongoing safety concerns surrounding the manufacturer.
