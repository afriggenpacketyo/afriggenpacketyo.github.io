          <p>House Democrats are engaged in a behind-the-scenes race to fill the ranking member position on the House Oversight Committee following the death of Representative Gerry Connolly. Four Democratsâ€”Stephen Lynch, Jasmine Crockett, Robert Garcia, and Kweisi Mfumeâ€”are competing for the influential role. The ranking member will face Republicans in upcoming hearings on immigration, LGBTQ rights, and President Trump's mental state. The candidates are focusing on their communication skills, ability to support lawmakers in battleground districts, and strategies to challenge President Trump's administration, as the vote is scheduled for June 24 and will be conducted by secret ballot.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stated that Japan aims to make progress in tariff negotiations with the United States but will not rush into a deal that compromises national interests. These remarks precede a potential meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump at the G7 summit in Canada. Japan's negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, is set to continue talks with the U.S., emphasizing the need for a mutually beneficial agreement. The imposition of higher U.S. tariffs on imported goods has raised concerns about the impact on Japan's export-driven economy, which also faces a reciprocal tariff rate of 24 percent.</p>

Genge echoed this sentiment, highlighting the importance of fast learning both on and off the pitch.

          <p>A judge raised concerns about potential collusion between ticketing companies and ticket touts following a fraud conviction against prolific tout Peter Hunter. The judge suggested some ticketing sites may have been complicit in touts making substantial profits by reselling tickets at inflated prices. Former staff at Ticketmaster-owned resale sites revealed close relationships with touts, including financial incentives for high-volume sales. Email evidence suggested one tout was offered a meeting with a top Ticketmaster lawyer to explore ways the company could assist them, leading to allegations of inside help with buying and selling tickets.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has ceased loudspeaker broadcasts of anti-North Korea propaganda along the inter-Korean border, signaling a move to ease tensions between the two nations. President Lee Jae-myung ordered the halt as part of efforts to restore trust and promote peace on the Korean Peninsula. This decision follows the resumption of broadcasts last year in response to North Korea's trash-laden balloons sent toward the South. While South Korea has called for civilian activists to stop sending propaganda leaflets across the border, prospects for renewed dialogue between the Koreas remain uncertain due to ongoing nuclear threats and North Korea's alignment with Russia.</p>

          <p>The UK Aids Memorial Quilt, a collection of 42 quilts and 23 textile panels representing nearly 400 people who died from HIV/Aids, is on display at the Tate Modern. Created in 1994, the quilt serves as a tribute to those who lost their lives and a reminder of the impact of the epidemic. Individuals like Frankie O'Reilly, who lost his partner Georgie Long to an Aids-related illness, participated in creating the quilt as a way to cope with grief. The exhibition, initiated by author Charlie Porter, aims to provide an opportunity for remembrance and grieving, especially for those who experienced loss during the 1980s and 1990s due to the stigma surrounding HIV.</p>

          <p>China is striving to build its domestic AI chip ecosystem in response to U.S. restrictions on advanced semiconductor imports. Despite significant investment, China faces challenges across the entire semiconductor value chain, from design and manufacturing equipment to memory chips. Huawei's HiSilicon is making progress with its Ascend series GPUs, but still lags behind Nvidia's offerings. SMIC, China's largest chip foundry, is behind TSMC in manufacturing capabilities, and access to advanced chipmaking equipment from ASML is limited by export controls, requiring China to pursue alternative technologies and lithography techniques.</p>

Lord Brittan was falsely accused by Carl Beech, who was later jailed for perverting the course of justice and child sexual offences.

The missiles, deployed in the 1960s, could strike China and parts of the Soviet Union.

          <p>Despite promises to break the cycle of political retaliation, South Korea's newly elected President Lee Jae-myung is facing criticism for launching investigations into his predecessor, Yoon Suk Yeol, and his wife. Each of the previous six South Korean presidents has faced criminal investigations during or after leaving office. Lee's actions have raised concerns about the concentration of power in his hands and the potential for him to use it for personal gain. Critics fear that this will perpetuate confrontational politics and undermine efforts to reconcile political differences.</p>

          <p>Japan has strongly urged China to prevent a recurrence of a near miss between a Chinese military aircraft and a Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force patrol plane over international waters in the Pacific. Japan conveyed its serious concern to China, emphasizing that the incident could have led to a collision. The Chinese J-15 warplane flew as close as 45 meters to the MSDF P-3C patrol plane, and Japan has been on alert for increased Chinese military activity, including simultaneous operations by China's aircraft carriers in the Pacific.</p>

          <p>The U.S. is partially evacuating its embassy in Baghdad, removing non-essential staff and their families due to heightened security risks stemming from tensions with Iran. Officials cited concerns that Israel was prepared to launch an operation into Iran, potentially leading to retaliation against U.S. sites in Iraq. This action comes as U.S. talks regarding Iran's nuclear program have stalled, despite ongoing efforts to negotiate a deal. The State Department is constantly assessing personnel posture at embassies, and Trump reiterated that the U.S. will not allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon.</p>
