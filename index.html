          <p>Residents in Portland's South Waterfront neighborhood are experiencing a nightly "war zone" due to persistent clashes between federal agents and immigration protesters, with tear gas affecting local homes and prompting some to sleep with gas masks. President Trump's controversial threat to deploy the National Guard was temporarily blocked by a federal judge, who ruled it exceeded constitutional authority. The community remains deeply divided, with some blaming Antifa and others, including Mayor Keith Willis, accusing federal agents of escalating the situation. This continuous unrest has forced a local school to relocate and underscores the profound impact on daily life, with even a Portland native supporting federal intervention despite disagreeing with Trump's policies.</p>

          <p>VoteVets, a liberal organization supporting veteran candidates, is investing $1 million into aggressive ad campaigns for Democratic gubernatorial nominees in Virginia and New Jersey. The ads, featuring armed services veterans, directly criticize Republican opponents Jack Ciattarelli and Winsome Earle-Sears, alleging their policies would worsen economic difficulties for residents. Both Democratic candidates, Rep. Mikie Sherrill and Rep. Abigail Spanberger, are veterans, with Sherrill being a former Navy pilot and Spanberger a former CIA operations officer. These closely watched elections, held a year after the presidential race, often serve as referenda on the current administration and have recently seen heated controversies and legal challenges.</p>

          <p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced that President Trump authorized using Section 232 tariff revenue to keep the WIC nutrition program operational during the government shutdown. Leavitt attributed the program's potential lapse to Democrats, accusing them of "cruelly voting to shut down the government" and forcing WIC to exhaust its funds. This "creative solution," developed by the Office of Management and Budget, aims to prevent low-income mothers and children from going hungry. While the exact duration of the tariff funds' impact is undisclosed, this temporary fix underscores the ongoing political deadlock over federal spending.</p>

          <p>Members of the Texas National Guard have arrived in Illinois, preparing for assignments to protect U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and facilities, primarily in Chicago. This deployment, ordered by President Trump, faces strong opposition from Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who criticize it as federal overreach and question the Guard's policing authority. Local officials were largely uninformed about the deployment, leading to a lawsuit filed by Illinois and Chicago to block the move. A federal judge has scheduled a hearing to rule on the request, underscoring significant federal-state tensions and concerns about public safety from out-of-state troops.</p>

          <p>Sky-watchers worldwide were treated to a dazzling supermoon this week, appearing notably brighter and larger in the evening sky. This celestial event occurs when the moon reaches its perigee, its closest point to Earth in orbit, making it appear more prominent. Known as the Hunter's Moon, it marks the first full moon of October, a name rooted in historical preparations for winter in the Northern Hemisphere, when people would hunt and preserve meats. The phenomenon offered a beautiful and natural spectacle for observers across various global skylines, providing a moment of shared wonder.</p>

          <p>Matt Van Epps, backed by President Trump, is projected to win a crowded Republican primary for a Tennessee House seat, setting up a December general election against Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn. Van Epps secured the victory following a late endorsement from Trump, which came after in-person early voting concluded, leading some competitors to suspend their campaigns. His campaign highlighted his extensive military experience as a Tennessee Army National Guard lieutenant colonel and Army Special Operations helicopter pilot. This election will be a key test for Trump's second-term agenda and Republican popularity, potentially expanding the GOP's slim House majority.</p>

          <h2>Tesla Debuts New "Affordable" Model Y and 3 Variants in U.S. Market</h2>

          <p>Tesla has launched "affordable" versions of its Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan in the U.S., priced at $39,990 and $36,990 respectively, aiming to attract a wider customer base. CEO Elon Musk had previously suggested a price below $30,000 was key for mass appeal, leading to some disappointment that the new models were only about $5,000 cheaper than higher trims. These new variants offer reduced premium features and slightly lower acceleration but maintain over 300 miles of driving range. Analysts view this as a pricing lever rather than a major product catalyst, crucial amidst rising competition and the loss of a $7,500 U.S. tax credit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer stated that the UK will not relax visa rules for India, ahead of his visit to the country to promote a recently signed trade agreement. Starmer emphasized "massive opportunities" to enhance trade and cultural ties but clarified that immigration policy remains unchanged, with no plans for new visa routes for Indian workers or students. The multi-billion pound trade deal, signed in July, aims to boost bilateral trade by making exports like UK cars and whisky cheaper. This stance aligns with the Labour government's broader efforts to reduce immigration levels, despite calls to attract global talent to grow the UK economy. (not investment advice)</p>

The vigil, organized by an anti-occupation group, called for a ceasefire and hostage release, aligning with Mamdani's stance.

          <p>The Insurrection Act is a U.S. federal law empowering the president to deploy military forces or federalize National Guard troops domestically to quell uprisings, acting as an exception to the Posse Comitatus Act. This centuries-old law has been invoked dozens of times, notably during the Civil Rights Movement and the 1992 Los Angeles riots, but its use has become exceedingly rare since the 1960s. President Trump has repeatedly threatened to use it, particularly for immigration enforcement and controlling protests in Democratic-led cities, raising concerns about military involvement in civilian law enforcement. Courts have historically deferred to presidential military declarations, though some experts argue for judicial review based on factual conditions.</p>

This dramatic decrease is attributed to the Trump administration's sweeping clampdown on illegal immigration, which included sealing the border, closing the asylum system, and deploying thousands of soldiers. While the administration hails this as a success in border security, policies like mass deportations and National Guard deployments to cities like Chicago and Portland have drawn significant backlash and legal challenges from civil rights groups and local Democrats, who denounce them as inhumane and unconstitutional.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is grappling with a Colorado counselor's challenge to the state's ban on "conversion therapy" for minors, arguing it infringes on free speech rights by censoring certain conversations. Kaley Chiles, a Christian counselor, seeks to engage in talk therapy with young patients exploring changes in sexual attractions or gender identity, fearing violation of the 2019 law. Colorado contends the ban regulates professional conduct and protects minors from unsafe, ineffective practices, which major medical associations deem harmful. Justices expressed skepticism over Colorado's interpretation, raising concerns about potential viewpoint discrimination, highlighting the complex intersection of free speech, medical ethics, and LGBTQ+ rights.</p>

Mollick advises leaders to actively use AI themselves, suggesting a $20/month subscription to tools like Claude or GPT for at least 10 hours a week to understand its capabilities.
