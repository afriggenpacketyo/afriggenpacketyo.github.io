        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NHS is appealing for 200,000 new blood donors to alleviate a persistent shortage that has impacted patient treatment. A previous "amber alert" highlighted critically low supplies, particularly of O negative blood, which is universally compatible. The NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) aims to increase regular donors from 800,000 to over one million to ensure a stable supply, with a specific focus on attracting more black donors who are more likely to possess blood types crucial for treating sickle cell disease. While donor registrations increased in 2024, only a quarter proceeded to donate, underscoring the urgency of the appeal to prevent a "red alert" scenario. The importance of blood donations is emphasized by individuals who rely on transfusions, such as a young boy named Isaac, and the NHS is working to simplify the donation process through new donor centers and convenient appointment scheduling.</p>

          <p>Israeli forces seized a British-flagged ship carrying aid to Gaza in international waters, detaining climate activist Greta Thunberg and other protesters. The ship, named the Madleen, departed from Italy a week prior, intending to challenge Israel's blockade of Gaza and deliver symbolic aid. Israeli forces stated they took control of the vessel at sea and plan to return the detainees to their respective countries. Thunberg released a pre-recorded video calling for international pressure to secure their release, while Israel has banned international aid from reaching Gaza for two months amid rising malnutrition, implementing its own system of limited deliveries under armed guard.</p>

          <p>Top trade officials from the United States and China are scheduled to meet in London to address the ongoing trade dispute between the two economic powers. The U.S. delegation includes Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, while China's lead trade negotiator, Vice Premier He Lifeng, will represent Beijing. The talks follow a recent phone call between President Trump and President Xi Jinping aimed at de-escalating trade tensions, and are intended to build upon a temporary agreement reached in Geneva in May, which reduced tariffs for a 90-day period. Both sides have accused each other of violating the Geneva agreement, with the U.S. citing delays in critical mineral exports from China and China criticizing visa restrictions on Chinese students and export restrictions on chips.</p>

The consulate advised its citizens to closely monitor official announcements and media reports, avoid gathering sites and crowded areas, and refrain from going out at night or traveling alone. This advisory comes as approximately 300 California National Guard troops have been deployed in Los Angeles to support federal law enforcement amid escalating clashes between protesters and immigration agents, following President Trump's deployment of 2,000 National Guardsmen to address what he termed "the lawlessness" in California.</p>

The impasse raises the possibility that the Treasury may impose a settlement on the Home Office prior to Wednesday's Spending Review, which sets out departmental spending allocations. Cooper's allies argue that she followed the Treasury's negotiation timetable and that early settlements should not be prioritized, while others suggest she might have received a better deal had she settled earlier. The heads of police bodies have warned that the police service is "broken" due to budget cuts, while Technology Secretary Peter Kyle has said that police need to "do their bit" towards reforming public services.</p>

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is initiating a nationwide effort to arrest illegal immigrants after asylum hearings as they leave courtrooms, targeting those who have been in the United States for less than two years. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) aims to get illegal immigration cases dropped, allowing for expedited removal proceedings and swift deportation without a hearing before an immigration judge. While immigration judges are reportedly cooperating, the initiative is expected to cause controversy, as it may discourage migrants from attending hearings and involves arrests of individuals with no criminal history other than entering the country illegally. Legal analysts hold differing views on the legality and ethical implications of this new strategy.</p>

          <p>China's consumer prices declined for the fourth consecutive month in May, signaling weak domestic consumption despite Beijing's stimulus measures. The consumer price index fell by 0.1% year-on-year, driven by price wars in the auto sector and falling property prices, while deflation in factory-gate prices deepened, falling 3.3% from a year earlier. Despite strong exports, economists emphasize the need for China to rely on domestic demand to combat deflation, with the National Bureau of Statistics calling for more forceful and targeted stimulus measures.

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has announced a collaboration with Nvidia to launch a "Supercharged Sandbox" that will enable financial services firms to safely experiment with artificial intelligence. Starting in October, institutions can utilize Nvidia's accelerated computing and AI Enterprise Software products to explore AI innovations. The initiative aims to address challenges banks face in deploying AI tools due to concerns about privacy and fraud, particularly with large language models that send data overseas. The FCA's new sandbox is designed for firms in the "discovery and experiment phase" with AI, providing access to better data, technical expertise, and regulatory support.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's new travel ban has gone into effect, barring citizens from 12 countries from entering the United States, while also imposing heightened restrictions on people from seven additional nations. The ban applies to citizens from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. The administration argues that these countries do not provide sufficient information on their nationals to assess potential security risks, while critics have condemned the ban as discriminatory. The implementation of the travel ban coincides with ongoing protests in Los Angeles, where arrests have been made during clashes between protesters and law enforcement.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts suggest that the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) recent surprise rate cut may weaken the rupee by pressuring foreign exchange forward premiums. The rupee has already underperformed its Asian peers due to weak capital flows, and a narrowing interest rate differential with the U.S. Federal Reserve could further diminish its appeal. A drop in dollar/rupee forward premiums reduces the attractiveness of carry trades and exporter hedging incentives, while increasing the likelihood of importer hedging, potentially leading to sharper rupee depreciation. The RBI's larger-than-expected 50 basis point rate cut and reduction in the cash reserve ratio aim to support growth amid benign inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's exports to the U.S. experienced a sharp decline in May, dropping by 34.5% year-on-year, marking the steepest drop since February 2020, as overall export growth missed expectations. The decline is attributed to the impact of tariffs imposed by the U.S., while imports from the U.S. also fell by over 18%, leading to a contraction in China's trade surplus with America. Despite the overall slowdown, exports to Southeast Asian countries, the European Union, and Africa saw increases, while China's total trade surplus increased by 25% year-on-year. The drop in exports of rare earths suggests Beijing is tightening export controls amid trade negotiations with the Trump administration. (not investment advice)</p>

The proposal comes as the UN Ocean Conference begins in France, with Sir David Attenborough warning about the destructive nature of bottom trawling. The extension would cover 41 of the UK's 178 Marine Protected Areas, aiming to protect rare marine animals and the seabed, and is subject to a 12-week industry consultation.</p>
