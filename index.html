        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An art exhibit by Amy Sherald, known for her portrait of Michelle Obama, was canceled at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery. The cancellation followed pressure from Vice President JD Vance, who argued the exhibit's depiction of a transgender Statue of Liberty was divisive and violated a presidential executive order against "woke" content. Sherald pulled her work, stating she could not comply with censorship, especially when it targets vulnerable communities during a time of political hostility towards trans individuals. The White House supported the cancellation, calling it a necessary step to cultivate unity.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 18:41:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A worldwide craze for matcha, fueled by social media and a tourism boom in Japan, is causing global supplies to dwindle. The high demand, combined with poor harvests from heatwaves and a shortage of farmers, has led to significant price increases and purchasing limits in shops. Tea masters and distributors are struggling to keep up, with some cafes running through a month's supply in days. The situation may be exacerbated by new U.S. tariffs on Japanese goods, though some in the industry expect the market to stabilize in the coming years.</p>

          <p>The Syrian city of Sweida has been devastated by a recent wave of sectarian violence between Bedouin clans and the Druze minority, resulting in over 1,300 deaths and displacing more than 120,000 people. The conflict, which included summary executions and shelling, has turned the city into a scene of carnage, with hospitals overwhelmed and mass graves being dug for the victims. This violence underscores the instability under Syria's interim government and the deep-seated distrust among minority groups, despite a fragile truce and international diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the situation.</p>

          <p>According to Jeremy Konyndyk, president of Refugees International, the population of Gaza is on the verge of a mass starvation crisis that will be difficult to reverse once it begins. After more than a year of severe food insecurity, a recent near-total blockade on aid has left the population critically vulnerable, with a third of Gazans not eating for days at a time. Konyndyk explains that the current private aid system is dangerously ineffective, and without a massive, professional humanitarian response providing food, clean water, fuel, and medical care, a famine will lead to widespread death from both hunger and disease.</p>

          <p>In the Bokkos area of Nigeria's central Plateau state, gunmen attacked a vehicle returning from a market, killing 14 people, including women and children. The region has been a hotspot for violent conflict between farming and herding communities over land and resources, leading to hundreds of deaths in recent years. This latest attack has intensified calls for increased security in the sparsely governed area.

          <p>For the first time, multiple Christian artists are simultaneously holding spots on the Billboard Hot 100, signaling a significant mainstream crossover for the genre. Experts note that this trend is driven by a style of music they term "Barstool conversion rock," which blends faith-based themes with country music, masculinity, and conservative politics. This success is supported by a multi-million dollar industry that helps megachurches and smaller congregations replicate polished worship experiences. The phenomenon reflects a broader cultural moment where a segment of evangelicals feels their values are gaining prominence in mainstream entertainment.</p>

          <p>The White House has reversed its decision and will release $5.5 billion in congressionally approved education funds to states. The administration had abruptly frozen the money, intended for the 2025-26 school year, claiming it was being used to subsidize a "radical left-wing agenda." The move to withhold funds for programs like teacher training and arts education sparked widespread outrage from educators and bipartisan pushback from Republican lawmakers, including Mitch McConnell. Following the pressure, the Office of Management and Budget completed its review and directed the Department of Education to release the funding.</p>

Both men were central to the 2020 investigation that found top agency officials had violated scientific integrity policies during the "Sharpiegate" hurricane scandal to align with President Trump's incorrect statements. The move fuels speculation of retaliation, coming just before the confirmation hearing for Neil Jacobs, the former NOAA chief implicated in the original scandal, to lead the agency again.

          <p>A Southern California man, Christopher Earl Lloyd, has been arrested on federal fraud charges for allegedly conning women he met on dating apps like Tinder and Hinge out of more than $2 million. Prosecutors claim that between 2021 and 2024, Lloyd posed as a successful investor to romance his victims and convince them to transfer money for bogus investment opportunities. He allegedly used false contracts to appear legitimate but instead spent the funds on personal expenses, including a luxury car. If convicted, he faces a maximum of 20 years in prison for each of the 13 wire fraud counts.</p>

          <p>The direct involvement of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche in interviewing convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell is being described as highly unorthodox and concerning by multiple former federal prosecutors. Experts find it unprecedented for such a high-ranking official to personally conduct an interview with a convicted individual, a role typically handled by the line prosecutors who know the case details intimately. This raises questions about the interview's purpose and credibility, fueling speculation that the move is more about addressing political pressure surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein case than a standard investigative procedure.</p>

          <p>For the first time in Fenway Park's 113-year history, hundreds of concession workers have gone on strike. The Aramark employees, represented by the Local 26 union, are demanding higher wages, better job security, and protections against automation. A key point of contention is the introduction of AI-powered self-service kiosks, which workers fear will eliminate their jobs and diminish the fan experience. The strike began after more than a year of failed contract negotiations and is planned to last through the Boston Red Sox's weekend series against the Los Angeles Dodgers.</p>

          <p>A new executive order from President Trump on homelessness has sparked both outrage and cautious interest. The order uses harsh language, linking homelessness to "vagrancy" and "violent attacks," and calls for enforcing bans on urban camping while promoting civil commitment for individuals with mental illness. However, it also directs federal agencies to make funds available for encampment removal efforts, which some officials see as a potential lifeline for programs like Los Angeles's Inside Safe. Critics worry the order criminalizes homelessness and mental illness, while others note its themes align with some ongoing state and local policy shifts.</p>

          <p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has announced a new grant program offering over $600 million for states to detain undocumented migrants. The funding is intended to relieve overcrowding in federal facilities and increase local detention capacity as the Trump administration pursues mass deportations. This marks a significant shift for FEMA, which previously funded shelter and services for migrants after their release. The move aligns with the administration's call for states to assist in its immigration enforcement goals, as seen with Florida's "Alligator Alcatraz" detention facility.</p>

The move, seen as a last resort by aid officials, comes as children are reportedly dying of starvation at alarming rates.

          <p>An Arizona woman, Christina Chapman, has been sentenced to over eight years in prison for her role in a massive fraud scheme that helped North Korean IT workers steal American identities. Chapman operated a "laptop farm" from her home, allowing the workers to pose as U.S. citizens and secure remote jobs at hundreds of American companies, including Fortune 500 firms. The scheme generated millions of dollars for North Korea's sanctioned regime. Chapman's lawyers claimed she was initially unaware of the illegality but continued in order to pay for her mother's medical care.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he is considering issuing rebate checks to Americans, funded by the revenue collected from his administration's new tariffs. He suggested the rebates could be targeted toward people below a certain income level, though he did not specify a threshold. The administration has collected around $100 billion from the tariffs so far. The proposal was floated as an alternative to using the funds to pay down the national debt, which is projected to increase significantly under the president's recent tax and spending legislation.

          <p>In a satirical piece from The Atlantic, the author writes from a fictionalized perspective of Donald Trump, humorously explaining his presence in the "Epstein files." The narrator portrays himself as a naive figure, constantly preoccupied with understanding tariffs, who is reluctantly dragged to parties and onto planes by Jeffrey Epstein. In this telling, his association is part of a grand, confusing conspiracy orchestrated by a mysterious Barack Obama, with Trump signing lewd drawings he believes are about his love for tariffs. The essay lampoons the political spectacle and conspiracy theories surrounding the Epstein case.</p>
