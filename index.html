          <p>A total lunar eclipse created a stunning celestial event known as a "Blood Moon," which was visible to observers across the globe. This phenomenon occurs when the Moon passes directly into Earth's shadow, causing it to take on a distinct reddish hue. The event provided a captivating spectacle for both amateur and professional astronomers, with many sharing photographs of the impressive display. The visibility of the eclipse's total phase varied depending on geographic location, allowing for a shared international experience.</p>

          <p>England's football manager, Thomas Tuchel, has expressed his intention to integrate long throw-ins and long-ball tactics into the team's strategy for the upcoming World Cup. Despite England's successful qualifying campaign, Tuchel noted that such direct tactics have become more prominent in English football and could be crucial in high-stakes tournament matches. He acknowledged the limited training time available before the event but emphasized that these elements will be discussed and worked on. This tactical consideration marks a potential shift from the team's recent, more possession-based approach.</p>

          <p>A drone launched by Houthi militants from Yemen successfully evaded Israeli air defenses, striking the Ramon International Airport near Eilat. The impact caused damage to the passenger terminal, including shattering windows and lightly injuring one person with shrapnel. The Iran-backed Houthis claimed responsibility for the "qualitative military operation," warning that Israeli airports are unsafe and vowing further attacks. This incident represents a notable escalation in the long-range conflict, as such strikes on significant infrastructure have been rare.</p>

Accompanied by several staff members, his presence was met with a mixed reception from the crowd, receiving both cheers and boos at different moments. The U.S. Tennis Association reportedly asked broadcasters to avoid focusing on potential disruptions related to his visit. This marks a return for Trump, who was a regular fixture at the tournament before his political career.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has cautioned that the U.S. government could be forced to issue massive refunds, potentially up to one trillion dollars, if the Supreme Court rules against the Trump administration's tariffs. The administration has requested an expedited ruling from the court after a federal appeals court found the "reciprocal tariffs" to be an overstep of presidential authority. While expressing confidence in a favorable outcome, officials are also preparing contingency plans, such as using other legal authorities to implement similar levies if the current ones are voided.

          <p>At the Italian Grand Prix, McLaren instructed Oscar Piastri to yield second place to his teammate Lando Norris, sparking controversy but highlighting the team's commitment to its internal "racing principles." Norris, who had been ahead for most of the race, fell behind Piastri due to a slow pit stop caused by a team equipment issue. Citing fairness, team principal Andrea Stella ordered the positions to be reverted, a decision Piastri questioned but ultimately followed. This incident underscores the unique, collaborative culture at McLaren that has so far prevented an acrimonious rivalry between its two title-contending drivers.</p>

          <h2>Thousands Protest in Jerusalem, Demanding Hostage Deal and End to Gaza War</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 13:14:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Over 15,000 demonstrators gathered in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, urging Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to secure a deal for the release of hostages held by Hamas and to end the war in Gaza. The protests, some of the largest in recent months, included family members of the 48 hostages still held, of whom only around 20 are believed to be alive. Speakers directed angry messages at Netanyahu, arguing that intensifying the military offensive in Gaza further endangers the lives of their loved ones. The government, however, maintains that total victory over Hamas is the path to bringing the hostages home.</p>

          <p>UK Defence Secretary John Healey has stated that the government is exploring the use of additional military and non-military sites to accommodate asylum seekers. This initiative is part of Labour's broader plan to move people out of hotels, which have become costly and a source of public tension. Two former military bases are already in use, and officials are now assessing further options to expand this capacity. The move comes as the government faces the ongoing challenge of small boat crossings in the English Channel, with over 30,000 arrivals so far this year.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Rand Paul has strongly criticized Vice President JD Vance for comments supporting the extrajudicial killing of alleged drug traffickers. Vance had posted on social media that killing cartel members is the "highest and best use of our military," following a U.S. strike on a Venezuelan boat. Paul, who chairs the Senate homeland security committee, called Vance's sentiment "despicable and thoughtless," questioning the morality of executing accused individuals without a trial. The exchange highlights a division within the Republican party over the administration's increasingly militaristic approach to combating drug cartels.</p>
