        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court blocked the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan migrants detained in Texas under the Alien Enemies Act, citing insufficient notice for the deportees to challenge their removals. The court's order vacates a lower court's judgment and remands the case, emphasizing the need for adequate notice while acknowledging national security interests. The ACLU had argued that the migrants, classified as members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, were being deported within 24 hours without a realistic opportunity for judicial relief. The court did not address the legality of using the Alien Enemies Act for these deportations, focusing instead on due process concerns.</p>

          <p>A U.N. diplomatic source told Fox News that the United Nations is stalling budget reforms, hoping for a Democratic takeover of the House in the midterm elections to avoid significant changes under President Trump. Internal documents reveal that previous reforms failed due to a lack of collaboration incentives, and proposed reorganizations require a phased approach over 5-10 years, indicating the U.N.'s inability to reform itself quickly. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres admitted that the 2026 budget proposal is already set, suggesting the current cost-cutting efforts are merely to appease the Americans. A U.N. Foundation spokesperson refuted the claim that they proposed linking U.N. budgetary deliberations to the U.S. mid-term elections.</p>

          <p>Congressional Democrats introduced resolutions to block over $3 billion in proposed weapons sales to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, citing concerns about potential conflicts of interest involving President Trump and his family's business dealings. Senator Christopher Murphy questioned the sale to Qatar, pointing to a $400 million luxury Boeing jet offered to Trump as a gift and a $5.5 billion real estate deal involving the Trump family and a firm affiliated with Qatar's sovereign wealth fund. The lawmakers also criticized the Emirates for its role in the war in Sudan, accusing them of supporting a paramilitary group that the State Department determined committed genocide. Democrats are using the Arms Export Control Act to force a Senate debate on the security relationship with the United States.</p>

          <p>Proposed Medicaid cuts are causing anxiety among Americans who rely on the program for healthcare, with concerns that coverage losses could disproportionately affect vulnerable and underserved groups. While some Republicans claim the cuts will only eliminate fraud and waste, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that millions could lose health insurance by 2034. Individuals like Rosa Andresen, a caregiver for her disabled daughter, fear the potential loss of essential services and medications. Jodie Montplaisir, who relies on Medicaid for opioid treatment, worries that work requirements could jeopardize her recovery. Some Republicans are expressing grievances because they don't believe the bill does enough to protect vulnerable Americans.</p>

          <p>Ten inmates escaped from the Orleans Parish Jail in New Orleans, with authorities considering them "armed and dangerous" and suspecting inside assistance. The inmates reportedly removed a sliding jail cell door and breached a wall behind a toilet before scaling down a wall and fleeing across the interstate. One inmate was apprehended using facial recognition technology in the French Quarter, while the others are believed to still be in New Orleans. Police are working with the FBI, U.S. Marshals, and Louisiana State Police to locate the escapees, and have notified some victims of the escapees, several of whom are facing murder charges or other violent charges.</p>

          <p>New Jersey's first statewide transit strike in over 40 years left thousands of commuters stranded as train drivers walked off the job due to a wage dispute. Negotiations between New Jersey Transit and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen broke down, leading to picketing at stations. Governor Philip Murphy apologized to commuters and blamed union leaders, while the union argued that their members have not had a pay raise in six years and are seeking fair treatment. The strike has disrupted travel for approximately 350,000 NJ Transit riders, with limited alternative transportation options available.</p>

The case highlights the debate over the power of a single federal judge to block presidential policies and the potential for a patchwork implementation of laws if nationwide injunctions are limited.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court upheld its block on President Trump's deportations of Venezuelan migrants under the Alien Enemies Act, faulting the administration for inadequate due process. The justices emphasized the need for proper notice and opportunity to contest removals. The court clarified that the administration could pursue deportations under other immigration laws. ACLU lawyers argued that the migrants, accused of gang affiliation, were being deported without a chance to contest the allegations.</p>

          <p>The Illinois House passed legislation requiring more thorough background checks before police officers are hired, prompted by the Sonya Massey killing. The bill mandates law enforcement agencies to inspect prior employment records before making a final job offer. This includes duty-related physical and psychological fitness examinations, work performance records, and criminal or investigative records. The legislation aims to prevent hiring officers with documented misconduct, addressing concerns raised about the hiring of Sean Grayson, who is charged with Massey's murder.</p>

          <p>Boeing may avoid criminal responsibility for its role in the 737 Max crashes. Justice Department officials said they were considering a deal in which Boeing would agree to some concessions, including paying into a victims fund, but walk away without having to plead guilty to any charges. The lawyers described the deal as deeply disappointing and said that they would fight it in court if the department moves ahead with it. The crashes occurred in Indonesia and Ethiopia in 2018 and 2019 and have been blamed on changes Boeing made to flight control software on the 737 Max.</p>
