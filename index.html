          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed the GENIUS Act, a landmark bill to establish a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency, particularly stablecoins. The legislation saw bipartisan support, passing with a 308-122 vote, and now heads to the President's desk. The passage followed significant internal debate among Republicans, who initially stalled the process by attempting to merge it with other bills, including one to ban a central bank digital currency. A final compromise was reached to advance the bill as a standalone measure, marking a significant step in U.S. digital asset regulation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Netflix announced its second-quarter financial results, narrowly beating analyst predictions for both earnings and revenue. The streaming giant reported earnings per share of $7.19, slightly above the LSEG-polled estimate of $7.08. Revenue for the quarter reached $11.08 billion, just ahead of the expected $11.07 billion. These results indicate a period of steady growth for the company, reflecting its performance in a competitive streaming market.

          <p>Shares of Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM), a major producer of high-fructose corn syrup, declined after President Trump announced Coca-Cola had agreed to use real cane sugar in its U.S. products. While ADM's stock fell, Coca-Cola's shares rose nearly 2%. In response, Coca-Cola issued a noncommittal statement, appreciating the President's enthusiasm but not explicitly confirming the switch. The Corn Refiners Association warned the move could cost American jobs and increase reliance on foreign sugar, highlighting the economic tensions between agricultural interests and public health initiatives.

          <p>The White House has announced that President Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, described as a common and benign condition, after he experienced mild swelling in his legs. The president's physician confirmed the diagnosis following a comprehensive examination that ruled out more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis. According to the memo, the condition occurs when leg veins have difficulty sending blood back to the heart and is common in people over 70. The announcement also addressed minor bruising on the president's hand, attributing it to frequent handshaking and aspirin use.</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other executives have settled a multi-billion dollar shareholder lawsuit concerning the company's handling of the Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal. The lawsuit, which sought $8 billion in damages, alleged that executives' actions led to massive fines and legal costs for the company. The settlement was announced just as the trial was beginning, though the final settlement amount has not been disclosed. This resolution ends a significant legal battle stemming from the 2018 revelation that a political consulting firm improperly accessed the data of millions of Facebook users.</p>

          <p>Bipartisan senators are pushing back against comments from Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought, who stated the government appropriations process should be "less bipartisan." Vought's remarks came as Senate Republicans advanced a controversial $9 billion clawback package at President Trump's request. Members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, including Republicans Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins, expressed concern that such a partisan approach disrespects Congress's role and could destabilize the typically cooperative funding process.

          <p>A new survey reveals that 23% of Americans over the age of 50 are postponing their retirement, a significant increase from 14% in the previous year. The primary drivers for this trend are financial uncertainties, including concerns about inflation, a potential recession, and insufficient savings. The findings highlight the economic pressures facing Gen X as they approach traditional retirement age, with many feeling unprepared to stop working. Experts advise that consistent saving is crucial, and note that delaying Social Security claims can result in higher monthly benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal authorities have charged a Los Angeles woman with conspiracy and making false statements after she allegedly faked her own kidnapping by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. Prosecutors claim the woman orchestrated the hoax to elicit public sympathy and financial donations. The incident initially sparked outrage among immigrant rights groups, who held a press conference decrying what they believed was a real abduction. Investigators, however, used cellphone records and surveillance footage to uncover the scheme, which they say exploited existing community fears about federal immigration crackdowns.</p>

          <p>Recent Supreme Court decisions indicate a strong belief among its conservative majority in expansive presidential executive power, particularly over federal agencies. The court has repeatedly sided with the Trump administration, allowing it to proceed with staff layoffs and dismissals at various departments by setting aside lower court orders that had blocked these actions. These rulings, often issued as unexplained brief orders, align with the "unitary executive theory," which posits that the president has full control over the executive branch. Critics argue these decisions enable a "constitutional coup" by concentrating power, while supporters see it as a correct interpretation of presidential authority.</p>

Her dismissal has drawn parallels to her father's firing in 2017, with both events occurring while Trump faced scrutiny over sensitive investigations.

          <h2>Analysis: Recent Israeli Strikes in Syria Signal Broader Strategic Objectives</h2>

          <p>Recent Israeli military strikes in Damascus and southern Syria are seen as part of a larger strategy to maintain a weak and fragmented Syrian state, preventing it from posing a future threat. While Israel officially stated the attacks were to protect the Druze minority during sectarian clashes, analysts suggest the timing also serves to deflect from domestic political pressures. Israel has significantly increased its military actions since the fall of the Assad regime, aiming to carve out an informal buffer zone in southern Syria. This escalation has turned a potential neighbor into a more active adversary, further destabilizing the region.</p>

          <p>Kyiv's mayor, Vitali Klitschko, responded to President Trump's 50-day peace deadline for Russia, stating that Vladimir Putin "only understands the language of force." Klitschko expressed concern that the 50-day period would allow Russia to regroup and continue its attacks on civilians. He emphasized the urgent need for more advanced weapons and tougher sanctions from Western partners to protect Ukrainian cities from constant, massive air assaults. Klitschko highlighted the immense destruction in Kyiv, which he says is intended to spread panic, and asserted that Ukraine will not compromise on its territorial integrity.</p>

          <p>NBCUniversal has agreed to a proposed $3.6 million settlement with Los Angeles County to resolve a lawsuit over its Peacock streaming service. The suit alleged that Peacock violated consumer protection laws by not providing clear disclosures about automatic subscription renewals and by making it difficult for users to cancel. Under the settlement, Peacock must make its renewal and cancellation policies more transparent and provide an easy, immediate cancellation method. The payment includes $2 million in civil penalties and $1.5 million to fund the county's consumer protection enforcement efforts, marking a significant win for consumers.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police in London plans to close half of its station front counters, reducing the number from 37 to 19, in a move to save money amid budget shortfalls. This decision breaks a previous pledge to maintain a 24/7 public-facing desk in each of the city's 32 boroughs. The Met stated that with a shrinking size and budget, keeping all counters open is no longer sustainable, and noted that only 5% of crimes are reported at these locations. The move comes as the force struggles to rebuild public trust and faces pressure to tackle rising crime with limited resources.</p>

          <p>A TikTok trend known as "princess treatment," where women expect their male partners to cater to their every need, is fueling a wider conversation about relationship expectations. While some see it as a fun test, others promote a high-maintenance approach where men are expected to handle everything from ordering food to paying for gas. The article suggests this trend may be a reactionary response to the poor treatment many women have experienced, but also notes it promotes a passive, regressive role for women. Critics argue it fosters a transactional and self-focused view of dating rather than one based on mutual connection.</p>

          <p>This article examines the feasibility of debt consolidation for individuals whose primary income is from Social Security. While it is possible to consolidate debt, qualifying for traditional loans can be challenging due to fixed incomes and potentially high debt-to-income ratios. The article outlines several alternatives, including home equity loans, debt management plans from credit counseling agencies, and direct negotiation with creditors for hardship programs. For those with overwhelming debt, debt settlement or even bankruptcy are presented as potential, albeit more drastic, options for achieving financial relief. (not investment advice)</p>

Speaking at a conference, Noem said she is questioning the current 3.4-ounce limit and that an announcement on new sizes could be forthcoming. This follows the recent immediate removal of the requirement for passengers to take off their shoes during security screening. The potential change is linked to the deployment of new CT scanning technology at airports, which provides more detailed 3-D images of bag contents.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has threatened to redraw his state's 52 congressional districts in a bid to counter a Republican plan to gerrymander districts in Texas. The controversial proposal is seen as a longshot, as California law gives redistricting power to an independent commission, a system voters approved to prevent partisan gerrymandering. Newsom argues that Democrats must play hardball against Republican tactics that defy democratic norms, but the move has been criticized by good-government groups and some Democrats as undermining the very principles they claim to defend. The threat sets up a high-stakes political showdown.</p>

          <p>The UK's Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued a warning that shop-bought slushie drinks are unsafe for children under the age of seven due to the chemical glycerol. The agency also advises limiting consumption for children aged seven to ten. Glycerol is used as a sugar substitute to create the "slush" effect, but consuming it in large quantities can lead to side effects in children, including headaches, sickness, and in serious cases, shock. The updated guidance calls for written warnings at the point of sale and recommends against free refills for young children.</p>
