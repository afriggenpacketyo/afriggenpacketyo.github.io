          <p>The meticulous five-year, £80m restoration of London's iconic Elizabeth Tower, widely known as Big Ben, has earned a nomination for the Royal Institute of British Architects' Stirling Prize. This prestigious award, typically honoring new constructions, acknowledges the project's exceptional design vision, innovation, and originality, marking it as a "veritable masterclass in conservation and craftsmanship." Despite going over its original budget, the refurbishment included crucial repairs to the clock mechanism, a return to Victorian blue and gold on the clock faces, and accessibility enhancements like a new lift. The nomination celebrates the project's significant contribution to architecture and the built environment, showcasing how historic preservation can enrich society.</p>

          <p>A recent New York Times report alleges that advisors to President Donald Trump have discussed offering New York City Mayor Eric Adams a position in the Trump administration, aiming to undercut mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani and potentially boost former Governor Andrew Cuomo's chances. The White House has not commented on the report, and Adams' campaign explicitly denied any discussions with Trump regarding the mayoral race. This alleged political strategy underscores the high stakes and complex maneuvering in New York City politics, with Trump previously vocalizing strong opposition to Mamdani. The situation remains unclear regarding specific positions or Adams' potential inclination to accept such an offer, emphasizing the speculative nature of these political discussions.</p>

          <p>Over 4,000 miles from the front lines, the Russian city of Vladivostok in the Far East visibly bears the profound consequences of the war in Ukraine. The article highlights the presence of fresh graves for soldiers killed in the conflict and features Para ice hockey players, many of whom are veterans like Dmitry Afanasyev, who lost a leg in combat. Local residents express a deep weariness with the prolonged conflict and a strong desire for its swift conclusion, with some feeling detached from its origins yet impacted by its global repercussions. This distant perspective offers a unique insight into the varied public sentiment and the pervasive reach of the war across Russia's vast territory.</p>

          <p>Parents across the UK are highlighting a critical failure in children's continence services, asserting that a lack of dedicated support is causing severe health issues for constipated children. One mother recounted her son Ivan's constant pain and hospitalizations, with doctors estimating 2kg of his body weight was stool, emphasizing the life-threatening nature of untreated severe constipation.

          <p>Four former Milwaukee hotel workers, implicated in the suffocating death of D'Vontaye Mitchell in June 2024, were sentenced to probation and time served, effectively sparing them additional jail time. The case, which tragically echoed comparisons to the 2020 police killing of George Floyd, involved the workers pinning Mitchell face down for an extended period. Mitchell's death was ruled a homicide due to suffocation combined with the toxic effects of cocaine and methamphetamine. While two pleaded guilty to felony murder and two to misdemeanor battery, the outcome has reignited discussions on accountability and justice for such incidents. Mitchell's family attorney emphasized the sobering reminder of the need for systemic change.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced the termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 268,000 Venezuelan migrants, urging them to self-deport from the U.S. This move, which will cause their legal status and work permits to lapse within 60 days, is presented as part of a broader policy to revoke humanitarian protections for migrants from countries facing turmoil. Homeland Security officials stated that maintaining or expanding TPS for Venezuelans undermines efforts to secure the southern border by creating a "magnet effect" for irregular migration. Affected individuals who lack alternative legal means to remain in the U.S. could face arrest and deportation, signaling a significant shift in the administration's immigration stance.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that American sentiment towards the U.S. economy remains largely negative, with most respondents characterizing its state as "uncertain" and "struggling." Economic ratings have slightly declined over the last month, despite a minor uptick in July. A significant two-thirds of Americans report that prices are still increasing and expect this trend to continue, directly linking these perceptions to their personal financial well-being. The poll also highlights partisan divides in economic outlook, though no group foresees falling prices. Overall, a majority anticipate the economy worsening, with about a quarter still expecting a recession, reflecting persistent concerns among the populace. (not investment advice)</p>

University of Utah scientists are mapping mysterious groundwater-fed oases hidden beneath the exposed lakebed, identified by reed-covered mounds and unusual surface disturbances. These formations suggest a vast subsurface plumbing system that delivers fresh water under pressure, a phenomenon previously unconfirmed. Researchers believe understanding these hidden freshwater reserves could be vital for restoring the lakebed's fragile crusts, reducing dust pollution, and uncovering long-buried secrets of the region’s hydrology.

Democrats have largely criticized this move as a partisan attempt to rewrite the narrative and exonerate Donald Trump, especially following his issuance of pardons to many involved in the attack. The subcommittee's final report is expected by December 2026, indicating a prolonged effort to re-examine the events surrounding that day.</p>

          <p>Israeli forces are intensifying their attacks on the outskirts of Gaza City, with residents reporting over 30 Palestinians, including women and children, killed in recent strikes, as the military ramps up preparations for a ground offensive.

Many are unable to comply with Israeli instructions to move south due to prohibitive costs and the absence of safe, uncrowded areas. Meanwhile, Israeli protesters are demanding an immediate deal to end the war and secure the release of all remaining hostages, highlighting the profound human cost and complex pressures on all sides of the conflict.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled illegal the Trump administration's freeze of $2.2 billion in grant funds for Harvard University, concluding it was retaliatory and violated the university's First Amendment rights. The administration had imposed the freeze after Harvard rejected demands related to diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and screening international students for ideological biases, including antisemitism. While the judge acknowledged Harvard should have done more to address antisemitism, she stated that fighting it was not the government's "true aim," suggesting an ideologically motivated assault on universities. This decision safeguards critical research projects and academic freedom.</p>

However, the company's stock dropped 4% in extended trading after it issued disappointing revenue guidance for the fiscal third quarter and maintained its full-year revenue outlook, implying slower growth than anticipated. Salesforce has struggled to gain investor confidence in the AI boom, unlike many tech peers, and its stock is down significantly year-to-date. The company aims to counter pressure with its Agentforce AI software and recently announced an $8 billion acquisition of Informatica. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China demonstrated its escalating military power in a Beijing parade, revealing a new array of nuclear missiles for the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), many designed to reach the United States. Among the significant debuts was the Jing Lei-1 (JL-1), China’s inaugural air-launched ballistic missile (ALBM), which, when launched from an H-6 bomber, effectively completes Beijing's nuclear triad—a three-pronged system for delivering nuclear weapons. The parade also featured the JL-3, a third-generation intercontinental-range submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) with an impressive operational range exceeding 10,000km. This comprehensive display emphasizes China's enhanced deterrence capabilities and its assertive stance in global military strategy.</p>

The charges relate to organizing public gatherings and managing Zoom meetings in London, Manchester, and Cardiff over the summer, as well as a planned demonstration. The Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command led the investigation, emphasizing the "potentially serious consequences" for those supporting a banned group. Campaign groups criticize the arrests as an infringement on free speech, while Palestine Action plans to challenge the ban in High Court, arguing it stifles legitimate protest.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's reaction to China's recent military parade and the broader implications of his "America first" trade policies. It suggests that Trump's tariff-heavy approach may be inadvertently fostering new international alignments, as seen in a summit between China, Russia, and India. Critics argue that his trade actions are "all risk and no reward," potentially creating diplomatic costs without guaranteed economic benefits. Furthermore, Trump's trade regime faces legal challenges in U.S. courts, raising questions about the sustainability and constitutional basis of his unilateral policy decisions, highlighting the complex geopolitical and domestic ramifications.</p>

The strike has raised concerns about unilateral U.S. military action and "gunboat diplomacy," particularly in Mexico, where Trump has designated cartels as terrorist organizations.

House Speaker Mike Johnson blamed Democrats for the impasse, while Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer urged bipartisan cooperation, placing the onus on Republicans. The most likely path involves short-term funding bills, or continuing resolutions, but even these face hurdles due to Republican conference divisions and Democratic demands to reverse Medicaid cuts from Trump's recent policy package.

The use of lethal force against non-state actors in international waters without an immediate threat to life is particularly contentious.
