          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that the U.S. and Japan will equally share profits from American-based projects funded by a $550 billion Japanese investment until the initial amount is recouped. This investment is part of a broader trade deal that sets a 15% baseline tariff on Japanese goods. After Japan recovers its investment, the profit-sharing model will shift to 90% for the U.S. and 10% for Japan. The funds are intended to bolster U.S. domestic manufacturing in critical sectors like nuclear power and antibiotics, with an investment committee selecting the projects for funding.

          <p>Shares of Opendoor, a technology-based real estate company, closed 78% higher after naming Shopify executive Kaz Nejatian as its new CEO and co-founder Keith Rabois as chairman. This leadership change follows the resignation of former CEO Carrie Wheeler amid pressure from investors. The company, which had been trading below $1 earlier this year and faced delisting, has seen its stock rise over 500% year-to-date. The new leadership aims to revitalize the company by returning to its "founder mode" and leveraging artificial intelligence to simplify the home buying and selling process.

          <p>Oracle's stock fell 6% after a record-setting rally, driven by investor concerns that its projected massive growth is overwhelmingly dependent on a single client, OpenAI. The software company's stock had soared after it announced multi-billion-dollar contracts and forecasted a 14-fold increase in cloud infrastructure revenue by 2030. However, enthusiasm cooled following a report that a $300 billion, five-year deal with OpenAI constitutes the bulk of this new business. Analysts now express caution, suggesting the company's backlog is less diversified than initially perceived, tempering the outlook for its shares. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is underway in Germany over the relevance of the country's traditional literary canon in schools, with critics arguing it lacks diversity and fails to engage modern students. Figures like Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's "Faust" are staples, but student representatives and educators are calling for more contemporary works by female and minority authors. This push for reform comes as studies show declining reading comprehension among German youth, despite a resurgence in reading driven by social media trends like #BookTok. Proponents of the classics argue they are essential for understanding history and developing critical thinking skills.</p>

          <p>Gregory Bovino, the former Border Patrol chief who led high-profile immigration raids in Los Angeles, has reportedly arrived in Chicago to oversee a new enforcement effort named "Operation Midway Blitz." The operation is said to target "the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens," according to the Department of Homeland Security. The move has drawn criticism from Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who views it as evidence of the administration's "terrible plans" for the state's communities. Bovino's tough enforcement tactics and public image have made him a notable figure in the Trump administration's immigration policies.</p>

          <p>A majority on a Brazilian Supreme Court panel has found former President Jair Bolsonaro guilty on five counts related to a plot to overturn his 2022 election loss. The conviction, which could lead to a prison sentence of several decades, stems from accusations that he led a criminal organization and incited the January 8th riots by his supporters. The trial has deeply divided Brazilian society and has drawn attention from the U.S., with observers noting potential diplomatic strain following the verdict. Bolsonaro, who is currently under house arrest, maintains his innocence and his lawyers plan to appeal to the full 11-justice court.</p>

While European leaders strongly condemned the incursion, the initial response from U.S. President Donald Trump was seen as muted, fueling doubts about the unconditional nature of the Article 5 security guarantee. Analysts suggest the drone incident was a deliberate test by Russia to probe NATO's resolve and deepen divisions within the alliance.

          <p>Senate Republicans are expected to change chamber rules to expedite the confirmation of President Trump's sub-cabinet level nominees, a move Democrats have labeled the "nuclear option." The proposed change would allow for voting on nominees in groups, bypassing Democratic efforts to slow the confirmation process in protest of the administration's policies. Majority Leader John Thune argues the move is necessary to overcome the current gridlock and allow the president to staff his administration. Democrats warn that forcing the change through a party-line vote will damage the Senate's deliberative nature and lead to future regrets.</p>

          <h2>Report Shows Tariffs Contributing to Rising Consumer Prices for Everyday Goods</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-11 14:52:39 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recently released inflation data indicates that tariffs are increasingly impacting the prices of consumer goods such as apparel, electronics, auto parts, and groceries. The Bureau of Labor Statistics report for August showed price hikes in several tariff-sensitive categories, contributing to broader inflation concerns at a time when the labor market shows signs of weakening. While economists have historically viewed tariffs as a temporary price shock, the persistent increases are creating a "middle-class squeeze" and a complex situation for the Federal Reserve. The data may increase pressure on the Fed to consider interest rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts estimate that millions of Social Security beneficiaries could see a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) of around 2.7% to 2.8% in 2026, based on the latest government inflation data. This would provide a modest increase to monthly checks, with an average retirement benefit potentially rising by about $54. The projection is slightly higher than the 2.5% increase in 2025 but well below the record-high adjustments seen during the peak of recent inflation. The official COLA will be announced in October, but retirees remain concerned that such increases may not keep pace with rising essential expenses like Medicare premiums. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The cost of medical care in the U.S. is rising faster than general inflation, with a 4.2% annualized increase in August, fueling concerns about health spending for the upcoming year. Large employers are projecting an average 9% increase in their health coverage costs for 2026, the largest jump in 15 years, which may be passed on to workers through higher premiums. A significant driver of this inflation is the rising cost of prescription drugs, particularly expensive cancer treatments and popular GLP-1 weight-loss medications. This trend is forcing companies and consumers to explore alternative ways to manage escalating pharmaceutical expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

His remarks were made while signing an agreement to advance the controversial E1 settlement project, which involves building thousands of new homes on land that would effectively sever East Jerusalem from the West Bank. This project has long been opposed by the international community, including Germany, as it is seen as a major obstacle to a two-state solution.

The raid targeted a facility under construction on the Hyundai auto plant campus, a project previously lauded as a major economic development for the state.

          <p>A bill advancing in the California legislature could significantly limit public access to police misconduct records, drawing criticism from press freedom and police accountability advocates. The proposed legislation, AB 1178, would allow law enforcement agencies to shield the records of officers who have worked undercover, received threats, or been assigned to special task forces. Opponents argue this would gut recent transparency laws passed in 2018 and 2021, making it harder to identify officers involved in misconduct. Supporters, including police unions, contend the measures are necessary to protect officer safety and privacy in an era of heightened scrutiny.</p>

Routh, who is representing himself, is charged with plotting to kill the then-presidential candidate while he was golfing at his West Palm Beach club. During opening statements, prosecutors argued that Routh's plot was "carefully crafted and deadly serious." A former Secret Service agent testified that he encountered Routh in the bushes near the golf course with a rifle, describing the scene as a "textbook ambush scenario."
