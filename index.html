MSRA, Microsoft's largest research facility outside the United States, has been a pioneering force in AI, voice, and facial recognition technologies. Cao's move is notable as the Beijing-based lab has been a crucial hub for global AI talent and research. Her new role at Tsinghua places her under the leadership of Zhang Yaqin, a former managing director at MSRA, signaling a significant talent shift.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has determined that Alina Habba, a former personal lawyer for Donald Trump, was not lawfully appointed as the acting U.S. Attorney for New Jersey. The ruling states that Habba has been exercising her duties without legal authority since July 2025, potentially voiding her actions. Judge Matthew Brann's decision came after the Trump administration used a series of complex personnel moves to install her in the position. The administration has announced its intention to appeal the ruling, which is currently stayed.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 20:20:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food, cooled to 3.1% in July, slightly above economists' expectations of 3% but down from 3.3% in June. This moderation is partly due to the easing of rice prices, which had previously surged. The 'core-core' inflation metric, closely watched by the Bank of Japan as it also excludes energy, held steady at 3.4%. These figures come after the central bank recently raised its inflation forecasts, indicating persistent price pressures within the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump visited a U.S. Park Police facility to thank federal law enforcement and National Guard members involved in an anti-crime initiative in Washington, D.C. During the visit, he distributed hamburgers and pizza and praised the officers for their work. The deployment includes approximately 2,000 Guard personnel and a surge of federal agents, a move that has drawn criticism from local officials who argue it is unnecessary and politically motivated. Despite the administration's claims of a crime emergency, local police data shows a decline in violent crime over the past year and a half.</p>

          <p>A Texas farmer, Chad Raines, has successfully transitioned from struggling with cotton farming to a profitable venture in solar grazing. By renting out his flock of sheep to manage vegetation at large-scale solar farms, he has created a stable and lucrative business model. This innovative approach allowed him to turn a potential significant financial loss into a nearly $300,000 profit last year. The trend highlights a sustainable synergy between agriculture and renewable energy, offering a lifeline to small and mid-sized farms facing economic hardship.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, has permitted the Trump administration to proceed with cutting $783 million in research grants from the National Institutes of Health. These cuts are part of a broader push to eliminate federal funding for initiatives related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). While the court lifted an injunction blocking the immediate cuts to existing grants, it kept a block on the administration's anti-DEI guidance for future funding.

          <p>The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts has terminated its entire dance programming team, consisting of three individuals, including the director. This move comes shortly after President Trump appointed himself as the center's Chairman and secured a significant increase in its federal funding. A spokesperson confirmed the firings and stated that an announcement about a 'new direction for Dance programming' would be forthcoming. The decision has raised concerns among some curators and artists about the future artistic direction of the renowned cultural institution under its new leadership.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is escalating its campaign for the removal of Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, who faces unconfirmed allegations of mortgage fraud. After Cook stated she would not be 'bullied' into resigning, a top administration official sent a letter to Fed Chair Jerome Powell urging him to remove her from the board. This action is part of a broader, unprecedented effort by the administration to influence the independent central bank. The Federal Reserve Act does not grant the chair authority to remove another governor.</p>

          <p>President Trump has voiced strong support for the Resolution Copper mine project on sacred Apache land in Arizona, meeting with mining executives and criticizing a court decision that temporarily halted it. A federal appeals court recently paused the transfer of the land, known as Oak Flat, to multinational mining companies Rio Tinto and BHP pending further legal arguments. The San Carlos Apache Tribe, which considers the site sacred, celebrated the reprieve in its long-standing battle to prevent the area from being turned into a massive mining crater.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent commitment to provide 'security guarantees' to Ukraine, a significant shift from his previous isolationist stance, is being undermined by Russia's public rejection of the concept. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has repeatedly stated that the presence of any foreign troops in Ukraine is unacceptable, making the White House's diplomatic efforts appear weak. While European leaders were initially encouraged by Trump's change in tone, Russia's firm opposition casts doubt on the feasibility of any peace deal based on these guarantees, creating a confusing geopolitical situation.</p>

          <p>A New York appellate court has thrown out the massive financial penalty imposed on Donald Trump in his civil fraud trial, deeming the nearly half-billion-dollar award excessive. While the court upheld the finding that Trump is liable for fraud, it concluded the fine was likely unconstitutional. The ruling keeps in place non-monetary penalties, such as a ban on Trump serving as a company director in the state for three years. The New York Attorney General's office plans to appeal the decision on the fine to the state's highest court.</p>

His actions include negotiating with food companies to remove synthetic dyes, challenging CDC recommendations for pediatric COVID-19 vaccines, and initiating a complete overhaul of the nation's dietary guidelines. While some public health experts fear his policies will weaken vaccination systems, he has achieved some surprising successes through direct negotiations with industry rather than formal regulation.
