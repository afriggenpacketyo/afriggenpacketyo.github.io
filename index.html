        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Online real estate company Opendoor Technologies experienced a volatile surge in its stock price, characteristic of a "meme stock" rally driven by retail investors on social media forums like Reddit's WallStreetBets. After its shares tripled in a matter of days, the rally lost momentum, with the stock price falling significantly after its peak. The speculative trading was fueled by a high percentage of short interest and explosive options trading, drawing comparisons to the 2021 GameStop mania. This article details the rapid rise and subsequent decline of the stock, highlighting the speculative nature of such market events. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee condemned a joint statement from nearly 30 Western countries that called for an end to the war in Gaza, arguing it sided with the terror group Hamas. The statement, which Hamas welcomed, expressed concern over the civilian suffering in Gaza. Israeli officials and supporters echoed Huckabee's sentiment, asserting that such international pressure overlooks Hamas's role in instigating the conflict and perpetuating civilian harm by allegedly stealing aid. The article presents the diplomatic clash, contrasting the Western call for a ceasefire with Israeli and U.S. perspectives on the war's necessities.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 16:04:41 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has released a vast collection of previously classified federal documents related to the 1968 assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The files, sourced from agencies like the FBI and CIA, detail the government's investigation into the killing and the preceding years of surveillance on Dr. King. While the release aims for transparency, much of the information confirms long-established facts, such as the FBI's intense and legally questionable monitoring of the civil rights leader. Dr. King's family expressed mixed feelings, supporting accountability while urging the public to view the files with respect for their ongoing grief.</p>

          <p>The French news agency Agence France-Presse (AFP) is urgently calling on Israel to permit its freelance journalists to leave the Gaza Strip, citing a severe and worsening hunger crisis. According to AFP's global news director, the journalists are physically weakened by the lack of food, which severely impedes their ability to report on the conflict. The situation has prompted an alarm from journalists' unions and international bodies like the U.N., who warn that the world risks losing its last independent sources of information from within Gaza. This plea highlights the dire humanitarian conditions faced by media personnel covering the war.</p>

          <p>The executive director of the Mercator Institute for China Studies (Merics), a prominent German think tank, has completed a visit to Beijing four years after the organization was sanctioned by the Chinese government. The visit, which came at the invitation of a leading Chinese think tank, suggests a possible easing of travel restrictions that have prevented Merics researchers from entering China. European officials have repeatedly called for Beijing to lift the sanctions. Merics welcomed the development, expressing hope for renewed engagement and dialogue between European and Chinese researchers in the future.</p>

          <p>Entertainment production in the Los Angeles area saw another quarter of decline, with on-location shoot days falling by 6.2% compared to the same period last year, according to a report from FilmLA. The drop was driven by significant decreases in the production of feature films and commercials. However, the television category was a notable bright spot, with shoot days increasing by 17%, fueled by a surge in TV dramas and reality shows. The overall numbers remain well below the region's five-year average, though a recently expanded state tax credit program aims to attract more productions to California.</p>

          <p>Ozzy Osbourne, the iconic frontman of the pioneering heavy metal band Black Sabbath, has died at the age of 76. Osbourne's distinctive wailing vocals and "prince of darkness" persona helped define the genre and propelled the band to global stardom before his struggles with addiction led to his dismissal. He then forged a highly successful solo career and later found a new generation of fans as the unlikely star of the reality TV show "The Osbournes." This obituary reflects on his tumultuous life, from his working-class Birmingham roots to his legendary rock-and-roll excesses and enduring musical legacy.</p>

The suspect allegedly called 911 from the house after the crime, but the couple's bodies were not discovered by police until a welfare check four days later. This revelation has raised questions about the initial police response to two calls from the address on the day of the murders. The suspect, who has a history of criminal offenses, is now in custody and charged with two counts of murder, with investigators believing the couple was killed after walking in on a burglary.</p>

          <p>Shares of DuPont saw a positive turn after China's market regulator announced it was suspending an antitrust investigation into the company's Chinese operations. The probe, which began in April and focused on DuPont's Tyvek business, was widely seen as a retaliatory measure against U.S. tariff escalations. Although the business in question represents a small fraction of DuPont's total sales, the investigation had created a significant overhang for the stock. The suspension of the probe removes a key uncertainty for the company ahead of its planned business spinoff later this year. (not investment advice)</p>

Maxwell, who is serving a long prison sentence, has a clear incentive to cooperate in exchange for a potential pardon or reduced sentence.

Gyokeres has been a top target for Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta, who is keen to add an elite center-forward to his squad.

This strategy contrasts with Tesla's EV-only focus, which GM claims leaves its competitor more exposed to market volatility, especially as federal tax credits are set to expire.</p>
