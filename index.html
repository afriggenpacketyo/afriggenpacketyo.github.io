            <p>A helicopter crashed into the Hudson River near Jersey City, New Jersey, killing all six people on board, including a family of five from Spain and the pilot. Witnesses reported seeing the helicopter's propeller separating mid-air before the crash, suggesting a possible mechanical failure. The FAA, NTSB, and Coast Guard are investigating the incident, which caused significant disruption to vessel traffic and ferry services in the area. The crash occurred in approximately 50-degree water with overcast skies and wind gusts of up to 21 miles per hour.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration must facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man wrongly deported to El Salvador. The court instructed a lower court to clarify its order, balancing the need to ensure Garcia's rights with deference to the executive branch's foreign affairs powers. Garcia, who has a family in the U.S., was deported despite a withholding order forbidding his removal to El Salvador. The Justice Department acknowledged the deportation was an error but maintains its prerogative in conducting foreign affairs.</p>

            <p>Twelve masked individuals have been charged with felony vandalism and conspiracy to trespass after allegedly breaking into a Stanford University building during an anti-Israel protest. The protesters barricaded themselves inside, vandalized administrative offices, and caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage. The Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office stated that the suspects, ranging in age from 19 to 32, had planned the takeover in advance and used tools to break in and disable security cameras. The incident reflects a broader trend of anti-Israel protests on university campuses demanding divestment from companies doing business with Israel.</p>

            <p>Markets experienced further turmoil after a short-lived rally following Donald Trump's retreat on global tariffs, with investors expressing ongoing uncertainty. The U.S. is imposing 145% tariffs on China, and Beijing appears unwilling to back down. Former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has criticized Trump's economic policies, calling them a 'self-inflicted wound' on the economy. In immigration news, the Supreme Court has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a man wrongly deported to El Salvador.</p>

            <h2>Inflation Rises by 2.4% in March, CPI Report Reveals</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-10 20:16:14 EDT</div>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.4% in March on an annual basis, indicating progress in the Federal Reserve's effort to bring inflation down to 2%. While inflation eased due to lower fuel prices and travel costs, egg prices continued to increase. Experts note that the CPI data is backward-looking and does not fully reflect the impact of Trump's recent tariff policies, which are expected to push inflation higher later in the year. The Federal Reserve is likely to remain cautious in its monetary policy decisions due to ongoing inflationary risks and trade policy uncertainties.</p>

            <p>CBS has lost distribution rights to "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy!" after a court rejected the network's bid to block Sony from taking over. Sony, the producer of the game shows, alleged that CBS entered into unauthorized licensing agreements. While CBS plans to appeal the ruling, Sony is now set to distribute the shows to stations across the U.S. and worldwide. The legal battle highlights the high value and competition surrounding these iconic game show franchises.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has partially upheld a lower court order requiring the Trump administration to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an immigrant wrongly deported to El Salvador. While the Court agreed that the government must facilitate Garcia's release, it questioned the scope of the lower court's order to 'effectuate' his return. The case highlights concerns about the administration's treatment of immigrants and its willingness to defy court orders. The Supreme Court has asked the lower court to clarify its directive.</p>

The former world number one has secured two runners-up finishes, plus 14 others in the top 25, since making his debut in 2003. Rose made a rapid start with three birdies in the opening three holes, continuing to use his putter marvellously to sink three more in a row around the turn.</p>
