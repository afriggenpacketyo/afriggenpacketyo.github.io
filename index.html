          <p>TalkTV host David Bull has been named the new chairman of Reform UK, succeeding Zia Yusuf, who resigned after disagreements over a burka ban. Bull, a longtime ally of Nigel Farage, will focus on providing leadership to activists, while Yusuf will lead the "Doge team" to cut wasteful spending. Farage emphasized that Bull's role is to inspire the party's base and not to get involved in administrative tasks. Bull expressed his honor at being appointed and praised Yusuf's work in professionalizing the party, and has stepped down from his TalkTV role to assume his new position, highlighting his commitment to Reform UK. The appointment signifies a shift towards a more media-focused leadership style within the party.</p>

Harvard is attempting to resist the administration's demands while simultaneously addressing concerns about intellectual diversity on campus.

          <p>Marks and Spencer has resumed taking online orders after halting purchases in April due to a cyber attack, which significantly disrupted its services. Customers can now buy fashion items for home delivery in England, Scotland, and Wales, with beauty and homeware products to follow. Click and collect and delivery services to Northern Ireland will resume in the coming weeks. The cyber attack is estimated to reduce this year's profits by around Â£300m, and some personal customer data was stolen, though payment details and passwords were not compromised.</p>

          <p>President Trump is deploying hundreds of active-duty Marines to Los Angeles, along with additional National Guard troops, in response to protests against ICE immigration raids. California's Governor and Los Angeles Mayor are calling this move an unnecessary escalation, and the governor is planning to sue regarding the deployment of Marines. Meanwhile, U.S. drug-related deaths among young people are declining after a decade of increases, with provisional data from the CDC showing a significant drop in fatal overdoses last year, attributed to better health care and increased caution among young people.</p>

The ruling coalition aims to secure a majority in the upper house and is considering using fiscal 2024 tax revenue to fund the program.

          <p>President Trump has frequently invoked Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act to implement restrictive immigration policies, including travel bans and visa restrictions. This law allows the president to block any foreigner's entry if deemed detrimental to U.S. interests. While previous presidents used this authority sparingly, Trump has employed it aggressively, leading to legal challenges and a Supreme Court affirmation of broad presidential powers in immigration. The policy has been used to justify barring students from attending Harvard, as well as a travel ban on 12 countries and restrictions on seven others.</p>
