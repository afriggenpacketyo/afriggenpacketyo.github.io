        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England defeated West Indies by 238 runs in the first one-day international at Edgbaston, marking a strong start to Harry Brook's captaincy. England posted 400-8, their highest ODI total in three years, with significant contributions from Brook, Ben Duckett, Joe Root, and Jacob Bethell. Saqib Mahmood's impressive bowling performance, taking 3-32, dismantled the West Indies top order, leading to their dismissal for 162 in 26.2 overs. This victory ends England's seven-match losing streak in ODIs and boosts their confidence after a challenging 18 months in white-ball cricket; the series can be sealed with a win in Cardiff. The spectacle was lacking but England was desperate for any sort of victory after a wretched 18 months in white-ball cricket, and the team needed this win. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's global tariff policy encountered a significant challenge as a federal court ruled that he lacks the authority to unilaterally impose certain levies. The Department of Justice has requested a delay in the ruling, arguing it could lead to a "foreign policy disaster scenario" and weaken the president's position in trade negotiations. Separately, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced plans to "aggressively revoke visas" for Chinese students at U.S. universities amidst escalating tensions with Harvard. The legal and political landscape remains tense as the administration navigates these challenges.</p>

          <p>A Harvard graduate student, Fangzhou Jiang, described the atmosphere on campus as "devastating" due to the Trump administration's efforts to restrict international students. A federal judge temporarily blocked the administration's attempts to prevent Harvard from enrolling international students, providing a temporary victory for the university. Tensions further escalated when Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced officials would begin to "aggressively revoke" the visas of some Chinese students. Jiang emphasized the crucial role international students play on campus, and remains optimistic that online learning options could provide a solution if necessary, as the school has committed to protecting international students in whatever capacity.</p>

Markets largely expect the Fed to maintain its current stance on rates until there is greater clarity on tariff uncertainty, though futures market pricing indicates a potential rate cut in September.

While Senate Majority Leader John Thune says he will safeguard the filibuster, Democrats may use the situation as justification for abolishing it when they regain control.

          <p>The White House has criticized a trade court for blocking President Trump's use of emergency powers to impose tariffs, labeling the ruling as "judicial overreach." Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that trade negotiations are continuing with "countries around the world" despite the court's decision. Leavitt asserted that Trump used his "full and proper legal authority" in ordering the tariffs to address the threat posed by large U.S. trade deficits, arguing that the ruling undermines the president's ability to conduct diplomatic and trade negotiations.
