          <p>With food prices rising, many parents are facing increased financial pressure to provide meals for their children during the school summer holidays. This article shares several cost-saving strategies from families, including meticulous planning, creative cooking, and minimizing waste. Key tips include buying reduced "yellow sticker" items, especially meat, to store in the freezer, and organizing daily food portions in separate bags to make supplies last longer. Utilizing local food pantries that offer surplus groceries for a small fee has also proven to be a vital resource for families struggling with the higher cost of living.</p>

          <p>Swarthmore College has issued a statement regarding a lawsuit filed by transgender athlete Evelyn Parts, who alleges the school improperly handled their participation on the women's track team. The lawsuit claims the college first removed Parts following an NCAA rule change prohibiting biological males in women's sports, but later reinstated them despite the new policy. The college's response emphasizes its support for transgender community members during a time of evolving guidance but declined further comment due to the pending litigation. This case is one of several recent legal challenges concerning transgender athletes in U.S. collegiate sports.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has suspended the issuance of temporary medical-humanitarian visas for individuals from Gaza, pending a full review of its procedures. This decision followed an online pressure campaign by far-right activist Laura Loomer, who spread false claims about injured Palestinian children arriving for medical treatment. Humanitarian groups have been facilitating the evacuation of a small number of critically injured children to the U.S. for care not available in the war-torn region. The suspension has been condemned by civil rights organizations as a cruel policy that puts the lives of vulnerable children at further risk.</p>

          <p>In response to limited space, the historic Hollywood Forever Cemetery has introduced a new five-story vertical mausoleum, adding a modern architectural feature to the iconic Los Angeles landmark. The Gower Mausoleum provides final resting places for approximately 13,000 people and has already sold out two of its five floors since opening in January. The design emphasizes natural light and offers views of the city, aiming to create a peaceful environment for visitors. This development is part of the cemetery's broader strategy to integrate community life with its traditional purpose, hosting events like festivals and movie nights.</p>

          <p>The accessories chain Claire's, once a staple for tweens and teenagers, has appointed administrators in the UK and Ireland as it struggles with declining sales and intense competition. For decades, the brand was a go-to destination for affordable jewelry, ear piercings, and novelty items, representing a rite of passage for many young shoppers. However, the rise of online fast-fashion giants like Shein and Temu, which can replicate trends at lower prices and faster speeds, has eroded its market position. Analysts suggest that today's youth are influenced by older social media creators and are turning to different brands, making it difficult for Claire's to maintain its former cultural relevance.</p>

After being attended to on the field, Johnston was able to stand and walk under his own power before being transported for further evaluation. He is expected to be a key component of the Chargers' offense this season.</p>

These experiences, which would be considered shocking today, include teachers openly bullying students, the common presence of firearms in student vehicles for hunting, and designated smoking areas on school property. Other recounted issues involve corporal punishment, lax supervision on field trips, and gender-discriminatory dress codes and class requirements, illustrating a significant cultural shift in educational standards and student safety over the years.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing signs of an early autumn, such as leaves changing color and fruit ripening prematurely, as a result of a prolonged hot and dry summer. Experts attribute these phenomena not to a seasonal shift but to environmental stress on plants and trees caused by record-breaking heat and drought conditions. While some crops have thrived, the unusual weather has created challenges for farmers and ecosystems, potentially impacting wildlife that relies on the normal timing of seasonal cycles for food. Conservationists warn that this disruption could have negative consequences for various species heading into the winter.</p>

          <p>Air Canada suspended all its flights after 10,000 flight attendants went on strike Saturday, causing widespread travel disruptions during the peak summer season. The strike began after contract negotiations with the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) stalled over key issues, including wages and unpaid work hours. In response to the shutdown, the Canadian federal government swiftly intervened, ordering both the airline and the union into binding arbitration to force a resolution and resume operations. The union criticized the government's move, arguing it undermines their right to negotiate a fair contract freely.</p>

The exercise, organized by a teacher to instill motivation during a disruptive period, served as a poignant reminder of their personal growth and the unique challenges their cohort faced.

          <p>Samsung is narrowing the gap with Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, increasing its share from 23% to 31% in the second quarter while Apple's declined from 56% to 49%. This shift is partly attributed to the growing momentum of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, like the Z Fold 7, which offer new form factors beyond the traditional smartphone slate. While Apple still leads, Samsung's wider range of price points and its willingness to experiment with new designs are creating renewed competition, with analysts anticipating Apple may release its own foldable device by 2026 to counter the trend.

          <h2>Commentary Argues for Strengthening the Marine Mammal Protection Act Amid New Threats</h2>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 is under threat from the Trump administration and corporate interests who seek to weaken its regulations. While the act has been successful in helping some species recover, many marine mammals still face significant dangers from ship strikes, fishing gear entanglement, pollution, and climate change. The author contends that scaling back protections would be a grave mistake, as declining marine mammal populations are an indicator of broader ocean health issues that ultimately affect human well-being. The article calls for maintaining strong protections to address both old and new environmental challenges.</p>

          <p>Dutch midfielder Tijjani Reijnders made a sensational Premier League debut for Manchester City, contributing a goal and an assist in a dominant 4-0 victory over Wolves. The 27-year-old, signed from AC Milan, delivered an all-action performance that earned praise from manager Pep Guardiola, who called him a "top signing for the coming years." Reijnders' energy and creativity in the midfield suggest he will be a key player for City as they look to rebound from a disappointing previous season. His immediate impact provides a new hero for fans following the departure of club legend Kevin de Bruyne.</p>

          <p>Greg Iles, the best-selling author known for his Southern gothic crime novels, including the acclaimed "Natchez Burning" trilogy, has died at the age of 65. His death was announced by his literary agent, who confirmed Iles passed away after a long battle with multiple myeloma, a blood cancer. Born in Germany but raised in Natchez, Mississippi, Iles developed a deep connection to the region, which served as the setting for many of his suspenseful stories exploring themes of race and class. He was also known for performing with the Rock Bottom Remainders, a musical group composed of fellow popular authors like Stephen King.</p>

          <p>A cross-party group of 96 British MPs has sent a letter to the government, urging the immediate evacuation of sick and injured children from Gaza to the UK for medical treatment. The letter highlights the collapse of Gaza's healthcare system and warns that many children are at risk of imminent death. The MPs are calling for a clear timeline for evacuations, adequate funding, and for the process to be based solely on clinical need. They also question the practicality of the government's biometric visa requirements and suggest that families should have the option to seek asylum in the UK after treatment.</p>

          <p>Following his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump has altered his approach to the war in Ukraine, now advocating for a direct peace agreement rather than a preliminary ceasefire. He stated that ceasefires often fail to hold and announced he will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday to discuss a potential deal. This represents a significant policy shift, as a rapid ceasefire was previously his stated goal. Reports suggest the proposed deal may involve Ukraine ceding territory in the Donbas region in exchange for Russia freezing other frontlines.</p>

          <p>After a brief period of cooler, more humid weather that aided firefighting efforts, Southern California is expecting a return to hot and dry conditions, increasing the risk of wildfires. The National Weather Service forecasts another week of high temperatures starting Monday, with some inland areas potentially exceeding 100 degrees by Thursday. This follows a recent heatwave that fueled several large blazes, including the 132,000-acre Gifford fire. While crews have made significant progress containing existing fires, the upcoming weather pattern creates favorable conditions for new ignitions and rapid fire growth.</p>

          <p>Six senior Senate Democrats have sent an open letter to President Donald Trump, urging him to reverse a decision allowing Nvidia and AMD to sell advanced AI semiconductor chips to China. The deal requires the companies to pay the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from these sales in exchange for export licenses. The senators argue that this arrangement recklessly trades away a key American technological advantage for a commission, potentially strengthening China's military capabilities. The White House dismissed these concerns, while Nvidia stated the specific chips in question would not enhance military power.</p>

          <p>After his summit with Vladimir Putin, reports suggest Donald Trump's peace proposal for Ukraine involves Kyiv ceding the unoccupied parts of its Donbas region to Russia. In exchange, Putin would reportedly agree to freeze the current frontlines in other occupied southern regions like Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. This potential plan, which Trump is expected to discuss with President Zelenskyy, marks a significant departure from the stance of Ukraine and its European allies, who maintain that international borders should not be altered by force. The deal would bypass a ceasefire in favor of a direct, permanent settlement.</p>

          <p>Norfolk Police arrested 13 individuals in Norwich for displaying support for Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed as a terrorist organization by the UK government. The arrests occurred during a protest outside City Hall, where individuals were holding placards in support of the group, which is a criminal offense under the Terrorism Act 2000. This action comes as the Metropolitan Police announced further prosecutions of the group's supporters, with over 700 arrests made since the ban was enacted. Civil liberties groups have expressed concern over the mass arrests, while Palestine Action is challenging its proscription in the High Court.</p>
