          <h2>CATL Stock Surges in Hong Kong Debut Amid US-China Financial Decoupling</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of CATL, the world’s largest electric car battery maker, experienced a 16% surge during their Hong Kong stock market debut, though U.S. onshore investors were barred from participating due to escalating tensions between the U.S. and China. The New York Times article highlights how CATL has become a focal point in the ongoing financial decoupling between the two nations, facing sanctions and scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers, despite its strategic importance and global expansion plans. CATL's Hong Kong listing, raising $4.6 billion, marks a significant shift from past instances like Alibaba's NYSE debut, signaling a growing trend of Chinese companies being excluded from U.S. markets due to national security concerns. This move is expected to impact other Chinese hardware and software producers, limiting U.S. investors' access to potentially profitable opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A second man, Stanislav Carpiuc, has been charged with conspiracy to commit arson in connection with fires at properties and a vehicle linked to UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The BBC article details that the charges relate to a vehicle fire, a fire at the prime minister's private home, and a fire at a previous residence. Carpiuc is accused of conspiring with Roman Lavrynovych, who was previously charged with arson with intent to endanger life and has denied the charges. The incidents include a car fire, a fire at a house converted into flats linked to the prime minister, and a fire at Starmer's former home, which is now rented to his sister-in-law.</p>

          <p>An elephant was killed by a train in Sri Lanka, derailing the train despite safety measures implemented after a previous deadly accident, according to CBS News. The young elephant was struck near Habarana by the same train involved in a February accident that killed seven elephants. This incident occurred despite speed limits and efforts to improve visibility along the tracks. Wildlife officials report that 139 elephants have been killed by trains in the past 17 years, highlighting the ongoing human-elephant conflict in Sri Lanka.</p>

          <p>Israel has recovered documents and personal effects belonging to Eli Cohen, a famous Israeli spy executed in Syria in 1965, according to the New York Times. The trove includes 2,500 items such as documents, photographs, letters, and information about his final moments. During his time undercover in Syria, Cohen provided crucial information to Israel that contributed to their victory in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. The announcement was received as a unifying moment in Israel, though it remains unclear if the documents shed light on the location of Cohen's burial site.</p>

          <p>The BBC's F1 Q&A discusses the performance of McLaren compared to Red Bull, noting that McLaren has shown superior qualifying pace with more pole positions and race wins. However, Red Bull remains strong in high-speed corners, making tracks like Suzuka and Imola favorable for them. McLaren excels when rear-tyre degradation is a significant issue or when the corners are slower. The article highlights that these relative performances can change due to upgrades and track conditions, with Red Bull having introduced recent upgrades to improve their performance.</p>
