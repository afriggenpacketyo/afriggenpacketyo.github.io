          <p>This article explores the origins and evolution of tennis, tracing it from a 12th-century French handball game called "jeu de paume" to the modern sport of lawn tennis. It details how the game was initially favored by royalty before being formalized in 18th-century Britain and later professionalized in 1968, which introduced prize money and corporate sponsorships. The piece also discusses the sport's increasing accessibility, the fight for equality by players like Billie Jean King, and the impact of modern stars and technological advancements. It highlights how tennis has transformed from an exclusive pastime into a more global and inclusive sport.</p>

          <p>This opinion article asserts that a declassified CIA review reveals a concerted effort by former top intelligence officials to frame Donald Trump during the 2016 election. The author argues that figures like John Brennan and James Comey deliberately promoted the discredited Steele dossier to create a false narrative of Russian collusion, despite objections from senior agency experts. The piece contends this was a politically motivated plot to undermine the president, constituting one of the most significant political scandals in history. It concludes by calling for legal accountability for the officials involved to prevent future abuses of power.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 05:00:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Minnesota United has become one of the most aggressive set-piece teams in global soccer by employing unconventional tactics, such as frequent long throw-ins and deep free kicks. Under coach Eric Ramsay, the team has found an analytical edge, scoring a significant portion of their goals from these dead-ball situations, which create chaos for opposing defenses. This strategy, born from financial necessity, allows the lower-budget MLS team to compete effectively against wealthier opponents by maximizing high-value opportunities. The approach has proven remarkably successful, turning set pieces into a major offensive weapon and exciting the team's fanbase.</p>

          <p>A group of Senate Democrats is introducing legislation to create a new, independent inspector general position specifically to oversee the Executive Office of the President. The bill aims to establish a permanent watchdog to root out potential fraud, waste, and misconduct within the White House, regardless of which administration is in power. Proponents, like Senator Adam Schiff, argue this is a vital and long-overdue check on executive power, bringing the same level of accountability to the president's office that exists in other federal agencies. The move follows years of criticism regarding alleged conflicts of interest and ethics concerns in the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of the deadly Texas floods, a massive volunteer search effort for the missing is being led by Thad Heartfield, an attorney whose own son is among those unaccounted for. Heartfield was on the phone with his son, Aidan, when the family's cabin was swept away by the floodwaters of the Guadalupe River. Despite his personal tragedy, he has organized dozens of volunteers into systematic search teams, covering miles of debris-choked riverbank. This grassroots effort is working alongside official responders to locate victims, providing a poignant example of community resilience in the face of immense loss.</p>

          <p>As Texas grapples with catastrophic flooding, the state is heavily relying on federal assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), an agency President Trump has proposed eliminating. This creates a paradox, as Texas Governor Greg Abbott and other state leaders are part of a council tasked with recommending changes that could significantly reduce FEMA's role, arguing states can respond more effectively. While Texas officials praise the swift federal response to the current disaster, their simultaneous push to dismantle the agency highlights a major policy contradiction. The situation underscores the national debate over the federal government's role in disaster relief amid increasing climate-related events.</p>

These import taxes, the highest since the 1930s, have been a drag on the U.S. economy, particularly the manufacturing sector, and face legal challenges arguing the president overstepped his authority.

Their son, Joe Bennett, criticized the UK Foreign Office's "quiet diplomacy" approach as ineffective and urged more urgent action to bring his parents home.

Over 560 people were arrested during the Saba Saba Day unrest, and President Ruto has warned against unconstitutional attempts to change the government.

          <p>President Trump's move to revoke birthright citizenship for children of non-citizen immigrants has drawn comparisons to authoritarian regimes, including Nazi Germany's 1935 Nuremberg Laws that stripped Jews of their citizenship. While Germany's historical path to citizenship was based on bloodline rather than birthplace, the act of stripping citizenship is seen by some as a hallmark of authoritarianism. The 14th Amendment, which enshrined birthright citizenship in the U.S. Constitution, was intended to grant rights to formerly enslaved people and has become a symbol of a multi-racial society.

          <p>Malaysia's trade minister announced that the country will not compromise on its national interests and sovereignty in trade negotiations with the United States. The talks are aimed at lowering a 25% tariff the U.S. has imposed on Malaysian exports, with an August 1 deadline looming. The minister stated that U.S. demands have touched on sensitive domestic policies, including digital taxes and halal certification, which Malaysia considers its "red lines." Despite the difficult negotiations, Malaysia remains optimistic about reaching a deal and has no plans for retaliatory tariffs against the U.S., its second-largest trading partner.

          <p>Recent Israeli airstrikes in Gaza have reportedly killed 20 people, including six children, amid ongoing international efforts to secure a ceasefire. In the U.S., President Donald Trump met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss the conflict, with Trump suggesting a ceasefire deal looks likely soon. Meanwhile, an international law expert has warned that Israel's plan to permanently move Palestinians into a "humanitarian zone" could constitute a war crime. The developments underscore the intense diplomatic and military activity surrounding the conflict, as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza continues to worsen with a severe fuel shortage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To combat a severe backlog of nearly 77,000 cases in UK criminal courts, a former senior judge, Sir Brian Leveson, has recommended a series of radical reforms. His proposals include conducting judge-only trials for certain offenses like fraud, which would eliminate the need for a jury in those cases. Sir Brian argues that such fundamental changes are necessary to prevent a "total system collapse" and reduce the years-long delays that victims and defendants currently face. While some legal professionals support the measures to speed up justice, others express strong opposition, arguing that removing juries undermines the fundamental right to be tried by one's peers.</p>

          <p>An emergency room doctor has described the moment he realized Erin Patterson had intentionally poisoned her family members with toxic mushrooms, calling her a "heinous individual." Dr. Chris Webster was treating two of the victims for what he initially thought was food poisoning when Patterson herself arrived at the hospital with mild symptoms. Her suspicious answers about the source of the mushrooms and her lack of concern for her dying relatives immediately convinced him of her guilt. A jury has since convicted Patterson of murdering three of her in-laws and attempting to murder a fourth, with Dr. Webster's testimony playing a key role.</p>

          <p>An Indian nurse, Nimisha Priya, is scheduled to be executed in Yemen on July 16 after being sentenced to death for the 2017 murder of her local business partner. Her only hope for survival is to secure a pardon from the victim's family, which is permissible under Yemen's Sharia law in exchange for "blood money." Campaigners and her family have offered $1 million to the victim's family, but they are still awaiting a response.

          <p>Russia has seized approximately $50 billion worth of assets over the last three years, a move that underscores its economic shift towards a self-reliant "fortress" model. The confiscations have targeted both foreign companies and domestic assets, justified on grounds ranging from national security and corruption to violations of privatization rules. This trend reflects a significant departure from the post-Soviet goal of an open, integrated market economy. A Russian law firm has advised business owners to minimize ties with "unfriendly" Western countries and consider partnerships with state-owned entities to mitigate the risk of seizure.

Although the attempts were reportedly unsuccessful and not highly sophisticated, the incident highlights the growing threat of deepfake technology being used for deception and espionage.

In contrast, Raducanu's run was deemed incredible, pushing the world number one in a high-quality match and showing she has the potential to return to the top 10.

          <p>The UK's railway system is facing a new crisis as it transitions back to public ownership, a key policy of the current Labour government. While most train services are being renationalized under the new entity Great British Railways, a debate is raging over the future of private "open access" operators. These operators, which compete with state-run services and are credited with improving service and lowering fares, are now facing resistance from the Department for Transport. The government's stance has raised fears that it aims to eliminate these competitors, potentially leading to higher costs for taxpayers and less choice for passengers. (not investment advice)</p>
