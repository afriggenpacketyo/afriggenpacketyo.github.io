          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has strongly condemned a New York Times article about Orville Etoria, a Jamaican man convicted of murder who was deported by the Trump administration. The DHS accused the newspaper of publishing a "disgusting sob story" that downplays the severity of his crimes, which also included armed robbery and weapon possession. After serving his sentence, Etoria was allowed to remain in the U.S. under the Biden administration before being deported this summer. The agency reaffirmed its commitment to enforcing immigration laws without apology.</p>

          <p>Most Asia-Pacific markets saw gains as investors evaluated the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, though sentiment was weighed down by uncertainty surrounding U.S. tariffs. Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi both rose, with South Korean inflation data showing a slower increase than anticipated. This market activity follows a U.S. federal appeals court ruling that found most of President Trump's global tariffs to be illegal. Meanwhile, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 declined ahead of the release of its current account balance data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has used advanced facial recognition technology to analyze a photograph of a corpse discovered in a secret Libyan mortuary in 2011, concluding there is a high probability it is the revered Shia cleric Musa al-Sadr. Sadr, an influential Iranian-Lebanese leader, mysteriously vanished in Libya in 1978, sparking decades of speculation. The algorithm developed at Bradford University provided a strong match, suggesting Sadr was likely killed, potentially solving a mystery that has gripped the Middle East for nearly 50 years.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece draws historical parallels between the current state of some Western countries and the decline of the Soviet Union in the 1980s. The article suggests that nations like Britain are exhibiting similar signs of decay, such as political rigidity, a managerial class resistant to change, and an unwillingness to question obsolete dogma. The author posits that while history is unpredictable, these warnings warrant serious attention, as even a decline of the West could have significant global consequences.</p>

          <p>Labour MP Marie Tidball, who was born with a congenital disability, has spoken out about the significant accessibility challenges within the historic Houses of Parliament. Despite being the place where the Equalities Act was passed, the building presents numerous barriers, including heavy doors with round handles, long distances to accessible toilets, and physically demanding voting procedures. A parliamentary modernization committee is currently reviewing these issues, with its chair acknowledging that the House of Commons is "repeatedly falling short" on accessibility standards.</p>

          <p>In a New York Times op-ed, nine former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have accused Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of endangering Americans' health. The bipartisan group, whose tenures date back to the Carter administration, claims Kennedy's actions—such as firing the new CDC director, canceling vital mRNA vaccine research, and replacing expert committees with his own appointees—are dismantling the nation's vaccine system and leaving the U.S. vulnerable to health threats.</p>

          <p>The summer transfer window has ignited a debate over player power after strikers Alexander Isak and Yoane Wissa both refused to train with their clubs before successfully forcing transfers. Their actions have been labeled "despicable" by some pundits, who argue players should honor their contracts. This contrasts with the case of defender Marc Guehi, who remained professional but failed to secure his desired move, raising questions about whether disruptive tactics are becoming a more effective strategy for players.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests President Trump is holding back on imposing more severe sanctions on Russia for its war in Ukraine due to broader strategic concerns. According to experts, the administration fears that completely isolating Russia could push it into a much stronger, more formal alliance with China, which could be detrimental to U.S. interests. This calculation, combined with Trump's desire to be seen as a potential peace-broker, appears to be overriding calls for more punitive measures against Vladimir Putin's government.</p>
