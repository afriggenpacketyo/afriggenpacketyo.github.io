          <p>Elon Musk has announced the launch of a new political party, the "America Party," positioning it as an alternative to the established two-party system. The announcement, made on his social media platform X, follows a recent and public falling out with President Donald Trump, for whom Musk had been a key financial backer and appointee. It remains unclear if the party has been formally registered with the Federal Electoral Commission or who will lead it, as Musk himself is ineligible for the presidency.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a £500 million plan to establish "Best Start" family hubs in every local authority in England by April 2026. These hubs aim to provide a wide range of support services for families, including parenting advice, midwifery support, youth clubs, and debt counseling, with a focus on assisting 500,000 more children in disadvantaged areas. The initiative expands on a previous Conservative program and is reminiscent of the "Sure Start" centers from the early 2000s, though critics question how much of the plan is genuinely new versus a rebranding of existing services.</p>

          <p>Monica Sementilli has been found guilty of murdering her husband, beauty executive Fabio Sementilli, in a case involving a complex web of love, greed, and deception. Prosecutors argued she conspired with her lover, Robert Baker, to kill Fabio in 2017, staging the scene to look like a burglary to collect on a large life insurance policy. Key evidence included cell phone data, a secret affair, and testimony from a co-conspirator, despite Baker later claiming on the stand that Monica was not involved. After an eight-year legal process, she was sentenced to life in prison without parole.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods in Texas's Hill Country have resulted in at least 50 deaths, including 15 children, with dozens more, primarily from a children's summer camp, still missing.

Officials described the event as unprecedented, with rainfall exceeding forecasts, prompting a massive search and rescue operation involving state and federal agencies.

Despite an early lead and a home run from Miguel Rojas, the Dodgers' offense struggled to capitalize on opportunities, stranding nine runners on base.

          <p>An excerpt from Ron Chernow's new biography, "Mark Twain," details the author's 1882 return to the Mississippi River, the landscape that defined his youth and literary career. Traveling incognito, Samuel Clemens sought to gather material for his book "Life on the Mississippi" and reconnect with his past as a steamboat pilot, a profession he cherished for its sense of absolute freedom. Despite his fame and the changes to the river landscape, Twain found profound comfort in the pilot house, reflecting on it as a sanctuary where he felt his most authentic self, away from the constraints of society.</p>

          <p>Recent changes to the operating rules of China's Communist Party suggest President Xi Jinping might be delegating more decision-making power to his deputies. The new regulations are designed to standardize the policy coordination and review processes for top-level bodies like central commissions and party leading groups, many of which were established or empowered under Xi. According to state media, these organs are now directed to focus on major strategic planning and oversight, a move some analysts interpret as a potential signal regarding Xi's long-term succession plans and a shift in governance style.</p>

          <p>Young people often face the challenge of needing experience to get a job, but needing a job to get experience, a cycle that can make finding summer employment difficult. Career experts advise applicants to reframe their qualifications, highlighting skills learned from volunteering, team sports, or even household responsibilities to demonstrate teamwork and problem-solving abilities. They also recommend keeping CVs simple and tailored, trying in-person applications at smaller businesses, and preparing thoroughly for interviews. While the job market is competitive, these strategies can help first-time job seekers stand out to potential employers.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Trump's Unpredictability in Foreign Policy Seen as Strategic 'Madman Theory'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 19:09:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis suggests President Donald Trump is strategically employing the "Madman Theory" in foreign policy, using his perceived unpredictability to coerce allies and adversaries. This approach, characterized by contradictory statements and sudden policy shifts, aims to keep other nations off-balance to extract concessions, as seen with increased NATO defense spending. However, critics question its effectiveness against entrenched adversaries like Iran and Russia and warn it could erode trust in the U.S. as a reliable partner. The doctrine may ultimately be limited if other leaders learn to predict Trump's behavior based on his known character traits.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 19:09:05 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Lifetime ISA (LISA), a savings vehicle for first-time home buyers and retirement, is a divisive product. Supporters praise the 25% government bonus, which can provide a significant boost towards a house deposit or retirement fund. However, critics and some users point to major flaws, including a harsh penalty for early withdrawal that can cost savers their own money. Another significant issue is the £450,000 property price cap for using the funds, a figure that has not been updated since 2017 and is increasingly unrealistic in high-priced areas, leading to calls for reform.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of runners participated in a 15-mile "Run Against ICE" through immigrant communities in Los Angeles to protest federal immigration raids.

Participants jogged through areas like Koreatown, MacArthur Park, and the Fashion District, expressing outrage and solidarity with affected families. The run was a visible demonstration of defiance against what many see as aggressive and racially-motivated enforcement actions by federal agents.</p>

          <p>A former chief medical officer for the CDC's HIV prevention division has warned that recent Trump administration funding cuts to scientific research could jeopardize progress toward ending the HIV epidemic in the U.S. While a Trump initiative to eliminate HIV by 2030 remains, broader cuts are reportedly impacting vital prevention research, including the development of a vaccine and a cure. The expert expressed concern that while treatment for current patients may continue, a lack of investment in prevention strategies and access to new drugs could lead to a future increase in new HIV infections.</p>

          <p>Representative Mark Green, a Republican from Tennessee, has officially announced his resignation from Congress, effective July 20. The move, while expected, will further shrink the already slim Republican majority in the House of Representatives to 219-212 until a special election is held. Green, who chairs the Homeland Security Committee, stated he is leaving public office to start a private sector business focused on helping the U.S. compete with China. His departure presents an additional challenge for Speaker Mike Johnson, who relies on near-total party unity to pass legislation.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is facing criticism for sending an email claiming President Trump's new spending bill "eliminates federal income taxes on social security benefits for most beneficiaries." Critics, including former SSA officials, have labeled the statement as misleading and partisan, as the bill does not eliminate the tax but instead provides a temporary, income-limited tax deduction for seniors. The communication has been called a "lie" and "blatant misinformation," with observers noting that such a politically-charged statement from a typically apolitical agency is highly unusual.

          <p>Fly-half George Ford delivered a masterful performance on his 100th cap, guiding England to a commanding 35-12 victory over Argentina in their first Test match in La Plata.

Ford orchestrated the offense, had a hand in multiple scores, and kicked with precision to keep the Pumas at bay. Despite a brief comeback attempt from Argentina, England's composure and defensive strength secured a convincing win ahead of the second Test.</p>
