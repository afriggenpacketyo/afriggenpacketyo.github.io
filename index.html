          <h2>China's Bond Yields Rise Despite Deflationary Pressures</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-03-20 23:51:39 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists attribute the recent increase in China's government bond yields to market optimism exceeding economic reality.  Persisting deflationary pressures, weak consumer sentiment, and anemic credit demand are expected to keep borrowing costs low in the long term.  This situation is further complicated by a potential renewed trade war with the US.</p>

          <p>The UK government announced plans to create a new national forest in the west of England, involving the planting of 20 million trees and the creation of 2,500 hectares of new woodland by 2050.  This initiative aims to increase woodland cover and contribute to national tree-planting targets, though environmental groups emphasize the need for further action to meet the legally binding goal of 16.5% woodland cover by 2050.  The project will also target urban areas.</p>
