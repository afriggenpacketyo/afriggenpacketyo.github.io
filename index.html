          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved a new blue food color additive derived from the fruit of the gardenia plant. The dye is cleared for use in various products, including sports drinks, candies, and non-carbonated beverages. This approval is part of a broader push by health officials to replace petroleum-based dyes with natural alternatives in the American food supply. The additive is created using soy protein, and the FDA is currently reviewing a request to exempt it from allergen labeling requirements.</p>

          <p>Constance Marten and Mark Gordon have been convicted of gross negligence manslaughter following the death of their newborn daughter, Victoria. The couple went on the run to avoid authorities, living in a tent in cold conditions where the baby is believed to have died from hypothermia or smothering. The verdict came after a chaotic retrial where the jury also found them guilty of child cruelty and perverting the course of justice. Gordon's prior conviction in the U.S. for sexual assault was disclosed during this second trial, which the couple repeatedly attempted to disrupt.</p>

          <p>Search and recovery operations for victims of the catastrophic July 4 flash floods in Kerr County, Texas, were temporarily suspended due to a renewed flood threat. Heavy weekend rains have caused rivers to rise again, prompting new flood warnings and rescue operations in several counties. The initial flooding on July 4 killed at least 132 people, and approximately 160 individuals remain missing in the Hill Country area. Authorities are urging extreme caution as the saturated ground and ongoing rain create dangerous conditions, complicating the massive search effort.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has asked the Fed's inspector general to review a controversial $2.5 billion building renovation project. The move follows sharp criticism from the White House, with officials including President Trump accusing the central bank of "fiscal mismanagement" and excessive spending. The project, which involves upgrading the Fed's main Washington, D.C., buildings, has been defended by the Fed as necessary for safety remediation and modernization. Since the Federal Reserve is not taxpayer-funded, it is not under the direct oversight of the Office of Management and Budget. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A wildfire on the Grand Canyon's North Rim has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and dozens of other structures. The fire, sparked by lightning on July 4, grew rapidly over the weekend, leading to questions about the National Park Service's initial strategy to "confine and contain" it rather than suppress it aggressively. Arizona's governor has called for a federal investigation into the handling of the blaze. The park's North Rim has been closed for the rest of the year, and while no injuries have been reported, the loss of the iconic lodge is a significant blow.</p>

          <p>Calvin Duncan, who was wrongfully convicted of murder in 1982 and sentenced to life, has earned a law degree after being exonerated and released. While incarcerated for over 28 years, Duncan studied law and became a "jailhouse lawyer," providing legal assistance to hundreds of fellow inmates who could not afford representation. With the help of the Innocence Project, he successfully appealed his own case and was freed in 2011. Now 60, he has published a memoir and founded the Light of Justice program in New Orleans to improve court access for incarcerated individuals.</p>

          <p>A Hague tribunal has upheld the war crimes conviction of former Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) member Pjeter Shala but reduced his prison sentence from 18 to 13 years. Shala was convicted in 2024 for torture, murder, and arbitrary detention committed at a makeshift prison during the 1998-99 Kosovo uprising. On appeal, judges reversed some specific convictions but confirmed others, and determined the original sentence was disproportionately long compared to similar cases. The Kosovo Specialist Chambers was established to prosecute former KLA fighters for crimes committed during the conflict.</p>

          <p>The U.S. housing market is continuing to cool, with nearly one-third of the 100 largest markets now seeing annual home price declines. According to mortgage technology firm ICE, factors such as high mortgage rates, rising inventory, and falling demand contributed to the slowdown, with annual price growth slowing to just 1.3% in June. While prices are still rising in the Northeast and Midwest, they are softening in the South and West, with Florida and Texas markets seeing notable drops. This trend suggests more markets may see price corrections. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new federal spending bill is anticipated to boost the private jet market by reinstating a significant tax benefit for buyers. The provision allows businesses to immediately write off 100% of the purchase price of a new or used jet, a policy known as "bonus depreciation." Jet brokers report a surge in interest from clients who were waiting for the bill to pass, as the tax incentive makes purchasing or upgrading an aircraft more financially attractive. The stimulus arrives as the private jet market was experiencing a slowdown after a post-pandemic boom. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The legacy of former Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, who has passed away, is viewed as a complex mix of achievements and significant failures. He is remembered by some for his anti-corruption stance, but heavily criticized by others for his autocratic tendencies and human rights abuses, such as the violent crackdown on the #EndSARS protests. His tenure was also marked by economic struggles, including a recession and a failure to diversify the oil-dependent economy. Ultimately, his time in power, both as a military ruler and a democratic president, leaves behind a deeply divisive record.</p>
