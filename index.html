          <p>This article recounts the story of Julie Moore, an Army spouse who spearheaded a movement to change the way the U.S. military notifies families of service member deaths. Outraged by the impersonal telegrams used during the Vietnam War, Moore lobbied for in-person notifications with support for the grieving families. Her efforts led to a significant shift in Army culture, with service members now personally delivering the news and offering assistance. Moore's legacy was honored in 2023 when Ft. Benning was renamed Ft. Moore, marking the first time a military base was named after a civilian.</p>

          <p>A police officer in Dalton, Georgia, has resigned after mistakenly arresting a 19-year-old undocumented college student, Ximena Arias Cristobal, leading to her detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The officer pulled Arias-Cristobal over for a traffic violation, but after reviewing dashcam footage, officials found the wrong vehicle had been stopped and dismissed the charges. Arias Cristobal, who came to the U.S. from Mexico at age 4, was released from ICE custody after an immigration judge granted her bond, and her father, also detained by ICE, was released as well. Both still face deportation proceedings.</p>

The German finance minister emphasized the need for serious negotiations and warned that the tariffs would harm both the U.S. and European economies. The EU has reiterated its commitment to securing a deal that benefits both sides, stressing that trade relations should be based on mutual respect rather than threats.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent shift in policy toward Syria, marked by meetings with President Ahmed al-Sharaa and plans to lift sanctions, has complicated Israel's military strategy in the region. Previously, Israel conducted numerous airstrikes in Syria, aiming to prevent hostile groups from acquiring weapons and establishing a presence near its borders. However, since Trump's embrace of al-Sharaa, Israeli airstrikes have significantly decreased, indicating a potential shift towards de-escalation and dialogue. This change in U.S. foreign policy is reshaping the dynamics in the Middle East, prompting Israel to reassess its approach to Syria.</p>

Claims to Essequibo are deeply rooted in Venezuelan national identity, though most residents of the region identify as Guyanese and want to remain part of Guyana.

          <p>An All Nippon Airways flight from Tokyo to Houston was forced to divert to Seattle after an unruly passenger attempted to open the plane's exit doors mid-flight. Fellow passengers and crew members restrained the individual, who was later evaluated by police and transported to a local hospital for a medical crisis. A second, unrelated unruly passenger was also removed from the plane while on the tarmac in Seattle. The flight eventually continued to Houston after a delay.</p>

          <p>President Trump has criticized Harvard University regarding its international students, alleging that their home countries are unfriendly to the U.S. and contribute nothing to their education. This statement comes after a federal judge blocked the Trump administration's attempt to revoke Harvard's ability to enroll international students. The university argued that the revocation violated the First Amendment and punished the school for rejecting government control over its policies. International students comprise a significant portion of Harvard's student body and are typically ineligible for federal financial aid.</p>

A longtime West Point professor, Graham Parsons, who resigned in protest of the administration's changes to the academy, objected to Trump's wearing a "Make America Great Again" hat, viewing it as a blurring of the lines between the presidency and personal politics. Parsons criticized the administration's orders as indoctrination, eliminating courses and censoring arguments to align with its ideological preferences, and said that it felt like a professional betrayal.</p>
