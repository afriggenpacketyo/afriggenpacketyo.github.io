          <p>Novo Nordisk's shares increased by 3% after the company announced trial data indicating that Wegovy, its weight management drug, outperformed rivals in reducing heart disease risk. The study showed that semaglutide users had a 57% greater reduction in heart attack, stroke, or death risk compared to those using tirzepatide. This news comes after Denmark recently lowered its annual economic growth forecast, partially due to Novo Nordisk's declining U.S. market share. European stock markets were generally higher, while U.S. financial markets were closed for Labor Day. (not investment advice)</p>

This overhaul aims to reduce the use of hotels for migrants arriving on small boats, following recent protests. The National Crime Agency reported a record number of disruptions to immigration crime networks, and the first deportations to France under a returns deal are expected soon. The government aims to end the use of asylum hotels by the end of this Parliament.</p>

          <p>The final phase of England's largest-ever expansion of publicly funded childcare support has begun, providing eligible working parents with 30 hours of childcare per week for children aged nine months to four years. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hailed it as a "landmark moment" for families, but parents are facing long waiting lists and nurseries are reporting staff shortages. The government estimates 70,000 extra places are needed, and while the number of spaces is rising, availability varies across the country. Some parents are making significant life choices to become eligible for the funded hours as early as possible.</p>

          <h2>ScotRail Scraps Peak Time Rail Fares</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ScotRail has eliminated peak rail fares, allowing passengers to travel during weekday rush hours without paying higher prices. This initiative aims to encourage more commuters to use trains instead of cars, making tickets more affordable and straightforward. A rail ticket from Edinburgh to Glasgow will be nearly 50% cheaper, and fares on routes without peak time pricing will remain unchanged. The change follows a pilot scheme in 2023 and a subsequent announcement by First Minister John Swinney, and is designed to put money back in people's pockets and reduce carbon emissions.</p>

          <p>A new book reveals that Queen Camilla was the victim of an attempted indecent sexual assault as a teenager, recounting how she fought off her attacker. The Queen reportedly shared the story with Boris Johnson in 2008 when he was mayor of London, and the incident occurred on a train to Paddington Station. Much of the Queen's public work in recent years has been dedicated to supporting victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, serving as patron of the charity SafeLives and visiting women's refuges and rape crisis centers. Sources close to the Queen emphasize that her advocacy work stems from hearing victims' stories over the years.</p>

          <p>BBC Panorama revealed that staff at a luxury jewellery retailer were instructed to act as customers to deceive investors in the UK's largest diamond scam. This helped Vashi Dominguez obtain fresh capital to support his failing business, which collapsed in 2023 with £170m in debt. Investors lost their money when the promised £157m diamond stock was only valued at about £100,000. Former staff members claim that customers were also defrauded, with smaller or lower-quality diamonds being sold than what was paid for.</p>

Putin also mentioned "understandings" reached with U.S. President Donald Trump at a summit in Alaska, which he hopes will contribute to resolving the conflict.

          <p>China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly grew in August, according to a private survey, driven by a recovery in new orders and export business. The RatingDog manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) came in at 50.5, exceeding expectations. However, the survey indicated that domestic demand remains weak and employment in the manufacturing sector remains bleak. The results contrasted with an official reading that showed manufacturing activity shrinking for a fifth straight month, and Beijing and Washington extended their tariff truce for another 90 days.</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to deport unaccompanied Guatemalan children, responding to reports that the children were being placed on planes. The judge's order came after immigrant advocacy groups sought an emergency injunction, arguing that the children would be at risk of abuse and persecution if deported. The Trump administration asserted that the flights were for family reunifications, but advocacy groups disputed this claim. The order will remain in effect for 14 days while the matter is further considered.</p>
