          <p>Snap's stock price experienced a significant drop of 13% after the company reported its first-quarter earnings and expressed concerns about 'headwinds' affecting revenue growth in the current quarter. The company cited macroeconomic uncertainties and their potential impact on advertising demand as reasons for not providing specific guidance for the second quarter. Snap's revenue for the first quarter rose 14% to $1.36 billion, surpassing expectations, but the lack of guidance and concerns about future advertising revenue weighed heavily on investor sentiment. Snap lowered its full-year adjusted operating expenses range to between $2.65 billion and $2.70 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In this New York Times article, Bret Stephens interviews Dane Chapin, a San Diego-area entrepreneur whose business, USAopoly, faces significant challenges due to President Trump's tariffs on goods from China. Chapin, who voted for Trump in the last election, expresses concern that the tariffs are forcing his company into survival mode, potentially impacting his 80 employees. He notes that while he doesn't object to taking a harder line on China, he's offended that Apple has received tariff exceptions while smaller American businesses are struggling. Chapin adds that the tariffs have the potential to obliterate the toy business, as a large portion of his games are manufactured in China due to its highly developed supply chain.</p>

          <p>UPS announced plans to eliminate 20,000 jobs this year as part of a cost-cutting strategy linked to a reduction in package volume from Amazon, its largest customer. The layoffs will affect over 4% of UPS's workforce and are part of a broader plan to consolidate facilities and operations, including closing 73 buildings by the end of June 2025. UPS expects to save $3.5 billion this year through these measures, while the Teamsters union asserts that UPS is contractually obligated to create 30,000 Teamsters jobs. The company cited shifts in global trade policy and the potential impact of tariffs as additional risks to its business.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberal Party has won enough seats in the House of Commons to form a government in Canada, although falling short of a majority.

Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre lost his seat, while domestic issues such as affordability and immigration also influenced voters. Carney emphasized the need for Canada to look out for itself and take care of each other, noting the end of the old relationship with the United States.</p>

Trump dismissed concerns that tariffs on goods from China would raise prices for American consumers, stating that China was ripping off the United States and is no longer doing so.
