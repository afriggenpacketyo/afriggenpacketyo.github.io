          <p>A bipartisan coalition in the House successfully blocked an attempt by Republican leadership to prevent a vote on a bill allowing new parents to vote remotely.  Nine Republicans joined Democrats to defeat the procedural measure, temporarily halting House proceedings.  The bill, sponsored by Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, would permit proxy voting for up to 12 weeks after childbirth.  The unexpected outcome highlights internal divisions within the Republican party and underscores the challenges faced by new parents in Congress.</p>
