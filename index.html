          <p>The White House announced President Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency after he experienced mild swelling in his lower legs. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated the condition is benign, common for his age, and that tests ruled out more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis. The announcement also addressed minor bruising on the president's hand, attributing it to frequent handshaking combined with aspirin use. The White House affirmed the president remains in excellent health and will release a full letter from his physician.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey by F&G Annuities & Life found that 23% of Americans over 50 are delaying retirement, a significant increase from 14% in 2024. The primary drivers for this trend are financial uncertainties, including concerns about inflation, potential recession, and insufficient savings. With the median savings for 55-year-olds at only $50,000, many are choosing to work longer to maximize Social Security benefits. Financial experts advise consistent saving, no matter the amount, to better prepare for retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has reversed its previous ban, now allowing Juul to market its tobacco and menthol-flavored e-cigarettes in the United States. The agency concluded that the company's studies demonstrated its products could be less harmful for adult smokers who switch completely from traditional cigarettes. This decision, which makes Juul one of only two companies authorized to sell menthol vapes, has drawn sharp criticism from anti-tobacco groups who blame the brand for sparking the teen vaping crisis. The FDA clarified the authorization is not an endorsement of the products.</p>

          <p>Shares of Archer-Daniels-Midland, a major producer of high-fructose corn syrup, fell after President Trump announced Coca-Cola had agreed to use real cane sugar in its U.S. products. While Coca-Cola's response was noncommittal, stating more details on innovations would be shared soon, the news caused a temporary dip in ADM's stock. The Corn Refiners Association warned the potential switch could cost American jobs and increase reliance on foreign sugar. The development highlights the administration's influence on corporate product formulations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A moment on the "Kiss Cam" during a Coldplay concert has sparked widespread online speculation about a potential affair. Frontman Chris Martin playfully pointed out a man and woman who reacted awkwardly and quickly moved away from the camera, joking that they were either shy or having an affair. Internet sleuths subsequently identified the pair as the CEO and Chief People Officer of the tech firm Astronomer, leading to a viral discussion about their relationship.

          <p>The Supreme Court's conservative majority has recently issued several rulings that strengthen the president's power to control federal agencies, a trend consistent with the "unitary executive theory." In unexplained orders, the court has allowed the Trump administration to proceed with significant layoffs at the Department of Education and other agencies, overturning lower court blocks. These decisions, along with a prior ruling allowing the dismissal of officials with fixed terms, signal a belief that the president holds broad authority over the executive branch. This judicial interpretation is seen by some legal experts as the court's long-held theory of the presidency being put into practice.</p>

The project, intended to connect San Francisco and Los Angeles, has seen its estimated cost balloon from $33 billion to over $128 billion. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the move, while the administration defended its decision, noting the project is 16 years in with no track laid.</p>

This change would allow states and local governments to access federal FEMA funding for heat-related emergencies, such as establishing cooling centers and implementing heat adaptation projects. Proponents argue the measure is necessary as heat kills more Americans than any other weather event, yet is not explicitly listed as a qualifying disaster.

          <h2>The "Princess Treatment" Trend on TikTok Sparks Debate Over Modern Relationship Expectations</h2>

          <p>A viral TikTok trend known as "princess treatment" is prompting discussions about relationship dynamics and gender roles. The trend sees women promoting and testing partners on their willingness to perform excessively doting or chivalrous acts, framing them as the "bare minimum." While some view it as a lighthearted response to poor treatment, critics and relationship experts argue it promotes a passive, self-focused, and transactional view of dating. This phenomenon is seen as part of a broader online culture where regressive or traditional gender norms are framed as empowering for women.</p>

          <p>This article examines the feasibility of debt consolidation for retirees and others living primarily on Social Security benefits. While it is possible to consolidate debt, qualifying for a traditional loan with favorable terms can be challenging due to fixed incomes and potentially high debt-to-income ratios. The article outlines several alternatives, including home equity loans, debt management plans through credit counseling agencies, and direct negotiation with creditors. For those with unmanageable debt, it also discusses debt settlement and bankruptcy as potential options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Connie Francis, a major pop icon of the 1950s and 60s, has passed away at the age of 87. The singer, known for hits like "Stupid Cupid" and "Lipstick On Your Collar," died from pneumonia following treatment for a pelvic fracture. Her death comes just months after her 1962 song "Pretty Little Baby" experienced a viral resurgence on TikTok, introducing her music to a new generation.

This follows the recent immediate removal of the requirement for passengers to take off their shoes at security checkpoints. The potential change is linked to the deployment of new CT scanners at airports, which provide more detailed 3-D images of bag contents.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has threatened to have the state legislature redraw its congressional district maps, a move aimed at offsetting a Republican plan to gain seats in Texas. This controversial proposal would challenge California's voter-approved independent redistricting commission, which was created to prevent partisan gerrymandering. Newsom frames the potential action as a necessary response to Republicans "playing by a different set of rules," while critics, including some Democrats and watchdog groups, argue it would undermine democracy and the rule of law.

          <p>The UK's Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued a warning that children under seven should not consume shop-bought slushy drinks due to health risks associated with glycerol. This sweetener, used to create the slushy texture, can cause side effects like headaches, sickness, and, in rare cases, shock or loss of consciousness in young children. The updated guidance, which is stricter than previous advice, also recommends that children aged seven to ten should have no more than one small slushy per day. The FSA is asking vendors to add written warnings at the point of sale.</p>
