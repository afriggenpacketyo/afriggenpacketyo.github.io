Meghan expressed her joy at having Lilibet in their lives and thanked everyone for their birthday wishes. Typically, Meghan protects Lilibet's privacy by only sharing photos where the princess is pictured from behind, but this time Lilibet's eyes and the top half of her face are visible. The princess was born in 2021, a year after her parents stepped back from being senior royals and moved to the US.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves unveiled a Â£15 billion investment in transport infrastructure projects across mayoral authorities in the Midlands, the North, and the West Country, marking a shift away from stringent Treasury rules that have favored London and the south-east. The funding will support tram, train, and bus projects, including extensions to tram networks in Greater Manchester and the West Midlands, as well as the West Yorkshire Mass Transit program. Six other metro mayors will receive transport investments for projects such as tram network renewals, faster connections to airports and stadiums, and improved rail infrastructure. This investment aims to address regional disparities and boost economic growth in areas facing electoral challenges.</p>

          <p>French cognac businesses are hopeful that recent discussions between Chinese and French officials may lead to the removal of tariffs imposed by Beijing on brandy and cognac imported from the European Union. These tariffs were initially enacted in retaliation for the EU's tariffs on made-in-China electric vehicles. Guilhem Grosperrin, director of the Grosperrin family brand, expressed optimism, noting that discussions were progressing positively and that the Chinese government was showing a willingness to listen. One of Grosperrin's Chinese clients has even delayed taking delivery of a paid order, awaiting the outcome of these negotiations.</p>

          <p>Portuguese and German authorities have resumed searching for Madeleine McCann in Portugal, 18 years after she disappeared from Praia da Luz. The search is focused on disused buildings and wells in the municipality of Lagos, near Praia da Luz, covering a 21 sq km site between where Madeleine went missing and where the German investigators' prime suspect, Christian BrÃ¼ckner, had been staying at the time. BrÃ¼ckner is currently serving a sentence in Germany for a sexual assault in Portugal in 2005 and is considered a suspect in Madeleine's disappearance. The search involves clearing grass and vegetation, draining a well, and examining abandoned buildings, with British police continuing to treat the case as a missing persons investigation.</p>

          <p>Executives at major corporations like Target, Goldman Sachs, and Pepsi have expressed concern about the unsteady business environment due to President Donald Trump's fluctuating tariff policies. These tariff shifts, including those recently challenged in court, have led companies to put hiring and investment plans on hold, fearing potential financial repercussions. Experts warn that this paralysis could hinder economic momentum and potentially lead to a downturn. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defends the administration's approach as "strategic uncertainty" to gain leverage in trade negotiations, but companies worry about potential losses due to the lack of clarity.

          <p>President Donald Trump's 50% tariff on steel and aluminum imports to the U.S. has taken effect, impacting European steel exporters, while the U.K. has been granted a temporary reprieve with a 25% tariff in place. The order aims to protect the U.S. steel industry amid cheaper foreign imports and weaker global demand. The U.K.'s exemption is tied to its recently signed trade deal with the U.S., but Trump warned that the tariff could increase to 50% if the U.K. does not comply with the agreement. The European Union is reportedly fuming about the tariffs, saying that such a move undermines ongoing trade deal negotiations with the U.S.</p>

The review highlighted a lack of curiosity about how his parents' culture and lifestyle impacted his wellbeing, with the report warning that "the safeguarding of children being impacted by harmful cultural practice is paramount". Abiyah died in early 2020 from a respiratory illness, worsened by a "restricted" vegan diet that caused severe malnourishment, rickets, anaemia and stunted growth.

However, the National Portrait Gallery is part of the Smithsonian Institution, which is independent of the federal government, and the portrait gallery was established by congressional statute. The author points out that Trump has no formal capacity to shape the leadership of any of the Smithsonianâ€™s museums, so the question remains whether other political actors will treat him as if he does.</p>

          <p>A Republican-backed budget package includes a new restriction for the federal Child Tax Credit (CTC) that could strip the benefit from millions of children who are U.S. citizens or legal residents, according to policy experts. The bill requires both a tax filer and their spouse to have Social Security numbers to claim the CTC for their kids, impacting children with mixed-status parents or undocumented parents. Republicans argue the bill would benefit families by boosting the CTC to $2,500 for three years and adjusting it for inflation, but experts estimate roughly 4.5 million children could be affected by the restriction.</p>

While the Trump administration is also taxing some finished products, Woltz fears higher costs might delay construction projects.

          <p>The federal government is holding over 48,000 people in immigration detention, exceeding ICE's funded capacity, with plans to further increase detention numbers. Private prison companies like GEO Group and CoreCivic are expanding their facilities to meet this demand, while local police departments are increasingly partnering with ICE through the 287g program. Critics raise concerns about deteriorating conditions and lack of oversight in private detention centers. Congress is considering a significant increase in funding for ICE detention, aiming to facilitate mass deportations.</p>

          <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has proposed the largest increase in defense spending since the Cold War, citing the need for the U.K. to be prepared to fight a war in Europe. The move is a response to growing security threats from Russia and uncertainty about the Trump administration's commitment to NATO. The plan would boost defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, with a goal of reaching 3% in the next parliamentary term, and includes modernizing the military, developing a "hybrid navy," and increasing the number of long-range weapons.</p>

          <p>Scotland's recent draw against the Netherlands has offered renewed hope for their qualification for the 2027 World Cup in Brazil. The team's performance, particularly in the second half, has been praised as a potential turning point after a disappointing campaign. The coach's energy and tactical adjustments were apparent, and the team's growth with limited sessions is encouraging. The draw serves as a positive start as they look towards World Cup qualification next year.</p>
