        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing divide is emerging within American religion, particularly Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy, driven by online-influenced converts who hold conservative views and seek community. This trend sees converts challenging established church hierarchies and pushing for ideological changes, contrasting with traditional members who prioritize community and cultural ties over strict theological adherence. The influx of these converts is contributing to the political polarization of American religion, impacting civil society and potentially reshaping institutional power dynamics as these individuals challenge existing authorities within their chosen faiths. The trend reveals a rebellion against the American mainstream and an attempt to remake religious communities in an idealized image. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Conservative commentators are increasingly obsessed with the idea that Barack and Michelle Obama's marriage is failing, despite a lack of evidence. This fixation is seen as part of a broader pattern of right-wing figures struggling to accept the happiness and success of those they politically oppose. Michelle Obama has suggested that sexism plays a role in the rumors, with people finding it hard to believe she would make personal choices independent of her husband. The article argues that the rumors are lazy and that critics should focus on valid criticisms of Obama's policies instead.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that almost half of Americans are exposed to unsafe levels of air pollutants, marking a rise from the previous year and a concerning trend for the future. Over 156 million people reside in areas with unhealthy levels of soot and smog, which can lead to premature death and various health issues. The increase in air pollution is attributed to climate crisis-driven events like heat waves and wildfires, with communities of color disproportionately affected.

          <p>Jiangsu province is narrowing the economic gap with Guangdong, which has been China's largest provincial economy for over four decades. Jiangsu's GDP grew by 5.9% in the first quarter, surpassing Guangdong's 4.1% growth. Guangdong's slower growth is attributed to its overreliance on the property sector, weak consumption, and the impact of trade tensions on exports. Analysts suggest that Guangdong is undergoing a painful economic restructuring, while Jiangsu is showing stronger growth momentum.</p>

Analysts suggest that China's overture may be aimed at undermining Japan's ties with the U.S. rather than achieving a genuine alliance against protectionism.

Higher borrowing levels have increased expectations of potential spending cuts or tax increases to meet borrowing rules. The IMF has lowered its growth forecast for the UK, citing tariffs, rising inflation, and borrowing costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Travis Hunter, a Heisman Trophy winner and top NFL prospect, aims to play both offense and defense in the NFL, a feat rarely achieved. Hunter played extensively on both sides of the ball in college, excelling as both a cornerback and receiver. NFL teams face the challenge of how to utilize his unique talent, balancing his desire to play both ways with the demands and specialization of the professional game. The decision will likely depend on whether teams prioritize his potential impact as a top player at one position or his versatility across both sides of the field.</p>
