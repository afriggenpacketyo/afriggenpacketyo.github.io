            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) traveled to El Salvador to investigate the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident, despite a court order prohibiting his removal. Van Hollen emphasized that his trip was about upholding the rule of law and defending Abrego Garcia's right to due process, not defending the individual himself. The senator criticized the Trump administration and El Salvador's President Bukele for their handling of the case, alleging an "illegal scheme" and violation of international law by preventing communication with Abrego Garcia. Van Hollen stressed the importance of upholding constitutional rights for all, regardless of accusations, and criticized Republicans for suggesting that defending constitutional rights equates to supporting gang violence.</p>

            <p>Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan are considering investing in the Alaska LNG project as a way to navigate trade tensions and potential tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.

The Trump administration views the project as strategically important, offering a direct route to Asian markets and bolstering U.S. energy dominance. However, the project faces challenges including high costs, political risks, and competition from other LNG suppliers.</p>

            <p>The CEO of Back Market anticipates a surge in sales of used and refurbished tech devices due to President Trump's tariffs on electronics manufactured in China. He believes that Americans will increasingly opt for used devices to avoid higher prices on new electronics, potentially flipping the current sales ratio of new versus used devices. While some analysts agree that tariffs could boost short-term sales of refurbished devices, they suspect that consumers will eventually return to buying new tech when their finances allow. The timeline for the tariffs' impact remains unpredictable, but the CEO sees a "big opportunity" to change consumer habits.</p>

            <p>Germany is attempting to deport an American and three EU citizens for alleged actions at pro-Palestinian protests, sparking concerns about freedom of movement and potential clashes with EU law. The individuals were served with deportation orders related to a protest at Berlin's Free University in October 2024. Critics draw comparisons to the Trump administration's handling of pro-Palestinian student protesters in the U.S. The Berlin Immigration Office cites "property damage including graffiti" as the reason, while lawyers argue the protesters have no criminal convictions and haven't received specific charges.</p>

            <p>As retirement nears, protecting savings from market volatility, including that caused by tariffs, is crucial. Experts advise rebalancing portfolios based on risk tolerance and timeline, potentially shifting to a 60/40 stock/bond allocation. Building cash reserves to cover two years of income can help avoid selling investments during market downturns. Considering a "bond ladder" strategy, where bonds mature at different intervals, provides a steady income stream and reduces risk. These strategies aim to mitigate the impact of market fluctuations on retirement funds, (not investment advice).</p>

She distinguishes between egregious lies that cause real harm and lesser lies often born of insecurity or attempts at kindness. The author questions whether all dating lies are inherently awful, suggesting that some may be attempts to present a better version of oneself. Ultimately, the author's date found out about the lie years later but didn't care, highlighting the potential for forgiveness and acceptance in relationships.</p>

This would strengthen the renminbi's exchange rate, challenging the US dollar's dominance. Given China's strong manufacturing capabilities and trade volume with the US, mandatory renminbi settlement would force the US to buy Chinese currency on a large scale, increasing its demand and value. The author argues this would also signal China's economic strength to global investors and encourage capital inflows.</p>
