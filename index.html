          <p>China's export growth slowed in May due to declining shipments to the United States following tariffs imposed by President Trump. Exports rose 4.8% year-on-year, but shipments to the US fell almost 12% month-on-month. The report of the slowdown comes just hours before another round of trade talks between US and Chinese officials in London. Trump has lowered his 145% tariffs on Chinese goods to 30% for 90 days to allow for talks while China also reduced its taxes on US goods from 125% to 10%. (not investment advice)</p>
