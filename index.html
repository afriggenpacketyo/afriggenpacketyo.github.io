          <p>Doctors and humanitarian aid workers in Gaza are reporting a severe and escalating hunger crisis, with a significant rise in malnutrition-related deaths, particularly among children. Organizations like Médecins Sans Frontières and MercyCorps describe overwhelmed medical facilities and parents struggling to feed their families, with some going days without food. The situation is described as dystopian, with aid groups warning of mass starvation as access to food and supplies remains critically low. The Israeli government states it is not limiting aid and blames Hamas for shortages, a claim Hamas denies.</p>

          <p>Three Venezuelan men, deported from the U.S. to El Salvador's CECOT prison, have alleged experiencing severe physical and psychological abuse by prison officers. The men, who were deported under the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act over alleged gang ties, claim they were beaten, humiliated, and denied legal access. They deny being members of the Tren de Aragua gang and describe their detention as "real hell." The Department of Homeland Security defended the deportations as necessary to remove threats, but did not comment on the abuse allegations.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that the country has secured funding for three Patriot air defense systems, with two from Germany and one from Norway. Ukraine is now working to find funding for an additional seven systems as part of a broader deal allowing European nations to purchase and transfer US weaponry to Kyiv. This arrangement follows a shift in US policy under President Trump, who has favored weapon sales via allies over direct aid. The article also notes ongoing discussions for a potential peace summit between Ukrainian and Russian leaders.</p>

          <p>Mhairi Black, the former deputy leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP) at Westminster, has announced her departure from the party. She cited disagreements with the party's decisions, particularly its "capitulation" on transgender rights and its stance on the conflict in Palestine. Black, who was once the UK's youngest MP, stated she remains pro-independence but feels the party needs to change and that she identifies as more left-wing. An SNP spokesperson responded by emphasizing the party's unity under its current leadership.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that California's high-speed rail project, now facing a lawsuit from Governor Gavin Newsom against the Trump administration for pulling federal funds, symbolizes the state's deeper fiscal problems. The project's cost has ballooned from an initial $40 billion to a projected $128 billion, with no track laid. The author contends that despite its large economy, California suffers from high poverty, bureaucratic incompetence, and unsustainable spending, which drives residents and businesses away. The lawsuit is portrayed as a political maneuver by Newsom to appear strong against Trump while ignoring systemic governance failures.</p>

          <p>A panel of doctors has strongly urged the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to remove its most severe "black box" warning labels from low-dose estrogen treatments for menopause. They argue the warnings, which list risks of cancer and dementia, are not supported by current science for these specific therapies and unnecessarily scare women away from beneficial treatments for symptoms like vaginal dryness and UTIs. The debate reflects a significant shift from two decades ago when hormone therapy was widely linked to health risks. Critics, however, argue the panel's process was unconventional and lacked a full scientific evaluation.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is under increasing pressure to immediately recognize Palestinian statehood, following a similar commitment from France and a call from a parliamentary committee. The Foreign Affairs Committee's report, supported by Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs, described statehood as an "inalienable right" that should not be conditional. However, Conservative members dissented, aligning with the government's official position that recognition should be part of a long-term, two-state solution. Starmer has reiterated that statehood is a right but maintains recognition should be timed for maximum impact.</p>

          <p>German auto manufacturer Volkswagen has lowered its full-year financial forecast after reporting a 29% drop in second-quarter operating profit. The company cited the disruptive impact of U.S. tariffs, which cost it €1.3 billion in the first half of the year, along with restructuring costs and lower margins on electric vehicles. VW now expects its 2025 operating return on sales to be between 4% and 5%, down from a previous forecast of 5.5% to 6.5%. The results highlight the vulnerability of European automakers to U.S. trade policy and other industry-wide challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>US chip manufacturer Intel has officially abandoned its plans to construct a major €30 billion semiconductor factory in Magdeburg, Germany. The decision was confirmed after the company announced significant second-quarter losses and job cuts in the US.

German officials called the reversal a setback but noted that Intel's internal struggles and the "America first" policy of the Trump administration made the decision unsurprising.</p>

These schemes exploit a legal loophole allowing institutions to claim multiple refunds on a single tax payment on stock dividends, with global losses estimated at over €140 billion.

The recall effort, organized by pro-independence civic groups and backed by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), accuses the KMT legislators of being too close to Beijing. Analysts view the vote as a litmus test for the "resist China, protect Taiwan" campaign and a potential indicator of the political climate ahead of future elections.

However, this growth has brought increased scrutiny and debate over various issues. The article explores whether the league is too dependent on Clark, noting that other stars like A'ja Wilson and newcomers like Paige Bueckers are also major factors. It also addresses criticisms of refereeing and the idea that a lack of dunking holds the league back, concluding that the WNBA's emphasis on fundamentals and team play is a strength appreciated by true basketball fans.</p>

          <p>UK retail sales volumes rose by 0.9% in June, rebounding from a significant drop in May, according to the Office for National Statistics. The increase was largely attributed to the month's hot weather, which boosted supermarket sales of drinks and summer clothing, as well as fuel sales as more people traveled. However, the rebound was smaller than some economists had forecast, and overall sales growth for the second quarter remained slow. This suggests that while weather provided a temporary lift, underlying consumer confidence and economic momentum may still be weak. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As England prepares to face Spain in the Euro 2025 final, this analysis identifies key tactical areas that could decide the match. England may look to exploit Spain's high defensive line with the hold-up play of Alessia Russo and the pace of its forwards, a strategy Germany used effectively in the semi-final. A crucial challenge for the Lionesses will be containing Spain's talented midfield, particularly by limiting service to pivot Patri Guijarro and closing down space for Aitana Bonmati and Alexia Putellas.

Furthermore, India has been actively pursuing a "multi-alignment" strategy, advancing trade agreements with other partners like the UK and the EU.
