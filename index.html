        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced plans to impose "substantial" new tariffs and restrict U.S. chip exports on countries that maintain digital services taxes, asserting these policies are designed to harm American technology companies. Speaking on Truth Social, Trump warned that unless these discriminatory actions are removed, his administration would implement significant additional tariffs on affected countries' exports to the U.S. and institute restrictions on highly protected U.S. technology and chips. This declaration intensifies his long-standing efforts to pressure global trade partners into abandoning digital taxes, which primarily target large, often American, tech firms. The move underscores a confrontational approach to international economic policy.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has removed Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook from her position, an unprecedented and dramatic move that significantly escalates his attacks on the central bank's independence. Trump's letter, posted on Truth Social, cited allegations of mortgage fraud, claiming Cook made false statements on documents regarding her primary residence in both Michigan and Georgia. This decision, following a criminal referral from the Federal Housing Finance Agency Director, is expected to trigger a legal clash, potentially reaching the Supreme Court, as Fed governors can only be removed "for cause." The action could profoundly reshape the Fed's governing board and impact financial market stability.</p>

          <p>Korean Air and U.S. aviation giant Boeing announced a significant deal for 103 new aircraft, including 787, 777, and 737 passenger jets. This agreement followed a meeting between South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and President Trump, where discussions also included U.S. tariffs on the Asian country. The purchase aims to modernize Korean Air's fleet and enhance its competitiveness, particularly as it merges with Asiana Airlines, marking a pivotal moment for the carrier. Boeing emphasized that this landmark order would support approximately 135,000 jobs across the U.S., aligning with President Trump's broader agenda to boost American business and exports.</p>

          <p>SpaceX again postponed the 10th test flight of its Super Heavy-Starship rocket, this time due to unfavorable weather conditions, following an earlier scrub caused by a ground system issue. This mission is crucial for testing corrective upgrades after three prior catastrophic failures and aims to restore confidence in the rocket's viability and reliability. The flight objectives include rigorous testing of the Super Heavy first stage during descent and sending the Starship upper stage on a sub-orbital trajectory to the Indian Ocean, deploying Starlink simulator satellites and testing engine restarts. Concerns persist among some experts about the vehicle's readiness for NASA's planned 2027 moon landing, highlighting the complex technical challenges ahead.</p>

          <p>The Pickett Fire, currently the largest wildfire in the San Francisco Bay Area this year, is threatening Napa Valley vineyards, with smoke posing a significant economic risk to the region's vital wine industry. Even if flames spare the orchards, smoke taint can ruin grapes, as tragically experienced by winery owner Chris Jambois, who lost two vintages to smoke from previous fires. This recurring threat is alarming for local businesses already grappling with increasingly frequent wildfires.

          <p>An American tourist, John Rudat, was reportedly stabbed in the face by a Syrian asylum seeker in Dresden, Germany, after courageously intervening to protect two women being harassed on a tram. The 21-year-old paramedic sustained a facial wound from a six-inch blade, leading to the arrest and subsequent release of a suspect due to insufficient detention grounds. Rudat, from upstate New York, later criticized Europe's immigration policies on Instagram, raising questions about law enforcement and accountability for non-citizens. The U.S. Embassy in Berlin condemned the attack, urging German authorities to swiftly bring the perpetrators to justice and ensure public safety.</p>

          <p>California Republicans have launched another attempt to block Governor Gavin Newsom’s redistricting plan, Proposition 50, from the November ballot, filing a 432-page lawsuit with the state Supreme Court. They argue the initiative, which aims to replace nonpartisan congressional districts with maps favoring Democrats, violates the state Constitution by presenting an "illegal, take-it-or-leave-it choice" to voters. Democrats crafted the measure as a retaliatory strike against GOP-led redistricting in Texas. While legal experts view the Republican argument as "weak," the case highlights an ongoing, high-stakes battle over electoral maps and the significant power of California voters to amend their state constitution.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump expressed a desire for another meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, possibly this year, during talks with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung. Trump lauded his relationship with Kim and claimed North Korea had reduced rocket firings since his return to the White House, despite recent test launches. He controversially suggested the U.S. should seek ownership of land for its massive military base in South Korea, rather than a lease, a notion likely to anger South Korean officials. These remarks underscored Trump's unconventional foreign policy approach and his ongoing pressure for greater compensation from allies for U.S. troop presence.</p>

          <p>A survivor of child sexual assault, identified as "Zora," is pleading with Elon Musk to prevent links to images of her abuse from circulating on his social media platform, X. The BBC investigation found thousands of such photos and videos being sold via X accounts, with traders operating globally. Zora, whose abuse occurred over 20 years ago, expressed outrage that her suffering is still commodified, emphasizing that distributors are "complicit perpetrators." Despite X's "zero tolerance" policy for child sexual abuse material, critics argue that platforms must do more to prevent repeat offenders from creating new accounts and to better protect vulnerable individuals.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and several other Southern California airports experienced a temporary ground stop due to anticipated thunderstorms, causing flight disruptions. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued the stop, affecting departures from distant airports like Phoenix, Denver, and Salt Lake City, whose flight paths would traverse the potentially impacted region. This precautionary measure, which lasted over an hour, was prompted by a 30% probability of thunderstorms near Palmdale and a surge of monsoonal moisture across the Western U.S. Similar ground stops at Long Beach and John Wayne airports had expired earlier, indicating a regional weather phenomenon.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Food price inflation in the UK has surged to its highest point in 18 months, reaching 4.2% this month, up from 4% in July, according to the British Retail Consortium. Staples such as butter, eggs, and chocolate have experienced "significant increases" due to a combination of high demand, tightening supply, and rising labor costs. Poor cocoa harvests, exacerbated by climate change and crop disease, specifically contributed to the higher chocolate prices. This notable uptick adds to the overall UK inflation rate, which stands at 3.8%, and underscores a broader trend of food prices increasing by approximately 37% over the past five years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC study reveals that UK local authorities are accumulating spiraling debts, totaling £122 billion, forcing them to sell off public assets like schools and care homes. This debt, equivalent to £1,700 per UK resident, grew by 7% last year, despite previous curbs on commercial borrowing. Councils are increasingly granted "capitalisation directions" to sell assets or take short-term loans for day-to-day services, further exacerbating their financial woes. Experts warn this "payday loans for local government" approach erodes public value, calling for long-term government solutions to address systemic underfunding and unsustainable borrowing that threatens essential community services.</p>

          <p>Russian tennis player Daniil Medvedev experienced a notable on-court meltdown during his U.S. Open first-round match, sparked by a photographer's error that granted his opponent, Benjamin Bonzi, a second first serve.

Despite winning the point and the next two sets, he ultimately lost the match in five sets, smashing his racket in frustration.

          <p>The Trump administration has appealed a federal judge's ruling that Alina Habba unlawfully served as acting U.S. attorney for New Jersey, sending the case to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Matthew Brann's decision mandated Habba's disqualification from ongoing cases, stating her tenure since July 1, 2025, was without lawful authority. Habba, a Trump appointee, publicly criticized the "blue slips" tradition that allows senators to block nominees and cited her arrest of a congresswoman. The Justice Department, which had previously attempted a workaround to keep Habba in the role, is challenging the judges' decision, raising questions about executive authority.</p>

          <p>Flock Safety, a major operator of automated license-plate reading systems, has halted pilot programs with federal agencies like Customs and Border Protection and Homeland Security Investigations. The decision follows "confusion and concern" regarding the purpose of federal investigations, particularly in Illinois, where state law prohibits sharing data for out-of-state abortion or undocumented immigrant probes. While Flock Safety stated it was unaware of immigration-related searches, it admitted to poor communication and unclear parameters. The company has since modified its system to clearly identify federal inquiries and restrict broad national searches, limiting them to one-on-one interactions with local police, aiming to enhance data privacy.</p>

          <p>This opinion article suggests that while President Trump aims to de-escalate the Ukraine conflict and position himself as a peacemaker, China is subtly but effectively expanding its influence across Eurasia, a region historically regarded as pivotal for global power. Trump's tariff policies have not only strained U.S.-China economic ties but have also inadvertently prompted India, a key regional rival, to improve relations with Beijing. The significant increase in trade between India and China, alongside Russia becoming a major energy exporter to China, indicates a broader strategic realignment. This geopolitical shift may gradually diminish American influence in Eurasia, creating new power dynamics.</p>

While most Taiwanese believe an invasion is unlikely in the next five years, the government emphasizes "preparing for war, we are avoiding war." The drills, which include urban warfare scenarios and public evacuations, are designed to ready both military and citizens, despite some public skepticism about the urgency and the potential for provocation.</p>
