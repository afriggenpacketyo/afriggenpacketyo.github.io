          <p>The Tall Ships Races have begun in Aberdeen, Scotland, an event expected to draw hundreds of thousands of visitors and billed as Europe's largest free family festival. Dozens of impressive vessels from around the world, including from as far as Peru and Oman, are docked in the harbor for the four-day event. Despite a yellow weather warning for heavy rain, the festival kicked off with entertainment including a concert by the band Deacon Blue. Organizers hope to create a "party city" atmosphere, celebrating international friendship and providing sailing training for young people before the ships depart for Norway.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died on Long Island, New York, after being fatally injured by a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machine. According to Nassau County police, the man entered an unauthorized MRI room while a scan was in progress, and a large metallic chain he was wearing caused him to be forcefully drawn into the powerful magnet. He was transported to a hospital but succumbed to his injuries the following day. Medical experts emphasize that strict safety protocols, including the removal of all metallic objects, are crucial to prevent such rare but catastrophic accidents, as the machine's magnet is always active.</p>

          <p>According to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, at least 32 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli gunfire near aid distribution points in the southern part of the territory. The incidents occurred near sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a US and Israeli-backed organization. Eyewitnesses reported that the gunfire seemed targeted to kill, while the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) stated that troops fired warning shots to deter suspects approaching them before the aid sites opened. The UN has noted that since the GHF began operations, there have been almost daily reports of Palestinians being killed while seeking desperately needed food aid.</p>

          <p>A recent survey indicates that Americans believe they need an average net worth of $839,000 to feel financially comfortable, but financial experts argue this metric can be misleading. Certified financial planner Joy Slabaugh notes that people often fixate on achieving a specific number without considering their underlying values and lifestyle goals. Experts suggest that true financial comfort comes from aligning money management with personal values, such as freedom or security, rather than just tracking net worth. They advise focusing on cash flow and progress toward meaningful goals, as emotional well-being is a critical component of financial security.</p>

          <p>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has altered its long-standing policy, signaling it will no longer challenge the nonprofit status of churches whose clergy endorse political candidates. This change, stemming from a lawsuit by evangelical groups, is seen by some as a victory for free speech but raises concerns about the further politicization of religion. Critics argue that allowing direct electoral involvement could turn houses of worship into de facto political organizations, susceptible to pressure from PACs and partisan congregants. In response, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops reaffirmed that its clergy will continue to refrain from endorsements, focusing instead on forming parishioners' consciences.</p>

          <p>The prospect of President Trump attempting to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has created significant uncertainty, raising complex legal and economic questions. While legal experts believe Trump lacks the authority to remove Powell without "cause," the situation could trigger a messy court battle and destabilize financial markets. The conflict stems from Trump's persistent demands for lower interest rates, which he believes are necessary to bolster the economy. An attempt to fire Powell would be an unprecedented challenge to the central bank's independence, with potential fallout including reduced Fed credibility, volatile markets, and long-term risks to inflation.

Some insiders feel the government still lacks a clear governing plan and is overly influenced by backbench pressure and volatile financial markets.

After a four-year absence from competitive fighting, Pacquiao insists his passion and determination are stronger than ever, aiming to become the oldest champion in his weight class. His opponent, Barrios, is a formidable counter-puncher in his prime, making this a significant challenge for the legendary Filipino fighter. If successful, Pacquiao would make history, extending a storied career that already includes titles in eight different divisions across four decades.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has taken a significant step in regulating digital currencies with President Trump signing the first major crypto legislation into law. The bill, passed with bipartisan support, establishes new rules for stablecoins, a segment of the crypto market where coins are backed by traditional currencies like the dollar. This marks a major shift from the government's previously hands-off approach and is seen by supporters as a move to cement American dominance in financial technology. However, critics worry the new rules are too weak and heavily influenced by industry lobbying, potentially exposing consumers and the financial system to new risks.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army has announced plans to dramatically scale back its Military Working Equid program, putting 141 of its 236 horses, donkeys, and mules up for adoption. These animals primarily serve in ceremonial roles, such as in honor guards and funeral processions at Arlington National Cemetery, and have not been used in combat since 1942. The move is expected to save the Army about $2 million annually from its $185 billion budget. While the program is being reduced, the Army will retain some animals for key ceremonial duties, ensuring the tradition of honoring fallen soldiers with horse-drawn caissons continues.</p>

This barrage is part of an intensified bombing campaign by Russia, which now frequently launches more drones in a single night than it did in entire months last year.

          <p>Syria's interim government has announced an immediate ceasefire in the southern city of Suweida following a week of violent sectarian clashes between local Bedouin tribesmen and the Druze community that have left hundreds dead.

The conflict has drawn international attention, with Israel conducting airstrikes in support of the Druze minority and the U.S. and other regional powers backing the truce.

This follows mass firings and budget cuts at health agencies, which critics say are sowing distrust in vaccines amid soaring measles cases and damaging vital research. A recent Supreme Court decision has empowered agency leaders to implement such changes, alarming scientists who warn of long-term consequences for the nation's health.</p>

          <p>A social media trend known as the "Gen Z stare" has sparked a cross-generational debate about social skills and communication norms. Older generations describe it as a blank, unresponsive look from young people in customer service or conversation, while some Zoomers say it's an overblown reaction to the behavior of their elders. Psychology experts suggest the phenomenon may be linked to a greater reliance on digital interaction and the social isolation of the pandemic, which limited in-person social development. The frustration it causes in older adults may stem from interpreting the lack of nonverbal cues as social rejection.</p>

The city also claims Airbnb's verification processes are inadequate, leaving users vulnerable to false hosts and addresses.

The Trump administration announced the end of the interest-free payment pause for borrowers who were moved into forbearance under the now-defunct SAVE plan. As interest begins to accrue again, those transitioning to other income-driven plans, like the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan, will likely face significantly higher bills. This change is expected to create financial strain for millions of borrowers, with some potentially being forced into default due to the sharp increase in payment obligations.
