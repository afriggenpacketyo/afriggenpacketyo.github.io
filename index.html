          <p>India's women's cricket team defeated England by four wickets in the first one-day international, successfully chasing a target of 259 runs. All-rounder Deepti Sharma was instrumental, scoring an unbeaten 62 to guide the tourists to their second-highest successful chase in the format. Despite a late-game scare, India reached the target with 10 balls remaining, overcoming a sloppy fielding performance. For England, Sophia Dunkley's 83 was a highlight in an otherwise below-par effort.</p>

          <p>OpenAI announced it will use Google's cloud infrastructure for its ChatGPT services, expanding beyond its initial exclusive reliance on Microsoft. This move is driven by the need for more computing power to meet heavy demand for its popular artificial intelligence tools. The company now lists Google, Microsoft, CoreWeave, and Oracle as key infrastructure suppliers. This partnership is seen as a significant win for Google's cloud unit in its competition with Amazon and Microsoft.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has received U.S. government licenses to restart sales of its H20 artificial intelligence chips to Chinese customers, marking a significant policy reversal by the White House. The decision is viewed as a major diplomatic achievement for CEO Jensen Huang, who argued that locking Nvidia out of the Chinese market would undermine American tech leadership. The H20 chip is a less powerful version designed specifically to comply with previous U.S. export controls. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) agenda is finding more success through state-level actions than federal regulations. States like Louisiana, Texas, and Oklahoma have passed laws targeting food additives, seed oils, and sugary drinks, effectively implementing his policies from the ground up. This state-led approach allows Kennedy to advance his vision while navigating the Trump administration's aversion to new federal rules, creating pressure on national food companies.</p>

It explains that the court hears legal disputes between states, with a panel of 15 judges from different countries. The ICJ's jurisdiction depends on whether states have agreed to submit to its authority. While its rulings are legally binding, the court notably lacks an enforcement mechanism, relying on the cooperation of the involved nations.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles police have detained five adults for questioning following the discovery of a young boy's body near dumpsters in Panorama City. The boy, estimated to be around 5 or 6 years old, was found in a parking lot, prompting an investigation by the LAPD's Abused Child Unit. A tip led authorities to a nearby apartment, where they executed a search warrant and took two of the adults into custody.</p>
