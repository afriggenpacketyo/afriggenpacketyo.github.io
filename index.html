          <p>UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood is set to announce a Labour policy requiring migrants to demonstrate significant contributions to society to earn permanent settled status.

          <p>Jim Cramer argues that the current AI boom's massive spending on data center buildouts is fundamentally different from the dot-com bubble of 2000. He contends that today's investments are by established, cash-rich hyperscalers like Meta, Tesla, Google, and Microsoft, unlike the debt-laden, unproven companies of the past. While acknowledging skepticism about immediate AI returns and high costs, Cramer highlights the practical use cases and competitive necessity driving this expenditure. The article asserts that the buildout is a necessity for these dominant companies to maintain their edge, rather than a speculative bubble. (not investment advice)</p>
