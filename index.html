            <p>The United States and Iran are set to meet for a third round of nuclear talks in Muscat, Oman, after making what a senior administration official described as "very good progress" in discussions held in Italy. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi reportedly engaged in face-to-face conversations. While Araghchi expressed cautious optimism, retired Gen. Jack Keane noted concerns about Iran's advanced centrifuge capabilities and ballistic missile technology, which could complicate negotiations compared to the 2015 nuclear deal.</p>

            <p>Jose Hermosillo, a 19-year-old U.S. citizen, was wrongfully detained by border patrol agents in Arizona for nearly 10 days.

            <p>China's commerce ministry has cautioned against trade agreements that undermine its interests, as the Trump administration negotiates with other countries. While respecting efforts to resolve trade disputes with the U.S., China warns it will take countermeasures if deals harm its position. This follows reports of Trump seeking to isolate China through tariff negotiations, even as he expresses a desire for a deal with Beijing. The ministry stated that seeking tariff exemptions by harming others would lead to failure and hurt everyone involved.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump has escalated his criticism of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, labeling him a "major loser" and asserting that the U.S. economy could decelerate without immediate interest rate reductions. Trump claimed that low inflation justifies preemptive rate cuts and his team is exploring the possibility of legally removing Powell before his term expires in May 2026. Experts warn that any attempt to fire Powell could trigger a steep sell-off in U.S. equity markets, highlighting the importance of Federal Reserve independence.</p>

Governor Gavin Newsom announced the expansion of the program, aiming to make the life-saving medication affordable and accessible. The state has already saved $17 million since May 2024 by paying $24 per two-dose unit, down from $41 charged by previous suppliers.

            <p>Doug Sosnik, a former advisor to President Bill Clinton, asserts that Donald Trump has "overread his mandate" and may be heading towards a historically unpopular presidency. Sosnik argues that Trump has fallen into the trap of prioritizing campaigning over effective governance, leading to declining approval ratings. He points to the chaotic rollout of immigration and tariff policies as evidence of a failure to properly plan and execute policy, creating uncertainty and hindering investment decisions. The analysis suggests that Trump's approach risks a steeper fall in job approval compared to previous presidents.</p>

            <p>Chinese enterprises are increasingly using the yuan for international payments due to concerns about the safety and credibility of U.S. assets.

Renmin University's findings indicate a rise in the percentage of enterprises planning to increase yuan settlements.

            <p>Following the death of Pope Francis, the Roman Catholic Church initiates a series of rituals and traditions, including a conclave to elect the next pontiff. The Cardinal Camerlengo formally pronounces the pope dead, breaks the Fisherman's ring, and seals the papal apartment. A nine-day mourning period called Novemdiales follows, with the funeral taking place four to six days after the death. Cardinals from around the world gather in Rome and begin meeting in "General Congregations," a period where papal candidates give speeches. Between 15 and 20 days after the pope's death, the Cardinal Electors of the papal conclave isolate themselves from the world and begin the centuries-old process of choosing the next pope.</p>
