          <p>London's Metropolitan Police have confirmed that the number of arrests at a protest in support of the proscribed group Palestine Action has risen to 890. The demonstration, which turned violent, led to a majority of arrests under the Terrorism Act for supporting a banned organization. The UK government officially proscribed Palestine Action in July, making any form of support for the group a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. This updated arrest total is more than double the initial figure reported on the day of the event.</p>

          <p>The United States Tennis Association is facing criticism for its decision to instruct broadcast partners not to show any on-screen disruptions or negative reactions directed at Donald Trump during the US Open men's final. Critics argue this move is hypocritical and cowardly, pointing out that the tournament has previously televised other forms of protest and fan disturbances. This policy is seen by some as an attempt to shield a political figure from public disapproval, undermining the event's reputation for being an unfiltered and authentic expression of New York's vibrant culture.</p>

          <p>Milda Mitkutė, the creator of the online marketplace Vinted, developed the idea for the platform after realizing she had too many clothes to fit into her new, smaller apartment. In 2008, she and a friend, Justas Janauskas, built a simple website to sell her unwanted items, which quickly gained popularity through word of mouth. Despite early mistakes, such as initially forgetting a 'buy' button and a failed attempt at charging commission, the company grew into Lithuania's first tech 'unicorn.' Vinted is now a major player in the sustainable fashion movement, with over 16 million users in the UK alone.</p>

A significant strike hit the cabinet building in central Kyiv, and officials confirmed at least eight civilian deaths and dozens of injuries across the country. Zelenskyy condemned the attack as a deliberate crime intended to prolong the war and made a renewed appeal to the international community for more advanced military assistance to bolster Ukraine's air defense capabilities against such escalating aggression.</p>

          <p>Erik Prince, the founder of the controversial private military company Blackwater and a known supporter of Donald Trump, is reportedly attempting to purchase drone technology companies in Ukraine. As the conflict has made drones a critical component of modern warfare, Prince is allegedly seeking to enter this valuable sector, coinciding with the Trump administration's considerations for using private contractors in a postwar scenario. However, sources indicate Prince faces a damaged reputation within the industry, and Ukrainian drone firms are considered strategic national assets, making any potential sale unlikely.</p>

          <p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is actively encouraging public school students to recite the Lord's Prayer, a move critics condemn as a violation of the separation of church and state. This stance is contrasted with his 2017 actions, when he raised concerns about a prayer room used by Muslim students in a Frisco school, suggesting it excluded other faiths. This apparent double standard is seen by opponents as part of a broader Christian nationalist agenda that seeks to prioritize one religion over others in public institutions, undermining constitutional principles of religious freedom.</p>

          <p>The criminal referral of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook for alleged mortgage fraud, initiated by Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) head William Pulte, is being called highly unusual by former officials and experts. Typically, such investigations are handled by the agency's independent Office of Inspector General, not the director. Critics suggest the move is politically motivated, as President Trump has used the accusations to try and remove Cook from her post. The referral's directness and the fact that it targets a performing loan have raised concerns about the weaponization of the agency against political opponents.</p>

          <p>Political science experts are expressing caution regarding President Trump's recent proposal seemingly in favor of Chinese students, suggesting it may be a strategic maneuver rather than a genuine policy shift. Professor Dennis Lu-Chung Weng of Sam Houston State University believes the move is likely part of a broader negotiation strategy with China, aimed at creating a more positive atmosphere before a potential meeting with President Xi Jinping. He advises that the current climate in the U.S. remains highly skeptical of China, and there are no immediate signs that visa processes will actually be streamlined.</p>

          <p>A recent human case of the New World screwworm in a Maryland traveler highlights a growing threat to the U.S. as the parasite resurges through Central America and Mexico. The screwworm fly lays eggs in the open wounds of warm-blooded animals, and its larvae consume living flesh, which can decimate livestock herds. For decades, the U.S. has maintained a biological barrier using sterile flies, but that defense has been compromised. The USDA is now investing millions to build new sterile fly production facilities to combat the spread, which could cost the U.S. cattle industry billions if it reaches the border.</p>

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic argues that President Donald Trump's economic strategy increasingly resembles the state-controlled, populist policies of mid-20th century Argentinian leader Juan Perón. The article points to Trump's use of high tariffs to promote domestic production, direct government intervention in private companies like Intel and U.S. Steel, and attempts to undermine the Federal Reserve's independence. This centralization of economic power, driven by personal dealmaking and emergency declarations, is creating a system that rewards political allies and punishes opponents, moving the U.S. away from its traditional market-based capitalism.</p>

          <p>A growing number of federal student loan borrowers are utilizing deferment and forbearance options to pause their monthly payments, with over a quarter of all borrowers now in one of these statuses. Deferments can be more advantageous, as the government may cover the interest on subsidized loans during the pause for reasons like unemployment or economic hardship. Forbearances are more widely available but typically result in interest accumulation, which can significantly increase the total loan balance over time. While these tools prevent default, experts advise they are short-term solutions and income-driven repayment plans are often a better long-term strategy.</p>

          <p>Hypertension, often called the 'silent killer' because it typically has no symptoms, affects over half of Americans by age 40 and is a leading cause of heart disease, stroke, and dementia. New recommendations from the American Heart Association advocate for earlier intervention, including lifestyle changes and medication, once blood pressure exceeds 130/80 mm Hg. Experts stress that early treatment can significantly increase healthy life expectancy by preventing damage to blood vessels in the heart and brain. A new class of medication targeting the hormone aldosterone is also showing promise for patients with treatment-resistant hypertension.</p>

          <p>UK Defence Secretary John Healey has stated that the government is exploring the use of military and other non-military sites to accommodate asylum seekers as an alternative to hotels. This initiative is part of Labour's pledge to end the practice of housing asylum seekers in hotels, which currently accommodates over 32,000 people and has been a source of public protest. The move follows the existing use of two former military bases for this purpose and comes as the new Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, faces the ongoing challenge of a record number of small boat crossings in the English Channel.</p>

          <p>President Trump's second term is characterized by an aggressive and chaotic assault on the traditional U.S. economic model, according to a Guardian analysis. His administration's actions, including imposing steep tariffs, taking government stakes in private tech companies like Intel, and attempting to undermine the Federal Reserve's independence, represent a significant break from the free-market principles of the 'Washington consensus.' While the post-2008 economic landscape was already shifting, Trump's approach is rapidly accelerating the move towards a more state-controlled, unpredictable economic system that is simultaneously deregulatory and interventionist.</p>

          <p>The controversial migrant detention center in a Florida swamp, dubbed 'Alligator Alcatraz,' serves as a powerful example of what The Economist calls Donald Trump's 'security theatre.' This article suggests that regardless of the facility's legal fate, its very existence and name are part of a broader political strategy. The approach focuses on creating highly visible, often harsh symbols of border control and immigration enforcement. This performative security is designed to project an image of strength and control, appealing to his political base even if the practical or legal foundations of such measures are questionable.</p>

          <p>This financial article identifies three companies—PepsiCo, ConocoPhillips, and Watsco—as potentially strong high-yield dividend stocks for investors to consider in September. It notes that an activist investor has taken a significant stake in PepsiCo, signaling belief in its undervalued potential, while ConocoPhillips shares have dipped due to lower energy prices, creating a possible entry point. Watsco, a leader in the HVACR market, is also presented as a solid long-term option despite facing temporary market softness, making it another candidate for dividend-focused portfolios.

          <p>Japan's Prime Minister, Shigeru Ishiba, has announced he will step down from his position after just under a year in office. His resignation follows mounting pressure from within his own Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to take responsibility for a significant defeat in July's parliamentary election. The ruling coalition's loss of its majority in the upper house destabilized his government, and Ishiba's decision to resign preempted a party vote that was widely seen as a no-confidence motion against his leadership. The LDP will now hold an election to choose his successor.</p>

          <p>With the price of gold surging to record highs near $3,600 an ounce, investors are increasingly looking to the precious metal as a safe-haven asset amid economic uncertainty. Financial experts generally recommend gaining exposure to gold through low-cost, liquid exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) rather than owning physical bullion, which involves higher transaction and storage costs. While gold is seen as a hedge against economic downturns and geopolitical instability, financial advisors typically suggest limiting its allocation to a small portion, under 3%, of a well-diversified investment portfolio.

While believed to be a comet, data reveals it has the highest carbon dioxide-to-water ratio ever observed and was active much farther from the Sun than typical comets. Additionally, it displays a teardrop-shaped dust cocoon but lacks a distinct tail, adding to its mystery. Scientists are analyzing the data to understand its unique composition and origins as it continues its journey through our solar system.</p>

          <p>A district judge in Utah has thrown out the state's congressional map, ruling that the Republican-controlled legislature unconstitutionally overrode the will of voters who had approved an independent redistricting commission. The 2021 map was criticized for 'cracking' Democratic-leaning Salt Lake County into four separate districts, ensuring Republican victories in all of them. The ruling is a significant victory for voting rights advocates and a rare pushback against partisan gerrymandering, ordering lawmakers to draw a new, fairer map. The decision comes amid a national trend of both parties attempting to draw districts for political advantage.</p>
