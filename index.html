          <p>Reality television personality Christina Haack celebrated her 42nd birthday by sharing her ambitious goals for the upcoming year with her social media followers. In her post, she expressed a desire to manifest a calmer, more grounded version of herself while pursuing adventures, new design projects, and travel. Haack also highlighted her excitement for launching a new champagne brand in partnership with a French vineyard this fall. The celebration comes shortly after she settled her divorce from her third husband in May and debuted a new relationship with CEO Christopher Larocca.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has announced a forthcoming 50% tariff on all copper imports, a move aimed at encouraging domestic production of the essential metal. The announcement caused copper prices to surge to a record high, and shares of U.S. copper miners like Freeport-McMoRan also rose. The U.S. currently imports nearly half of its copper, primarily from Chile. According to the Commerce Secretary, the investigation justifying the tariff on national security grounds is complete, and the new duty is expected to be formally implemented by the end of July.

          <p>Search and rescue operations are ongoing in Central Texas following catastrophic flash floods that have claimed at least 109 lives, with over 100 people still missing. The majority of fatalities and missing persons are in Kerr County, which was devastated when the Guadalupe River swelled to historic levels. A federal disaster has been declared, enabling FEMA support, though scrutiny has arisen regarding the adequacy of weather warnings and the impact of federal budget cuts on forecasting capabilities. The disaster was particularly tragic at Camp Mystic, a girls' summer camp where numerous campers and staff died.</p>

          <p>Officials in Yolo County, California, have confirmed that the remains of all seven workers missing after a massive explosion at a fireworks warehouse have been recovered. The fatal blast occurred at a facility that was reportedly not permitted to store fireworks, and the property is owned by a Yolo County Sheriff's Lieutenant. The victims' families have been waiting for days for answers and have expressed concern that controlled detonations of remaining materials could destroy evidence. State and federal agencies, including the ATF, are investigating the incident, which is now transitioning to a law enforcement-based probe.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has lifted a lower court's injunction, permitting the Trump administration to move forward with its plan for large-scale layoffs across the federal government. The decision allows the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to resume its efforts to reorganize and reduce the workforce at nearly two dozen agencies while legal challenges continue. In its unsigned opinion, the court stated the government was likely to succeed on the merits but expressed no view on the legality of specific agency plans. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, criticizing the majority for greenlighting the president's "legally dubious actions."</p>

          <p>This review of the new "Superman" movie criticizes the film for presenting a protagonist who is earnest but ultimately obtuse and lacking in personality. Directed by James Gunn, the reboot attempts to pivot away from cynicism, but in doing so, creates a Man of Steel who comes across as naive and overwhelmed. While David Corenswet looks the part, his performance is described as mostly dazed. The plot is deemed entertaining but impatient, with a tone that shifts recklessly between silly gags and brutal violence, struggling to find a consistent, earnest footing despite its pop-punk sensibilities and talented supporting cast.</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened to impose tariffs as high as 200% on imported pharmaceuticals, though he suggested the industry would have a grace period of up to a year and a half to onshore its manufacturing. This announcement is part of a broader strategy using national security grounds to justify new trade barriers and encourage domestic production. The pharmaceutical industry has pushed back, warning that such tariffs could disrupt supply chains, increase costs for patients, and deter investment in the U.S. Further details on the proposed tariffs are expected by the end of the month.

The lawsuit detailed that the abuse began when the victim was 10 years old and continued for over two years, with the attendant threatening the boy to ensure his silence. The perpetrator, who was later convicted of a felony, had allegedly been the subject of misconduct complaints for decades, yet remained employed and had access to vulnerable students.

          <p>The UK's Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has forecast that the annual cost of the state pension's "triple lock" policy will reach £15.5 billion by 2030, three times the original estimate. The triple lock guarantees the state pension rises annually by the highest of inflation, wage growth, or 2.5%. The OBR report described the UK's public finances as being in a "relatively vulnerable position," warning that the rising cost of age-related spending makes the current fiscal path unsustainable in the long term.

          <p>The recent passage of major cuts to means-tested programs like Medicaid and food stamps has reignited a debate within the Democratic party about the political viability of different types of social welfare policies. This article explores the argument between pursuing universal programs, like Social Security, versus means-tested benefits targeted at the poor. While some argue universal programs are more politically durable, the historical record is mixed, as programs like unemployment insurance have faced cuts while targeted benefits have grown. The author contends that the primary challenge is not just resilience but the initial difficulty of enacting expensive universal programs in an electorate often resistant to tax increases.</p>

          <p>Consumers and restaurants in the U.S. are facing searingly high beef prices, which reached a record of $5.98 per pound in May. The primary driver of the price surge is a classic case of supply and demand, with American appetite for beef remaining strong while the nation's cattle herd has shrunk to its smallest size since the 1960s. This reduction in supply is largely due to multi-year drought conditions across the U.S., which diminished feedstock and forced ranchers to sell off cattle. Experts predict that prices are likely to remain elevated for the next several years as the industry works to rebuild its herds.</p>

          <p>Disneyland's popular Haunted Mansion attraction will close temporarily starting August 11 for its annual transformation into the Haunted Mansion Holiday. This seasonal makeover, inspired by Tim Burton's "The Nightmare Before Christmas," is a yearly tradition that prepares the ride for the park's Halloween season. A Disney official confirmed that the brief downtime is an expected part of the park's schedule. The attraction is slated to reopen on August 22, just in time for the start of Halloween Time at the Disneyland Resort, a period that typically sees high visitor traffic.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held meetings with U.S. congressional leaders, including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Vice President JD Vance, to discuss the U.S. commitment to Israel's security and a potential ceasefire in Gaza. The visit comes as the Trump administration faces criticism for its recent military strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, an action taken in coordination with Israel. Netanyahu praised the "unmatched" cooperation with the U.S., stating it has created new opportunities for peace. He reaffirmed Israel's goal to eliminate Hamas's capabilities in Gaza and secure the release of all hostages.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated he is "not happy" with Russian President Vladimir Putin over the war in Ukraine, accusing him of throwing "bulls---" at the U.S. in response to peace efforts. During a Cabinet meeting, Trump cited the high casualty rate in the conflict and said the war "should have never happened." His comments came just a day after the administration announced it would send more weapons to Ukraine, following a brief, unexplained pause in a previous shipment. Trump suggested that the war has turned out to be tougher than Russia expected, partly due to U.S. military aid to Ukraine.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled against several non-profit organizations that sued the Trump administration for rescinding hundreds of millions of dollars in grant funding intended for violence prevention. While Judge Amit P. Mehta described the administration's decision to terminate the grants as "shameful" and likely to harm vulnerable communities, he concluded he lacked the authority to issue an injunction to stop the cuts. The Department of Justice had informed the groups that their work no longer aligned with agency priorities, which now focus more directly on law enforcement operations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis praises the new "Superman" film for its brilliant and consciously sincere approach, shifting away from the grimness of recent superhero adaptations. Director James Gunn surrounds the hero, played with a "regular-guy sensibility" by David Corenswet, with other super-powered individuals, which helps to define what makes Superman exceptional. The film is described as lighthearted and fun, evoking Saturday-morning cartoons with whimsical concepts and a willingness to be silly. By building modern society's discomfort with pure altruism into the plot, the movie effectively makes the case for the hero's inherent goodness in a refreshing way.</p>

          <p>Members of Parliament have voted to pass the Football Governance Bill, which will establish an independent regulator to oversee the top five divisions of men's football in England. The legislation is designed to protect the financial sustainability of clubs and put fans' interests at the heart of the game, following several high-profile club collapses. The bill was reintroduced by the new Labour government after failing to pass before the last election. During the debate, MPs rejected amendments that would have mandated more free-to-air Premier League matches and scrapped the ban on alcohol in stadium stands.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For savers with $20,000, choosing between a certificate of deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account involves a trade-off between rate security and liquidity. A detailed comparison shows that short-term CDs, such as 3-month or 1-year terms, currently tend to earn slightly more interest than a high-yield savings account with a competitive rate. However, for longer terms like 18 or 24 months, the high-yield savings account could potentially yield more, assuming its variable rate remains stable. The decision ultimately depends on an individual's financial goals and their need for access to the funds. (not investment advice)</p>

This marks the second consecutive game where Schüller has scored a crucial goal for her team. The 27-year-old Bayern Munich star has stepped into a leadership role for Germany following the retirement of Alexandra Popp, and her goal-scoring form will be vital for her country's chances in the tournament.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is planning to eliminate the long-standing requirement for most travelers to remove their shoes at U.S. airport security checkpoints. The rule was implemented in 2006 following intelligence about potential threats and the failed attempt by "shoe bomber" Richard Reid in 2001. The change would bring the screening process for general passengers more in line with the expedited process for those enrolled in TSA PreCheck, who are already allowed to keep their shoes on.

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs is scheduled to be sentenced on October 3, 2025, after a jury found him guilty on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. While he was acquitted of more serious sex trafficking and racketeering charges, the judge ordered him to remain in detention until sentencing, citing flight risk. Each conviction carries a maximum sentence of 10 years, though legal experts believe the final sentence is unlikely to reach the 20-year maximum. Prosecutors are expected to argue for a sentence of roughly four to five years, while the defense has suggested a term closer to two years.</p>

          <p>The Court of Arbitration for Sport has cleared French fencing champion Ysaora Thibus of doping, accepting her unusual explanation that she was contaminated with a banned substance through kissing. Thibus tested positive for ostarine, but she argued it entered her system via bodily fluids exchanged with her then-partner, who was using a product containing the substance. The court found that scientific evidence supported the possibility of contamination through kissing over a nine-day period. Concluding that Thibus bore no fault or negligence, the court dismissed an appeal from the World Anti-Doping Agency, which had sought a four-year ban.</p>

          <p>Provisional data from the U.S. Geological Survey illustrates the dramatic and rapid nature of the deadly Texas floods, particularly along the Guadalupe River in Kerr County. A flood gauge near the hard-hit Camp Mystic recorded a water level increase of over 25 feet in just two hours, reaching levels associated with "disastrous life-threatening flooding." The region, known as "flash flood alley," is particularly vulnerable due to its topography and limestone geology, which prevents rainwater from soaking into the ground. This geographical context helps explain the swift and devastating impact of the intense storm.</p>
