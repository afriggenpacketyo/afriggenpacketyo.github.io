          <p>Chinese scientists have engineered a novel vaccine booster, SABER, capable of amplifying immune responses against cancer and viral infections by up to 150-fold. This advancement facilitates the delivery of vaccine antigens directly to the endoplasmic reticulum within cells, overcoming traditional delivery challenges. The technology has shown promise in enhancing treatments for malignancies like melanoma and liver cancer, as well as improving vaccine effectiveness against rapidly mutating coronaviruses. The research, published in Nature, highlights the potential of SABER to act as a dedicated 'courier' for antigens, significantly boosting the body's immune defenses.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new tariffs, including a 10% baseline tariff on imports from many countries, have commenced, signaling a major departure from established global trade practices. Higher 'reciprocal' tariffs, ranging from 11% to 50%, are scheduled to follow, impacting goods from the European Union, China, and Vietnam. These tariffs have already shaken global stock markets, leading to substantial losses in market value. While some exemptions have been made for certain product categories, the move represents a significant shift in how the United States engages in international trade, potentially leading to renegotiations and adjustments over time.</p>

          <p>The Japanese Grand Prix practice sessions faced disruptions due to recurring grass fires beside the Suzuka track, leading to two stoppages during the final practice. Despite mitigation efforts implemented after similar incidents on Friday, the fires persisted, believed to be caused by sparks from the cars igniting dry grass. Formula 1's governing body focused on dampening the grass further before qualifying. Lando Norris led the final practice, raising concerns about race conditions, especially with rain forecasted for the race day. </p>

          <p>Livia Tossici-Bolt was convicted of breaching an abortion clinic protection zone in Bournemouth, sparking a free speech controversy. The anti-abortion campaigner was given a conditional discharge and ordered to pay £20,000. The case drew attention from the US State Department, which expressed concern about freedom of expression in the UK. The conviction highlights the ongoing debate surrounding buffer zones around abortion clinics and the balance between free speech and the protection of women accessing healthcare.</p>

          <p>The Peace Corps is the latest federal agency to be targeted by Elon Musk’s unofficial “department of government efficiency”. A Doge representative visited the Peace Corps headquarters and requested access to the agency’s financial records. The agency has notified everyone that it received a visit from Doge on Friday and it expects “additional visits”. It’s unclear what Doge’s directive is with the Peace Corps, but obtaining access to the agency’s financial records indicates it could be looking to cut costs and cancel programs.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration mistakenly sent notices to some Ukrainian refugees informing them that their legal status was being revoked and they must leave the U.S. immediately. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) attributed the notices to an 'error' and retracted the emails, stating that the Uniting for Ukraine (U4U) parole program has not been terminated. Despite the retraction, concerns remain about the administration's potential future actions regarding the status of Ukrainians in the U.S.</p>

They argue that Santos's 'unparalleled crimes' made a mockery of the election system. Prosecutors highlighted Santos's lies, theft of money from donors, and lack of remorse. The proposed sentence reflects the severity of Santos's deceit and the need to prevent him from reoffending.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's sweeping cuts to the federal bureaucracy have included slashing a little-known government agency that channels grant money to America's libraries. One staff member at the Institute of Museum and Library Services sent grant coordinators a chilling email, warning the agency would "not be able to work or respond to your emails" and that there was no "information about future timelines related to this action." The cuts will undermine Americans' access to library resources, which are vital to bringing communities together.</p>
