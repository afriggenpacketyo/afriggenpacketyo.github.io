          <p>The Liberal Democrats in the UK are advocating for the establishment of police counters in public venues like supermarkets, shopping centers, and libraries across England and Wales. The party argues this move would enhance public confidence in policing and simplify the process of reporting crimes. To fund this initiative, they propose abolishing the roles of Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs), which they estimate would free up over £100 million. This policy announcement comes as the party seeks to appeal to more liberal-minded Conservative voters by positioning itself as a party of understated patriotism.</p>

          <p>A shooting at the Mango nightclub in Birmingham has left one man in critical condition and three other individuals injured. West Midlands Police responded to the incident on Bristol Street around 3:00 AM BST, discovering three men and one woman with gunshot wounds. Shortly after, authorities arrested three suspects in their 20s and 30s on suspicion of violent disorder after locating their vehicle on the M6 motorway. Police have cordoned off a major section of Bristol Street and are appealing to the public for any information, including dashcam or mobile phone footage from inside the busy venue.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued an executive order imposing a new $100,000 annual fee for applicants to the H-1B visa program, which is designed for skilled foreign workers. The administration states the measure is intended to curb "abuse" of the program and encourage companies to hire American workers, with the fee applying to new requests for six years. Critics, including immigration lawyers and business groups, warn that this substantial fee will have a devastating impact on small businesses and start-ups, potentially pricing them out of hiring necessary foreign talent. The move marks a significant shift in U.S. immigration policy for skilled labor. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russia is reviving the Soviet-era "Intervision" song contest, positioning it as a conservative counterpoint to the Eurovision Song Contest, from which Russian artists are currently banned. President Vladimir Putin's initiative aims to promote "traditional values" and "national identity," with officials explicitly stating there will be no "perversions," a remark aimed at Eurovision's pro-LGBTQ+ stance. The competition features 23 participating countries, including former Soviet republics and BRICS partners like Brazil, China, and India. The event underscores the deepening cultural and political divide between Russia and the West.</p>

          <p>Peter and Barbie Reynolds, a British couple held by the Taliban in Afghanistan for nearly eight months, have been released and are returning to the United Kingdom. Their son expressed he was "ecstatic" and grateful for the Qatar-brokered negotiations that secured their freedom. The couple, aged 80 and 76, had lived in Afghanistan for almost two decades running a charitable training program. The Taliban, who never disclosed the reason for their detention, stated the pair had broken Afghan laws. Despite the ordeal, the couple has expressed a desire to return to Afghanistan to continue their work.</p>

          <p>Estonia has formally requested consultations with NATO allies under Article 4 after three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets violated its airspace over the Gulf of Finland. The Estonian government reported the jets entered without permission, had their transponders off, and did not maintain radio contact. In response, jets from Italy, Finland, and Sweden were scrambled as part of NATO's mission to bolster its eastern flank, with a NATO spokesperson calling it another instance of "reckless Russian behaviour." Russia has denied the violation, but the incident marks the second time this month a NATO member has invoked Article 4 due to Russian military activity.</p>

These groups can be invaluable for sharing important reminders about school events, organizing teacher gifts, and fostering a sense of community among new parents. However, they are also a source of stress for many, leading to information overload, competitive parenting, and the spread of divisive opinions or misinformation. Some parents are choosing to leave the groups entirely to avoid the "background noise" and anxiety, while others find them to be a necessary tool for navigating the complexities of school life.</p>

          <p>A historic global treaty to protect the world's oceans is set to become international law after receiving its 60th ratification, the critical number needed for it to take effect. The High Seas Treaty, which has been in development for two decades, will allow for the creation of marine protected areas in international waters. This is a crucial step toward the goal of protecting 30% of the world's oceans by 2030 to combat damage from overfishing, pollution, and climate change. Environmental groups have celebrated the milestone as a "monumental achievement" for global cooperation in conserving marine biodiversity.</p>

          <p>Erik Siebert, the acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, has resigned from his post. His resignation came shortly after President Trump publicly stated, "I want him out," amid concerns that Siebert's office was not pursuing a mortgage fraud case against New York Attorney General Letitia James, a political rival of the president. In an email to his staff, Siebert announced his resignation without detailing the reasons. Trump told reporters he wanted Siebert removed because he had been supported by two Democratic senators, suggesting that made him untrustworthy for the role.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Senator Ted Cruz has sharply criticized Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman Brendan Carr, accusing him of acting like "a mafioso" for pressuring ABC to suspend host Jimmy Kimmel. Cruz stated that Carr's threat to review ABC's broadcast license over Kimmel's monologue about a slain conservative activist was "dangerous as hell." While Cruz said he was "thrilled" that Kimmel was suspended, he warned that using government power to regulate media speech could set a dangerous precedent that Democrats could later use to silence conservatives. President Trump defended the FCC chairman, stating he disagreed with Cruz's assessment.</p>

          <p>A prominent Japanese defense researcher has warned that the United States' declining engagement in Asia and weakening ties with India are undermining key regional alliances, potentially creating a strategic opening for China. Speaking at the Beijing Xiangshan Forum, the expert identified the Quad—an alliance of the U.S., Japan, Australia, and India—as a critical tool for balancing against China. The researcher expressed concern that President Trump's waning interest in the framework and the deteriorating U.S.-India partnership could be "potentially dangerous" from Japan's strategic perspective, threatening regional stability.</p>

          <h2>Investigation Reveals Widespread Fraud and Counterfeit Goods on Walmart's Online Marketplace</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 21:25:37 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CNBC investigation has uncovered significant issues with counterfeit products and fraudulent sellers on Walmart's third-party online marketplace. As Walmart rapidly expanded its e-commerce platform to compete with Amazon, it relaxed its seller vetting processes, making it easier for bad actors to join. The report found dozens of vendors using stolen identities of legitimate businesses to sell counterfeit goods, including potentially dangerous fake health supplements and beauty products. Former employees stated they were pressured to approve seller applications quickly, turning the platform into what one expert called the "Wild West" for banned Amazon sellers.</p>
