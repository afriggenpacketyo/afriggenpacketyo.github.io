          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will impose a 50% tariff on copper imports, a move intended to bolster domestic production. The announcement caused copper prices to surge to a record high, benefiting U.S. mining companies like Freeport-McMoRan. President Trump also signaled future plans for steep duties on other sectors, including a potential 200% tariff on pharmaceutical imports, which could take effect after giving companies a year and a half to relocate production to the U.S. The copper tariff is expected to be formalized by the end of July, aligning it with existing duties on steel and aluminum.</p>

          <p>Canadian authorities have charged four men, including two active members of the Canadian Armed Forces, for allegedly plotting to form an anti-government militia. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) stated the group conducted military-style training and planned to forcibly seize land in the Québec City area. During a search, police seized numerous explosive devices, dozens of firearms, and thousands of rounds of ammunition. This incident highlights growing concerns about extremism within the Canadian military, following a 2022 report that noted a rise in members with ties to extremist groups.</p>

          <p>During a visit to Washington, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced he is nominating U.S. President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, citing their joint strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities. The visit also focused on negotiations for a 60-day Gaza ceasefire and hostage release, with Trump expressing optimism about reaching a deal. Meanwhile, regional conflicts continue, with reports of a Houthi attack in the Red Sea killing three mariners and five Israeli soldiers being killed in Gaza. Israel's defense minister also proposed a plan to house displaced Palestinians in a "humanitarian city" in Rafah, a move critics fear could lead to forced emigration.</p>

          <p>The UK's Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecasts that the annual cost of the state pension triple lock policy will reach £15.5 billion by 2030, three times the original estimate. The triple lock, in place since 2011, ensures the state pension rises annually by the highest of inflation, wage growth, or 2.5%. The OBR warns that rising pension spending, combined with other age-related pressures, places the UK's public finances on an unsustainable long-term path. Despite the warning, the government has affirmed its commitment to the policy to provide security for pensioners.</p>

          <p>Following significant cuts to means-tested programs like Medicaid, a debate has intensified over the best strategy for expanding the U.S. welfare state. This article analyzes the political arguments for universal programs, such as Social Security, versus targeted, means-tested benefits. While proponents of universality argue such programs are more politically resilient because they benefit a broader constituency, the historical record is mixed, with some universal programs like unemployment insurance also facing cuts. Ultimately, the piece suggests that while universal programs may have substantive policy advantages, such as easier administration, their political superiority is not guaranteed, especially given the difficulty of enacting the large tax increases required to fund them.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has lifted a lower court's injunction, clearing the way for the Trump administration to move forward with its plan for mass layoffs of federal workers. The plan is part of a broader initiative led by the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to significantly reduce the size of the federal government. In its unsigned opinion, the court stated that the administration is likely to succeed on the merits of its case that the underlying executive order is lawful. This decision allows the administration to resume its reorganization efforts across nearly two dozen agencies while the legal challenges continue, with Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissenting.</p>

          <p>A Reddit user claiming to be an airline baggage claims manager is warning travelers not to discard their luggage tags at the airport due to a potential fraud scheme. The user alleges that scammers are using information from the tags to submit fraudulent claims for missing items, complicating the reimbursement process for legitimate claims. While the tags contain limited information like a name and flight number, the poster believes it is enough for thieves to create a fake identity and file for payment. A travel industry expert expressed skepticism about the scam's prevalence but still advised travelers to keep their tags until any baggage issues are resolved and then discard them at home.</p>

          <p>Rescue operations are ongoing in central Texas following catastrophic flash floods, with the death toll now at 109 and dozens of people still missing.

The fire, which reportedly started from a burning car on a motorway, has burned approximately 700 hectares and led to the closure of Marseille Provence airport.

          <p>Consumers and restaurants in the U.S. are facing record-high beef prices, with the cost per pound reaching its highest level since tracking began in the 1980s. The primary driver is a simple case of supply and demand, as the nation's cattle herd has shrunk to its smallest size since the 1960s. This decline is largely attributed to persistent drought conditions, which have reduced feedstock and forced ranchers to sell off cattle. Despite the availability of cheaper alternatives like pork and poultry, robust consumer demand for beef persists, and experts predict prices will remain elevated for the next several years as herds are slowly rebuilt.</p>

This review notes that the movie functions as an intentional throwback to the 1978 classic, which may please fans tired of the grim superhero trend but could disappoint others with its dramatic simplicity. While the film incorporates modern elements like social media, its core feels nostalgic, even replicating specific plot points from the original. David Corenswet's performance as Superman is seen as convincing and empathetic, while Rachel Brosnahan's Lois Lane brings a welcome modernity to the character.</p>

This article calculates the potential earnings for both, showing that short-term CDs currently offer slightly higher returns than top high-yield savings accounts. For example, a 1-year CD at 4.40% APY would earn $880, while a savings account at 4.30% would earn $860, assuming the rate remains static. However, for longer terms, the variable rate of a savings account could potentially outperform a fixed CD rate, though this is not guaranteed as rates are likely to change.

This polarization is fueled by massive financial investment and the technology's growing ubiquity, creating parallel realities where evidence is often spun to support either side. The piece argues this ideological war obscures more nuanced discussions about AI's real-world impacts on employment, society, and the environment.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Reaffirms August 1 Deadline for New Tariffs Amid Confusion</h2>

          <p>President Trump is escalating his trade war, vowing to impose a 50% tariff on copper and threatening a 200% tariff on pharmaceuticals. The announcements came amid confusion over tariff deadlines, with the president clarifying that a new wave of duties on goods from 14 countries will take effect on August 1, with no extensions granted. This reversed an earlier extension of the deadline from July 9. The aggressive trade strategy, which economists warn could worsen inflation, has so far been met with a muted reaction from global stock markets, with some investors seemingly betting that the president will ultimately back down from the most severe threats.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is planning to allow many travelers to keep their shoes on during airport security screenings, ending a rule that has been in place for nearly two decades. According to people familiar with the matter, the agency briefed industry members on the upcoming change this week. The requirement for most passengers to remove their shoes began in 2006, following the failed attempt by Richard Reid, the "shoe bomber," to ignite explosives on a flight in 2001. Travelers enrolled in the TSA PreCheck program are already exempt from this rule, and this change would extend that convenience to a broader group of passengers.</p>

          <p>The National Weather Service has issued a severe thunderstorm watch for a large portion of the Mid-Atlantic, including central Virginia, effective through Tuesday evening. Forecasters warn of the potential for damaging winds, hail, and frequent lightning. The area is also under a slight risk for excessive rainfall, which could lead to localized flash flooding, particularly in urban and poor-drainage areas. This severe weather alert follows a heat advisory, where high humidity made temperatures feel as high as 109 degrees.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>No-closing-cost home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are attracting homeowners, but it's crucial to understand the trade-offs. Lenders often recoup these waived upfront fees by charging a higher interest rate or imposing penalties if the line of credit is closed early, typically within three to five years. This article advises borrowers to calculate the break-even point to see if paying a higher rate over time is more expensive than paying closing costs upfront. Lenders may also have stricter credit and equity requirements for these products, so homeowners should read the fine print carefully before committing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Campus police at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) are investigating an act of vandalism where an anti-Israel slogan was spray-painted on a campus building. The words "Death to the IOF," a slur for the Israel Defense Forces, were found on the Stata Center over the weekend, tagged with the name of a pro-Palestinian activist group. An MIT spokesperson condemned the act as a threat of violence and confirmed increased security measures are being taken.

          <p>A Justice Department memo stating no evidence of a Jeffrey Epstein "client list" was found has sparked outrage among President Trump's supporters. Many prominent MAGA figures are criticizing administration officials, particularly Attorney General Pam Bondi, for what they perceive as a cover-up and mixed messaging after she previously alluded to having such files. The backlash represents a notable moment of public criticism from Trump's own base, with some calling for Bondi's resignation. The controversy taps into long-running conspiracy theories that the government is protecting powerful individuals connected to Epstein.</p>

          <p>The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has cleared French fencing champion Ysaora Thibus of doping, accepting her explanation that she was contaminated with a banned substance through kissing. Thibus tested positive for ostarine in January 2024 but argued it entered her system via bodily fluids exchanged with her partner, who was unknowingly using a product containing the substance. The court found that scientific evidence supported this possibility and ruled that Thibus bore no fault or negligence. The World Anti-Doping Agency had appealed for a four-year ban but was dismissed by the court's decision.</p>

          <p>Data from the U.S. Geological Survey provides a stark look at the severity of the flash floods that devastated central Texas. Flood gauges along the Guadalupe River, particularly near the heavily impacted Camp Mystic in Kerr County, recorded an unprecedented surge in water levels. One gauge showed the river rising over 25 feet in just two hours before it stopped transmitting data. The area, known as "flash flood alley," is particularly vulnerable due to its terrain and limestone geology, which prevents water from soaking into the ground, causing rapid and dangerous runoff into valleys and riverbeds during intense rainstorms.</p>

          <p>Amazon has expanded its Prime Day sales event to a four-day affair, testing consumer resilience at a time of economic uncertainty due to shifting U.S. tariff plans. Despite this, spending is projected to hit a record $23.8 billion, with shoppers expected to hunt for deals on electronics and back-to-school supplies, categories affected by tariffs on Chinese imports. While President Trump's trade policies are designed to pressure other countries, the costs are often passed to U.S. consumers. So far, a strong job market and retailers absorbing costs have sustained consumer spending, but the extended sale will be a key indicator of shoppers' willingness to spend.</p>

The attack, carried out by hired criminals for cash, targeted a business sending communications equipment and other aid to Ukraine. The plot was coordinated through the secure messaging app Telegram, where a Wagner-linked account tasked a UK-based drug dealer to organize the sabotage. The case reveals Russia's strategy of using local criminals as proxies to sow chaos and target entities supporting Ukraine, with one of the main organizers pleading guilty under the UK's new National Security Act.</p>

Ives, one of Tesla's most bullish analysts, had called Musk's political venture a "tipping point" that required board action to end the ongoing "soap opera."
