          <p>Regencell Bioscience Holdings, a Hong Kong-based company focused on traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for ADHD and autism, has seen its stock price skyrocket, despite reporting no revenue. The surge follows a stock split and coincides with increased attention on alternative medicines, potentially influenced by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s role as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The company's treatments center on a TCM formula developed in partnership with practitioner Sik-Kee Au, father of the Regencell CEO, and the CEO controls a vast majority of the outstanding shares. The stock's volatility and lack of revenue raise questions about its sustainability, with online discussions reflecting both enthusiasm and skepticism. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A senior Trump administration official clarified the U.S. position on Iran's nuclear program, stating that while Iran is not currently building a nuclear weapon, it remains "very close" to having the capability. This clarification follows earlier congressional testimony from Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, who stated that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and that Supreme Leader Khamanei has not authorized a nuclear weapons program. Despite this, Iran's enriched uranium stockpile is at its highest levels, and the country continues to develop ballistic missiles and UAVs, raising concerns about its regional influence. The International Atomic Energy Agency also reported that it has no credible indications of an ongoing, undeclared structured nuclear program.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is defending his decision to hold a national inquiry into grooming gangs, reversing his previous stance where he accused those calling for one of "jumping on a far right bandwagon." This shift follows the release of a report by Baroness Louise Casey, who initially opposed a national inquiry but changed her mind due to a lack of cooperation from local councils and organizations. The Casey report recommends a national police operation to review unacted-upon child exploitation cases and a national inquiry overseen by an Independent Commission. The inquiry will address sensitive issues, including the ethnicity of perpetrators, which the report highlights as disproportionately Asian in some areas, while emphasizing the need to remain calm and interrogate data carefully.</p>

          <p>JetBlue Airways is implementing additional cost-cutting measures due to weaker-than-expected travel demand, making it unlikely the company will break even this year. CEO Joanna Geraghty informed staff of the changes, which include cutting off-peak flights, trimming unprofitable routes, and pausing plans to retrofit older Airbus A320 jets. The airline is also reassessing hiring plans and considering combining leadership roles and reducing travel spending. The company is hopeful that demand will rebound, but the path back to profitability is expected to take longer than initially anticipated.</p>

          <p>Mothers in the United States are bearing the brunt of rising costs, facing challenges in managing household expenses, childcare, and work-life balance. Concerns about the cost of food and childcare are growing, with some families seeing their monthly grocery bills double. The situation is compounded by the persistent gender pay gap, with mothers earning significantly less than fathers for full-time work. Experts suggest policies like paid family leave, flexible work schedules, and affordable childcare could help alleviate the burden, while also addressing the underlying issue of the "motherhood penalty," which negatively affects mothers' wages and career advancement.</p>

          <p>Five years after General Assimi Goita seized power in Mali, the country continues to face significant security and political challenges. Despite the initial promise of improved security, jihadist attacks have increased and spread to new regions.

While some observers note improvements in fighting corruption, the economy struggles, and education initiatives suffer due to Western countries suspending their work amid increasing Russian involvement.

          <p>Republicans are proposing to eliminate economic hardship and unemployment deferments for federal student loan borrowers as part of their budget bill. These deferments allow borrowers to pause monthly payments during job loss or financial difficulties, often without accruing interest. Critics argue that nixing these deferments could lead to increased loan defaults, particularly for those facing unexpected economic setbacks. The Trump administration projects a potential rise in student loan defaults from 5 million to 10 million in the coming months.</p>

The settlement, if approved by the court, would end the Sacklers' control of Purdue, the maker of OxyContin, and prevent the family from selling opioids in the U.S. The funds will be distributed over 15 years to compensate victims and combat the opioid crisis, with over half of the funds being distributed in the first few years.

          <p>Sarah Lin, a Bronx high school student, is advocating for the passage of a bill that would require closed captions in movie theaters across New York State. Inspired by her mother's hearing loss, Lin is working with the Hearing Loss Association of America's New York Chapter to promote the Open Captioning Accessibility Act. She hopes this will provide a more reliable option for people with hearing difficulties, as some assistive devices have proven faulty. Lin envisions the act serving as a model for national legislation, encouraging others to contact their representatives in support of the bill.</p>

          <p>Despite claims that the Trump Organization's newly announced smartphone, the T1, will be manufactured in the U.S., experts believe it will likely be produced in China. The phone, priced at $499 and running Android, is said to be "built in the United States" by the Trump Organization. However, industry analysts suggest the device was likely designed and will be manufactured by a Chinese original device manufacturer (ODM). They point to the lack of readily available smartphone manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. as a key factor.</p>
