        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has accused India of "arbitrage" by purchasing discounted Russian oil, refining it, and then reselling the products to regions like Europe that have sanctioned Russia. Since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, India's imports of Russian crude have surged, making it Moscow's largest customer. This practice has drawn criticism from the Trump administration, which recently imposed additional tariffs on Indian exports in response. However, some analysts note that the U.S. initially encouraged India to buy Russian oil to prevent a global price spike.</p>

          <p>Despite recent market volatility, a Fidelity Investments study shows that many investors, particularly newer ones, remain confident in their portfolios. However, seasoned investors are more cautious, highlighting a divide in risk tolerance. Certified financial planner Tim Maurer advises that all investors should "always be calibrating" their risk based on their long-term goals and changing life circumstances. Experts recommend maintaining a well-diversified portfolio, including stocks and high-quality bonds, and utilizing vehicles like ETFs to navigate uncertain market conditions.

          <p>A second airman from F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming has been charged with involuntary manslaughter within a month, following two separate fatal shootings.

This incident follows the August arrest of another airman in connection with the July shooting death of a fellow service member, which prompted the Air Force to suspend the use of the M18 handgun over safety concerns.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Miami delivered a mixed ruling in a lawsuit concerning the rights of detainees at an immigration facility in the Florida Everglades nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz." U.S. District Judge Rodolfo Ruiz dismissed claims regarding detainees' lack of confidential access to lawyers, deeming them moot after the administration designated a different facility for their hearings. However, the judge also transferred the remaining First Amendment violation claims to Florida's middle district, where the detention center is located, allowing that part of the case to proceed in a new jurisdiction.</p>

          <p>German prosecutors have officially charged Taleb A., a 50-year-old Saudi Arabian doctor, with six counts of murder and hundreds of counts of attempted murder for driving a car into a Christmas market in Magdeburg. The attack, which occurred in December 2024, resulted in the deaths of five women and a nine-year-old boy, and injured over 300 others. Authorities describe the suspect as an anti-Islam activist who allegedly acted out of frustration over a civil lawsuit. The investigation suggests the attack was planned weeks in advance without accomplices.</p>

          <p>This article details the struggles of families seeking justice against private equity-backed prison healthcare companies like Corizon (now YesCare) and Wellpath, which have filed for bankruptcy amidst numerous lawsuits alleging negligent and fatal care. These bankruptcy filings often pause civil lawsuits, complicating efforts for accountability. However, in some cases, victims' families have successfully formed tort claimants' committees within the bankruptcy proceedings, securing larger settlements and even equity in the reorganized companies. This has provided an unconventional path to holding the firms accountable for systemic failures in correctional healthcare.</p>

In nations like Pakistan, women may be forced to forfeit their dower and can face retaliatory legal action from their husbands. In the Philippines, divorce remains illegal, forcing couples into a costly and psychologically taxing annulment process.

          <p>This opinion article argues that the persistent disputes in the South China Sea stem from two mutually exclusive narratives, where one side's defensive actions are seen as aggressive by the other. This perception gap is rooted in conflicting national interests, ambiguous post-World War II territorial arrangements, and differing interpretations of historical claims versus international law. The author suggests that without a joint, fact-based, and collaborative process to narrow this divide, de-escalation will remain difficult.

A gay man and an early LGBTQ+ rights activist, Gernreich was a fashion pioneer who championed unisex clothing and challenged societal norms.

          <p>Taiwan's military is planning a massive expansion of its drone fleet, aiming to procure nearly 50,000 new unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) by 2027. This move is part of a new strategy to classify drones as consumable munitions, similar to bullets, which will accelerate the procurement process. The tender notice details plans to acquire five different categories of drones, ranging from small multi-rotor platforms for short-range reconnaissance to larger fixed-wing systems. This significant investment in UAV technology is intended to enhance Taiwan's defensive capabilities amid rising regional tensions.</p>

          <p>Air Canada is set to gradually resume operations after its flight attendant union, CUPE, announced a tentative agreement, ending a strike that began over the weekend and disrupted travel for hundreds of thousands of passengers. The breakthrough came after renewed talks with a government-appointed mediator. A key issue resolved in the new agreement is pay for work performed on the ground before flights. While the airline is restarting flights, it cautioned that a full return to its regular schedule could take up to a week as it repositions aircraft and crew.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An increasing number of single men are choosing to become fathers on their own, often through surrogacy, a path once almost exclusively taken by women. This growing trend reflects rising singlehood rates and a cultural shift where fatherhood is seen as a central source of purpose for men, independent of romantic partnership. While the process is logistically complex and prohibitively expensive for many, organizations like Men Having Babies are seeing a surge in interest. This demographic shift challenges traditional family norms and highlights how modern concepts of masculinity are evolving to embrace nurturing and caregiving roles.</p>

          <p>This article reviews Spike Lee's latest film, "Highest 2 Lowest," a remake of Akira Kurosawa's "High and Low" starring Denzel Washington as a successful music producer facing a moral dilemma. The plot centers on his chauffeur's son being mistakenly kidnapped instead of his own, forcing him to confront his detachment from the world outside his luxury high-rise. The review praises the film's energetic, distinctly New York style, particularly in its latter half, and Washington's sharp performance. It interprets the film as a self-aware satire from Lee, questioning what happens when an influential artist risks losing his edge.</p>

          <p>The article explores the recent explosion in popularity of matcha, suggesting its second wave is driven less by its traditional flavor and more by its cultural currency on social media. The drink's vibrant green color and the ritual of its preparation make it highly "aesthetic" and shareable on platforms like TikTok. Unlike its previous niche trendiness in the mid-2010s, matcha is now mainstream, often consumed in highly sweetened and customized latte forms that mask its earthy taste. This trend reflects a broader consumer desire for experiential products and a sense of shared reality in an algorithmically isolated world.</p>

However, his disciplinary case remains unresolved, and the criminal investigation was dormant until a new victim came forward in 2024, highlighting criticism of the slow and opaque processes for handling abuse cases in Olympic sports.</p>

This move represents a major test for the Federal Communications Commission's current media ownership rules, which cap a single owner's reach at 39% of the country.

          <p>This article highlights PepsiCo and McDonald's as two potentially strong dividend stocks for investors. It notes that PepsiCo's stock looks appealing after a recent price decline, offering a dividend yield above 3.5% and a 53-year history of consecutive annual raises. Similarly, McDonald's has returned to sales growth, maintains a high operating margin, and offers a 2.6% yield. The author suggests that the current market focus on tech stocks has created an opportunity for income investors to acquire shares in these established companies at a reasonable valuation.

          <p>A second man, 21-year-old Reece Parish, has pleaded guilty to robbery for his role in stealing a BMW that later crashed into a Sunderland care home during a police pursuit.

Parish's co-accused, Sam Asgari-Tabar, had previously pleaded guilty to the same charge.

          <p>President Trump has declared his intention to ban mail-in voting before the 2026 midterm elections, stating that an executive order is currently being drafted to achieve this goal. During a meeting, he asserted that mail-in ballots are "corrupt" and claimed that states must follow the federal government's direction on election administration. However, Article I of the U.S. Constitution grants states the authority to regulate elections, a power that can only be altered by Congress, not the president. Legal experts and election officials have noted that a presidential ban would be unconstitutional and chaotic to implement.</p>

          <p>This article examines the widespread use of dietary supplements in the U.S., where at least 60% of people use them despite often dubious evidence for their effectiveness. Health columnist Anahad O’Conner explains that the industry is loosely regulated under a law that allows companies to make vague health claims without undergoing rigorous clinical trials. While some supplements like creatine can offer modest benefits under specific conditions, many others, such as collagen, lack scientific backing. Experts advise consumers to be cautious and prioritize getting nutrients from a healthy diet rather than relying on a largely unregulated, multi-billion-dollar industry.</p>
