          <p>The Food and Drug Administration is considering withdrawing its emergency use authorization for Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine for healthy children under five, a move that could leave this age group without an available shot. Pfizer confirmed it is in discussions with the agency to keep the authorization for the upcoming fall and winter, stating the review is not related to the vaccine's safety or efficacy. This potential decision follows other policy changes since Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a known vaccine skeptic, took office.</p>

          <p>A 39-year-old man, Andrew Barber, was successfully rescued after being lost for nine days in the remote wilderness of British Columbia. He survived by drinking pond water, eating what he could find, and building a makeshift shelter from sticks and moss. To attract attention, Barber carved "HELP" on a rock and drew an "SOS" in the mud, which ultimately led to his discovery by a search and rescue helicopter. He was found severely dehydrated with a leg injury but is expected to recover.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders have publicly appealed to President Trump to defend Europe's security interests during his upcoming summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin concerning the war in Ukraine.

In a statement, the leaders emphasized that any lasting peace must respect international law and Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

The growth was primarily driven by a 90% year-over-year increase in the circulation of its USDC stablecoin, which now stands at $61.3 billion. Despite a net loss due to IPO-related charges, the company projects continued growth and announced a new proprietary blockchain called Arc for stablecoin payments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Documents released by the Uvalde school district show that its former police chief, Pete Arredondo, had attended an active shooter training just two months before the Robb Elementary School massacre. The training explicitly stated that an officer's first priority is to immediately move in and confront the attacker, a protocol Arredondo failed to follow, waiting 77 minutes instead. The records, released after a long public battle for transparency, also detail the deceased gunman's history of disciplinary issues at school.

          <p>E.J. Antoni, President Trump's nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), has suggested the agency should suspend its monthly employment report.

The nomination follows Trump's firing of the previous BLS commissioner over revisions to jobs data, which are a standard part of the agency's process for ensuring accuracy.

While most reverse mortgages are federally insured and regulated, they are not without risks. Homeowners must still pay for property taxes, insurance, and maintenance, and falling behind can lead to foreclosure. The loan balance grows over time, which can deplete equity intended for heirs, making it a complex decision that depends on an individual's long-term housing plans and financial situation.

          <p>Authorities have revealed that the man who fired hundreds of rounds at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) headquarters in Atlanta had expressed distrust of COVID-19 vaccines. The gunman, Patrick Joseph White, reportedly blamed the vaccine for making him depressed and suicidal before the attack, during which police officer David Rose was killed. White died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the scene. Investigators recovered 500 shell casings and five firearms from the site of the violent incident.</p>

          <p>Ford is recalling more than 103,000 of its F-150 pickup trucks from model years 2023-2025 due to a potential defect with the rear axle hub bolt. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the bolt can fatigue and break, which could lead to a loss of drive power or cause the vehicle to roll away when not in park, increasing the risk of a crash. Ford stated it is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to the issue and will notify owners to have the rear axle shaft assemblies replaced for free.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has released its annual human rights reports with a drastically reduced scope, eliminating entire categories of abuses that were previously documented. An analysis shows the reports are about one-third the length of last year's, with sections on issues like women's rights, government corruption, and restrictions on free assembly removed. The administration claims the "streamlined" reports adhere more closely to legal requirements, but critics and human rights advocates argue the cuts let authoritarian governments off the hook and weaken a vital diplomatic tool.</p>

According to internal documents, the plan calls for 600 troops to be on standby, a move that would represent a significant expansion of the military's role in domestic law enforcement. This development comes as the Trump administration has already deployed the National Guard in unconventional ways, raising legal and jurisdictional questions.</p>

          <p>England has officially entered its fourth heatwave of the summer, with temperatures surpassing 30°C (86°F) in multiple regions. The sustained period of hot, dry weather has led to "nationally significant" water shortfalls, according to the national drought group, impacting farms, wildlife, and increasing wildfire risk. Millions of people are now under hosepipe bans to conserve water. The ongoing heat has also caused disruptions to rail services due to the effects of dry soil on the tracks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion column argues that claims of success regarding President Trump's tariff policies are premature and overlook fundamental economic principles. The author refutes the idea that tariff revenue is "free money" from other countries, explaining that these taxes are paid by American importers and ultimately passed on to consumers as higher prices. While the long-term goal may be to reshore manufacturing, this will also come at a cost. The article concludes that declaring "Mission Accomplished" on the economy ignores the looming challenges and the real-world impact on American households and businesses. (not investment advice)</p>
