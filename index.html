          <p>An Orange County couple was convicted of felony child abuse for causing their infant son to suffer permanent brain damage, leaving him blind and quadriplegic. Prosecutors stated the parents, who identified as "vegan mucus-free fruitarians," failed to provide proper nourishment and subjected the baby to extreme temperature changes. The child, now 5, had been found unresponsive and emaciated by doctors in 2020 after the couple refused many life-saving treatments for him.</p>

          <p>As Europe experiences a severe heat wave, the European Commission has formally proposed a new climate goal to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2040, compared to 1990 levels.
