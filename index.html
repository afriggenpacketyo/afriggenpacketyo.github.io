          <p>A small, 3.0 magnitude earthquake occurred Saturday night, with its epicenter located near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. Residents across the New York City area and New Jersey reported feeling brief shaking, with some describing it as feeling like a car had impacted their house. Despite the surprise and confusion captured on security cameras, authorities reported no injuries or significant structural damage from the event. The U.S. Geological Survey noted that while earthquakes are uncommon on the East Coast, this minor tremor was not a cause for major alarm, distinguishing it from the larger 4.8 magnitude quake that occurred in April 2024.</p>

          <p>Over 3,200 unionized Boeing workers in the St. Louis area have voted to reject the company's latest contract offer and are set to go on strike. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union stated that the offer was insufficient and did not adequately reflect the skill and dedication of its members. These employees are responsible for assembling critical defense hardware, including fighter jets and the MQ-25 aerial refueling drone. This action marks the first strike at Boeing's St. Louis defense hub since 1996, impacting a division currently expanding to accommodate production of the new F-47 Air Force fighter.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-03 15:48:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has unexpectedly surpassed California in the installation of new utility-scale solar energy, adding over 3 gigawatts of capacity last year. This growth is primarily driven by major utilities like Florida Power & Light, which are capitalizing on solar energy's increasing cost-effectiveness compared to natural gas. State regulations that fast-track approval for projects under 75 megawatts have also accelerated development. However, the industry faces future headwinds from the federal rollback of solar tax credits, which is projected to cause a significant drop in rooftop solar installations, and growing constraints on the existing power grid.

          <p>Dyfed-Powys Police intervened to shut down a large, unlicensed music event in Myherin forest, Ceredigion, during the early hours of Sunday. The illegal rave, held at the Cefn Croes wind farm, prompted Natural Resources Wales to advise the public to avoid the area due to safety concerns and potential environmental harm. Police monitored the gathering as attendees began to disperse throughout the day, with a small number remaining by late afternoon. Authorities emphasized the disruption such events cause and stated they will robustly investigate any criminal offenses connected to the illegal gathering.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced plans to impose prison sentences of up to five years for people smugglers who use social media to advertise illegal crossings into the UK. This move targets criminal gangs who promote dangerous journeys across the English Channel online, which the Home Office estimates were used by 80% of the 25,000 people who have made the crossing this year. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper condemned the criminals for selling a false promise of safety for profit. The Labour government is also planning a major overhaul of the asylum appeal process to manage the increasing number of arrivals.</p>

          <p>The death toll from a collapse at the El Teniente copper mine in Chile has risen to five, with rescue teams still searching for one missing worker. The incident at the world's largest underground copper mine was triggered by a 4.2 magnitude earthquake on Thursday, which caused several tunnels to collapse deep below the surface. The state-owned mining company, Codelco, confirmed the fatalities and stated that its primary focus is now on recovering the final trapped miner. Authorities are currently investigating whether the tremor was a result of natural tectonic activity or was induced by the mining operations themselves.</p>

          <p>This opinion article contends that Israel's international reputation is being severely damaged by extreme voices from both its political right and left. It cites provocative statements from far-right ministers, such as calls to conquer Gaza, which are used by critics to validate accusations against the state. Simultaneously, it points to influential figures on the far-left, including author David Grossman and the head of B'Tselem, who have accused Israel of committing genocide, lending weight to the country's delegitimization. The author concludes that both sides provide ammunition to Israel's detractors, leaving the moderate majority to bear the consequences of this polarizing rhetoric.</p>

Dr. Oz stated the money is intended to assist with workforce development, system adjustments, and the implementation of technology like telehealth.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers managed to generate just enough offense to defeat the Tampa Bay Rays 3-0, clinching a series victory and ending a nine-game road trip with a winning record. After struggling to score for 18 consecutive innings, the team manufactured runs through aggressive baserunning, a double-steal, and a key sacrifice fly. Pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered 5 ⅔ scoreless innings, and the bullpen secured the shutout. Despite the win, concerns remain about the team's slumping lineup, which has prompted manager Dave Roberts to experiment with the batting order, including swapping Shohei Ohtani and Mookie Betts.</p>

          <p>Canadian Trade Minister Dominic LeBlanc expressed that negotiators are prepared to continue working toward a new trade deal with the United States, despite being "disappointed" by the Trump administration's decision to increase tariffs to 35% on certain goods. LeBlanc characterized recent talks in Washington as constructive and stated that his team left with a better understanding of American concerns. The White House justified the tariff hike by citing Canada's previous retaliatory tariffs and a perceived lack of action on immigration and fentanyl flows. Canada is the second-largest trading partner of the U.S., buying over $350 billion in American goods last year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris won the Hungarian Grand Prix, securing his third victory in the last four races and narrowing the championship points gap with his teammate, Oscar Piastri, to just nine. The win came despite a challenging start where Norris dropped to fifth place on the first lap after a tight battle with Piastri. Norris had to execute a difficult one-stop tire strategy to recover, a gamble that ultimately paid off. He admitted after the race that he has not been making his championship fight easy for himself and needs to improve in the second half of the season.</p>

          <p>The final Test match between England and India is set for a dramatic conclusion on its fifth day, with the series outcome hanging in the balance. Chasing a record-breaking 374 runs, England reached 339-6 before rain and bad light stopped play. Centuries from Harry Brook and Joe Root had put England in a commanding position, but a late surge from India's seam bowlers, who took three quick wickets, turned the match into a cliffhanger. England now needs 35 more runs to win the series 3-1, while India needs four wickets to level the series 2-2.</p>

          <p>White House officials appeared on Sunday political shows to defend President Trump's economic policies following a week of poor economic data and the controversial firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics chief, Erika McEntarfer. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer stated the president has "real concerns" about the reliability of jobs numbers, while NEC Director Kevin Hassett called for a "fresh set of eyes" at the agency. The moves have drawn sharp criticism, with former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers calling the firing "way beyond anything that Richard Nixon ever did" and warning that such actions are characteristic of democracies giving way to authoritarianism.

          <p>New Mexico's Democratic Governor, Michelle Lujan Grisham, has stated that the new federal requirements for Medicaid are practically impossible to implement. She argued that the changes, which include work requirements and other administrative burdens, will create more paperwork for all levels of government and healthcare providers without improving health outcomes. With two out of five New Mexicans on Medicaid, the governor expressed deep concern that the policy will lead to rural hospitals closing and a catastrophic loss of coverage. She estimated the changes would cost her state between $12 and $13 billion over the next decade, a loss no temporary reserve funds could sustain.</p>

          <p>A 20-foot Minke whale has died in New Jersey's Barnegat Bay after being struck by a boat on Saturday afternoon. The collision was severe enough to nearly capsize the vessel and throw a passenger overboard, who was reportedly unharmed. The Marine Mammal Stranding Center had been alerted to the whale's presence in the bay shortly before the incident. Due to shallow water and tidal conditions, crews were unable to immediately access the whale's carcass, which is resting on a sandbar. A necropsy is planned for Monday to determine the exact cause of death.</p>

          <p>Despite a self-imposed deadline passing without a new trade agreement, negotiations between the U.S. and Canada are set to continue. Canada now faces a 35% U.S. tariff rate on certain goods, though a carve-out for products compliant with the existing USMCA free trade deal provides a significant buffer for nearly 90% of its exports. President Trump has justified the tariffs by citing security concerns and Canada's recognition of a Palestinian state, while Canada has retaliated with its own tariffs. Analysts note that both sides are under pressure to reach a deal, but Canada appears willing to prioritize a quality agreement over a rushed one. (not investment advice)</p>

This trend is a response to both the flavor preferences of younger, more diverse generations and a broader pullback in consumer spending.

Swiss Business Minister Guy Parmelin stated that options include purchasing U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) or increasing investments by Swiss companies in the U.S. The high tariff rate, one of the most severe in President Trump's global trade reset, targets Switzerland's $48 billion trade surplus with the U.S. and threatens its crucial export-oriented economy.
