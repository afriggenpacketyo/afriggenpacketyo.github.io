          <p>Billy Joel has announced the cancellation of all his upcoming concerts, including a large-scale tour, due to a diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). According to a statement released on his social media, this condition has been exacerbated by recent performances, leading to hearing, vision, and balance problems. Joel is currently undergoing physical therapy and has been advised to refrain from performing during his recovery. He expressed his sincere apologies to his audience and thanked them for their understanding, while prioritizing his health and hoping to return to the stage in the future.</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened to impose a 50% tariff on all goods from the European Union and a 25% import tax on iPhones not manufactured in the United States, reigniting trade tensions. The EU did not immediately respond, but analysts speculate that Trump's actions are intended to increase leverage ahead of trade negotiations. The announcements have sparked worries globally, with US and EU stocks falling after the latest threats. Trump has long singled out Apple as a firm he hopes to see manufacture in the US, with limited effect.</p>

          <p>Following the Trump administration's revocation of Harvard University's eligibility to enroll international students and the revocation of hundreds of student visas, uncertainty is growing on US campuses. While the order regarding Harvard was swiftly blocked by a judge, academics and students are considering leaving the US to work or study elsewhere. This follows funding cuts, hiring freezes, and visa revocations, including those related to participation in protests against the war in Gaza. Many international students are now re-evaluating their plans to study in the U.S. due to the current political climate.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has temporarily halted the Trump administration's ban on Harvard University enrolling international students, hours after the university filed a lawsuit challenging the ban. The suit came after the Department of Homeland Security revoked Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students, alleging the school tolerated anti-American agitators. The judge stated that Harvard demonstrated it would sustain immediate and irreparable injury without the restraining order. The ban affected over 7,000 current visa holders, including Princess Elisabeth of Belgium.</p>

He notes that while problems exist, Harvard is not the extremist institution its critics claim, and the government's actions, such as cutting research funding, are harmful and misguided.</p>
