          <p>Dan Evans secured a significant victory against Frances Tiafoe at Queen's Club, advancing to the last 16, while Cameron Norrie was defeated by Jakub Mensik. Jacob Fearnley also progressed after defeating Alex Bolt. Evans' win marks his first against a top-20 player since 2023, and only his second on grass. Mensik's victory makes him the second teenager in a decade to win a main draw match at Queen's, following Jack Draper in 2021, as he overcame Norrie in three sets in the heat of London. Evans is set to face either Brandon Nakashima or Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard, while Fearnley might play Taylor Fritz, and Mensik will compete against Roberto Bautista Agut. </p>

          <p>Following the murder of a Minnesota lawmaker and her husband, and the wounding of another lawmaker and his wife, House Republicans held a tense conference call to discuss security concerns. Members requested increased police presence in their home districts, but law enforcement officials indicated that more funding from Congress would be necessary to provide such protection.

          <p>The Trump administration is considering expanding its travel ban to include up to 36 additional nations, according to a State Department memo. These countries, primarily in Africa, Central Asia, the Caribbean, and the Pacific Islands, are identified as having deficient vetting and screening processes. The memo requires diplomats to detail how they will address U.S. concerns, which include terrorism risks, unreliable identity documents, and high visa overstay rates. Critics argue that the travel bans are discriminatory, while the Department of Homeland Security asserts that limiting entry from these countries will enhance national security.</p>

          <p>Israel attacked Iranian state television and warned residents in Tehran to evacuate following another wave of Iranian missile strikes on Israel. The Israeli military accused Iran of deliberately targeting civilians, while Israel claimed to be hitting military targets and capabilities.

The report notes a disproportionate number of men from Asian ethnic backgrounds among suspects for group-based child sexual exploitation in certain police forces. The Home Secretary has announced a new national inquiry into grooming gangs, with recommendations including mandatory data collection on ethnicity and nationality for suspects in child sexual abuse cases, as the report concludes that ignorance and fear of being seen as racist meant organizations turned a blind eye to abuse.</p>
