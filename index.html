          <p>Jasveen Sangha, known as the "Ketamine Queen," has agreed to plead guilty to federal charges for distributing the ketamine that led to actor Matthew Perry's death. She is one of five individuals, including doctors and Perry's assistant, accused of supplying the actor with the drug, leading to his fatal overdose in October 2023. Sangha faces a maximum of 60 years in prison for her role in a case that has highlighted a broader network for illicit ketamine distribution in Hollywood.</p>

The appointment was confirmed by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who praised Bailey's record of challenging "weaponized government." This move is unusual as the deputy director role is typically held by a career FBI staffer, whereas Bailey's background is in the Army and as a state prosecutor. Bailey, a known Trump loyalist, will resign from his current position in September.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security stated that an immigrant truck driver accused in a fatal Florida crash received his work permit under the Biden administration after being denied under the Trump administration. Harjinder Singh, who allegedly caused a crash killing three people, entered the U.S. illegally in 2018 and obtained a commercial driver's license in California. The case has ignited a political dispute between federal officials and California Governor Gavin Newsom regarding immigration enforcement and state licensing policies.</p>

This race to the bottom erodes profit margins, which in turn stifles the resources available for new investments, creating a cycle of stagnation that is symptomatic of deeper structural problems in the economy.</p>

          <p>Leeds United's 1-0 win over Everton has sparked a debate over the decisive penalty, awarded after the ball struck defender James Tarkowski's arm. While Tarkowski's arm was close to his body, the referee deemed his movement unnatural, a decision that has divided pundits and fans. The incident highlights the ongoing confusion and controversy surrounding the handball rule in football, with Everton's manager calling the decision "wrong" while others argued it was correctly applied according to the current laws of the game.</p>

          <p>Professor Malik Peiris, a renowned virologist who helped identify the SARS coronavirus in 2003, has warned that the emergence of another pandemic is a certainty. He expressed particular concern about respiratory viruses, noting that animal-to-human virus jumps have become more frequent in recent decades. Peiris stated that despite the lessons from COVID-19, the world may not be significantly better prepared for the next global health crisis. He emphasized the need for a more integrated approach to public health that considers human, animal, and environmental factors.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent fired at a moving vehicle in Southern California after the driver sped away from an immigration stop. The Department of Homeland Security stated the agent fired in self-defense after the driver allegedly struck two agents, though video taken by a passenger does not show this. The incident, which involved agents smashing the car's windows, has drawn criticism from immigrant advocates and highlights escalating tensions surrounding federal immigration enforcement tactics in so-called "sanctuary" jurisdictions like California.</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers who fled Texas to prevent a vote on a Republican-led congressional redistricting plan have returned to the state capitol. By leaving, they broke the legislature's quorum for weeks, successfully killing the special session and drawing national attention to the issue. While Governor Greg Abbott has already called another session to pass the maps, Democrats claim victory in their effort to build a legal case against what they call a "racist map." The standoff is part of a larger national battle over gerrymandering.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's announcement that he was arranging a meeting between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Kremlin has offered a noncommittal response. While Trump presented the move as a significant step toward peace, a Putin aide stated only that they would consider "raising the level" of the existing negotiation delegations. This cautious language from Moscow casts doubt on whether a direct presidential summit will actually occur, highlighting the significant diplomatic hurdles that remain in the U.S.-led push to end the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>General David Allvin, the U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff, has unexpectedly announced his intention to retire, effective around November 1. This move is surprising as Allvin will have served only two years of the typical four-year term for the position. The announcement comes amid a series of dismissals of senior military officials by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth since January. It remains unclear whether General Allvin's decision to retire was voluntary or if he was asked to step down.</p>

          <p>The union representing over 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants is refusing to end its strike, defying a federal order to return to work. The Canada Industrial Relations Board declared the job action illegal, but the union stated it will continue the strike, which has grounded Canada's largest airline and stranded thousands of passengers. Union leaders say they are willing to face penalties, including fines or jail time, insisting that a negotiated settlement is the only acceptable resolution.

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the United Kingdom should approve China's proposal for a new, large-scale embassy at the former Royal Mint site in London. The author suggests that the project symbolizes China's view of London as a critical global partner and offers the UK a chance to engage in long-term diplomacy. While some raise security concerns, the article frames the approval as a test of Britain's international standing and capacity to manage complex relationships, contrasting it with the UK's recent trend of selling off diplomatic properties for short-term financial gain.</p>

Curran, who was recently left out of England's national squads, finished with an unbeaten 50 runs. The two-time defending champions are now well-positioned to advance in the tournament.</p>
