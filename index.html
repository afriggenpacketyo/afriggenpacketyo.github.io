          <p>The U.S. and Ukraine have finalized a joint economic investment deal, granting the U.S. access to Ukrainian rare earth minerals. The agreement establishes a "United States-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund," described as an "economic partnership" to develop mineral, oil, and gas projects. Funded through direct investment, U.S. aid, and mineral licensing revenue, the deal ensures Ukraine retains ownership of its natural resources. The fund aims to secure supply chains essential to U.S. economic prosperity and national security by investing in critical minerals and infrastructure projects within Ukraine. This deal is part of a broader effort to broker an end to the Russia-Ukraine war and address President Trump's concerns about U.S. aid to Kyiv.</p>

          <p>Alibaba's cloud computing unit has launched the Qwen3 family, featuring eight enhanced AI models ranging from 600 million to 235 billion parameters. According to analysts, these models demonstrate that Chinese companies have significantly closed the technology gap with U.S. firms in artificial intelligence. Despite U.S. export restrictions on advanced semiconductors, the pace of innovation in China is expected to continue, supported by the growing availability of alternative AI chips from domestic suppliers like Huawei Technologies and Cambricon Technologies. The impact of U.S. sanctions on China's AI development efforts has diminished compared to previous years.</p>

          <p>Waiters, dealers, and bartenders in Las Vegas are still waiting for President Trump's campaign promise to eliminate taxes on tips to materialize into legislation. Nevada has the highest concentration of tipped workers in the country, and inflation has made basic essentials more expensive for them. While the White House says the president is working with Congress, two bills are in committees: one to eliminate federal income tax on tips and another to replace the sub-minimum wage with the federal minimum. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggests tariffs could fund the plan, but workers are eager for real action to alleviate financial pressures.</p>

          <p>Yosemite National Park officials are cautioning visitors to be cautious of mule deer, which cause more injuries than any other animal in the park. While seemingly harmless, these wild animals can lash out if startled, especially when approached or fed. Bucks are prone to aggressive behavior during mating season, and females may defend their fawns. Feeding and approaching wildlife is illegal, and visitors are advised to maintain a safe distance. Mule deer often gather near roads at dawn and dusk, so drivers should exercise caution while visiting the park.</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms shares surged after reporting a strong first quarter, signaling continued investment in artificial intelligence. Revenue climbed 16.1% year-over-year to $42.31 billion, with earnings per share soaring 36.5% to $6.43. The company's profitability allayed fears that CEO Mark Zuckerberg is overspending on AI, as AI investments are improving user engagement and ad targeting capabilities. Despite increasing its 2025 capital expenditures guidance, investors are receptive, viewing it as evidence that Meta's AI investments are paying off. CFO Susan Li noted that a recent decision from European regulators regarding Meta's compliance with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) could cause a 'significant impact' to its revenue in that region as soon as the third quarter of 2025.</p>

          <p>The New York City Rent Guidelines Board voted in favor of rent increases for nearly one million rent-stabilized apartments, citing rising costs for landlords. The preliminary vote backed increases of 1.75 to 4.75 percent on one-year leases and 4.75 to 7.75 percent on two-year leases, with a final decision expected in the next two months. Tenant advocates argue the increases will worsen the housing crisis, while landlords claim the adjustments are insufficient. The rent stabilization system covers roughly half of all apartments in New York City, providing an important source of affordability, but the board's decision reflects the priorities of the current mayor, Eric Adams, who has been more publicly supportive of landlords than his predecessor.</p>

It's likely those firms did so as they prepare for the de minimis trade loophole ending this Friday, Li said during a first-quarter earnings call. This trade loophole allowed packages worth less than $800 to enter the U.S. tariff free, benefiting online retailers like Temu and Shein.

          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a contraction in the first quarter of 2025, with the gross domestic product shrinking at a 0.3% annual rate. This slowdown is attributed to businesses stockpiling goods ahead of President Trump's sweeping tariff policies. The report may not fully reflect the state of economic growth, economists cautioned, noting that the figures are likely to be noisy because of the surge in imports as businesses sought to get ahead of tariffs. A key measure of the economy's health — known as final sales to private domestic purchasers — also rose 3% in the first quarter, edging up from 2.9% in the previous three months.</p>

          <p>President Trump's aggressive trade policies have created both uncertainty and opportunity across the American economy. Soybean farmers in Wisconsin are concerned about the impact of tariffs on their exports to China, while shrimpers in South Carolina see potential benefits from reduced competition with lower-priced imports. Major retailers have warned the White House that continued tariffs could lead to empty store shelves. Despite the uncertainty, farmers maintain resilience, hoping for a resolution to the trade disputes.</p>

          <p>Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg outlined a five-pillar strategy to weather President Trump's tariffs, including leveraging artificial intelligence, monetizing messaging apps, and doubling down on A.I. investments. This optimism contrasts with concerns from other companies about the fallout from the tariffs. Meta reported strong first-quarter revenue and profit, with shares rising in after-hours trading. CFO Susan Li noted that some Asian retailers have reduced ad spending on Meta's platforms in anticipation of the end of a U.S. trade loophole, but the company's guidance accounts for this uncertainty.</p>
