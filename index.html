          <p>China is increasing efforts to encourage foreign institutions to use the yuan, aiming to challenge the U.S. dollar's dominance as international confidence in the greenback weakens. These efforts include establishing a center for digital yuan internationalization in Shanghai and promoting yuan-denominated futures trading. However, despite these initiatives, some experts note that China's strict capital controls and less transparent system may deter large-scale buying of mainland assets. While the yuan's international use has seen some growth, it still lags significantly behind the U.S. dollar in global payments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Marine Corps veteran is struggling to care for his young children after his wife was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) during a green card application meeting. Paola Clouatre, a Mexican national who entered the U.S. as a minor, is now facing deportation due to a missed immigration hearing by her mother years ago. Despite her marriage to a veteran and attempts to seek legal status, ICE has taken a strict stance, leading to family separation and legal battles.

Democratic senators expressed frustration over the postponement of a formal briefing from the Trump administration, seeking more transparency on the impact of the strikes and the long-term strategy to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. The delay in the briefing has fueled concerns among lawmakers, particularly regarding the potential risks facing American service members.

          <p>An initial classified assessment suggests that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities have only set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months, despite President Trump's claims of complete obliteration. The assessment, produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency, indicates that while entrances to some facilities were sealed, the underground infrastructure remains largely intact. The White House has disputed these findings, with the press secretary calling the assessment "flat-out wrong."

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has determined that "multiple system failures" led to the Alaska Airlines incident where a door plug flew off mid-flight. The NTSB partly blamed Boeing's safety processes and the FAA's oversight for the incident. The report cited Boeing's failure to provide adequate training and oversight, as well as the FAA's ineffective compliance enforcement. The FAA stated it is taking the NTSB's safety recommendations seriously and has fundamentally changed how it oversees Boeing, but it has not lifted the 737 monthly production cap it has placed on Boeing until the FAA can confidently say Boeing can maintain the safety and quality of its aircraft.</p>

The meeting has become increasingly controversial after the U.S. health secretary abruptly fired all previous 17 members of the expert panel and named eight new members, half of whom have advocated against vaccines.

          <p>SpaceX launched the Ax-4 mission, a privately-financed flight to the International Space Station, led by America's most experienced astronaut, Peggy Whitson. The crew includes first-time fliers from India, Poland, and Hungary. The mission will conduct a full slate of science research and technology demonstrations, along with interactive educational events. The Ax-4 mission follows in the footsteps of Axiom's first three "private astronaut missions," or PAMs, a formal designation by NASA for commercial research flights to the International Space Station.</p>

          <p>Childhood vaccinations have saved an estimated 154 million lives since the launch of the WHO's Essential Programme on Immunization 50 years ago. However, efforts to boost vaccination rates have stalled or reversed in many places since 2010. The COVID-19 pandemic caused major disruptions to vaccination efforts, but there has been a concerted effort to find and vaccinate children who missed doses. India stands out as a country that has achieved very high vaccination rates across a very large population.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Commission approved an updated policy allowing the LAPD to deploy drones on routine emergency calls, citing successes other police departments have seen using drones. The new guidelines list other scenarios for future drone use — “high-risk incident, investigative purpose, large-scale event, natural disaster” — and transferred their command from the Air Support Division to the Office of Special Operations. The updated drone policy allows for the monitoring of mass protests for safety reasons, but department officials stressed that it will not be used to track or monitor demonstrators who aren’t engaged in criminal activities. Equipping the drones with weapons or pairing them with facial recognition software is still off-limits, officials said.</p>

          <p>A provision in the Senate Republican bill to enact President Trump's second-term agenda would force the USPS to sell off its new electric vehicle mail delivery trucks and cancel or significantly amend the contract for the remaining 58,800. Republicans say this provision could potentially raise money by rescinding $1 billion allocated in the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act to purchase the vehicles. However, USPS officials argue it would cost more to replace the revoked vehicles and the potential for raising money at auction is "negligible." The bill is being considered under budget reconciliation rules, but the Senate parliamentarian found that disposing of the USPS EVs is one of several of the bill's provisions violating the Byrd Rule.</p>

Tim Lang, a professor of food policy at City St George's, University of London argues that the issue is a ticking environmental time bomb. Advocates claim that it can meet the growing demand for meat with much less carbon emissions and land use, plus it can help governments hit certain targets.</p>
