          <p>An investigation in China's Gansu province has revealed that the provincial disease control agency and a local hospital deliberately falsified lead poisoning test results for kindergarten children. The scandal has led to ten officials, including senior health commission leaders, being placed under investigation for their oversight failures. The government has apologized, promising to provide free medical treatment and reimburse all costs for the affected children and their families, addressing a public health crisis that has shocked the nation.</p>

          <p>Despite a strong economy, many companies are conducting layoffs, often citing "restructuring" or "optimization" rather than admitting to replacing human jobs with artificial intelligence. Employment experts suggest these vague terms are used to avoid public and employee backlash, as the cuts often align with the implementation of new AI systems in roles like HR and customer service. While firms like IBM and Klarna have been more transparent, many are quietly reshaping their workforce, a trend that is expected to accelerate significantly in the coming years.</p>

Despite the projected defeat, which historically leads to a leader's resignation, Ishiba has vowed to remain in office to manage critical trade negotiations with the United States, potentially ushering in a period of political instability.</p>

          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships argues that the single most important skill to teach a child is self-connection—the ability to understand their own emotions and needs. The article suggests that common parental responses, such as dismissing a child's feelings, can inadvertently teach them not to trust their inner voice, leading to anxiety and insecurity. To foster this skill, parents are advised to validate emotions, welcome all aspects of their child's personality, and model their own emotional regulation, thereby building resilience and authentic confidence.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that traditional methods of measuring the U.S. labor market, such as job creation numbers and the unemployment rate, are becoming obsolete. With the rise of the gig economy, remote work, and the 'over-employed' holding multiple jobs, these metrics fail to capture the full picture of economic well-being. The author proposes a new approach focused on measuring inflation-adjusted income from all sources for the working-age population, using real data from tax returns and private companies. This shift would provide a more relevant and accurate assessment of the labor market's health.</p>

          <p>Recent developments in personality science suggest that individuals can intentionally redesign aspects of their personality, challenging the long-held belief that such traits are fixed in adulthood. Writer Olga Khazan documented her successful year-long effort to become less neurotic and more extroverted by forcing herself into uncomfortable situations, such as taking an improv class. Experts explain that by consciously and repeatedly adopting new behaviors and ways of thinking, people can effectively shift their personality, a process that can be a powerful tool for improving mental health and overall well-being.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is facing bipartisan condemnation for circumventing a 2021 law by effectively restoring the Confederate names of several U.S. Army bases. Hegseth claims the bases are being renamed for different soldiers who happen to share the same last names as the original Confederate namesakes, a move critics call a transparent game. The Republican-led House Armed Services Committee voted to block the action, arguing it flouts congressional authority and insults the nation by honoring individuals who fought to preserve slavery, some of whom were notoriously incompetent military leaders.</p>

          <p>In an interview about her new memoir, former Senator Carol Moseley Braun recounts her trailblazing career and the challenges she faced as the first African American woman in the U.S. Senate. She recalls incidents of overt racism, such as a colleague singing "Dixie" to her, but argues that sexism is an even more difficult barrier to overcome in American politics. Moseley Braun expresses concern that the Democratic party is currently "walking around in a daze" in its fight against Donald Trump, but remains optimistic that Americans will ultimately resist authoritarianism and uphold democratic values.</p>

          <p>This long-form essay argues that to understand America, one must understand Oklahoma, a state founded on the violent collision of settler colonialism, Indigenous dispossession, and Black aspiration. The author reflects on growing up with a sanitized state history that celebrated land runs while erasing the theft from Native nations and the racial terror that followed. The piece posits that Oklahoma has always been a testing ground for America's future, from its all-Black towns to its current political battles, embodying the nation's contradictory impulses of reinvention, denial, and the ongoing fight over who truly belongs.</p>

          <p>A new CBS News poll indicates that public support for President Trump's large-scale deportation program has fallen, with a majority now believing it is not focused on dangerous criminals and is deporting more people than expected. This shift comes as most Americans, particularly those outside his political base, continue to urge the administration to focus more on lowering prices rather than on immigration or tariffs. The president's overall approval has slipped, as disapproval of his handling of inflation has reached a new high and his signature tax cut bill is widely seen as benefiting the wealthy.

          <p>A recent study of census data reveals a significant trend of retirees moving out of major U.S. cities, with New York City, Los Angeles, and Washington D.C. seeing the largest net outflow of residents aged 60 and over. New York City's net loss was particularly stark, with nearly 24,000 more seniors leaving than arriving in 2023. A high cost of living appears to be a major factor, as most of the top ten cities being fled by retirees are located in states like California and New York, where over $1 million is considered necessary for a comfortable retirement.

The author, a naturalized citizen from Brazil, reflects on how the current political climate challenges the permanence of citizenship, which was once considered a guaranteed right. The piece argues that the threat of denaturalization, even if applied to a few, creates a chilling effect on the free speech and political participation of millions of naturalized Americans, who now fear their citizenship could be jeopardized for opposing the administration.</p>

While the exact reason is unconfirmed, sources suggest it may relate to national security concerns or an alleged failure to disclose his U.S. government employment on his visa application.

          <p>Archaeologists believe they have identified the wreck of the 'Nossa Senhora do Cabo,' a Portuguese warship captured by the notorious French pirate Olivier Levasseur, known as 'La Buse,' in 1721. The ship was carrying a vast treasure of gold, diamonds, and other valuables from the Portuguese colonies, estimated to be worth over $138 million today. The discovery near the island of Nosy Boraha, a historic pirate hideout off Madagascar, could be a major step in solving the 300-year-old mystery of La Buse's legendary lost treasure, which he famously hinted at with a cryptogram before his execution.</p>

          <p>In a significant discovery at the ancient city of Petra in Jordan, archaeologists have unearthed a previously unknown tomb system hidden beneath the iconic Khazneh, or 'Treasury.' The excavation, documented by the Discovery Channel, revealed a tomb containing the articulated skeletal remains of 12 individuals from over 2,000 years ago, along with various artifacts. This find is exceptionally rare, as most tombs at the World Wonder site have been found empty. The remains and artifacts could provide invaluable new information about the Nabataean people who built Petra and the purpose of its most famous monument.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the United States' trade strategy with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) has fundamentally changed, moving away from mutually beneficial partnerships. Instead, Washington is now treating market access as a commodity, demanding higher tariffs and mandatory purchases from Asean members in exchange for entry into the U.S. market. The author contends that this transactional, rent-seeking model undermines the economic competitiveness and sovereignty of Southeast Asian nations, turning them into "fee for access" economies rather than strategic partners in global trade.

          <p>A new report from the Lowy Institute finds that China's influence in Southeast Asia is increasing, largely due to its role as the region's primary infrastructure financier. This rise coincides with significant cuts in foreign aid from the United States and European Union, which are pulling back tens of billions of dollars in funding. As Western engagement wanes, the center of development finance is shifting eastward to Beijing, as well as Tokyo and Seoul. The report suggests China is well-positioned to enhance its dominance by funding key infrastructure projects while maintaining its policy of non-interference.</p>

          <p>A new workplace trend termed 'quiet cracking' has been identified, describing a state of persistent burnout, stagnation, and disengagement that differs from 'quiet quitting.' Affecting a significant portion of the workforce, it stems from feeling unappreciated and lacking career advancement opportunities, even in a job one might otherwise like. This gradual decline in morale and performance is difficult for employers to detect but costs the global economy trillions in lost productivity. Experts suggest that recognition, clear communication, and opportunities for learning and development are key to mitigating this growing issue.</p>
