            <p>Two Defense Department officials, including a senior advisor to Pete Hegseth, have been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation into an unauthorized disclosure. Dan Caldwell, the senior advisor, and Darin Selnick, the Pentagon's deputy chief of staff, were both suspended as part of the probe. The investigation was prompted by a memo from Hegseth's chief of staff directing the Pentagon to investigate unauthorized disclosures, potentially using lie detector tests. Caldwell is accused of sharing classified documents with reporters, raising concerns about information security within the Defense Department.</p>

            <p>Nvidia expects to incur a $5.5 billion charge due to the tightening of US export regulations concerning chip sales to China. The new rules necessitate licenses for exporting Nvidia's H20 AI chip, a popular product in China. This development is occurring amidst an escalating trade war between the US and China, impacting Nvidia's ability to capitalize on the AI boom. Experts suggest this move could lead to a complete decoupling of the US and Chinese AI semiconductor supply chains.</p>
