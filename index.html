          <p>President Trump stated he has no plans to dismiss Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, despite past criticisms, and expressed optimism about improving trade relations with China. Trump indicated he desires Powell to be more proactive in lowering interest rates. These remarks followed concerns about Trump's previous criticisms of Powell, which had triggered market instability. Trump also mentioned being amenable to negotiating with Beijing, suggesting potential tariff reductions if a trade agreement is reached. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Official figures reveal that government borrowing in the UK has exceeded expectations due to increased spending on pay and benefits.

          <p>Scientists have reported that coral bleaching is affecting 84% of the world's coral reefs, marking the highest level ever recorded. This widespread event, driven by rising ocean temperatures due to human-induced climate change, poses a severe threat to marine ecosystems. Experts emphasize that reducing emissions from fossil fuels is crucial to protecting coral reefs, as current conditions are causing significant coral mortality and ecosystem disruption. The earth had its hottest year on record last year, and the average annual sea surface temperature of oceans away from the poles hit a record 20.87 C (69.57 F).</p>
