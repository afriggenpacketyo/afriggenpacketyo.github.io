          <p>Taiwan's coast guard is requesting additional funding to enhance coastal surveillance following several undetected landings by mainland Chinese individuals using inflatable boats on sensitive Taiwanese shores. The request was prompted by two incidents: a father and son who claimed to be fleeing persecution and a man who allegedly crossed the strait, raised a Chinese flag, and returned. Authorities are investigating the authenticity of the latter incident, while also considering the feasibility of such crossings. The coast guard is working to improve surveillance and response capabilities to safeguard Taiwan's coastal regions. (not investment advice)</p>

Opposition parties have called for Eto's resignation, but Ishiba maintains that Eto should focus on addressing agricultural challenges, including mitigating the impact of inflation and higher tariffs.

The industry faces challenges like overworked and underpaid animators, leading studios to use AI for coloring, background generation, and converting media into anime.

While China has not directly confirmed the claims, Chinese media and analysts suggest the conflict demonstrates that Chinese weapons are on par with Western ones.

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, jumped over 18% in their Hong Kong trading debut, driven by investor confidence in the company's ability to capitalize on the electric vehicle boom. The IPO raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion), making it the largest offering this year globally. CATL intends to allocate 90% of the funds raised to construct its new factory in Hungary, which will supply batteries to European automotive clients such as Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. The company's expansion into Europe aligns with global efforts from Chinese EV makers and faces increased scrutiny from the U.S. and EU. (not investment advice)</p>
