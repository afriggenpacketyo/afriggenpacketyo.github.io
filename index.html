          <p>Leicester Tigers fought back in the second half to secure a crucial 44-34 victory over Sale Sharks in their bid for the Premiership play-offs. Sale Sharks initially dominated, leading 26-16 at halftime with four tries, but Leicester responded strongly after the interval with two tries from Ollie Hassell-Collins. Emeka Ilione's try appeared to seal the game, but Rob du Preez quickly responded for Sale, setting up a tense finish. Ilione's late try denied Sale a losing bonus point, securing the win for Leicester in this important match.</p>

          <p>Fifteen states, largely led by Democrats, are suing the Trump administration over its efforts to expedite oil and gas projects, arguing that the administration is circumventing environmental protection laws. The lawsuit challenges Trump's executive order declaring a "national energy emergency," which aims to expand U.S. oil and gas production through federal use of eminent domain and the Defense Production Act. The states contend that agencies are bypassing required reviews under laws like the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act, causing significant harm to natural resources. The states seek a court declaration that the executive order is unlawful and a bar against emergency permitting for non-emergency projects.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned Congressional leaders that the U.S. government could face default as early as August if Congress does not address the debt ceiling. Bessent urged lawmakers to increase or suspend the debt limit by mid-July to avoid financial chaos. Failure to do so would wreak havoc on the financial system and diminish America's global leadership position. The debt ceiling was last addressed in 2023, with Congress suspending it until January 1, 2025.</p>

          <p>As Congress begins drafting a massive fiscal package for President Trump's agenda, the question of raising taxes on millionaires remains a point of contention.

House Speaker Mike Johnson stated his opposition to increasing taxes, but others argue for it as a way to ensure wealthy Americans pay their fair share and generate federal revenue. Trump has expressed concerns about the political ramifications of raising taxes, citing the potential for Democrats to use it against him.</p>
