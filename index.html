          <p>Florida health officials are issuing a warning about the dangers of consuming unpasteurized raw milk after a recent outbreak sickened 21 people. The bacteria, linked to a single farm, led to seven hospitalizations and severe complications in two individuals. While it is illegal to sell raw milk for human consumption in the state, it can be sold as pet food, a loophole that has gained popularity through online wellness trends. Health agencies like the FDA and CDC maintain that pasteurization is the only guaranteed way to kill harmful bacteria without compromising nutritional benefits.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied Sean "Diddy" Combs' second request for bail, ensuring he will remain in custody until his October sentencing. The judge cited the rapper's history of violence in personal relationships as a key factor, stating that no amount of bond could sufficiently mitigate the risk he poses. Combs was convicted on two prostitution-related charges last month but was acquitted of more severe sex trafficking and racketeering counts. His attorneys had argued for his release based on what they described as inhumane conditions at the Brooklyn detention center where he is being held.</p>

          <p>In a dramatic political escalation, Texas House Republicans have authorized law enforcement to issue civil arrest warrants for Democratic lawmakers who fled the state. The Democrats left Texas to break the legislative quorum and block a vote on a contentious Republican-led redistricting plan. Governor Greg Abbott has ordered state police to locate and return the absent legislators, though the warrants have no legal authority outside of Texas. The proposed new congressional map is a key part of a national GOP strategy to secure its House majority in the upcoming elections.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice is reportedly launching a grand jury investigation into the origins of the 2016 election intelligence concerning Donald Trump and Russia. Attorney General Pam Bondi has directed a federal prosecutor to begin presenting evidence, a move that follows a criminal referral from Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. It remains unclear what specific charges are being considered or who the potential targets of the investigation might be. The Justice Department has not officially commented on the developing situation, which signals a significant escalation in the long-running political controversy.</p>

          <p>Following criticism over recent downward revisions to U.S. jobs numbers, experts are clarifying that such adjustments are a standard part of the process. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) issues preliminary reports to provide timely data and later revises them as more complete survey responses are collected. Former officials explain this is a feature, not a flaw, designed to balance speed with accuracy, especially as data collection has become more challenging. The recent revisions, while large, were attributed to late reporting from state and local governments and the expiration of pandemic-era subsidies.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Latah County prosecutor Bill Thompson discussed the Bryan Kohberger case following the killer's sentencing to four life terms without parole. Thompson described the immense emotional toll of the case, noting the murders of the four University of Idaho students were exceptionally brutal and cruel. He observed that Kohberger showed no emotion or remorse during the victim impact statements, appearing to have "empty" eyes. Thompson also defended the decision to accept a plea deal without requiring a full confession, stating a belief that Kohberger would never provide a truthful account and would only further traumatize the families.</p>

While sectors like healthcare saw growth, manufacturing experienced job losses, challenging promises of a revival. This data points to a stagnant labor market where companies are not expanding, making it harder for the long-term unemployed to find work. (not investment advice)</p>

California Democrats believe they could make several Republican-held districts more competitive in response to the Texas plan, which aims to add five new GOP seats.

The administration's filing argues the existing policy is legally questionable and inconsistent with federal funding restrictions.

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has endorsed a controversial Florida migrant detention center, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," as a model for a new federal initiative. The plan involves establishing similar state-run facilities near airports in states like Arizona and Nebraska to expedite the detention and deportation process. The Florida facility, located in remote swampland, has faced legal challenges and criticism from attorneys over its legality and alleged inhumane conditions. Noem argues the model is a more cost-effective and efficient approach to immigration enforcement, intended to send a strong deterrent message to unauthorized migrants.</p>

          <p>U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson made a high-profile visit to an Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank, becoming the highest-ranking American official to do so in years. During the trip, Johnson reportedly told settlers that the territory was the "rightful property of the Jewish people" and that the U.S. stands with them. The visit was praised by pro-Israel advocates but immediately condemned by the Palestinian Foreign Ministry as a blatant violation of international law. The trip underscores deep political divisions in the U.S. over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict amid the ongoing war and humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

          <p>As smoke from Canadian wildfires continues to trigger air quality alerts across the Northeast and Midwest, health experts are highlighting the significant risks of exposure. Pulmonologists compare breathing air with high concentrations of fine particulate matter to smoking up to half a pack of cigarettes a day. This exposure is particularly dangerous for children, the elderly, pregnant people, and those with pre-existing respiratory or cardiovascular conditions. To minimize harm, officials recommend staying indoors with windows closed, using air filters, and wearing a well-fitted N95 mask if going outside is unavoidable.</p>

          <p>Flaco Jiménez, the legendary Tex-Mex accordionist who passed away at 86, is being remembered not just for his musical genius but for his unique political voice. An appreciation article highlights his 1976 performance of "Un Mojado Sin Licencia" ("A Wetback Without a License"), a song that used humor and a rollicking rhythm to tell a story of an undocumented immigrant's struggles. This approach, turning pathos into a defiant and joyful revolt, was characteristic of his work. Jiménez, who collaborated with icons from the Rolling Stones to Bob Dylan, used his music to support civil rights and political causes, leaving a legacy of resilience and pride.</p>

          <p>Following a jobs report that showed weaker-than-expected growth, former President Donald Trump fired Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The July report also included significant downward revisions for the previous two months, prompting Trump to claim without evidence that the figures were politically manipulated. This action represents an escalation of his criticism of official government data when it does not align with his political narrative. McEntarfer, a career civil servant, was confirmed to her post last year with bipartisan support, and her dismissal has raised concerns about the politicization of federal statistical agencies.</p>

          <p>A new report from a San Diego nonprofit argues that extensive permitting requirements are a major cause of delays and budget increases for California's transit projects, including the high-speed rail. The analysis suggests that policies originally created decades ago to prevent disruptive highway construction are now hindering the development of beneficial public transit. These rules require transit agencies to secure approvals from multiple third-party jurisdictions, creating bottlenecks that can add years to timelines. The report points to systems in Canada, where transit agencies can self-permit if other bodies fail to act in time, as a potential model for reform.</p>

          <p>A top Federal Reserve official has warned that Americans may face higher inflation in the coming year as businesses begin passing on the costs of the Trump administration's tariffs to consumers. Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack noted that many companies had initially absorbed the costs by using stockpiled inventory but are now facing squeezed profit margins. She highlighted a "two-speed economy," where high-income households are thriving while lower-income families struggle with rising costs for essentials. The Fed faces a difficult challenge in balancing the risks of rising inflation with a simultaneously slowing job market. (not investment advice)</p>
