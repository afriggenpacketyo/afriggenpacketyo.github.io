          <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) criticized a Massachusetts judge for pausing the deportation of an illegal immigrant, Nyo Myint, who DHS says sexually assaulted a disabled woman with the mental capacity of a 3-year-old. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called the judge's decision "deranged," emphasizing that Myint had been convicted of attempted first-degree sexual assault. The White House echoed these sentiments, accusing the judge of protecting violent criminals, and former President Trump urged the Supreme Court to intervene. The article highlights the ongoing conflict between the Trump administration's deportation agenda and judicial intervention.</p>
