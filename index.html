          <p>Former President Trump defended his administration's focus on deploying federal agents to Chicago for immigration and crime enforcement, dismissing data showing other cities have higher crime rates. He insisted his actions are "common sense" rather than "war," framing the plan as a necessary measure to restore order. The comments follow a controversial social media post from Trump featuring an AI-generated image that parodied the film 'Apocalypse Now,' which has drawn sharp criticism from local and state Democratic leaders for its threatening tone.</p>

          <p>In an interview, Senator Roger Marshall of Kansas defended the Trump administration's appointment of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as HHS Secretary, describing him as a necessary "disrupter" for the CDC. Marshall argued that not every person requires every vaccine and that parents and doctors should be empowered to make individualized healthcare decisions. He addressed criticism from fellow Republican senators and the medical community, maintaining that Kennedy's goal is to increase transparency and restore trust in the public health institution.</p>

          <p>Indianapolis Colts safety Cam Bynum went viral during the season's first game for his bizarre celebration after intercepting a pass from Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa. Known for his elaborate and energetic displays, Bynum ran toward the end zone and began flailing his body in a distinctive dance-like motion. Bynum has previously stated that making big plays earns players the right to have fun and express their joy, a philosophy he clearly demonstrated in the Sunday matchup.</p>

          <p>Major UK trade unions are warning the government against weakening its proposed Employment Rights Bill, a significant piece of legislation intended to ban zero-hours contracts and enhance protections against unfair dismissal. Union leaders, including Unison's general secretary, have voiced concerns that a recent cabinet reshuffle has removed key champions of the bill, potentially opening the door for it to be watered down. Conversely, business groups like the Federation of Small Businesses see the changes as an opportunity to amend the legislation they find concerning.</p>

The article contends that launching military strikes on non-state actors without congressional approval or due process sets a perilous precedent, similar to the overreach seen during the "war on terror." It concludes that such actions are counterproductive and that a more effective strategy would involve addressing domestic demand and financial disruption of cartels.</p>

          <p>The Catholic Church has officially canonized Carlo Acutis, an Italian teenager who died of leukemia in 2006 at the age of 15, making him the first millennial to be declared a saint. Acutis, an avid gamer and self-taught coder, was dubbed "God's influencer" for his work creating websites to document miracles and spread the faith online. His canonization is seen by the Vatican as a way to provide a modern role model for young people, demonstrating that holiness is achievable in the digital age.</p>

          <p>A new study from River reveals a significant trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption, with businesses purchasing an average of 1,755 BTC daily over the past 20 months.

Regarding President Trump's executive orders, Barrett emphasized that the Court's role is to decide legal questions based on briefs and arguments, not to make political judgments about a president's actions.</p>

          <p>Jarvis McKenzie, a Black man who was shot at and racially threatened while waiting for work, is publicly calling for South Carolina to enact a hate crime law. The state is one of only two in the U.S. without such legislation, which would allow for enhanced penalties for crimes motivated by bias. The alleged perpetrator was charged under a local county ordinance, but advocates argue this is insufficient and that a statewide bill, which has stalled in the Republican-led senate, is urgently needed.</p>

          <p>The advancement of artificial intelligence is threatening to automate a significant portion of entry-level white-collar jobs, potentially dismantling the traditional career ladder where employees rise from the bottom to the top of a company. Data from venture capital firm SignalFire shows a 50% drop in hiring for new graduates at major tech firms between 2019 and 2024. This trend is forcing a reevaluation of how careers will progress and how companies will cultivate talent and transfer institutional knowledge in a flatter, more automated corporate world.</p>
