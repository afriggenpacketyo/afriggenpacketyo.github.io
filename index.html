          <p>A tragic boating accident occurred in Miami's Biscayne Bay when a barge struck a sailboat carrying children in a summer sailing program. The collision resulted in the deaths of two children and left two others in critical condition. The sailboat, operated by the Miami Yacht Club's youth program, sank after the impact, throwing its five child occupants and one adult counselor into the water. The U.S. Coast Guard has launched an investigation and established a safety zone around the submerged wreckage.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially accepted an "unconditional donation" of a luxury jet from Qatar for presidential use, according to a signed memorandum. The cost to retrofit the aircraft, which has been called a "flying palace," is classified but has been speculated by lawmakers to be as high as $1 billion. Critics, including Senator Chris Murphy, have questioned the use of taxpayer funds for a plane that might later be transferred to the Trump presidential library foundation. The agreement specifies the jet is a "bona fide gift" with no guarantees.</p>

The review will also examine claims that the university admitted illegal immigrants, which the school denies, stating it is "in compliance with federal laws."</p>

          <p>Adam Coy, a former Columbus, Ohio police officer, has been sentenced to 15 years to life in prison for the 2020 murder of Andre Hill. Hill, an unarmed Black man, was holding a cellphone when Coy fatally shot him in a garage. Coy, who was found guilty of murder in November, claimed he feared for his life but told the court he plans to appeal the verdict. The case drew national attention as one of a series of police killings of Black Americans, with body camera footage showing a significant delay before officers rendered aid to Hill.</p>

          <p>Spirit Airlines has announced it will furlough 270 pilots this fall and demote 140 captains to first officers as it restructures its operations. The move is intended to align staffing levels with a reduced flight schedule as the airline works to regain profitability after emerging from bankruptcy in March. The pilots' union stated that the airline continues to shrink, eroding the value of pilot careers at the company. Spirit is taking these steps in response to softer travel demand, particularly during off-peak periods.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Trump administration's recent claims of "irrefutable evidence" of an Obama-era plot regarding the 2016 Russia investigation are a deliberate distraction. The author posits that this narrative is a desperate attempt to shift public focus away from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. The piece contends that the administration is promoting a dishonest revisionist history, asserting that Russia did not interfere to help Trump win, a conclusion contradicted by a bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report. The author suggests the primary goal is to change the subject from Epstein to any other topic.</p>

          <p>This article explains the "4% rule," a long-standing guideline for retirees to estimate safe annual withdrawal amounts from their savings. The rule suggests withdrawing 4% of a portfolio in the first year of retirement, and adjusting for inflation thereafter, to make savings last for about 30 years. When applied to annuities, the rule serves as a benchmark to compare the guaranteed income from an annuity against what a traditional portfolio might provide. This comparison helps retirees evaluate trade-offs between an annuity's security and a portfolio's flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>
