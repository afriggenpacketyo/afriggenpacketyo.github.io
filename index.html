          <h2>Government Considers Social Media Time Limits for Children</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government is contemplating stricter online safety regulations, potentially limiting children's social media usage to two hours daily and imposing a 10 PM curfew. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle cited concerns about the addictive nature of apps and smartphones as the impetus for these considerations. Ian Russell, an online safety advocate, criticized the government's delay in enacting protective laws, pointing to the harm caused by weak regulation and tech companies prioritizing engagement over safety. Current parental controls offered by Apple and Google, along with TikTok's default 60-minute screen time limit for minors, are not widely adopted, suggesting a need for more comprehensive measures. Optimism regarding the safety and well-being of children online is somewhat tempered by the slow legislative progress.</p>

          <p>President Trump authorized the deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles following violent clashes between demonstrators and authorities over immigration enforcement. The California National Guard 79th Infantry Brigade Combat Team deployed approximately 300 soldiers to Los Angeles to protect federal property and personnel. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth threatened to send active duty Marines if the violence escalates. The LAPD reported eleven arrests during protests on Saturday, while the NYPD made at least 22 arrests during protests in New York City.

          <p>ABC News suspended veteran correspondent Terry Moran after he posted a critical tweet about President Trump and Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt condemned Moran's remarks and called for ABC to take action, reflecting the heightened sensitivity of news organizations to criticism from the Trump administration.

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies tone of voice/attitude, family relations, household chores, and communication styles as the most frequent sources of conflict in relationships. Contempt, often expressed through tone, is a significant predictor of divorce, while arguments about family often reflect unmet needs. Uneven distribution of household labor, particularly the "invisible load," can lead to resentment, and ineffective communication can escalate minor issues. The article suggests strategies for addressing these conflicts, such as naming the effect, reassuring one another, acknowledging the invisible load, and using a "five-second rule" to de-escalate arguments.</p>

          <p>Marc-Andre ter Stegen's strong performance was a highlight for Germany in their 2-0 defeat to France in the Nations League third-place playoff. Ter Stegen, recently named Germany's first-choice goalkeeper, made several key saves to prevent a larger defeat. However, his lack of playing time at Barcelona, where he is reportedly facing competition for the starting position, raises concerns. The article suggests that Julian Nagelsmann will likely continue to give Ter Stegen opportunities due to his experience and recent form.</p>
