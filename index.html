          <p>Following the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk in Utah, security measures have been significantly increased for prominent political figures, including President Donald Trump. Trump's 9/11 commemoration speech location was altered, and enhanced security is planned for his attendance at a New York baseball game. Several universities, particularly historically Black colleges, faced lockdowns due to threats, while some lawmakers, like Nancy Mace, are boosting personal protection and considering carrying firearms. The ongoing search for Kirk's assailant has amplified concerns about political violence across the nation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has appealed to a federal court to allow President Trump to dismiss Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, aiming for a decision before a critical meeting next week on interest rates. Cook was initially blocked from being fired by a U.S. District Judge, who stated the president lacked a legally permissible cause for removal. The Justice Department argues the president has broad discretion, citing allegations of Cook misrepresenting her primary residence in mortgage documents. Cook's attorneys contend that an administrative stay would disrupt the Federal Open Market Committee's vote and potentially impact financial markets.</p>

The acquisition, which included the nearly 8,000-square-foot building, was made with the support of hospitality union Unite Here Local 11. A key part of the deal ensures that all 25 former union workers, who lost their jobs in March due to a labor dispute, will be reinstated. Pustilnikov aims to reopen the 24-hour establishment by New Year's Eve, emphasizing his desire to preserve L.A. history and allow long-serving employees to finish their careers.</p>

          <p>An alleged drug-trafficking vessel from Venezuela was reportedly attempting to turn around when it was struck by the U.S. military last week, according to sources familiar with the incident. The individuals on board observed military aircraft overhead and then began to reverse course before the U.S. repeatedly engaged the boat. President Trump confirmed 11 fatalities from the strike, asserting the vessel was operated by the Tren de Aragua gang, designated a foreign terrorist organization. Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, however, disputed the U.S. claims, stating none of the deceased were gang members or drug traffickers.</p>

          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby publicly stated his belief that struggling Spirit Airlines is on the verge of going out of business, declaring the traditional discount airline model obsolete. Spirit Airlines recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the second time within a year, facing weak customer demand and high operating costs. Kirby criticized the low-fare, high-fee model, asserting that customers dislike it and that it is not sustainable. This prediction comes as Spirit has cut a dozen destinations, while competitors are expanding, intensifying the debate over the future of ultra-low-cost carriers in the industry.

          <p>The FBI has released two grainy photos of a person of interest in the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to an identification and arrest. Law enforcement officials confirmed the recovery of key evidence, including a high-powered, bolt-action rifle and good video footage, from a wooded area where the gunman fled. Investigators believe the suspect fired from a rooftop overlooking Kirk's event at Utah Valley University, then jumped from the building into a nearby neighborhood. The suspect is described as appearing to be of college age and blended in well on campus.</p>

          <p>Amazon has suspended a Palestinian software engineer, Ahmed Shahrour, who openly criticized the company's involvement in Project Nimbus, a cloud computing contract with the Israeli government. Shahrour, based in Seattle, was suspended with pay after posting messages on internal Slack channels urging Amazon to drop the $1.2 billion joint contract with Google, which provides AI tools and data centers to Israel. Amazon stated it does not tolerate discrimination or threatening behavior, confirming an investigation into the incident. This action follows similar instances at other tech companies where employees protesting ties to the Israeli military have faced consequences, highlighting growing tensions between tech workers and corporate policies related to international conflicts.</p>

          <h2>Inflation Rises to 2.9% in August, Bolstering Case for Gold Investment</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-11 16:42:40 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The latest inflation report revealed an increase to 2.9% in August, up from 2.7% in July, placing it almost a full percentage point above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. This data adds uncertainty to monetary policy ahead of next week's central bank meeting, where an interest rate cut is anticipated. With inflation rising, investors are advised to consider allocating a portion of their portfolio to gold, a traditional hedge against inflation that tends to maintain or increase in value during such periods. The article emphasizes that gold can protect purchasing power and diversify portfolios against economic fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Uber, alleging the ride-hailing giant discriminates against riders with disabilities. The complaint, filed in a San Francisco federal court, asserts that Uber and its drivers routinely refuse service to individuals with disabilities, including those with service animals or who use wheelchairs. Additionally, the DOJ alleges Uber imposes impermissible surcharges like cleaning fees for service animals and cancellation fees for unlawfully denied rides. Uber maintains a zero-tolerance policy for confirmed service denials and states its community guidelines prohibit discrimination, having recently introduced features to improve the experience for riders with service animals.</p>
