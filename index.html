          <p>A Mexican judge has ruled that boxer Julio César Chávez Jr. will stand trial for alleged ties to the Sinaloa Cartel and arms trafficking, although he may be permitted to await the trial outside of detention. U.S. authorities, who had been investigating the cartel since 2019, deported Chávez Jr. to Mexico after his arrest in Los Angeles for immigration violations. The case against the 39-year-old boxer, son of a legendary fighter, is part of a broader investigation that has also targeted high-profile figures like Ovidio Guzmán López, son of "El Chapo."</p>

The festivities started at dawn with J'ouvert, a traditional celebration involving participants covering themselves in bright paint and powder to mark the start of the weekend's events. As Europe's largest street party, the carnival continues a tradition spanning over 50 years. A 72-second silence will be observed on both days to honor the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire and others who have passed away.</p>

          <p>Forced medical experiments conducted during the Nazi era continue to cast a long shadow over modern medicine, with some data unethically obtained from concentration camp prisoners having been used for decades. A new online database now provides detailed profiles of 16,000 victims, exposing the scale of atrocities committed by over 200 institutions. A 2023 Lancet Commission report detailed how medical professionals justified these actions and continued their careers post-war, with some findings even influencing aviation and space medicine programs. This history has prompted ongoing ethical debates about how to handle knowledge derived from such inhumane practices.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in Vence, France, have discovered an ancient baptistery dating back 1,500 years, providing new insights into early Christian rituals. The structure, found next to a previously unearthed cathedral, features an octagonal exterior and a cross-shaped interior baptismal font, which remains in very good condition. This finding confirms the antiquity of the bishopric of Vence and enhances historical knowledge of early Christian practices in the region. The excavation also revealed several burials in the cathedral's nave, believed to be those of religious figures from the Carolingian period.</p>

          <h2>American Universities Urged to Adopt Institutional Neutrality to Restore Public Trust</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-24 09:00:31 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid declining public trust and partisan pressures, American universities are facing an existential crisis that threatens their core mission. The article argues that these institutions must reclaim the principle of academic freedom by adopting a stance of institutional neutrality on political and social issues. This approach would allow faculty and students to express diverse viewpoints freely while the university itself refrains from taking collective stances, thereby creating a protected space for open inquiry.

          <p>Despite China's significant trade relationship with the European Union, valued at around US$1 trillion, key US allies are resisting Beijing's diplomatic and economic overtures. This opinion article argues that these nations are prioritizing their foundational security alliances and intelligence-sharing pacts with Washington over potential economic gains from China. The author contends that centuries of shared identity, security integration, and cultural ties form an unbreakable bond with the United States' strategic framework. Consequently, China's efforts to create a wedge against American influence have failed to secure meaningful political alignment from these allies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 2026 Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) is projected to be around 2.7%, a figure determined by third-quarter inflation data. While this provides a nominal increase in benefits, it highlights a persistent issue for retirees where these adjustments often fail to keep pace with the actual rising costs of goods and services. According to a study by the Senior Citizens League, Social Security benefits have lost approximately 20% of their purchasing power since 2010. This discrepancy means that despite the annual COLA, many seniors may continue to face financial strain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to overhaul the asylum appeals system in an effort to reduce processing times and decrease the reliance on housing migrants in hotels. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced that a new body staffed by independent adjudicators will be created to handle appeals more swiftly, as the current process averages over a year per case. With 51,000 cases pending, the delays contribute significantly to accommodation costs. While the government aims to speed up the system, organizations like the Refugee Council argue that the focus should be on making correct initial decisions to reduce the number of appeals altogether.</p>

Dickerson was sexually abusing children, yet he was still ordained in 1980. The documents, part of a pending lawsuit, show that superiors, including the late superior general Pedro Arrupe, were aware of concerns but allowed Dickerson's career to proceed. Arrupe, who is currently being considered for sainthood, was informed of specific misgivings but the ordination ultimately occurred. This case provides a detailed look at the internal handling of a predator priest during an earlier phase of the church's abuse scandal.</p>

While largely a lighthearted joke, the trend also touches on a deeper suspicion that these tastes might be a deceptive act.

          <p>A first-time Tesla owner shared an honest one-year review, revealing that while the savings on gasoline were less than expected, the real financial benefit came from significantly lower maintenance costs. The owner spent $1,432 on charging, saving an estimated $334 on gas, but only $600 on two tire replacements after 15,000 miles, a stark contrast to the thousands spent on his previous car. This experience highlights a key advantage of electric vehicles: the long-term savings from avoiding common repairs like oil changes and transmission work.

          <p>This article advocates for designing and utilizing artificial intelligence as a collaborative tool that augments human expertise, rather than as an automation tool that aims to replace it entirely. Using examples from radiology and aviation, it argues that imperfect automation can be dangerous, as it may erode human skills and fail catastrophically when it encounters unforeseen situations. A collaborative approach, where AI provides data and insights while humans provide context, judgment, and ethical oversight, leads to better outcomes. This human-in-the-loop model is presented as a more effective and safer path for integrating AI into high-stakes fields like medicine and law.</p>

          <p>Despite growing favorability for socialism among young Americans and Democrats, the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) has failed to become a major political force. This article argues the reason lies in a deep internal schism between a pragmatic wing focused on winning elections within the Democratic Party and a sectarian wing with extremist, anti-democratic views. This latter group's influence leads to alienating actions, such as refusing to endorse mainstream Democrats like Joe Biden or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and passing resolutions that are nonstarters for the average voter. This factionalism prevents the DSA from adopting a unified, effective strategy to gain real political power.</p>

          <p>This personal essay argues that the practice of reading aloud to children, while declining in popularity, offers significant benefits not just for the child, but for the parent as well. The author describes how reading to her newborn, from Romantic poetry to simple board books, became a primary way to connect and communicate. This shared activity is framed as a way for parents to guide their children's understanding of the world, from distinguishing shapes and colors to grasping complex ideas. More profoundly, it allows a parent to witness their child's developing mind, learning to "read" their child's expressions and nascent personality.</p>

The article argues that it is an ideal lifetime sport, offering a full-body workout that improves cardiovascular health, muscle strength, and bone density. Studies have linked regular tennis play to a longer life expectancy compared to other physical activities. Beyond physical benefits, the sport's complex demands on motor coordination, strategy, and rapid decision-making provide a significant cognitive workout, helping to buffer against age-related decline and improve reaction times.</p>

          <p>In a new memoir, former USC and Raiders quarterback Todd Marinovich confronts his tumultuous life story of prodigious talent, intense paternal pressure, and a public downfall due to addiction. Marinovich, now 47, describes the process of writing the book as cathartic, allowing him to re-examine his complex relationship with his father and the "robo-quarterback" narrative that defined his youth. The book details his wild experiences at USC, his brief NFL career, and his subsequent struggles with heroin. Marinovich reflects on his ongoing recovery, emphasizing that it is a daily process of letting go of defiance and learning self-acceptance.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores a novel concept for combating climate change: treating excess atmospheric carbon as a sacred commodity to be hoarded, much like the U.S. government sequesters gold in Fort Knox. The idea, developed by an anthropologist and an artist, proposes creating community-based cooperative banks that accept organic waste, convert it into a stable form of carbon called biochar, and issue a local digital currency in return. This would create a grassroots system that gives value to carbon sequestration, taking it out of the environmental cycle. The authors suggest this approach could be a powerful, decentralized tool for climate action.</p>

          <p>Two decades after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, the storm's legacy serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of inadequate infrastructure and failed government response. The 2005 hurricane caused catastrophic flooding when federal levees broke, leading to 1,400 deaths and displacing hundreds of thousands. This retrospective examines the known vulnerabilities that were ignored before the storm, the chaotic and insufficient response from agencies like FEMA, and the city's ongoing, incomplete recovery. The article questions whether the lessons about disaster preparedness and federal responsibility have been truly absorbed, especially amid current political discussions about reducing FEMA's role.</p>

These comments follow the suspension of nuclear negotiations after a June conflict and come just as Iran and European powers agreed to resume preliminary talks.

After President Trump urged Texas to redraw its congressional map to favor Republicans, California's Democratic leaders, led by Governor Gavin Newsom, responded with a proposal to do the same for their party. This tit-for-tat maneuver sidelines voter-approved independent commissions and signals a new, more aggressive phase of gerrymandering.
