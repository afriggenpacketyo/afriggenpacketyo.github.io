          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman suggests the artificial intelligence market is forming a bubble, drawing parallels to the dot-com boom of the late 1990s. He acknowledges widespread investor overexcitement while simultaneously asserting AI's profound long-term importance. Other prominent figures, including Alibaba's Joe Tsai and Bridgewater's Ray Dalio, share similar concerns about the rapid pace of investment. Despite OpenAI's projected $20 billion in annual recurring revenue this year, the company remains unprofitable, underscoring the massive capital requirements for AI development and infrastructure buildout. Altman's comments also touch on the evolving relevance of "artificial general intelligence" (AGI) and OpenAI's future expansion plans into consumer hardware and brain-computer interfaces.</p>

          <p>European missions in Beijing are reportedly considering boycotting China's upcoming military parade, which commemorates the end of the war, due to the expected attendance of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Sources indicate significant discomfort among EU diplomats, especially in light of Moscow's intensified attacks on Ukrainian territory. This parade is poised to be only the second such event China has held to mark the war's end, offering Beijing a chance to showcase its military capabilities and expanded global clout. The potential boycott highlights the ongoing diplomatic tensions surrounding Russia's actions and China's relationship with Moscow.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Peter Navarro, a trade advisor to former U.S. President Donald Trump, has publicly criticized India for its ongoing purchases of Russian crude oil, accusing the nation of undermining international efforts to isolate Russia's wartime economy. Navarro argued that India effectively acts as a "global clearinghouse" for Russian oil, providing Moscow with essential dollars. His comments follow reports of cancelled U.S.-India trade negotiations and the Trump administration's imposition of additional tariffs on Indian goods over this issue. India, however, defends its imports as a necessity for ensuring predictable and affordable energy costs for its consumers, while also highlighting that other nations criticizing it are themselves engaged in trade with Russia.</p>

          <p>Chinese semiconductor firm Cambricon Technologies, positioned as a potential competitor to Nvidia, plans to raise nearly 4 billion yuan (US$560 million) to fund its artificial intelligence chip development. This significant investment aims to bolster China's drive for technological self-sufficiency in the crucial semiconductor sector. The fundraising plan has received initial approval from the Shanghai Stock Exchange and is pending final regulatory clearance, following a year where Cambricon's stock price nearly tripled. This surge reflects strong investor confidence in its AI prospects, especially as public computing hubs are mandated to source over 50% of their chips domestically.</p>

          <p>Helsinki, Finland, a city of nearly 690,000 people, reported zero traffic fatalities in the last year, showcasing the effectiveness of its smart city planning. This achievement aligns with the European Union's "Vision Zero" program, which aims for as close to zero road fatalities as possible by 2050. Key measures contributing to this success include reducing speed limits to 30 kmph on over half of the city's streets and around schools, along with increasing public transport use. Helsinki also utilizes crash and driving speed data, resident feedback, and improved infrastructure like bike paths and street lighting to enhance overall road safety.</p>

          <p>European stock markets opened mixed on Monday, with traders closely monitoring the upcoming meeting in Washington between U.S. President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and European leaders. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index remained flat, indicating uncertainty across sectors and major regional bourses. The discussions aim to address a potential peace deal for the Ukraine war, following Trump's recent summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which concluded without a ceasefire. Zelenskyy is anticipated to face pressure for a deal, as Trump suggested he could "end the war with Russia almost immediately."</p>

Heavy rains, which began Friday, caused widespread destruction, with Buner district being the worst-hit area, accounting for over 200 deaths due to cloudbursts, mudslides, and rock slides that washed away homes and vehicles. Operations were temporarily suspended due to continued heavy rainfall, but efforts are now focused on clearing roads and delivering aid.

Directed by Jennifer Kent, known for 'The Babadook,' the film is set in 1825 and follows a young Irish convict seeking revenge for horrific acts committed against her by Colonial forces in Tasmania. The article notes its brutal content, which includes graphic portrayals of sexual assault and murder, leading to cinema walkouts. Kent has defended the film, asserting its violence is neither gratuitous nor exploitative, arguing it serves the narrative.

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, has restrengthened to a Category 4 storm after fluctuating in intensity. Located northeast of Grand Turk Island, the major hurricane is moving northwest, with forecasters expecting it to remain powerful for several days. While not anticipated to directly impact the U.S. East Coast, the National Hurricane Center warns of life-threatening surf and rip currents likely across the U.S. Eastern Seaboard this week. The storm's changes are attributed to an "eyewall replacement cycle," a process where a new, larger eyewall forms, temporarily weakening then re-strengthening the storm, as seen with Erin's recent trajectory.</p>

          <p>This opinion article by Nesrine Malik argues that journalists in Gaza are being deliberately targeted by Israel due to their professional and dignified reporting, which challenges official narratives. The author highlights the immense sacrifices made by Al Jazeera's Gaza team, many of whom have been killed or lost family members, yet continue their work as a duty. Malik criticizes the "legitimisation cell" within the Israeli military, which she claims aims to portray Gaza-based journalists as militants to blunt global outrage over their killings. The article also faults Western media for often treating Israeli claims as plausible without sufficient scrutiny, thereby failing to adequately support Palestinian journalists.</p>

          <p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul called for increased pressure on Russia and robust security guarantees for Ukraine, advocating for a "just and lasting peace" ahead of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump. Key European leaders, including Germany's Friedrich Merz, France's Emmanuel Macron, and UK's Keir Starmer, met beforehand to underscore that any territorial negotiations must directly involve Kyiv. This united front aims to counter Trump's recent suggestion that Zelenskyy could end the war "almost immediately" by ceding Crimea and abandoning NATO aspirations, emphasizing the importance of Ukraine's sovereignty and security.</p>

          <p>New York City police are searching for up to four gunmen responsible for a mass shooting at the Taste of the City Lounge in Brooklyn, which resulted in three fatalities and nine injuries. The incident, believed to be gang-related, occurred during a dispute within the crowded nightclub, where officers recovered at least 42 shell casings. Mayor Eric Adams urged public assistance in the ongoing investigation, emphasizing that every piece of information is crucial to solving the crime. Despite this tragic event, NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch noted that citywide gun violence statistics for the first seven months of the year are at a record low, calling this incident an anomaly.</p>

          <p>Terence Stamp, the acclaimed British actor known for his roles in "Billy Budd" and as General Zod in early "Superman" films, has died at 87. Associated with the Swinging '60s, Stamp was celebrated for his distinctive looks and versatile performances, portraying everything from a humble sailor to shadow-haunted super-villains. His career spanned over 60 films, including a critically praised portrayal of a transgender woman in "The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert." Stamp overcame a working-class background and a career lull, famously returning to acting after receiving a telegram for the "Superman" role, leaving behind an extraordinary body of work.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump declared that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy could end the war "if he wants to," but stipulated "no going into Nato by Ukraine" and "no getting back Obama given Crimea" as part of a peace deal. These remarks came hours before he was set to host Zelenskyy and European leaders at the White House. Trump's comments follow his summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, which shifted from a ceasefire demand to a call for a permanent peace deal. Zelenskyy, upon arrival, reiterated his call for effective security guarantees from allies, emphasizing that past "guarantees" in 1994 proved ineffective.</p>

          <p>U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to allow the U.S. and European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee resembling NATO's collective defense mandate. This concession, described as "game-changing," emerged from Trump's summit with Putin and could serve as a workaround to Russia's longstanding objection to Ukraine's NATO membership. While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy welcomed the willingness for support, he noted a lack of details on how such an agreement would function or what roles America and Europe would play. The potential deal also reportedly includes Russia agreeing not to violate other European countries' sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Malaria cases in Zimbabwe have sharply increased this year, with deaths more than tripling from 45 to 143 between January and May, following U.S. aid cuts initiated by the Trump administration. These cuts specifically debilitated malaria research and support programs, leading to a surge in cases that now approach 120,000. Experts warn that without adequate funding, the Zimbabwean government struggles to distribute essential control methods like mosquito nets and preventive medicines, predicting that "lives will be lost." The crisis highlights the vulnerability of public health to international aid fluctuations and the growing challenge of malaria outbreaks, often exacerbated by climate change.</p>

          <p>Bolivia is on the cusp of electing its first non-left-wing president in nearly two decades, as preliminary results indicate a runoff between centrist Senator Rodrigo Paz Pereira and right-wing former president Jorge Quiroga. Paz Pereira, a surprise frontrunner, campaigned on redistributing funds to regional entities and fighting corruption, proposing accessible credit and tax breaks. This political shift comes amidst Bolivia's worst economic crisis in years, marked by fuel and foreign reserve shortages and high inflation. A change in government could also signify closer ties with the U.S., moving away from two decades of strengthened relations with China, Russia, and Iran, and potentially opening up Bolivia's vast lithium reserves to foreign investment.</p>

          <p>The Shanghai Composite Index has surged to a 10-year high, reflecting a prevailing "risk-on" mood in mainland Chinese markets as investors seek higher returns. The index advanced 0.9%, reaching a level not seen since August 2015, while the CSI 300 Index also climbed to its highest close in almost a year. This turnaround follows years of underperformance, driven by the fading appeal of fixed-income products like low-yielding government bonds and deposits. Telecoms and IT stocks are leading the gains, with companies on the CSI 300 offering an attractive average dividend yield compared to traditional investments, signaling a rotation of capital into equities.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the unprecedented diplomatic efforts by European leaders to manage their relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump, particularly ahead of the crucial Ukraine peace talks. It highlights how leaders like Starmer, Stubb, Meloni, and Rutte have cultivated individual relationships with Trump since a tense Oval Office meeting in February. The strategy aims to flatter Trump and emphasize his role in fostering peace, while subtly pushing for continued U.S. commitment to Europe rather than capitulation to Russia. The piece underscores the high stakes and unusual nature of the gathering, given Trump's unpredictable approach and the critical need for a sustainable resolution to the conflict.</p>

          <p>China has released its annual report on human rights, accusing the United States of hypocrisy and using human rights as a "bargaining chip" in its foreign policy. The report criticizes the U.S. political system, citing unequal social welfare, widespread racism, and the politicization of immigration, where immigrants are allegedly used as "scapegoats for political parties." It contends that despite 2024 being a pivotal year for American citizens to exercise political rights, the reality was "fraught with political violence" and that justice was "hijacked by politics," with voters disenfranchised by electoral rules.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is expanding its federal crackdown in Washington D.C., with three additional states—West Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio—committing to deploy hundreds of National Guard troops to the city. This move follows the initial deployment aimed at addressing crime in the capital. However, crime prevention workers are skeptical, arguing that the increased military presence will do little to prevent crime or address systemic cycles of violence and property crime. Democratic city mayors, anticipating further controversial policy rollouts, are reportedly preparing legal and other measures to protect their cities from similar federal interventions.</p>
