          <p>Columbia University's acting president, Claire Shipman, took a firm stance against pro-Palestinian demonstrators who occupied Butler Library, leading to arrests and a clash between protesters and campus security.

While some lauded the university's actions, others criticized the use of force against unarmed demonstrators.

The agreement includes reducing import taxes on British cars to 10% for a set number annually and allowing some steel and aluminum into the US tariff-free. While leaders from both countries have hailed the deal as significant, some analysts say it does not substantially alter the terms of trade as they stood before the tariffs.

This shift, driven by political polarization and attempts to delegitimize the courts, undermines the principle of a government of laws, not of individuals. While scrutiny of public officials is necessary, the focus on judges' personal biases risks eroding trust in the judiciary and allowing for further overreach by the executive branch.
