          <p>Over 180 current and former UK military aircrew are pursuing legal action against the Ministry of Defence, claiming their cancer diagnoses resulted from exposure to toxic fumes in helicopters like the Sea King and Chinook. The MoD has issued out-of-court settlements in at least six cases without admitting liability, maintaining that engine emissions pose no health risk. Veterans' groups and solicitors are advocating for a comprehensive cancer screening program and increased awareness, highlighting that personnel were unaware of risks beyond combat. The MoD is currently conducting monitoring to verify its safety claims.</p>

          <p>A recent G7 agreement will exempt U.S. multinational corporations from a previously agreed-upon global minimum tax, a move criticized as prioritizing corporate profits over public interest. This decision undermines the OECD/G20's Pillar Two framework, which was designed to establish a 15% minimum tax rate and curb harmful tax competition between nations. The authors, prominent economists, argue this exemption creates an unfair advantage for American companies and incentivizes a "race to the bottom" in global tax policy. They contend the deal weakens multilateralism and call for a stronger, UN-led international tax system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Dalai Lama has officially announced that the 600-year-old institution will continue after his death, ending speculation about its future. In a video message, he stated that his office will follow tradition to find and recognize his reincarnation, explicitly warning that no outside authority, particularly China, has the right to interfere in the process. This declaration comes as he celebrates his 90th birthday and is seen as a direct message to Beijing, which is expected to name its own successor. The Tibetan community-in-exile supports the continuation, viewing the institution as a vital symbol of their identity and struggle.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that Alabama prosecutors violated the constitutional rights of Michael Sockwell, a Black man sentenced to death in 1990, by systematically excluding Black individuals from his jury. The 2-1 decision noted a pattern of discriminatory intent, as prosecutors rejected 80% of eligible Black jurors. Sockwell, convicted of killing a former sheriff, is now eligible for a retrial. His case also involves a judge overriding a jury's 7-5 recommendation for a life sentence, a practice Alabama no longer permits, and claims of a coerced confession.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a decisive 6-1 victory against the Chicago White Sox, propelled by a strong performance from pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto and an early offensive surge. Yamamoto pitched seven innings, allowing only one run and striking out eight, lowering his ERA to 2.51. The Dodgers' offense ignited in the first inning with a four-run rally, and the scoring was later bolstered by Andy Pages' two run-scoring hits and a solo home run from Shohei Ohtani, his 30th of the season.

Key points of contention include China's economic policies and its continued support for Russia. The EU's objective is to achieve a more balanced relationship, but progress is slow, suggesting that the "reset" some had hoped for has not materialized.

          <p>Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the office of Republican Rep. Young Kim in Orange County to oppose President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." The legislation, which narrowly passed the Senate, proposes over $1 trillion in cuts to federal programs like Medicaid while extending tax cuts. Protesters, including nurses and healthcare advocates, argued the bill is cruel and will harm vulnerable Californians, as roughly one in five of Kim's constituents relies on Medicaid. Kim, who could be a critical vote in the House, stated she is listening to concerns but has previously supported a version of the bill.</p>

          <p>The "Quad" nationsâ€”the United States, Japan, India, and Australiaâ€”have announced a new initiative to secure a stable supply of critical minerals. The partnership aims to reduce global reliance on any single country, a clear move to counter China's dominance in the sector, which is vital for new technologies like semiconductors. In a joint statement, the group expressed concerns about economic coercion and supply chain disruptions. The announcement came after a meeting of the countries' foreign ministers in Washington, D.C., where they pledged to strengthen strategic stability in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants living in the U.S. The ruling prevents the Department of Homeland Security from ending the program in September, months ahead of a previously established 2026 deadline. The judge determined that the administration lacks the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation before its official expiration. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the decision, stating that district courts cannot prohibit the executive branch from enforcing immigration laws.</p>

This decision follows concerns within the Trump administration about depleting U.S. reserves and comes after a recent meeting between President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelensky.

          <p>Intel's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, is reportedly considering a significant strategic change for the company's contract manufacturing business. The potential shift would involve de-emphasizing the marketing of its "18A" chipmaking process to external customers, a technology that was a cornerstone of the previous CEO's plan. Instead, resources would be focused on the next-generation "14A" process, where Intel believes it can better compete with rival TSMC. This move, aimed at attracting major clients like Apple and Nvidia, reflects an effort to revive the struggling chipmaker but could result in a substantial financial write-off.</p>

The chaotic episode, which saw a large rebellion from his own Labour MPs, has drawn comparisons to the most difficult moments of his predecessors despite his large majority. This article suggests the event has severely weakened his authority, exposed deep divisions within his party, and left his policy agenda in disarray.
