          <p>Chancellor Friedrich Merz's coalition government is holding a two-day cabinet retreat in Berlin to address pressing issues and rebuild team spirit amid historically low public approval ratings just five months into its term. The agenda focuses on boosting Germany's economic competitiveness and cutting bureaucratic red tape, with plans to reduce administrative costs by 25%. The retreat follows a rocky start for the conservative-Social Democrat coalition, which is grappling with internal disagreements on fiscal policy, social welfare, and immigration. Separately, a German court convicted a former aide to a far-right politician for spying on behalf of China, sentencing him to over five years in prison.</p>

          <p>A potential US government shutdown looms as a last-minute meeting between President Trump and Democratic congressional leaders failed to produce an agreement. Republicans are pushing for a short-term spending extension, while Democrats are demanding a renewal of government health-insurance subsidies for low-income individuals. Both parties appear politically entrenched, with Republicans believing Democrats will be blamed for making demands, and Democrats seeing healthcare as a winning issue for them. The impasse raises concerns about the disruption of federal services and programs if a deal is not reached by the Tuesday deadline.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for governing religious affairs strictly in accordance with the law, describing it as the essential method for managing issues within the religious sphere. During a Politburo study session, he stressed the need to enhance relevant laws, conduct thorough legal education, and ensure strict enforcement. Xi stated that promoting the "sinicisation" of religions, which adapts them to Chinese political and cultural norms, is the "only way" to achieve religious, ethnic, and social harmony. This approach is presented as critical for the country's long-term stability and security.</p>

          <p>A school building collapsed in Sidoarjo, Indonesia, killing at least three students and injuring over 100, with dozens more believed to be trapped in the rubble. The incident occurred at the Al Khoziny Islamic Boarding School while students were performing afternoon prayers in a building undergoing an unauthorized expansion. Rescue efforts are ongoing but are hampered by the unstable structure, with teams supplying oxygen and water to survivors while working to free them. Authorities are investigating the cause, suspecting the building's foundation could not support the new floors being added without a proper permit.</p>

          <p>A Chinese national, Zhimin Qian, has pleaded guilty in a London court to illegally acquiring and possessing cryptocurrency related to a massive fraud scheme in China. Between 2014 and 2017, she defrauded over 128,000 investors and converted the stolen funds into bitcoin, leading to what is believed to be the world's largest crypto seizure, valued at over £5 billion. After fleeing China, Qian entered the UK and attempted to launder the money by purchasing property.

          <p>President Donald Trump, alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has unveiled a 20-point peace plan aimed at ending the war in Gaza. The proposal calls for the release of all Israeli hostages by Hamas within 72 hours in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, followed by a phased withdrawal of Israeli forces. It also demands the disarmament of Hamas and the establishment of a transitional, technocratic Palestinian government in Gaza, overseen by an international stabilization force. Netanyahu endorsed the plan, stating it achieves Israel's war aims, but warned that Israel would "finish the job by itself" if Hamas rejects the deal.</p>

          <p>The Taliban government has enforced a complete shutdown of internet and telecommunications services across Afghanistan, leading to what internet watchdog Netblocks described as a "total internet blackout." The move follows weeks of disruptions to fibre-optic connections and is reportedly part of a Taliban effort to filter online content and "prevent immoralities." International news agencies have lost contact with their Kabul offices, and the blackout is expected to severely impact banking, e-commerce, and daily life. This action represents a significant escalation of the Taliban's restrictions on information and communication since they seized power in 2021.</p>

          <p>Over 10,000 Ukrainian prisoners, including those convicted of drug dealing and murder, have been released from jail to join the country's armed forces. Under a new law, these convicts agree to fight on the front lines until the end of the war in exchange for their freedom. While motivated by a chance at rehabilitation and, for some, revenge, the soldiers face immense danger in some of the most intense combat zones. The policy aims to bolster Ukraine's military ranks with motivated individuals as the full-scale invasion continues, though it draws uncomfortable comparisons to similar Russian recruitment practices.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has ordered agents from the FBI, DEA, and other Justice Department agencies to help protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities. The directive follows a recent fatal shooting at an ICE office in Dallas and what Bondi described as a rise in "extreme political violence" targeting immigration agents. A temporary "ICE Protection Task Force" will be formed, with an initial focus on facilities in Portland and Chicago. The move comes as the Trump administration has intensified immigration enforcement, leading to tense protests and clashes at ICE locations nationwide.</p>

          <p>Germany's ruling coalition is facing a crisis driven by fundamental disagreements between the conservative CDU/CSU and the center-left SPD on major policy areas. Key points of contention include the national budget, with conservatives pushing for austerity while the SPD favors tax increases on wealth and inheritance to boost revenue. The parties are also at odds over the country's welfare system, pension reform, and the future of military conscription. These deep-seated ideological conflicts have contributed to the government's record-low approval ratings and threaten its stability as it attempts to find common ground.</p>

          <p>A woman who was knocked unconscious during a violent arrest by two Solano County sheriff's deputies in 2020 has secured a $17 million settlement. Nakia Porter, a Black woman, had pulled over with her family to switch drivers when the deputies approached, drew their guns, and slammed her to the pavement while handcuffing her. The incident, recorded on body cameras, led to a federal lawsuit alleging excessive force and civil rights violations. Porter was jailed overnight on suspicion of resisting arrest but was never formally charged with a crime.</p>

          <p>Police in Morocco have detained dozens of young protesters for a third consecutive day as authorities attempt to suppress demonstrations calling for improved education and healthcare. The protests, organized by anonymous youth networks online, have taken place in several major cities, including Rabat and Casablanca. A key complaint is that the government is investing in stadiums for the 2030 World Cup while neglecting essential public services. The demonstrations reflect widespread discontent over social inequality and high youth unemployment in the North African nation, which stands at nearly 36%.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the recent decline in support for diversity initiatives within Germany's cultural institutions is not a sign of fatigue but a deliberate political strategy. For a few years after movements like Black Lives Matter, there was a push for diversification, but this momentum has faded amid budget cuts and a reactionary pushback. The far-right AfD party frames diversity as "ideological indoctrination," and this rhetoric is gaining traction. The author contends that this backlash, often disguised as a return to meritocratic "neutrality," serves to protect existing privileges and risks losing complexity and truth in art.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto, currently a major Category 3 storm, is expected to generate dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents along most of the U.S. East Coast this week.

Humberto rapidly intensified over the weekend, reaching Category 5 strength before weakening slightly. Forecasters are also monitoring Tropical Storm Imelda, which is expected to become a hurricane but is projected to move away from the U.S. mainland and approach Bermuda by mid-week.</p>

          <p>The Miami Dolphins defeated the New York Jets 27-21 to claim their first victory of the season, but the win was overshadowed by a severe injury to star wide receiver Tyreek Hill. Hill dislocated his left knee in the third quarter after a tackle and was carted off the field, with the injury likely to end his season. In his first game in nearly two years, Dolphins tight end Darren Waller scored two touchdowns, and quarterback Tua Tagovailoa threw for 177 yards. The Jets, now 0-4, struggled with turnovers and penalties despite an effective rushing attack.</p>
