          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 02:42:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Official figures indicate that the UK economy experienced stronger-than-anticipated growth in the first three months of 2025, expanding by 0.7%, surpassing analysts' forecasts of 0.6%. The Office for National Statistics attributes this growth primarily to the robust performance of the UK services sector, with significant contributions from production as well. Chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed these figures as evidence of the UK economy's strength, noting that its growth outpaced that of the US, Canada, France, Italy, and Germany during the same period. However, shadow chancellor Mel Stride criticized the rise in employer's National Insurance payments, which came into effect in April, calling it a "jobs tax".</p>

          <p>Two British academics have identified a manuscript in Harvard Law School's library as an original 1300 version of Magna Carta, not a copy as previously believed, making it one of only seven such documents in existence. The manuscript, purchased for a mere $27.50 after World War II, had remained largely unnoticed for decades. Researchers authenticated the document using ultraviolet light and spectral imaging, comparing it to other known originals. The discovery is considered providential, especially given the current political climate and scrutiny Harvard faces, highlighting the document's enduring relevance in upholding the rule of law.</p>

          <p>A group of 21 economies, including the United States and China, has issued a warning about a potential sharp slowdown in their collective growth due to ongoing trade tensions and policy uncertainty. The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forecasts a drop in growth to 2.6% in 2025, down from 3.6% in the previous year. Carlos Kuriyama, Director of the APEC Policy Support Unit, highlighted the detrimental impact of tariff hikes, retaliatory measures, and non-tariff barriers on trade. He emphasized that restoring confidence in trade requires easing tensions, strengthening supply chain resilience, and improving the transparency of trade rules.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alabama lawmakers have passed legislation providing enhanced legal protections for police officers, establishing legal standards for the use of force and immunity hearings. Republicans argue the bill is necessary to support law enforcement, while Democrats fear it could lead to increased impunity for officers. The bill states that an officer ‚Äúshall be justified‚Äù in using physical force as long as it is not constitutionally excessive or ‚Äúrecklessly‚Äù outside of the officer‚Äôs discretionary authority. Critics, particularly Black lawmakers, expressed concerns that the bill could embolden misconduct and disproportionately harm minority communities, with some labeling it a ‚Äúlicense to kill Black people.‚Äù</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 02:11:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denmark's economy has experienced a boom driven by a surge in pharmaceutical exports, but the International Monetary Fund expects growth to moderate in the coming years. Despite this anticipated slowdown, the IMF suggests that potential U.S. tariffs on the pharma industry will have limited impact on Denmark. The country's drugmakers rely on a "merchanting and processing" system, with most of the value tied to intellectual property rather than domestic production. The IMF notes that only 3% of Denmark's total exports are produced in the country and pass through customs, thus limiting the direct impact of U.S. tariffs.</p>

          <p>Four sick children from Gaza have been evacuated to Jordan, along with twelve parents and guardians, to receive medical treatment after enduring 19 months of war. The evacuation plan was initiated following a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Jordan's King Hussein in February, with the goal of bringing 2,000 sick children to Jordan for treatment. However, Jordanian sources claim that Israeli delays and restrictions have impeded the evacuation process. The article paints a grim picture of Gaza, describing it as a claustrophobic zone of hunger and death, where those who manage to leave for medical treatment are exceptions.</p>

The government is considering releasing 100,000 tons of reserve rice per month for three months through July, in addition to the 321,000 tons already auctioned between March and April. This move comes as average rice prices have been rising due to a poor harvest in 2023 and increased consumption by tourists.

          <p>After four days of airstrikes and drone attacks, India and Pakistan are holding to a tenuous cease-fire, averting a potential nuclear war. This crisis highlights the dangers of the modern nuclear age as more nations expand their arsenals. The Trump administration intervened to de-escalate the conflict after India struck a military air base in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, prompting a meeting of Pakistan's National Command Authority. A scientific study in 2019 assessed the consequences of a nuclear war between India and Pakistan, finding that millions could die, and billions could be affected by worldwide famine.</p>

          <p>The Independent Schools Council (ISC) reports that the average cost of private school has increased by 22.6% in the last year, exceeding government estimates, due to the introduction of VAT on fees. The average termly fee for a day school in January was ¬£7,382, including 20% VAT, compared to ¬£6,021 in January last year. The ISC expects a reduction in pupils applying for private school as a result of the increased fees. A Treasury spokesperson says the increase in fees are not only down to VAT and the data "misrepresents reality".</p>

The Republican budget legislation targets key climate and energy provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, impacting renewable energy, manufacturing, energy efficiency, and electric vehicles. Environmental groups and renewable energy companies are lobbying against the cuts, arguing they are vital for supporting new industries. The GOP budget proposal would abruptly end the homeowner tax credit at the end of 2025, affecting local economies in Republican districts.</p>

Maureen Hartnett stated that she found broken glass, scratches, and a dent on Read's vehicle, as well as blood and debris from O'Keefe's clothes, but the evidence in the Solo cups, collected by Canton Police, was never analyzed, leaving its identification as blood uncertain. The defense could request the testing of these swabs, if they still exist, to contextualize the case. Read is charged with second-degree murder, drunk driving manslaughter, and fleeing a deadly accident.</p>
