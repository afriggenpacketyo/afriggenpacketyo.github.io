          <p>This article discusses the ceasefire agreement reached between India and Pakistan after U.S.-led talks aimed at ending escalating military confrontations. The agreement was intended to halt weeks of clashes triggered by a tourist massacre that India blamed on Pakistan, which denied the charge. However, hours after the ceasefire was announced, explosions were heard in Indian-controlled Kashmir, leading to accusations of violations from both sides. The article details the initial agreement, the subsequent explosions, and the conflicting claims from Indian and Pakistani officials, highlighting the fragility of the truce and the ongoing tensions between the two nations. The U.S. Secretary of State said that the two governments agreed to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times article reports that the Trump administration has directed federal agencies to stop estimating the economic impact of climate change when developing policies and regulations. This directive effectively shelves the "social cost of carbon," a metric used to weigh the costs and benefits of policies limiting carbon pollution. The article explains that this metric, which estimates the economic damage from global warming, was previously used to justify stricter emission limits. Critics argue that this decision ignores the scientific consensus on climate change and allows for policies guided by "feelings, not facts." The article also notes the potential legal challenges the administration may face for failing to consider climate change in project approvals.</p>

          <p>This article reports on the outcome of talks between Ukraine's allies in Kyiv, described by Prime Minister Starmer as a "significant moment" in the push for a ceasefire in the conflict with Russia. Around 30 global leaders reasserted their call for Russia to agree to a 30-day unconditional ceasefire, threatening "massive" sanctions if it does not comply. The article notes that the leaders assembled in Kyiv warned that "new and massive" sanctions will be imposed on Russia's energy and banking sectors if Putin does not agree to the unconditional 30-day ceasefire "in the air, at sea and on land". The Kremlin reacted to the proposal by accusing European leaders of making "contradictory" and "generally confrontational" remarks about Russia.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the challenges faced by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell in navigating the current economic landscape, where President Trump's tariffs threaten both growth and inflation. Economists suggest Powell is in a no-win situation, as any action he takes could be seen as a mistake. Trump has been pressuring the Fed to cut rates, while recent data presents a mixed picture, with heightened worries in manufacturing and service sectors but no clear signs of price spikes or economic slowdown. The article also highlights Powell's past missteps, including the Fed's initial dismissal of inflation as "transitory" in 2021.</p>
