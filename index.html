          <p>A sudden cloudburst triggered a massive flash flood in a remote Himalayan village in Indian-administered Kashmir, resulting in at least 37 deaths and injuring around 150 people. The disaster struck a group of over 100 Hindu pilgrims resting en route to a shrine, completely washing away a large makeshift kitchen. This event is the second major flooding disaster in the region this month, highlighting what experts describe as an increasing frequency and severity of such events due to climate change and inadequate planning.</p>

          <p>A draft executive order by Donald Trump aims to exempt space launches from most environmental reviews, a move seen as beneficial to commercial space companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin. Environmental advocates and legal experts warn the order could be illegal, as it attempts to bypass key regulations like the National Environmental Policy Act (Nepa). Critics argue that classifying rocket launches, which produce significant pollution and harm wildlife habitats, as minor "categorical exclusions" could lead to environmental disaster and represents an overreach of presidential authority.</p>

          <p>The Producer Price Index (PPI), a measure of wholesale inflation, unexpectedly jumped 0.9% in July, significantly higher than the 0.2% forecast and marking the largest monthly increase since June 2022. This surge in prices for final demand goods and services suggests that inflationary pressures may still be a significant threat to the U.S. economy. While consumer inflation (CPI) has been relatively soft, the strong PPI data raises concerns that businesses may soon start passing these higher costs on to consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent border clashes with Cambodia have significantly strengthened the Thai military's political influence, potentially at the expense of the civilian government. The conflict has allowed the army to operate with minimal oversight, and a leaked phone call where the Prime Minister appeared to criticize her own army has led to political turmoil and accusations of treason. With public trust in the military high and the ruling Pheu Thai party facing a potential collapse, analysts suggest another military coup is not impossible, or that a former junta leader could return to power.</p>

          <p>President Trump has moved to federalize Washington, D.C.'s police force, citing a city overrun by crime, but this characterization conflicts with federal data showing a 30-year low in violent crime. While D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser called the president's description "hyperbolic," polls show many residents perceive crime as a serious, rising problem despite the statistical decline. This discrepancy reflects a national trend where public perception of crime, often influenced by political rhetoric, does not align with official data, creating a complex challenge for policymakers.</p>

          <p>Social Security beneficiaries could receive a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in 2026, according to a new estimate from the Senior Citizens League. This projection, based on the latest inflation data, is slightly higher than the 2.5% increase recipients saw in 2025. The official COLA is determined by the Social Security Administration in the fall using inflation data from the third quarter, but some experts worry that even with the adjustment, benefit payments may not fully keep pace with seniors' true expenses.

          <p>Doctors in Gaza report a rising number of children arriving at hospitals with severe malnutrition, contradicting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's claims that there is no hunger in the territory. The U.N. warns that starvation is at its highest level since the war began, with thousands of children suffering from acute malnutrition, a condition requiring specialized hospital treatment. While recent aid increases may help, experts say it won't save those already severely malnourished, and a planned Israeli offensive threatens to worsen the dire humanitarian situation.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's move to take control of Washington D.C.'s police, the mayors of several other Democratic-led cities he targeted—including Chicago, Los Angeles, and Baltimore—have forcefully pushed back. The mayors, all of whom are Black, highlighted that their cities are experiencing historic lows in violent crime, contrary to Trump's claims. They condemned the threats as a political tactic to dismantle democracy and noted the racial undertones of targeting cities led by Black mayors, arguing for federal partnership in violence prevention rather than military-style takeovers.</p>

The 133-year-old company, which previously filed for bankruptcy in 2012, is grappling with the legacy of its transition from the film to the digital era, even as its classic products enjoy renewed popularity.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has ruled in favor of the Trump administration, allowing it to proceed with cutting billions of dollars in congressionally approved foreign aid. The decision reverses a lower court's injunction that had blocked the cuts, which were initiated by a 90-day pause on all foreign assistance. The ruling permits the termination of nearly $4 billion for global health programs and over $6 billion for HIV/AIDS initiatives, a move that humanitarian organizations have warned could have drastic and deadly consequences globally.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the recent wave of Western nations, including France, the UK, and Canada, moving to recognize a Palestinian state, arguing the gesture is driven more by domestic political pressures than a viable peace strategy. The author contends that leaders are attempting to appease growing anti-Israel sentiment within their progressive coalitions, which has intensified with public protests and anti-Jewish incidents. However, the move is unlikely to satisfy activists demanding sanctions against Israel or alter the reality on the ground, where Hamas's influence and rejection of key conditions make the plan unachievable.</p>

          <p>Financial experts advise that President Trump's "big beautiful bill" could complicate the decision to perform a Roth conversion, which involves moving pretax IRA funds into a post-tax Roth IRA. While the law made lower income tax rates permanent, it also introduced several temporary, income-limited tax breaks. This means that while there may be more room in lower tax brackets for conversions, incurring too much income from a conversion could make an individual ineligible for these new deductions, requiring careful multi-year tax planning.
