          <p>A man is in custody after allegedly stabbing eleven people in what authorities are calling a random attack at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan. The incident occurred near the checkout area, and the 42-year-old suspect reportedly used a folding knife. Six of the victims are in critical condition, with the remaining five in serious condition. Bystanders are being praised for their quick actions in helping to apprehend the suspect and provide aid to the injured before first responders arrived.</p>

          <p>Approximately 4,000 NASA employees, representing about 20% of its workforce, have chosen to leave the agency through a deferred resignation program initiated by the Trump administration. This reduction is part of a broader plan to shrink the federal workforce and comes amid proposed budget cuts for the agency. While the White House has proposed significant funding decreases, Congress is considering maintaining current budget levels, and a recent bill allocated additional long-term funding for key missions, creating uncertainty about NASA's future operational capacity.</p>

          <p>Virginia Tech's athletic department has launched an investigation following allegations from North Carolina Central's head football coach, Trei Oliver. Oliver claimed that a Hokies assistant coach was on the NCCU sideline during a game, actively recruiting one of his players to enter the transfer portal. The player in question, running back J'Mari Taylor, later transferred to the University of Virginia. Virginia Tech stated this was the first they had heard of the issue and are committed to reviewing the matter internally.</p>

          <p>A new BBC documentary series is examining the history of the Jesus Army, a disgraced evangelical movement in the UK that disbanded five years ago following extensive allegations of abuse. The investigation, which began in 2016, uncovered hundreds of cases of child abuse and evidence of a cover-up by senior leadership. The group's founder, Noel Stanton, was accused of sexual assault by a former elder before his death in 2009. The documentary explores the lasting trauma for survivors, with a redress scheme recently paying damages to hundreds of victims.</p>

          <p>A Guess advertisement in Vogue featuring a photorealistic but entirely AI-generated model has ignited controversy over the future of fashion and beauty standards. Critics, including plus-size model Felicity Hayward, argue the move is a "disheartening" step backward for diversity and could negatively impact the mental health of consumers. The company behind the AI model, Seraphinne Vallora, defends its work as a new marketing choice, not a replacement for human models.

          <p>The UK government is planning to change licensing rules to protect pubs and music venues from noise complaints, particularly from new residential developments. The proposed reforms would require developers building near existing venues to incorporate soundproofing measures. The changes also aim to streamline the process for opening new bars in disused shops and encourage more outdoor dining and live performances. This initiative is designed to help struggling town centers and a pub industry that has seen a steady decline in recent years.</p>

          <p>Opposition lawmakers in Taiwan, who hold a majority in the legislature, have successfully survived a large-scale recall vote, ensuring the island's political gridlock will continue. The recall campaign targeted 24 lawmakers from the China-friendly KMT party, accusing them of undermining national security and obstructing the agenda of President William Lai. Despite widespread protests and mobilization by civic groups, the effort failed to oust the lawmakers. This outcome emboldens the opposition and presents a significant challenge for President Lai's administration for the remainder of his term.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has exposed a "fantasist" and convicted fraudster who orchestrated an elaborate, fake music festival called Monmouth Rising. The man, James Kenny, claimed a lineup including major bands like The Killers and said the event would be the world's first hydrogen-powered festival. He deceived employees and suppliers with false promises of major investors and government backing, but no licenses were filed and no bands were actually booked. The scheme unraveled when payments failed to materialize, leaving employees and businesses unpaid and highlighting vulnerabilities within the festival industry.</p>

This move is reportedly part of a broader strategy to encourage more European nations to formally recognize a Palestinian state. The French official stated that in exchange for the Arab condemnation, European countries would confirm their intent to recognize Palestine. This follows France's own announcement that it will recognize Palestinian statehood in September, a decision that drew criticism from the U.S. and Israel.</p>

Prosecutors argued that Czuba targeted the family, who were his tenants, because they were Muslim and in response to the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war. The brutal attack, in which the boy was stabbed 26 times, drew international condemnation and heightened fears of anti-Muslim violence.</p>

A federal appeals court is set to hear arguments in a lawsuit challenging his authority to impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). A lower court has already ruled that Trump exceeded his authority, and policy analysts suggest that if the Supreme Court ultimately rules against him, it could unravel nearly all of his administration's major trade actions.
