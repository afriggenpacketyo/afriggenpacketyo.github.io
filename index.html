          <p>This article provides guidance for homeowners considering no-closing-cost home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), a popular option for tapping into home equity. It explains that while these products eliminate upfront fees, the costs are often absorbed through higher interest rates or penalties for early closure. Potential borrowers are advised to calculate their break-even point and carefully read the fine print to understand the long-term financial implications before committing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a plan to impose tariffs of up to 200% on pharmaceuticals imported into the United States, a move he stated could happen 'very soon.' However, he also suggested that drugmakers might be given a grace period of up to a year and a half to move their production to the U.S. before the tariffs take effect. The pharmaceutical industry has warned that such levies could lead to higher drug costs for consumers and disrupt the global supply chain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a visit to Washington D.C., Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicated he would be open to Israel acquiring advanced U.S. military hardware, including B-2 stealth bombers and powerful bunker-busting bombs. His comments follow a push from a bipartisan group of House representatives to authorize President Trump to provide Israel with such capabilities. The proposal is framed as a strategic measure to counter Iran's nuclear program, strengthening Israel's defensive and offensive capacities.</p>

          <p>Following his conviction on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, Sean 'Diddy' Combs is awaiting an October 3rd sentencing hearing while being held without bail. Although each count carries a maximum of 10 years, prosecutors have indicated a sentence range of approximately four to five years is more likely. Legal experts cited in the article suggest that while some prison time is almost certain, federal judges have significant discretion, making the final outcome difficult to predict.</p>

          <h2>Four Reasons to Consider Credit Card Debt Forgiveness in July</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article presents a case for why individuals with significant credit card debt might consider pursuing debt forgiveness programs this month. It argues that with Federal Reserve interest rate cuts unlikely in the immediate future, waiting for external relief is impractical as high-interest debt continues to compound. Acting now can address the growing financial burden and mitigate the negative impact that high debt loads have on a person's overall financial health and credit score. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from the Quincy Institute and Brown University found that the Pentagon awarded $2.4 trillion in contracts to private firms between 2020 and 2024, accounting for over half of its discretionary budget. This spending represents what the authors call a 'massive transfer of wealth from taxpayers to fund war and weapons manufacturing,' with the top five defense contractors alone receiving $771 billion. The study notes that this trend of escalating military budgets is set to continue, benefiting both traditional arms firms and new military tech companies. (not investment advice)</p>
