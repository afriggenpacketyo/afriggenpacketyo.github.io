          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 09:40:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This summer has seen a significant surge in flight cancellations across the United States, with the national rate increasing by 29% compared to the same period in 2024. East Coast airports have been disproportionately affected, with Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport experiencing a 274% higher cancellation rate. In contrast, several airports, particularly in Florida and California, have seen improved performance with fewer cancellations. Despite fewer scheduled flights overall, the number of cancellations has risen, and the average delay time has also slightly increased, contributing to widespread travel disruptions.</p>

          <p>Following public pressure and media reports, President Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to petition the court to unseal grand jury transcripts related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. The move comes after a Wall Street Journal article mentioned a letter signed by Trump in a birthday album for Epstein. While some supporters praised the decision, critics, including Democratic lawmakers, argue that the transcripts represent only a fraction of the evidence and that other materials like videos and interview notes should also be released to ensure full transparency.</p>

          <p>New York Republican Representative Elise Stefanik has used a viral photo, which sparked online allegations of an affair between a CEO and an employee at a Coldplay concert, for political attacks. On social media, Stefanik leveraged the image to criticize New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani and Governor Kathy Hochul. This action occurs as Stefanik is rumored to be considering a run for New York governor, a race that fellow Republican Representative Mike Lawler is also reportedly contemplating against the incumbent Hochul.</p>

          <p>Gold continues to be a popular commodity, often viewed as a safe-haven asset and a hedge against inflation during times of economic instability. The price of gold is subject to constant fluctuation, influenced by a variety of factors including supply and demand, global economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical events. The strength of the U.S. dollar and central bank policies also play a significant role in determining its value. As of mid-July 2025, the price stood at $3,337.20 per ounce, reflecting its appeal to investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Avon and Somerset Police have announced they will not take further action against the Irish rap group Kneecap following an investigation into their Glastonbury Festival performance. The inquiry was launched to determine if on-stage comments constituted a criminal offense. After consulting with the Crown Prosecution Service, authorities concluded there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction. The investigation followed weeks of controversy surrounding the group's pro-Palestinian stance and pro-Hezbollah imagery, which had drawn political criticism.</p>

          <p>With the U.S. inflation rate rising to 2.7% in June, the Federal Reserve is expected to delay interest rate cuts, creating a favorable environment for savers. This article suggests that investing in a short-term certificate of deposit (CD) is a prudent strategy to capitalize on the current high-rate environment. The extended period of high rates allows savers more time to find the best accounts, while the short-term nature of these CDs offers flexibility to adapt to future economic changes. Savers can still earn significant interest in the interim. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump, 79, has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common medical condition affecting blood flow in the legs. The disclosure came after photographs showed swelling in the president's ankles. According to a memo from the White House physician, the condition is considered "benign" and is common in people over 70. The examination found no evidence of more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis or heart failure, and the physician stated Trump "remains in excellent health."</p>

The author draws on personal experiences and points to bigoted tactics used against Mamdani by figures in both the Democratic and Republican parties, such as altering his appearance in ads and making baseless accusations. The article posits that while such prejudice is durable, Mamdani's public visibility and electoral success offer a powerful counter-narrative.</p>
