The piece further explores how Trump's attacks on the independence of the Federal Reserve and other governance standards are creating instability that China is navigating to its advantage.</p>

          <p>Luxury automaker Porsche is set to be removed from Germany's prestigious DAX stock index on September 22nd due to a significant and prolonged slump in its share price. The company's financial struggles are largely attributed to the impact of U.S. tariffs on European auto imports, along with weak demand in China and a slow transition to electric vehicles. Despite the relegation to the mid-cap MDAX index, Porsche's CEO has stated the company aims to return to the DAX as soon as possible. (not investment advice)</p>

The issue stems from her declaration that the property was her only home, while tax law deems her a co-owner of her former family home due to a trust set up for her children. The dispute centers on whether she received and followed appropriate specialist tax advice, which will determine if she is penalized for being "careless" with her tax affairs.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its legal battle over trade policy by asking the U.S. Supreme Court to quickly overturn a federal appeals court ruling that found most of the president's tariffs illegal. The government argues that the lower court's decision creates uncertainty for foreign negotiations and jeopardizes national economic strategy. The case challenges the president's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose sweeping import taxes, a central pillar of his "America First" agenda.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new scientific report from World Weather Attribution concludes that climate change dramatically fueled this summer's devastating wildfires in Spain and Portugal. The analysis found that the extreme weather conditions—hotter, drier, and more flammable—that led to the fires are now 40 times more frequent and 30% more intense due to global warming. The fires burned over 640,000 hectares combined, highlighting the urgent need to address fossil fuel emissions and improve forest management to prevent future catastrophes.</p>

          <p>Following a meeting between Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin in Beijing, North Korean staff were observed carefully wiping down chairs, tables, and other items the leader had touched. Analysts explain this is a long-standing security protocol designed to prevent foreign intelligence agencies from collecting forensic samples like hair or skin cells. These measures, which also reportedly include traveling with a personal toilet, are intended to conceal any information about Kim's health status from the outside world.</p>

          <p>A survey conducted by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and The Carter Centre indicates that the Chinese public's view of the U.S.-China relationship is more complex than often perceived. While optimistic about their own country's future, a plurality of respondents (48%) expressed a preference for a "shared leadership role" with the U.S. rather than outright global dominance. This suggests an acceptance of peaceful coexistence, although experts note that some self-censorship may have influenced the results of the survey.</p>

          <p>A BBC analysis suggests that China's massive military parade, observed by President Trump, was a clear demonstration of its growing global power and an alternative to the U.S.-led world order. The article contrasts Beijing's display of futuristic weaponry with Trump's more nostalgic, backward-looking "America First" policies. It argues that the president's high-risk tariff strategy is scrambling geopolitical alignments and could be undermined by U.S. courts, potentially leaving his administration with all risk and no reward.</p>

While the judge acknowledged that Harvard should have done more to combat antisemitism, she concluded the government's true aim was a targeted, ideologically motivated assault on the university.
