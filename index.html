            <p>An immigration judge ruled that Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil can be deported, citing concerns that his presence threatens U.S. foreign policy, as alleged by the Trump administration. The ruling has raised concerns about its potential impact on other international students. Khalil's lawyers have until April 23 to file applications for relief to stop the deportation, with the judge stating she would file an order of removal to either Syria or Algeria if they fail to meet the deadline. Supporters are calling the ruling a violation of due process and an attempt to suppress dissent.</p>

            <p>The U.S. and China are engaged in a trade war, with both countries imposing tariffs on each other's goods. The U.S. President is waiting for Beijing “to make the first move” to initiate tariff negotiations and believes it “would be gracious if China intends to make a deal with the United States. Beijing responded by raising tariffs on all US imports to 125 per cent, from 84 per cent, in response to Trump’s move on Wednesday increasing levies on Chinese imports to 145 per cent.

            <p>UnitedHealth is facing criticism for demanding immediate repayment of loans issued to struggling doctors after last year's cyberattack on Change Healthcare. The company had offered no-interest loans to help practices with cash flow, but is now aggressively pursuing borrowers, threatening to withhold future payments if they don't comply. Doctors say they cannot meet the demands and feel betrayed, as UnitedHealth's CEO had previously stated repayments would only begin when practices confirmed their cash flow had normalized. The American Medical Association has urged UnitedHealth to adopt a more flexible approach to loan repayment.</p>

Some companies, from small businesses to nationally recognized brands, have already announced higher prices, citing President Trump's tariffs. Although the tariffs and retaliatory moves by other countries have yet to hit economic growth, U.S. businesses aren't waiting around. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Southern California Edison will bury more than 150 miles of power lines in Altadena and Malibu in the wake of January’s firestorms. The years-long project would reduce the future risk of wildfire in the devastated communities, officials said. The project is expected to cost at least $860 million and could take years to complete, but officials said the plan would reduce the risk of wildfires in the area, and the need for emergency power shut downs during extreme weather events.</p>

Therapists are being ordered to work in shared office spaces and inform veterans that complete confidentiality cannot be guaranteed. This directive comes after the VA indicated it would cut about 80,000 staff in a massive restructuring effort.

            <p>The Trump administration is proposing major budget cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which would slash the agency's budget by more than 25%. The proposed cuts would significantly impact NOAA's research operations and fisheries services. Critics say the cuts would harm weather forecasting and hurt the agency's ability to keep Americans safe. The changes would also follow the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 guidelines.</p>

Dabney Friedrich, a US district judge in Washington, refused to grant a preliminary injunction to the plaintiffs, more than two dozen Christian and Jewish groups representing millions of Americans. She found that only a handful of immigration enforcement actions had been conducted in or around churches or other houses of worship and that the evidence did not show “that places of worship are being singled out as special targets”.</p>
