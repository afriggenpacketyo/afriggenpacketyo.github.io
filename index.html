        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alibaba reported a better-than-expected net income surge of 78% in the June quarter, primarily fueled by accelerated sales in its cloud computing division and a revival in its e-commerce operations. Despite revenue falling slightly short of analyst forecasts, the cloud unit's 26% growth, driven by robust AI demand, was a key highlight. The company faces intense competition in China's "instant commerce" space, requiring significant investment, which impacted adjusted earnings in its core e-commerce business. Investors have responded positively, with the U.S.-listed stock rallying 40% this year, recognizing Alibaba's strategic investments in AI and new e-commerce models.</p>

          <p>India's economy experienced a robust 7.8% annual growth rate in the June quarter, significantly surpassing economists' forecasts of 6.7%. This stronger-than-expected performance was attributed to substantial contributions from the manufacturing, construction, and service sectors, indicating sustained economic momentum. The latest figures follow a healthy 7.4% growth rate in the preceding quarter, reinforcing India's position as a rapidly developing global market. International bodies like the World Bank and IMF project the country's economy to grow around 6.3-6.4% for the fiscal year, underscoring positive long-term prospects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new survey reveals that Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology is a deterrent for more U.S. consumers than it is an attraction, with 35% less likely to buy a Tesla because of it, compared to 14% more likely. This finding emerges amidst Tesla's sales slump and increased competition, compounded by reputational damage linked to Elon Musk's public rhetoric. Many consumers also believe FSD technology should be illegal, and the article highlights a perceived lack of clarity and honesty, contributing to Tesla's declining brand reputation in the U.S. The company faces scrutiny over marketing claims versus safety warnings in its manuals.</p>

Both Eric and Donald Trump Jr. are actively involved in crypto ventures, with upcoming appearances at major Asian crypto events. The family's growing involvement coincides with President Trump's shift to a pro-crypto stance, though critics raise concerns about potential conflicts of interest and illicit activity in the volatile market.

          <p>Kyiv is observing a day of mourning after a major Russian aerial attack killed at least 23 people, including four children, and injured dozens, marking one of the war's deadliest strikes. The attack, which damaged diplomatic missions, has drawn widespread international condemnation, with the White House and EU leaders expressing outrage. EU defense ministers are currently meeting to discuss further military support for Ukraine, as calls for peace negotiations are deemed "naïve" in light of Russia's continued aggression. Ukrainian President Zelensky reiterated the need for new, tough sanctions against Russia, emphasizing Moscow's choice of "ballistics instead of the negotiating table."</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have unveiled what they claim is the world's first "universal" 6G chip, capable of transmitting a 50GB 8K movie within seconds. This breakthrough could revolutionize connectivity, especially for remote areas, by unifying the fragmented spectrum of frequencies currently used by various devices. The innovation, led by scientists from Peking University and City University of Hong Kong, aims to overcome the current piecemeal approach to wireless communication challenges. The development signifies a major leap in telecommunications technology, potentially making existing solutions for diverse frequency requirements obsolete.</p>

          <p>The UK has announced it will not invite an Israeli government delegation to a global defence exhibition in London next month, citing Israel's decision to escalate its military operation in Gaza as "wrong." Israel's defence ministry called the move a "deliberate and regrettable act of discrimination" and withdrew its national pavilion. This decision reflects growing UK criticism of Israel's conduct in Gaza, with leaders calling for an immediate ceasefire, hostage returns, and increased humanitarian aid. The article underscores the diplomatic fallout from the ongoing conflict and the UK's shifting stance on Israeli military actions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores how to approach life's most challenging decisions, such as career paths, using the philosophical framework of value pluralism. It draws on Ruth Chang's theory that hard choices aren't difficult due to ignorance of a "better" option, but because alternatives are "on a par"—equally valid yet different in kind of value. The article suggests that in such dilemmas, individuals must exercise "normative power" to create their own reasons and define who they want to be. This perspective emphasizes personal agency and freedom in shaping one's life by making choices that align with deeply held moral commitments or personal security.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Akira ransomware group has discovered a method to remotely disable Microsoft Defender by exploiting a legitimate Intel CPU tuning driver, `rwdrv.sys`, in a "Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver" (BYOVD) attack. This technique allows attackers to gain kernel-level access to Windows systems, install a malicious driver, and then turn off Defender, enabling undetected deployment of ransomware. The article highlights that this method, observed since mid-July 2025, leverages the system's trust in legitimate drivers rather than software bugs. Security experts recommend strong antivirus software, limiting exposure to untrusted sources, regular updates, and two-factor authentication to protect against such sophisticated threats.</p>

          <p>Relatives of the four University of Idaho murder victims are petitioning a judge to prevent the public release of graphic crime scene photos and videos, arguing the images are traumatizing and violate their privacy. Despite the city of Moscow's attempt to redact the images by blurring bodies, families find them heartbreaking and harmful. The attorney for two families emphasized the "commodification of the killings" by the "true crime" industry, which disseminates such images worldwide. The city contends it is legally required to release records under Idaho's Public Records Act, balancing privacy with the public's right to know, and awaits the judge's ruling.</p>

It traces their history from "Byronmania" to modern "stan culture," noting how media and marketing create public personas that foster deep, yet unreciprocated, connections. While fandom can be meaningful, the article highlights the increasing toxicity, with some fans overstepping boundaries, stalking, and attempting to control stars' private lives.

          <h2>Trump Administration Seeks to Build More Roads in National Forests, Raising Wildfire Concerns</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to rescind the 2001 Roadless Rule, aiming to build more roads in national forests, ostensibly to aid firefighters and promote active forest management. However, forest ecologists and fire scientists warn that more roads could paradoxically increase wildfire risk by bringing more people and altering vegetation. Historically, roads are primary ignition points, and studies indicate non-native, flammable plants are more common near them. Environmental groups suspect the move is driven by a desire to boost timber production, rather than solely fire reduction, despite existing rule exceptions for forest health.</p>
