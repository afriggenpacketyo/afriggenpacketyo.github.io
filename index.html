          <p>Many job seekers are facing a frustrating experience characterized by a perceived 'Glass Wall,' where numerous job postings are visible, but applications seem to yield no results. Blake Isaacs, a marketing professional who coined the term after sending over 1,000 applications, describes the feeling of being unable to access recruiters or hiring managers. Experts recommend strategies for overcoming this obstacle, emphasizing the importance of networking and leveraging personal connections to break through the perceived barrier. The experience highlights the disconnect between available positions and the challenges faced by individuals seeking employment in the current job market.</p>

          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has cautioned Asian nations about the 'imminent' threat China poses to Taiwan, urging them to increase defense spending and collaborate with the United States to deter potential conflict. Speaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, Hegseth accused China of seeking regional hegemony and preparing to use military force against Taiwan, citing a potential 2027 deadline given by President Xi Jinping for military readiness. China responded by accusing the US of being the primary 'troublemaker' in the region, deploying offensive weapons in the South China Sea, and conducting reconnaissance activities. The US seeks a strong deterrent shield forged with allies, but stresses that deterrence does not come cheap.</p>

Andreeva, who is playing in her third French Open, had previously lost to Jasmine Paolini in the semi-finals the previous year.

          <p>A confidential report by the United Nations nuclear watchdog reveals that Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels. As of May 17, Iran had amassed 900.8 pounds of uranium enriched up to 60%, a nearly 50% increase since February, raising concerns as it is a short technical step away from weapons-grade levels. The IAEA warned that Iran is the only non-nuclear-weapon state producing such material, prompting stern reactions from Israel, which sees it as a clear sign of Iran's determination to complete its nuclear weapons program. The IAEA chief reiterated his urgent call for Iran to cooperate fully with the agency's investigation into uranium traces discovered at undeclared sites.</p>

          <p>A psychiatrist with experience working with young adults suggests that parenting can be simplified by following five basic rules. These include trusting parental instincts, embracing cultural traditions, paying attention to each child's unique interests, focusing on enjoyment rather than strict development, and being authentic rather than striving for perfection. The psychiatrist emphasizes the importance of love, attention, and emotional modulation in raising children, noting that every generation faces unique challenges and parents should avoid overcomplicating the process. By prioritizing these simple rules, parents can navigate the complexities of child-rearing with greater confidence and less anxiety.</p>

          <p>Doctors at the University of Maryland Medical Center performed a first-of-its-kind surgery to remove a tumor on Karla Flores' spine through her eye. Flores, who had been experiencing double vision, was initially diagnosed with a chordoma wrapped around her brain stem, and during an MRI, doctors discovered a second chordoma at the top of her spine. Neurosurgeon Dr. Mohamed Labib developed a complex surgical plan, using a 'third nostril' approach to reach the spinal tumor, which was successfully removed. The procedure involved cutting through the membrane protecting the eye and removing part of the eye socket, leaving Flores with no external scars.</p>

She highlights AI's ability to teach by example and aid in understanding complex topics, but stresses the importance of verifying AI's output and integrating AI usage into school curricula.

Despite abortion being almost entirely illegal in Texas, law enforcement looked at cameras in states where abortion is legal. While the sheriff claimed the search was for the woman's safety, experts warn that this incident is a harbinger of more AI-enabled reproductive surveillance, especially for women of color.

          <p>Abdullah Ibhais, a former 2022 World Cup worker, is seeking to sue Qatar's Supreme Committee and Fifa for negligence after spending three years in a Doha jail. Ibhais claims he was targeted after investigating workers' rights complaints and advising the Supreme Committee to acknowledge its role. He alleges his confession was coerced and that he was a victim of arbitrary detention, a finding supported by the UN working group. Ibhais aims to hold both organizations accountable for their actions and is exploring legal avenues in Switzerland, the US, or any country with jurisdiction.</p>

          <p>The Army is planning to begin involuntary separations for active-duty transgender service members who remain in service, according to internal documents. These directives instruct personnel to address transgender troops by their medical assignment at birth rather than their preferred pronoun. Soldiers will identify fellow service members suspected of having gender dysphoria based on criteria such as requests for grooming standard exemptions or overt conduct differing from assigned sex at birth. The guidance also suggests that identifying with a gender different from one's sex assigned at birth is at odds with the values of truthfulness and discipline expected of service members.</p>

          <p>A monument to Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin has been replicated and reinstalled in a Moscow metro station, decades after the original statue was removed. The original statue, depicting Stalin surrounded by admiring children and workers, was taken down in the 1960s during the de-Stalinization period. While President Vladimir Putin has acknowledged the tragic period of Stalinist purges, an estimated 105 statues honoring the dictator have been erected since he came to power. The restored monument has sparked mixed reactions, with some praising it as a part of history and others questioning the decision to honor a figure responsible for widespread suffering.</p>
