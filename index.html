          <p>Singer Billy Joel has canceled all scheduled concerts following a diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a condition where cerebrospinal fluid builds up in the brain. This condition has been exacerbated by recent concert performances, leading to problems with hearing, vision, and balance, according to Joel's website. NPH primarily affects older people and can cause gait issues, urinary incontinence, and cognitive difficulties. The most common treatment involves a surgical procedure called shunting, which regulates the amount of fluid in the brain, with symptoms typically improving within days or weeks of the shunt being implanted. </p>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has called for increased sanctions against Russia to push for a ceasefire. The attacks occurred as Russia and Ukraine engaged in prisoner swaps, with hundreds of soldiers and civilians being exchanged in what is described as the largest exchange since the start of the conflict in February 2022. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration is escalating its conflict with Harvard University by threatening to block the university's ability to enroll foreign students. This action follows previous moves to freeze funding to the university over concerns that its teaching and research are dominated by left-wing content and ideologies. The administration has given Harvard a 72-hour deadline to provide specific information about foreign students or risk losing its license to enroll them. Harvard has sued the administration, arguing that the order would cause immediate and irreparable injury, and has secured a temporary block on the order pending a further hearing. </p>

          <p>Scientists have captured never-before-seen images of the USS F-1, a World War I-era submarine that sank off the coast of San Diego in 1917, killing 19 crew members. The high-definition pictures were taken using advanced deep-sea imaging technology during an expedition led by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The team used a human-occupied vehicle and a remote underwater vehicle to conduct meticulous surveys of the submarine, which collided with another ship during training exercises. The expedition also captured images of a U.S. Navy Avenger torpedo bomber that crashed in the same area in 1950. </p>

          <p>Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, who has been frequently absent from Senate proceedings, stated that he has been "shamed" into returning due to his openness about mental health struggles being "weaponized" against him. He expressed frustration with the perceived "performative" nature of senatorial duties, such as committee work and procedural votes, which he had been routinely skipping. Fetterman said he now attends hearings and votes to counter portrayals of him as mentally unfit, despite his belief that these tasks are a waste of time. Fetterman also credits Mounjaro, a weight-loss drug, with improving his mental clarity. </p>
