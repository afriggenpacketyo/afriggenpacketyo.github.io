          <p>Elon Musk stated on the X platform that he regrets some of his recent social media posts about President Donald Trump, which he felt "went too far." This public dispute with his former ally had fueled market concerns over Tesla and SpaceX. The conflict stemmed from Musk's opposition to Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which Musk claimed would undermine the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and increase the U.S. budget deficit. Musk had deleted some posts, including one accusing Trump of being mentioned in Jeffrey Epstein's "files," which the White House disputed. The optimism score reflects the resolution of a potentially damaging public feud. </p>

          <p>China is advocating for civil aviation, specifically the certification of its domestically produced C919 aircraft, to be a key discussion point at the upcoming summit with European Union leaders in July. High-level negotiations on the safety evaluation process could potentially expedite the airliner's ratification. A rumored order of hundreds of Airbus aircraft from Beijing could further facilitate the process, as direct talks between top leaders are seen as beneficial for certification progress.

The global share of the dollar in foreign exchange reserves has declined from over 70% in 2000 to 57.8% in 2024, as countries recognize the dollar's potential weaponization in trade negotiations.

          <p>Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk is facing a vote of confidence in parliament following a presidential election defeat by right-wing nationalist Karol Nawrocki. Tusk called for the vote to rally support for his pro-European coalition, which has struggled to deliver key reforms due to opposition from the president. Critics argue that little change has occurred under Tusk's government since it came to power in December 2023. The optimism score reflects the political instability and challenges facing the Polish government.</p>
