          <p>Judge Laura Taylor Swain has ordered an outside official, a remediation manager, to take control of New York City's Rikers Island jail complex due to persistent violence and dysfunction. This official will report directly to the judge and possess broad powers to implement necessary changes, working alongside the city's correction commissioner. The decision comes after nearly a decade of federal oversight following a class-action lawsuit focused on curbing excessive force. The city has struggled to improve conditions despite significant spending, and this move is seen as a last resort to address the jail system's cyclical problems and failures to adhere to court orders. </p>

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman aims to raise the U.S.-Saudi partnership to $1 trillion across various sectors.

          <p>President Trump's second administration is facing scrutiny for blurring the lines between public office and personal benefits, highlighted by the plan to accept a $400 million luxury jet from the Qatari royal family. This action, along with other business dealings involving the Trump family in the Gulf region, raises concerns about conflicts of interest and violations of ethical norms. The removal of constraints extends to law enforcement, with the disbanding of a Justice Department unit dedicated to investigating cryptocurrency crimes and narrowed enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.</p>
