          <p>The Senate adopted a Republican budget resolution after an all-night voting marathon, moving Congress closer to enacting President Trump's agenda. The resolution aims to make tax cuts permanent, authorize additional tax cuts, and raise the debt ceiling. Democrats offered amendments forcing votes on charged political issues, but the Senate adopted the resolution, teeing it up for a House vote. Senate Republicans claim the budget plan fulfills promises to secure the border, rebuild the economy, and restore peace, while Democrats criticize the tax relief as handouts to billionaires.</p>

          <p>President Trump's across-the-board 10% tariffs on nearly all imports went into effect early Saturday, adding to the economic fallout from his "Liberation Day" plan. More severe tariffs on imports from several dozen countries are slated to take effect soon. Wall Street has been roiling since the announcement, marking the worst day for U.S. stocks since 2020, but Trump has dismissed concerns about the short-term pain to American consumers.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's tariff rollout is part of a broader strategy to manage America's debt, reset its industrial base, and renegotiate its standing in the global order. With the U.S. government needing to refinance trillions in maturing debt, the tariffs aim to create economic uncertainty, driving investors to safer assets and lowering interest rates. The administration is also targeting spending cuts and aiming to boost domestic growth by making imports more expensive, incentivizing American production. This strategy also serves as leverage in reshaping global alliances, potentially forcing countries to the negotiating table.</p>

          <p>A devastating earthquake in Myanmar has killed thousands and compounded an existing humanitarian crisis, exposing the junta's weaknesses and sparking discontent. Despite the disaster disproportionately affecting junta-held territory, the military's response has been slow and criticized for restricting aid. The earthquake has also been interpreted by some as an omen against the junta's rule.

          <p>China's Foreign Ministry stated that "the market has spoken" following the U.S. imposition of new tariffs and called for the White House to defuse the trade war through consultation.

Beijing's response has heightened investor fears of inflationary, recessionary, and global economic growth risks, prompting China to urge the White House to resolve differences through consultation.</p>

The tax has led to a significant decline in high-value property sales, reduced revenue, and slowed the production of market-rate and affordable apartments.

A variable, high-fibre diet is essential to support this bacteria and maintain a balanced microbiome.</p>
