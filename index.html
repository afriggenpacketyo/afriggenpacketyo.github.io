        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Microsoft is laying off 3% of its workforce, affecting approximately 6,000 employees across various levels, teams, and geographic locations, as part of organizational changes to enhance efficiency and position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace. The layoffs are not related to performance, according to the company. This decision follows a period of strong sales and profits for Microsoft, with the company reporting better-than-expected results and an upbeat forecast in late April. The company had 228,000 employees worldwide at the end of June. This is likely Microsoft's largest round of layoffs since the elimination of 10,000 roles in 2023.</p>

Agreements were signed for judicial cooperation, defense modernization, and FBI coordination. The visit also focused on business, with high-profile business leaders attending an investment summit. Trump also indicated he would normalize relations with Syria, giving the country "a chance at peace."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.3% annually in April, slightly below economists' expectations, signaling that price hikes remain above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Housing and energy costs were significant contributors to inflation, while grocery prices saw a slight decrease. Experts are closely monitoring the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs on consumer prices, but the April data is unlikely to reflect these effects due to exemptions and front-loading of purchases. The Federal Reserve may hold off on cutting rates as it assesses the impact of trade policies.</p>

The group, part of the "Reich Citizens" movement, rejects the legitimacy of the modern German republic and has been accused of trying to establish a "counter-state" within Germany. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt stated that the group undermines the rule of law and uses antisemitic conspiracy narratives. The ban includes associated splinter groups, and authorities believe Fitzek founded the group in 2012, declaring himself monarch.</p>

          <p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced he is putting a hold on Department of Justice political nominations in protest of President Donald Trump's plans to accept a luxury jet from Qatar. Schumer criticized the move as "naked corruption" and a "grave national security threat," demanding answers from the Trump administration and Justice Department. The nominations will likely move forward with Republican support, but Schumer's action could slow down the process.

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced it is beginning the process of removing ingestible fluoride prescription drug products for children from the market. The FDA will conduct a scientific review of these products by October 31. Ingested fluoride has been shown to "alter the gut microbiome," and studies suggest a link between fluoride and thyroid disorders, weight gain, and possibly decreased IQ. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has long questioned fluoride's safety, while dental experts largely disagree.</p>

          <p>President Trump's administration is considering accepting a luxury aircraft from Qatar for presidential use, prompting legal and ethical questions. Critics argue that accepting the gift may violate the U.S. Constitution's emoluments clause, which prohibits presidents from receiving gifts from foreign states without congressional approval. While the White House insists any donation would comply with the law, experts suggest the move raises concerns about potential bribery and undue influence.

          <p>Despite signs of economic improvement, high credit card interest rates and persistent financial strain make debt forgiveness a viable option for many borrowers. While inflation might be easing and the job market stable, credit card APRs remain elevated, trapping many in a cycle of minimum payments. Debt forgiveness can drastically reduce debt obligations and offer a path out of an otherwise endless cycle. However, debt forgiveness comes with trade-offs, like a hit to credit and potential tax liability, so borrowers should carefully consider their options.</p>
