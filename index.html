          <p>Asian stock markets experienced a decline following President Trump's suggestion that new tariffs would impact all countries, not just those with significant trade imbalances with the US.  This announcement fueled concerns about a potential global trade war and recession, leading to widespread market uncertainty. The BBC's reporting, while aiming for neutrality, subtly emphasizes the negative economic consequences of Trump's actions, potentially reflecting a bias against protectionist trade policies.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Michael Tanzi, a morbidly obese Florida death row inmate, are arguing that his weight and health conditions could lead to a botched lethal injection, violating the Eighth Amendment.
