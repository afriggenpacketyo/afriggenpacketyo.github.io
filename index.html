          <p>India and Pakistan have agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire, mediated by the United States, following rising tensions stemming from an April attack on Indian-controlled Kashmir. Pakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and Indian officials have both confirmed the agreement, which was first announced by President Donald Trump. Secretary of State Marco Rubio commended Prime Ministers Modi and Sharif for choosing the path of peace, while Indian officials initially reported Pakistani attacks across 26 locations. This ceasefire aims to de-escalate the conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbors, who have exchanged cross-border fire and strikes in recent days. The optimism surrounding this ceasefire is guarded, pending sustained adherence by both sides.</p>

          <p>Derek Carr, the New Orleans Saints' starting quarterback, has announced his retirement from the NFL after 11 seasons due to a labral tear and degenerative rotator cuff injury in his right shoulder. Carr, 34, was drafted by the Oakland Raiders in 2014 and joined the Saints as a free agent in 2023, achieving a 14-13 record as a starter. Despite mixed results and injuries during his time with the Saints, Carr accumulated 41,245 passing yards and 257 touchdowns throughout his career. His retirement follows the Saints' selection of Tyler Shough in the recent draft, potentially signaling a future quarterback transition for the team.</p>

The article highlights Arsenal's attacking prowess, led by Alessia Russo, but also raises concerns about their defensive vulnerabilities, having conceded 12 goals in their last three WSL matches. Former England goalkeeper Rachel Brown-Finnis emphasized that Arsenal's defensive lapses could be severely punished by Barcelona.

Roscosmos confirmed that the spacecraft reentered the atmosphere west of Jakarta, Indonesia, with no immediate reports of damage. Experts had previously warned that the probe's sturdy construction, designed to withstand Venus's harsh atmosphere, could allow it to reach Earth's surface largely intact.</p>

          <p>Ric Edelman, founder of Edelman Financial Engines, argues that the U.S. is failing to adequately educate its youngest investors about personal finance. He believes that the lack of financial literacy, coupled with the rise of get-rich-quick schemes and overly complex financial products, puts young investors at risk. Edelman stresses the importance of credible financial education and cautions against relying on sources like TikTok. He advocates for mandatory personal finance courses in high schools to better prepare future generations for financial success, and notes that younger generations are motivated to avoid their parents' mistakes in retirement planning.</p>

The ruling challenges the work of the ‚Äúdepartment of government efficiency‚Äù (Doge), with dozens of lawsuits alleging violations of privacy laws and exceeding authority.
