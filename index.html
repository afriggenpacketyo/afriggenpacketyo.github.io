Amorim highlighted that the team is collectively missing chances and needs to improve its overall goal-scoring ability, as evidenced by their league position. He praised the performances of young players like Tyler Fredricson and Harry Amass, emphasizing the need to focus on improving the team step by step and acknowledging that the season hinges on their Europa League campaign. Amorim acknowledged that the team lacks a lot of things, and that they need to improve step by step.</p>

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen criticized the El Salvadoran government for initially obstructing his visit to Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national mistakenly deported from Maryland. Van Hollen stated that the government staged photos to create a false impression of Abrego Garcia's well-being while he was held in a notorious prison. He emphasized the importance of upholding Abrego Garcia's constitutional rights, arguing that violating one person's rights threatens the rights of all Americans. The senator urged the Trump administration to provide evidence linking Abrego Garcia to MS-13 in court, rather than through social media posts.</p>

            <p>Joe Rogan and comedian Ron White satirized President Trump's leadership style, depicting him as casually handling serious matters while playing golf. They questioned the existence of a grand plan behind Trump's actions, particularly regarding the economy, and expressed concern over the potential consequences of his tariffs. Their comments coincided with market reactions to Trump's tariffs, which have raised fears of a potential recession.

            <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba sent a ritual offering to the Yasukuni Shrine, which is viewed by neighboring countries as a symbol of Japan's past militarism, during its spring festival. Ishiba is not expected to visit the shrine personally, likely due to diplomatic considerations as Japan aims to improve relations with China and South Korea. The Yasukuni Shrine honors wartime leaders, including those convicted as war criminals, alongside millions of war dead. This year marks the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, and Ishiba has expressed readiness to re-examine the reasons for Japan's involvement in the war.</p>

This proposal comes amid international scrutiny of El Salvador's acceptance of deportees from the U.S., who are often detained in the CECOT mega-prison, including Kilmar Abrego Garcia.

            <p>Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of violating a 30-hour "Easter truce" announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed Russian troops had violated the ceasefire "more than 2,000 times" since the start of Sunday. Russia's defense ministry said it had "repelled" assaults by Ukraine and accused Kyiv of launching hundreds of drones and shells. The BBC has not independently verified claims by the warring sides. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump said that "hopefully Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week", without giving further details.</p>

            <p>Senator Amy Klobuchar has warned that the US is getting closer to a constitutional crisis, urging the Supreme Court to hold Trump administration officials in contempt for ignoring a court order to facilitate the return of Kilmar Ábrego García from El Salvador. Klobuchar suggested appointing a special prosecutor, independent of the Department of Justice, to charge officials responsible for Ábrego García’s deportation or refusal to facilitate his return. Her comments followed the Supreme Court's decision to block the Trump administration from deporting more Venezuelans held in a Texas detention center, with Justice Alito dissenting and criticizing the court's decision.</p>

            <p>An Israeli military inquiry found that "professional failures" led to the killing of 15 emergency workers in Gaza last month, including an "operational misunderstanding" and a "breach of orders." The IDF stated its troops opened fire believing they were facing a threat from enemy forces, claiming that six of the casualties were Hamas members. The deputy commander of the unit involved has been dismissed for providing an incomplete report, and another commanding officer will receive a reprimand. The incident occurred in what the IDF called a "hostile and dangerous combat zone" with poor night visibility, causing the commander to misidentify the vehicles as ambulances.</p>
