Strong earnings reports from major financial institutions like Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs were offset by disclosures of bad loans from Zions and Western Alliance, which caused a temporary selloff in financial stocks. The article provides a comprehensive overview of the week's financial news, including quarterly results from BlackRock, Abbott Labs, and Salesforce's positive long-term forecast, reflecting a market grappling with conflicting economic indicators.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid a federal government shutdown, Washington D.C.'s official tourism bureau, Destination DC, has launched a campaign to assure visitors that the city remains open for business and leisure. The "DC is Open" initiative emphasizes that while federal institutions like the Smithsonian museums are closed, most of the capital's attractions, including private museums, restaurants, hotels, and memorials on the National Mall, are unaffected. The campaign aims to counteract the assumption that the entire city ceases to function during a shutdown, thereby protecting the local tourism industry, which drew 27.2 million visitors and $11.4 billion in spending last year.</p>

          <p>The German publishing house PONS Langenscheidt has announced that "Das crazy," a mix of German and English, is the Youth Word of the Year for 2025. The phrase, which deliberately breaks grammatical rules, is widely used by young Germans in internet culture to express surprise, speechlessness, or to keep a conversation going. Selected through an online vote with two million participants, the term's victory highlights the growing influence of English and a trend toward brevity in youth language. The announcement was made at the Frankfurt Book Fair, with the selection reflecting the contemporary linguistic habits of Germany's younger generation.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Starboard Value has acquired a stake in Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) and is engaging with its management, signaling potential strategic changes for the beverage company. The move comes after KDP's stock fell 25% following the announcement of a complex, debt-financed merger with JDE Peet's, a deal seen as highly favorable to majority stakeholder JAB Holdings. While Starboard cannot block the cash deal, its involvement is viewed as a constructive effort to restore investor confidence and guide the company through this transition, similar to its successful engagement with Ritchie Bros Auctioneer.

          <p>Psychologist Jean Twenge argues that parents should delay giving children smartphones and social media access for as long as possible, ideally until age 16, to promote better mental health and future success. She advises starting conversations about responsible technology use by late elementary school, focusing on privacy, the value of time, and the permanence of online content. Twenge also stresses the importance of setting firm rules, such as using basic non-internet phones first and implementing parental controls to moderate use. For parents who feel they gave devices too early, she recommends being honest about the decision and establishing new, healthier boundaries.</p>

This policy has caused confusion and concern among non-binary and transgender travelers who obtained 'X' markers after they became available in 2022 for more accurate identification.

          <p>In a detailed explanation of his investment philosophy, Warren Buffett categorizes investments into three types: currency-denominated assets, non-productive assets, and productive assets. He expresses skepticism about the first two, noting that currencies lose value over time and that non-productive assets like gold generate no intrinsic value, relying solely on the hope that someone else will pay more for them later. Buffett strongly advocates for the third category—productive assets like farms and businesses—which are valued based on what they can produce and deliver over time. He emphasizes that the success of these investments is determined by their output, not by daily market fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has commuted the prison sentence of former New York Republican Congressman George Santos, who will be released immediately. Santos had been serving a more than seven-year sentence after pleading guilty to wire fraud and identity theft charges. In a social media post, Trump stated that Santos had been "horribly mistreated" in prison, including being held in solitary confinement. Santos, who was expelled from Congress in 2023 following a damning ethics report, had publicly implored the president for a chance to prove he was more than his mistakes. A commutation reduces a sentence but does not erase the conviction.</p>

          <p>Despite escalating tariffs and calls for boycotts, the economic interdependence between the U.S. and China remains high, with experts suggesting a complete trade cessation would harm the U.S. more. China has effectively responded to U.S. tariffs by imposing its own, restricting exports of critical rare-earth minerals, and redirecting trade to other regions like Africa and Southeast Asia. While the U.S. remains a key market, its relative importance to China has declined. China has also reduced its holdings of U.S. Treasury securities, signaling a gradual financial disengagement, though deep ties in sectors like aerospace and semiconductors persist.

          <p>The U.S. has significantly increased its military presence in the Caribbean, conducting lethal strikes on boats allegedly linked to Venezuelan drug cartels and authorizing covert CIA operations, fueling speculation of a potential military intervention to oust President Nicolas Maduro. President Trump has framed the actions as a response to Venezuela weaponizing gangs, drugs, and mass migration against the U.S. While Maduro has condemned the moves as a prelude to a coup, the Venezuelan opposition has expressed hope for a decisive intervention. The ultimate goal of the U.S. campaign remains unclear, ranging from continued maritime strikes to a direct regime change operation.</p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces have confirmed the identity of the remains of another deceased hostage, 76-year-old Eliyahu Margalit, which were handed over by Hamas from the Gaza Strip. This transfer is part of a peace plan that required Hamas to return all remaining hostages, both living and deceased, but the process for returning the dead has been slow. U.S. officials have noted the significant challenges in locating and recovering all the remains due to the extensive destruction in Gaza.

The leadership team believes their deep, specialized knowledge of women's football provides a unique advantage, allowing them to operate with the agility of a "speedboat" rather than a "tanker" to build a progressive and sustainable ecosystem for the women's game.</p>

          <p>A new analysis of federal data by the Pew Research Center reveals that remarriage is a common outcome for divorced Americans, with two-thirds choosing to marry again. The study found that men are slightly more likely to remarry than women, and nearly half of those who remarry have a child with their new spouse. Economically, remarriage appears beneficial, with the median household wealth of remarried adults being significantly higher than that of divorced, single adults. While divorce rates have declined overall since the 1980s, the trend of remarriage continues to shape the structure of American families and households.</p>

          <p>As millions prepare for "No Kings" protests against President Trump, this article re-evaluates the anti-Trump "Resistance" movement, arguing that its earnest and sometimes "cringe" idealism is a powerful tool against political cynicism. Dismissed by some as performative, the movement's on-the-ground organizing during Trump's first term proved effective, contributing to the 2018 midterm victories. The author posits that in an era of authoritarianism, sincere belief in democratic principles, even if it appears uncool, is essential to counter the nihilism and fatalism that allow such regimes to thrive. The movement's effectiveness lies in combining this idealism with concrete, community-based political action.</p>

          <p>Native tribes in California's Owens Valley are intensifying their efforts to reclaim water rights from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP), which has been extracting groundwater from the region for decades. Tribal leaders argue that the extensive pumping has desiccated their ancestral homeland, drying up springs and meadows and harming the ecosystem. While the DWP maintains it manages the groundwater sustainably, the Bishop Paiute, Big Pine Paiute, and Lone Pine Paiute-Shoshone tribes are seeking the return of both land and water to make their reservations viable.

While acknowledging the city's challenges with homelessness and urban decay, many view the idea of military intervention as inappropriate and alarming. State and local officials, including State Sen. Scott Wiener and Dist. Atty. Brooke Jenkins, have called the suggestion a vindictive political ploy and legally questionable. The backlash follows similar deployments in other cities, which critics argue is part of a pattern of using federal power to target political opponents.</p>

          <p>A proposal to remove Los Angeles police officers from most traffic enforcement duties and replace them with unarmed civilian workers is stalled months behind schedule, causing frustration among reform advocates. The plan, first proposed in 2020, gained traction with a 2023 study outlining its feasibility, and the City Council requested follow-up reports from various departments with a three-month deadline. Over a year later, most of those studies remain incomplete, with officials citing bureaucratic hurdles and data collection difficulties. The delay highlights the significant challenges in implementing major police reform, even when there is initial political will.</p>
