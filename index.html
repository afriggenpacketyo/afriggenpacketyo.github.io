          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly becoming comfortable with the idea of launching strikes on Iran's nuclear facility, specifically the Fordo Fuel Enrichment Plant, according to a source familiar with the intelligence. The plan involves multiple strikes, and there is a movement to prepare for this possibility. Trump is also gauging the reaction of his MAGA base with Vice President JD Vance regarding potential strikes against Iran. Security at U.S. Army bases has been reviewed due to potential retaliation from Iran, and concerns have arisen about the effectiveness of Iran's air defenses. These developments indicate a heightened level of consideration for military action against Iran.</p>

          <p>Amidst ongoing tensions, an Iranian missile directly struck a major hospital in southern Israel, causing extensive damage and casualties, though the affected area had been evacuated beforehand, potentially saving lives. Simultaneously, Israel launched an attack on Iran's Arak heavy water reactor, prompting concerns about potential radiation hazards, which Iranian officials quickly dismissed. These events are unfolding as President Trump considers direct U.S. involvement in the conflict, with previous Israeli strikes targeting key Iranian nuclear facilities and military leaders. This escalation has resulted in hundreds of casualties on both sides, raising fears of a wider regional conflict. The situation remains volatile, with both sides trading strikes and the international community urging de-escalation. Optimism for a peaceful resolution remains low amid escalating violence.</p>

Hashimoto emphasized that the substantial $11 billion investment in U.S. Steel operations and the golden share issued to the U.S. government are justifiable conditions, even though analysts perceive them as potential risks to U.S. Steel's management. The agreement ensures that a U.S. president or designated official can approve key management decisions, including facility closures. Hashimoto highlighted the strategic importance of U.S. Steel, particularly with the likelihood of continued U.S. tariffs on steel products, which would benefit Nippon Steel's high-grade steel production used in electric vehicles (not investment advice).</p>

While he did not explicitly confirm whether China had offered to mediate, he highlighted that Israel's primary concern remains its military operation. This stance reflects Israel's strategic interest in maintaining diplomatic ties with key global players, even amidst disagreements over regional conflicts.

The raids are part of a broader effort to increase deportations, sparking outrage and condemnation from community members and advocates.

          <p>A recent study suggests that a passing star could potentially destabilize objects within our solar system, including Pluto and even Earth. Computer simulations indicate that these flybys are the most probable trigger for instability over the next four billion years. While the chance of a collision with Earth is relatively low at 0.2 percent, it is still higher than previously estimated. The gravitational interactions could disrupt the orbits of planets, leading to potential collisions or ejections from the solar system, although experts note that these events are not highly probable.</p>

The discovery includes a fragment with the Latin word "Fecit," suggesting clues about the artists who created the frescoes. This collection is considered one of the largest assemblages of Roman wall plaster and paintings ever found in Roman London, shedding light on the city's rich Roman history and the sophistication of its inhabitants.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has resumed processing student visas for foreign applicants, but now requires them to unlock their social media accounts for government review. Consular officers will monitor posts and messages for content deemed hostile to the U.S., its government, culture, or founding principles. Applicants who refuse to make their accounts public may face visa rejection, as it could be interpreted as an attempt to evade scrutiny. This policy change aims to enhance screening measures, but has raised concerns about potential censorship and chilling effects on free speech.

The deals, covering infrastructure, tourism, technology, and deep-sea mineral exploration, were struck in February without New Zealand's prior knowledge. New Zealand's Foreign Minister Winston Peters stated that funding relies on a high-trust bilateral relationship, which has been compromised by these agreements. The Cook Islands responded by expressing a commitment to addressing New Zealand's concerns and maintaining a close relationship.

          <p>An analysis of historical attempts at regime change suggests that overthrowing the theocratic regime in Iran would be a complex and potentially destabilizing endeavor. While the current regime is repressive and poses a threat to regional stability, history shows that simply destroying a regime does not guarantee a successful transition to a better system. The experiences in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya serve as cautionary tales, highlighting the difficulties in rebuilding a country after regime change. The analysis suggests that a weakened but still powerful Iran could lead to civic instability and prolonged conflict, making a replaced regime an unlikely outcome.</p>

For example, manufacturers are bundling steel and aluminum to qualify for lower duties or switching synthetic materials for cotton.
