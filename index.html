          <p>Scientists at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab are developing more sophisticated AI for humanoid robots, aiming to make them capable of performing complex tasks in human-centered environments. Led by Professor Daniela Rus, the team trains robots like "Ruby" by capturing motion and force data from humans performing the same tasks, teaching the machines nuanced actions. While acknowledging public apprehension, Rus emphasizes that these robots are tools designed with safety measures, intended to augment human abilities and serve as "cognitive superpowers."</p>

The article recounts their history, from Trump's deference at the 2018 Helsinki summit to his more recent expressions of irritation with the Russian leader. Despite Trump's optimism about brokering a deal, former diplomats express concern that Putin may exploit Trump's transactional approach to foreign policy, making the outcome of this "feel-out meeting" highly uncertain.</p>

Attorney General Pam Bondi confirmed his termination, stating such disrespect for law enforcement would not be tolerated in the administration.

          <p>Following the recent federal takeover of the city's police force, Washington, D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith has issued an executive order outlining limited cooperation with federal immigration agencies. The order permits sharing information and providing transport for federal agents but maintains a prohibition on officers inquiring about immigration status for civil enforcement purposes. This policy change comes amid a major crime crackdown initiated by President Trump, which has been praised by Republicans but criticized by many Democrats as an unnecessary overreach.</p>

          <p>Israel's far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has approved a long-frozen settlement plan known as E1, which critics argue would effectively divide the occupied West Bank and prevent the formation of a viable Palestinian state. The plan involves building over 3,400 new housing units for Israeli settlers. This development coincides with international backlash against Israel over aid restrictions in Gaza, where a worsening humanitarian crisis is unfolding, and renewed, though stalled, efforts to secure a ceasefire with Hamas.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to block a Mississippi law that requires social media users to verify their age, allowing it to go into effect temporarily. The law, which is broader than a recent Texas ruling on pornographic sites, applies to common platforms like Facebook and Instagram and also requires parental consent for minors. Tech industry group NetChoice challenged the law, arguing it unconstitutionally restricts free speech, and while Justice Kavanaugh noted it is likely unconstitutional, the court denied interim relief.</p>

This rotation has softened the high end of the market for pre-1970s vehicles, while demand and prices for newer supercars have been skyrocketing. (not investment advice)</p>

This authority does not extend to other cities like Chicago or Los Angeles, where state governors control the Guard, making it far more difficult for the president to intervene unilaterally without their consent.</p>

          <p>Pakistani authorities have detained numerous Afghan refugees in Islamabad as part of a wider crackdown, including individuals who had already been approved for relocation to Germany. These Afghans, such as former local staff for German institutions, were fleeing the Taliban and are now at risk of deportation. Advocacy groups and German opposition parties have criticized the situation, urging the German government to act immediately to secure their release and issue visas, highlighting a failure to protect those it had promised refuge.</p>

          <p>Amid a growing national battle over redistricting, House Democrats held a call with former Attorney General Eric Holder to discuss strategies to combat what they term GOP gerrymandering schemes. The focus is currently on Texas, where the Republican-led legislature is advancing a new congressional map that could significantly favor their party, prompting state Democrats to flee to deny a quorum. In response, Democratic states like California have threatened retaliatory redistricting, escalating a conflict with major implications for the upcoming midterm elections.</p>

          <p>Spain has activated the EU's disaster assistance mechanism for the first time as it battles devastating wildfires, prompting the bloc to send two firefighting planes. The country recorded its third wildfire-related death, and forecasters warn that a continuing heatwave with high temperatures and wind could cause the fires to spread further. Thousands have been evacuated across the country, which accounts for a quarter of the 1.6 million acres burned across the EU this year, highlighting the growing threat of climate-change-exacerbated weather events.</p>

          <p>A jury has concluded that the death of 14-year-old Ruth Szymankiewicz at a mental health hospital was an unlawful killing. Ruth, who was supposed to be under constant observation, was left alone for 15 minutes by an agency staff member with fake credentials, during which time she self-harmed and was later found unconscious. The inquest found that insufficient staff training, an unsuitable care environment, and other systemic failures at the now-closed Huntercombe Hospital contributed to her death, which her parents described as a betrayal by the system.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece praises a new report from the Department of Energy's Climate Working Group for charting a middle course on climate change. The author argues that the report, which affirms human-driven warming but questions catastrophic predictions and the intensity of recent weather events, injects needed nuance into a polarized debate. By challenging the "settled science" narrative without dismissing the problem, the report is presented as a model for fostering open, evidence-based discussion that can lead to more rational policy decisions rather than fear-driven responses.</p>

          <p>This article compares two primary strategies for managing overwhelming debt: debt forgiveness and debt management. Debt forgiveness involves negotiating with creditors to settle for less than the full amount owed, which can significantly reduce the principal but harms credit scores and may create a tax liability. Debt management, facilitated by credit counseling agencies, focuses on creating an affordable repayment plan with lower interest rates, preserving credit but requiring full repayment of the original debt. The best choice depends on an individual's specific financial hardship and long-term goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The plant-based meat industry's two biggest competitors, Beyond and Impossible Foods, are taking different paths to win back consumers. Beyond is reformulating its products with simpler, "cleaner" ingredients and moving away from directly mimicking meat, even dropping "meat" from its name. In contrast, Impossible Foods is doubling down on a "meatier" identity, launching more indulgent products and sticking with its heme ingredient to closely replicate the taste of animal meat. These opposing bets will shape the future of an industry vital to environmental and animal welfare goals.</p>

The report complicates the Federal Reserve's upcoming decision on interest rates, as the unexpected cost pressures in the supply chain could fuel consumer inflation and argue against a potential rate cut.

          <p>Eli Lilly, the manufacturer of the popular weight-loss drug Mounjaro, is increasing the UK list price by as much as 170% for those paying privately. This means a month's supply of the highest dose could rise from £122 to £330, although the final consumer price may vary. The company stated the initial UK price was significantly below the European average to ensure quick availability, and the increase aligns it more fairly for global innovation costs. The change does not affect the discounted price paid by the NHS.</p>
