          <p>Intel reported better-than-expected Q3 revenue of $13.65 billion, signaling a recovery in demand for its core x86 PC processors, which caused its stock to jump 6% in extended trading. This marks the first earnings report since the U.S. government became a top shareholder through an $8.9 billion investment. The company projects Q4 revenue of $13.3 billion at the midpoint and is strategically integrating Nvidia's AI graphics processors to revive growth in its data center CPU business. Despite starting advanced chip production in Arizona, Intel's foundry division is still actively seeking a major external customer, indicating ongoing investment challenges.

          <p>President Trump announced the cancellation of a planned federal deployment to San Francisco after speaking with Mayor Daniel Lurie and receiving calls from tech leaders like Jensen Huang and Marc Benioff. Mayor Lurie stated that San Francisco is making "substantial progress" with crime rates down significantly, including a nearly 30% citywide reduction and historic lows in violent crime and homicides. The decision follows earlier controversy ignited by Benioff's suggestion for federal intervention, highlighting a unified local effort towards public safety and positive urban development. Governor Gavin Newsom and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi praised the mayor's leadership in resolving the situation.</p>

          <p>Mark Killick, a 56-year-old "cowboy builder" with a criminal record dating back to 1995, has been convicted for defrauding 37 victims of over £1.25 million. Killick exploited legal name changes and a lack of regulation in the building trade to perpetuate his scams, often presenting slick websites and fake positive reviews to mislead customers. The case has prompted fresh calls for tighter rules on convicted fraudsters and increased regulation in the building industry, as many victims were unable to identify red flags despite attempting background checks. This highlights systemic failures in consumer protection.</p>

          <p>Indian exporters are struggling with a challenging Diwali season due to a 50% U.S. tariff, significantly impacting labor-intensive sectors like textiles, gems, and jewelry. The U.S. accounts for over 20% of India's total exports, and the tariffs have jeopardized billions in revenue and millions of jobs. Textile exports saw a nearly 10% year-on-year decline in September, and the gems and jewelry industry expects a $9 billion hit, forcing businesses to cut production. Hopes for a trade deal to reduce tariffs to around 15-16% offer a potential lifeline, but the immediate outlook remains bleak. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Pew Research poll found that 85% of Americans believe political violence in the U.S. is on the rise, with a significant partisan divide in attributing blame. Republicans largely point to left-wing violence (77%), while Democrats predominantly fault right-wing violence (76%), often linking it to President Trump and the MAGA movement. Both sides, however, equally blame partisan polarization, unwillingness to understand opposing views, growing acceptance of violence, and social media.

          <p>'The Celebrity Traitors' reached new levels of drama with host Claudia Winkleman expressing frustration as the "faithfuls" continued to struggle, leading to a banishment decided by the "Chest of Chance." With only nine players left, including three traitors, the faithfuls are performing historically poorly, facing an uphill battle in the final episodes. The episode also saw the return of the life-size chessboard challenge, sabotage by a faithful to protect others, and comedian Alan Carr embracing his role as a brutal traitor, leading to another faithful's murder. The show's intensity keeps viewers engaged.</p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton has cautioned McLaren's Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris about Max Verstappen's aggressive "cut-throat" character as they head into the final five races of the Formula 1 season. Piastri leads the championship, but Verstappen, despite being 40 points behind, has shown strong recent form. Hamilton emphasized that being the "hunter" is easier than the "defender" and consistency is key to holding off Verstappen. The McLaren drivers, free to race each other without internal team rules, are focused on maximizing their performance, though Verstappen's rapid resurgence has been a surprising development in the championship.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Attorney for Maryland, Kelly Hayes, has reportedly informed the Department of Justice that there is insufficient evidence to indict Senator Adam Schiff on mortgage fraud charges. This development comes after President Trump publicly called for the criminal charging of Schiff, a prominent critic and prosecutor in Trump's first impeachment trial. Schiff's lawyer, Preet Bharara, asserted that career prosecutors have found the politically-motivated allegations baseless, urging the Justice Department to conclude the matter. However, the investigation is reportedly being pressed to continue by a senior Justice Department official, indicating ongoing political pressure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A five-week shutdown of Jaguar Land Rover's (JLR) factories due to a cyberattack led to a 27% slump in UK car production in September, the lowest monthly figure since 1952. The attack forced JLR to halt global manufacturing, impacting its three UK plants and contributing to an estimated £1.9 billion economic cost for the industry. While JLR production is phasing back, the incident highlights the immense pressure on the automotive sector and its vulnerability to cyber threats. The industry is now calling for government interventions, including maintaining tax breaks, to shore up competitiveness and support a resurgence in domestic car production.</p>

          <p>A cross-party Environmental Audit Committee of MPs has warned that planned airport expansions, including new runways at Heathrow and Gatwick, could jeopardize the UK government's net zero climate goals. The committee found that the government has not demonstrated how the economic growth from expansion would outweigh its negative climate impact. While technological solutions like sustainable aviation fuel exist, they are not yet commercially scalable or widely adopted. The report emphasizes that meeting climate targets requires a serious strategic approach to decarbonizing aviation, a challenge that remains largely unaddressed and poses significant environmental risks.</p>
