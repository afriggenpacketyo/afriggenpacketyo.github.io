          <p>Archaeologists have announced the discovery of the Koning Willem de Tweede, an 800-ton Dutch merchant ship that sank off the coast of Australia in 1857, resulting in the death of 16 crew members. The find, a collaboration between the Australian National Maritime Museum and the SilentWorld Foundation, was made after a four-year search. Components of the ship, including its windlass, were found, confirming the ship's identity based on its dimensions and the water depth. Future monitoring visits are planned to further assess the site and uncover more of this important piece of maritime history.</p>

          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested outside an immigration detention facility during a protest, leading to conflicting accounts between the Trump administration and Democratic lawmakers. Representatives Bonnie Watson Coleman, Rob Menendez, and LaMonica McIver, who were present, claim they were manhandled by agents attempting to arrest Baraka, who was later released. Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin suggested the lawmakers could face assault charges, but videos released appear inconclusive. Baraka has accused the government of fabrication and described his time in custody as humiliating, turning the arrest into a local political issue.</p>

          <p>In San Jose, California, a cold case from 1977 has been solved with the arrest of Willie Eugene Sims for the murder of Jeannette Ralston, who was found strangled in her car. The case went cold due to a lack of leads, but investigators never gave up. A thumbprint found on a cigarette carton at the crime scene matched Sims after the F.B.I. upgraded its fingerprint search algorithm. Sims, who was stationed at Fort Ord at the time of the murder, had a prior conviction for assault to commit murder and robbery, and DNA evidence further linked him to the crime.</p>

          <p>Fulham Football Club is aiming to create the "best stand in the world" with its new Riverside Stand, which includes a rooftop swimming pool and Michelin-star dining. The stand, part of an American sport-inspired hospitality experience, is designed to resemble a five-star hotel or cruise ship, offering views of the River Thames. Architect Phillip Johnson emphasized the focus on the river view rather than the pitch, creating a unique design reminiscent of rowing and boat houses. The stand will also operate as a private members' club on non-matchdays.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China have resumed high-stakes trade negotiations in Geneva, aiming to de-escalate tensions and reduce tariffs that have disrupted the global economy. The meetings, led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, come after significant tariff hikes by both countries. While expectations for a major breakthrough are low, the fact that talks are occurring has raised hopes for a potential easing of trade hostilities.

          <p>China's strategy in the trade war with the US involves imposing export controls on rare earth elements, which are critical for manufacturing military and commercial products. These restrictions, enacted in response to increased US tariffs, have stirred anxiety in the US defense industry, as rare earths are essential for technologies used in jet engines, radar, and avionics. China, the world's largest producer of rare earths, accounts for 90% of the global supply and dominates production capacity.

This directive effectively shelves the "social cost of carbon," a metric used to weigh the costs and benefits of climate policies.

          <p>President Donald Trump's crypto agenda is facing challenges due to concerns that his personal cryptocurrency ventures create a conflict of interest. Lawmakers rejected the GENIUS Act, a bill to establish federal rules for stablecoins, due to the president's meme coin, $TRUMP, and other crypto activities. Critics argue that individuals can enrich Trump by purchasing his cryptocurrencies, potentially influencing his decisions. The Senate Democrats have introduced the "End Crypto Corruption Act" to address these concerns, and some investors fear that Trump's personal pursuits impede crypto advancements.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell may struggle to avoid President Trump's "Too Late" label as the Fed navigates a complex economic landscape. Economists believe the Fed often acts too slowly, potentially leading to economic downturns. Powell faces conflicting pressures from Trump's tariffs, which threaten both growth and inflation, making a clear policy path difficult. While Trump pushes for rate cuts, the Fed remains cautious, citing a "solid" economy and a strong labor market. Given these challenges, Powell's current inaction may be the best course, despite the risk of being perceived as behind the curve.</p>
