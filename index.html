          <p>U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson stated that "the state of our democracy" is a primary concern that keeps her awake at night. Speaking at a legal association meeting, she emphasized the need for public engagement and attention to governmental affairs. As the court's most junior member, Jackson has become a prominent voice, frequently writing dissents to express her views on major cases, including those involving executive power and presidential immunity. Despite facing sharp criticism from her conservative colleagues, she affirmed her commitment to using her voice and mentioned having a "very thick skin."</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and permanent U.S. resident, has filed a $20 million claim against the Trump administration for false imprisonment and malicious prosecution. He was detained by immigration agents for over 100 days due to his involvement in pro-Palestinian campus protests, which the government argued was detrimental to U.S. foreign policy. His lawyers contend the detention was a targeted effort to suppress criticism of Israel's actions in Gaza and U.S. support. The Department of Homeland Security has called the claim "absurd," while Khalil seeks accountability for the harm caused by his detention, including missing the birth of his child.</p>

          <p>Patty Hartman, a public affairs specialist with 17 years at the Justice Department, has issued a stark warning that the agency's traditional independence from the White House is gone. Hartman was one of several employees connected to the January 6th prosecutions who were recently fired by the Trump administration, a move she characterizes as retribution. She described her sudden termination as indicative of a broader destabilization, stating that the country appears to be "driving straight into an abyss." Hartman, who maintains she is not political, is considering legal action and hopes the nation can recover from this erosion of democratic principles.</p>

          <p>Tesla has submitted an application to test and operate its autonomous Robotaxi service in Phoenix, Arizona, aiming to compete with Waymo, which has been active in the area since 2020. The move follows a pilot program in Austin, Texas, where Tesla's camera-based system has faced some operational issues and regulatory scrutiny. The company's expansion plans also include the San Francisco Bay Area, although it has not yet filed for the necessary permits in California. This effort is part of Elon Musk's push to establish Tesla as a leader in autonomous driving, despite trailing competitors like Waymo in public deployment.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing an unusually warm year, with 2025 having the warmest spring on record and June being the hottest ever for England. This article examines whether the current series of heatwaves is a normal summer phenomenon or a direct consequence of accelerating climate change. Scientists attribute the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme heat to human-induced global warming, noting that a 1°C global rise can translate to 3-4°C hotter heatwaves in the UK. While the summer of 1976 is often cited as a benchmark, recent heat events are more geographically widespread and consistent with long-term warming trends.</p>

          <p>A new study from UCLA researchers reveals that the duration of heat waves is increasing at a faster rate than the overall pace of global warming. This means that even small increments in global temperature will have a disproportionately large impact on the length and severity of extreme heat events. The research, published in Nature Geoscience, warns that this acceleration poses significant risks to public health, agriculture, and infrastructure, particularly in tropical regions. The scientists stress the urgent need for faster adaptation strategies and criticize cuts to climate research funding, which they say hinder the ability to prepare for these growing threats.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reversing long-standing policy by excluding undocumented children from Head Start, a federal program providing early childhood education and nutrition for low-income families. The change is part of a broader strategy to make life more difficult for undocumented immigrants, reclassifying Head Start and other programs as "federal public benefits" to restrict access. Critics, including the National Head Start Association, warn this will create fear and confusion among all families, not just those directly affected.

          <h2>ICE Official Testifies Agency Has No Plan for Where to Send Mistakenly Deported Man if Released</h2>

          <p>An ICE official testified in federal court that the agency has not determined where it would send Kilmar Abrego Garcia if he were released from detention. Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported to El Salvador earlier this year and was returned to the U.S. to face criminal charges. A judge had ordered his release before trial, but the government stated it would then seek to deport him to a "third country." The testimony revealed a lack of planning, with the official admitting he had never been involved in a successful third-country removal, creating further uncertainty in this legally complex and high-profile case.</p>

          <p>The premier of Manitoba, Wab Kinew, has accused a group of U.S. lawmakers of "trivializing" Canada's deadly wildfire season after they sent a letter complaining that smoke was hampering their constituents' summer activities. Kinew, whose province has declared a state of emergency and is battling over 100 active fires, called the congresspeople "ambulance chasers." He highlighted the seriousness of the situation, which has caused fatalities and forced thousands to evacuate, while praising the American firefighters who are on the ground assisting Canadian crews. The exchange underscores the cross-border impact and political tensions arising from increasingly severe, climate-linked wildfires.</p>

          <p>Rescue operations are ongoing in Central Texas as teams search for more than 170 people who remain missing a week after catastrophic flash floods. The death toll has climbed to at least 121, with the majority of fatalities occurring in Kerr County, where the Guadalupe River rose with unprecedented speed. A girls' summer camp was devastated, with at least 27 campers and counselors confirmed dead. President Trump has signed a federal disaster declaration, deploying FEMA to support the massive search and recovery effort, which has been hampered by subsequent storms and challenging terrain in the flood-prone region.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's announcement that it will not release more files on Jeffrey Epstein, and that no "client list" was found, has caused a schism among some of the president's most ardent supporters. After years of promises that he would expose a secret cabal, the reversal has led to feelings of betrayal, with figures like Marjorie Taylor Greene calling it a "shameful coverup." The narrative, which had functioned as a more palatable version of QAnon, is now mutating, with some followers accusing administration officials of being part of the conspiracy. This episode highlights the administration's struggle to manage the expectations of a base it actively courted with conspiracy theories.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to CDC data, emergency room visits for tick bites are at a five-year high, with a notable spike in the U.S. Northeast. Experts attribute the rise to record-high tick populations and a longer active season for the arachnids, both of which are linked to warming temperatures caused by climate change. Ticks can transmit numerous diseases, including Lyme disease, and public health officials are urging increased vigilance. Prevention is key, with experts recommending the use of insect repellent, wearing protective clothing, and performing thorough tick checks after spending time outdoors to mitigate the growing public health risk.</p>

          <p>Just before the deadly flash floods that devastated Kerr County, Texas, regional officials were scheduled to begin developing a new, centralized flood monitoring system. The Upper Guadalupe River Authority had contracted a company to create a dashboard to help emergency managers better track weather data and make decisions, with preliminary meetings set for mid-July. This revelation comes as the region grapples with a death toll of over 120 and questions about the adequacy of its warning systems. The new tool was intended as a decision-support resource, not a public alarm, highlighting a critical gap in a region long known as "flash flood alley."</p>

          <p>This article explores the potential erosion of Japan's long-held identity as a proponent of nuclear disarmament, a stance born from the tragedies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Amid a rapid nuclear buildup by China and North Korea, and the possibility of South Korea developing its own arsenal, the taboo against nuclear weapons in Japan is weakening. The piece suggests a dangerous proliferation cascade could begin in East Asia, potentially collapsing the global nonproliferation effort. It reflects on how historical memory, regional rivalries, and the current global security environment are forcing Japan to reconsider its foundational post-war principles.</p>
