          <p>President Trump's advisers are standing by the administration's tariff policies despite ongoing legal battles that challenge their legitimacy. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett expressed confidence that the courts would ultimately uphold the tariffs, emphasizing their importance to Trump's economic agenda. However, they also indicated that alternative measures would be considered if the tariffs were blocked, aiming to ensure fair trade practices for America. The U.S. Court of International Trade had previously ruled against the tariffs, but the administration swiftly appealed, leading to a temporary pause in the ruling, which is now headed to the Supreme Court.

West Indies posted 308, with Keacy Carty scoring 103, but sloppy fielding proved costly.
