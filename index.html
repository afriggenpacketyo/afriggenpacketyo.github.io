          <p>Cameron Hamilton, the acting head of FEMA, was removed from his position after contradicting the Trump administration's stance on the agency's importance. Hamilton had testified before Congress that FEMA was vital and should not be eliminated, a day after the Homeland Security Secretary suggested it should be. His removal highlights the administration's desire to dismantle FEMA despite concerns from state officials about disaster preparedness. The article notes that FEMA has faced increasing demands and diminishing resources, exacerbated by climate change and the rise in natural disasters.</p>

          <p>President Trump has named Fox News personality Jeanine Pirro as the interim U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., replacing Ed Martin. Pirro, a former judge and district attorney, has been a staunch defender of Trump and repeated false statements about the 2020 election. This appointment raises concerns about the politicization of the Justice Department, given Pirro's close ties to the president and her history of promoting election falsehoods. Her prior experience includes a failed run for New York Attorney General, and she was a co-host of "The Five" on Fox News before this appointment.</p>

          <p>President Trump has appointed Fox News host Jeanine Pirro as the interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, replacing Ed Martin.
