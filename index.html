          <p>Pony.ai, a Chinese robotaxi company, is collaborating with Uber to introduce driverless taxis in the Middle East later this year, marking a significant step in the autonomous driving industry. The initial deployment will feature Pony.ai's robotaxis on Uber's platform in a key regional market, with plans for international expansion. During the pilot phase, a safety operator will be present in the vehicles until fully autonomous commercial service begins. This partnership aims to establish a new benchmark for commercializing driverless services and accelerating the integration of autonomous vehicles into Uber's offerings.</p>

          <p>Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic's abrupt cancellation of a US visit and uncertainty surrounding a planned trip to Moscow have exposed a crisis in Serbia's foreign policy strategy. Officially attributed to illness, speculation suggests the US trip was a failed attempt to meet with Donald Trump, bypassing standard diplomatic protocols. The EU has strongly opposed Vucic's potential visit to Moscow for Victory Day celebrations, warning it could jeopardize Serbia's EU membership aspirations. Analysts suggest Vucic is trying to project an image of international recognition to strengthen his position at home amidst ongoing domestic protests.</p>

          <p>King Charles III unveiled his official coronation portrait, painted by Peter Kuhfeld, depicting him in his regalia from the crowning ceremony, alongside a portrait of Queen Camilla by Paul Benney. The coronation portraits follow a tradition of monarchs being depicted in their ceremonial attire. The unveiling comes after Charles's previous official portrait by Jonathan Yeo received mixed reactions, with some critics comparing it to blood or hell. Both Kuhfeld and Benney have long-standing professional relationships with the royal family.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz, despite winning the national election, has struggled with low public approval, impacting his attempt to form a new German government. His personal popularity has declined, with few Germans trusting him due to his approach to the far-right AfD and U-turns on key policy decisions. His coalition with the SPD is perceived as having limited voter support, and he faces challenges in appealing to women and eastern Germans. Some suggest his focus on immigration over economic issues has not helped him gain popularity.</p>

Despite the criticism, Streeting defended the move as necessary to invest in public services amidst inherited crises, while former cabinet minister Louise Haigh criticized the cuts as failing to understand voters' priorities.</p>

          <p>The Taiwan dollar experienced a pullback after a significant surge driven by speculation about pressure from Washington to strengthen the currency. The currency weakened over 3% against the U.S. dollar after a 9% rally in the previous days. The central bank Governor Yang Chin-long refuted claims that exchange rates were part of U.S. trade negotiations, but analysts remain skeptical. The pullback was attributed to returning dollar demand from importers, with some believing the central bank has not intervened aggressively.</p>

The plan includes expanding involuntary hospitalizations, requiring screening for mandatory outpatient treatment upon discharge from hospitals and jails, and increasing supportive housing units. Many of Cuomo's ideas align with those of Mayor Eric Adams and Governor Kathy Hochul, who have also sought to force more people into treatment. Critics argue that Cuomo oversaw a reduction in psychiatric beds as governor, worsening the mental health system.</p>
