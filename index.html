          <h2>US Ports Experience Significant Drop in Chinese Freight Traffic</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 12:14:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major U.S. ports, particularly Los Angeles and Long Beach, are experiencing a steep decline in container vessel traffic from China, signaling a pullback in trade between the two nations. The drop is attributed to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods and fears of a potential recession. Data indicates a significant week-over-week and year-over-year decrease in freight vessels leaving China for Southern California ports. This slowdown is impacting ground transport linked to ports, with a sharp reduction in available truck loads, indicating a potential tipping point for the West Coast freight industry.</p>

          <p>A tour company owner, Nerys Bethan Lloyd, has been sentenced after pleading guilty to manslaughter following the deaths of four paddleboarders in Pembrokeshire, Wales, in October 2021. The victims drowned in hazardous conditions on the River Cleddau during a tour operated by Lloyd's now-dissolved company, Salty Dog. The court heard that Lloyd lacked the necessary qualifications to run the tour, and risk assessments and safety briefings were not conducted. Family members of the deceased delivered emotional statements, holding Lloyd accountable for their loss and criticizing her lack of remorse, highlighting the devastating impact of the tragedy.</p>

          <p>Since President Masoud Pezeshkian assumed office in July 2024, Iran has significantly increased state executions, surpassing 1,051, a more than 20% rise compared to 2023. Despite Pezeshkian's alignment with moderates and reformists and his willingness to engage with the U.S. in nuclear negotiations, executions have surged, targeting those arrested for drug-related offenses, dissent, and involvement in the 2022 protests. Human rights organizations are calling on the international community to consider Iran's human rights record during nuclear negotiations, urging conditions based on the cessation of torture and executions.</p>

The addition of Starbucks shares comes after a stock drop of about 25% due to concerns about a weakening consumer and China exposure, but the Investing Club sees it as a self-help story with potential for improvement.

Following the lobbying, the CFIA paused its decision, acknowledging the low risk of the added vitamins when consumed in suggested serving sizes.

Even firing Powell might not guarantee the rate cuts Trump seeks, as the FOMC could still choose someone else to lead the rate-setting committee.

          <p>The R&A, the governing body of golf, is considering bringing The Open back to Donald Trump's Turnberry course in Scotland, but logistical and commercial challenges need to be addressed first. While the golf course is considered excellent, concerns about road, rail, and accommodation infrastructure must be resolved. The R&A had previously avoided staging championships at Turnberry due to concerns about focusing on the event rather than political issues, but the focus has shifted to logistical feasibility.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has reclaimed the $90,000 level for the first time since March, as investors turn to cryptocurrency amidst turbulence in the stock market. This surge coincides with President Trump's increased pressure on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and a recent sell-off in U.S. equities. Bitcoin's decoupling from risk assets is becoming apparent, with U.S. ETFs tracking spot bitcoin experiencing significant inflows. Some analysts suggest that the cryptocurrency's resilience is due to long-term holders and increased buying activity.</p>

Hamas has reportedly signaled its readiness to hand over governance of Gaza to a mutually agreed-upon Palestinian entity.

The ruling clarifies that individuals born male but identifying as women do not have the right to use women-only spaces if it is deemed disproportionate.
