          <p>Houthi-run media reports that a US air strike on a detention center in Houthi-controlled Yemen has killed at least 68 African migrants and injured 47 more. The strike targeted a detention center in Saada province, reportedly holding 115 migrants. This incident follows intensified US air campaigns against the Houthis, ordered by President Donald Trump, which have allegedly killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and civilians. Migrants continue to arrive in Yemen from the Horn of Africa, seeking work in Saudi Arabia, but face exploitation and dangerous conditions due to the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Canadians have voted in a snap federal election called by Prime Minister Mark Carney, leader of the Liberal Party, focusing on responses to US President Donald Trump's tariff threats and suggestions of Canada becoming the 51st state.

Key regions to watch include Ontario and Quebec, holding a majority of Parliament seats, and specific ridings where party leaders are running.

          <p>President Donald Trump is calling on Republicans to immediately eject "disruptors and troublemakers" from their town hall events, alleging that "Radical Left Democrats" are paying people to infiltrate these meetings. Trump insists that these individuals are not Republican dissidents but rather paid protesters aiming to create the impression of dissension within the party. This comes as some Republican lawmakers have faced intense criticism at their town halls over Trump's policies. House Speaker Mike Johnson has suggested alternative communication methods like phone and livestreamed events to avoid disruptions.</p>

          <p>The Jacksonville Jaguars made a historic move by trading up to select Travis Hunter, a rare two-way player, while the Atlanta Falcons' draft strategy, particularly their trade to acquire James Pearce Jr., is being questioned. The Cleveland Browns selected Dillon Gabriel in the third round, and Shedeur Sanders in the fifth, creating an overcooked media circus. The Chicago Bears focused on supporting Caleb Williams with new offensive weapons, and the Philadelphia Eagles, led by Howie Roseman, made strategic defensive additions. The 2025 quarterback class was considered weaker, with only two quarterbacks selected in the first round.</p>

          <p>Marriage registrations in China continue to decline, with a further 8% drop in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the previous year, alongside a 10% increase in divorce registrations.

The government has also streamlined marriage registration rules, allowing couples to register without returning to their place of household residency, in an effort to encourage more marriages.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) anticipates that increased infrastructure spending in Germany will contribute to Europe's economic growth in the coming years, but it won't be enough to counteract the negative impact of U.S. tariffs. The IMF has lowered its growth outlook for the euro area due to President Donald Trump's volatile tariff policy. While Germany's recent infrastructure spending bill, enabled by exemptions to debt rules, will provide some offset, the tariffs and trade tensions will continue to weigh on the economic outlook.</p>

          <p>A Syrian man, Majdi Nema, is on trial in France, accused of war crimes during the Syrian civil war. Nema, a former spokesperson for Jaysh al-Islam (JAI), is charged with complicity in the war crime of enlisting minors and participating in a group formed to prepare war crimes. JAI is accused of various atrocities during the conflict, and the trial marks the first examination of these alleged crimes. The case is possible because France's legal code allows it to judge international crimes under certain conditions, even if committed outside of France.</p>

          <p>Despite winning the Premier League, Liverpool faces a rebuild, particularly in defense, with questions surrounding the full-back positions and potential additions at center-back. Trent Alexander-Arnold is expected to join Real Madrid, while Andrew Robertson's age prompts speculation about a replacement. Potential signings include Bournemouth's Milos Kerkez and a new center-back to provide depth and leadership. The emergence of Conor Bradley offers a potential replacement for Alexander-Arnold, but the team's financial resources will need to be carefully allocated across defensive and forward positions.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that the Han conquest of the Nanyue kingdom in southern China in 112 BC may have contributed to the decline of the Chinese swamp cypress. Researchers analyzed geological evidence, pollen analysis, and historical records to link the Han dynasty's riverine warfare tactics to changes in the Pearl River Delta's ecosystem. Sediment samples from ancient battlegrounds showed a decline in swamp cypress pollen around 100 BC, coinciding with the Han's assault on Nanyue's capital, Panyu, which was set ablaze.</p>
