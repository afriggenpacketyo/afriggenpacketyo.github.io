          <p>St Helens achieved a stunning 16-14 comeback victory against Leeds Rhinos in a Super League play-off eliminator, with Shane Wright scoring the decisive try on the final play of the game at a stunned Headingley. The dramatic finish involved a mesmerising 16-pass move that criss-crossed the pitch, keeping St Helens' hopes alive and securing their place in the semi-finals against Hull KR. The physically demanding match saw Saints forward Matty Lees leave midway through after his wife went into labor, adding an emotional layer to the intense contest. This sensational win marked one of the season's most frantic and decisive moments in rugby league.</p>

Oregon Governor Tina Kotek and Portland Mayor Keith Wilson vehemently condemned the plan, asserting there is no national security threat or insurrection, and urged the president to keep military troops out of their peaceful city, emphasizing local opposition to federal intervention.</p>

          <p>This article examines China's remarkable technological advancement over the past five decades, coinciding with 50 years of formal diplomatic relations with the European Union and the 25th anniversary of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China. Initial assessments from a European delegation in the 1970s concluded China was at least 20 years behind in science, technology, and industry. However, China's subsequent reform and opening-up policies ushered in decades of rapid growth, fundamentally altering the global tech landscape. The article prompts a critical re-evaluation of whether China has now surpassed Europe in the race for a high-tech future, highlighting a significant shift in global power dynamics.</p>

Hardy, who was the youngest Red Tail fighter pilot to fly his first combat sortie over Europe in World War II, further distinguished himself by serving in both the Korean and Vietnam Wars. His extraordinary legacy is celebrated for his unwavering courage, remarkable resilience against racism and prejudice, and significant contributions to the U.S. military. Hardy also helped develop the Department of Defense's first global military telephone system before retiring in 1971, leaving only 13 Documented Original Tuskegee Airmen alive today.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump posted an AI-generated image on Truth Social depicting himself firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, amidst his ongoing criticism of Powell's cautious approach to cutting interest rates. Trump has frequently nicknamed Powell "Too Late Powell," despite the central bank having lowered rates earlier this month for the first time this year. This move highlights Trump's unconventional and assertive stance towards the Fed, though a recent Supreme Court decision indicated that presidents do not have the authority to remove Fed officials at will, raising concerns about the central bank's independence.

          <p>Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar utilized his speech at the UN General Assembly in New York to issue a stern warning against "tariff volatility," "technology controls," and "supply-chain coercion" imposed by developed nations. He urged the Global South to collectively push back against protectionism and foster greater understanding and respect in international relations. Jaishankar also advocated for "de-risking" supply chains in critical minerals, a move widely interpreted as a veiled critique aimed at China. His remarks underscore India's growing assertiveness on the global stage, championing a more equitable and less economically pressured international trade environment.</p>

          <p>The southeastern United States is actively bracing for significant impacts from Tropical Depression 9, which is expected to intensify into a tropical storm and make landfall early next week. South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster declared a state of emergency, warning residents of substantial wind, heavy rainfall, and widespread flooding across the entire state. This preparedness comes just one year after Hurricane Helene devastated parts of the region, prompting urgent calls for residents to closely monitor forecasts, assemble emergency kits, and prepare for potential flash, urban, and river flooding as the storm approaches.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed his administration to declassify all federal records pertaining to Amelia Earhart's 1937 disappearance, a mystery that has captivated millions for nearly 90 years. While the prevailing theory suggests Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan ran out of fuel and crashed near Howland Island, other theories persist, including one about her capture by the Japanese on Saipan. This order follows a request from a U.S. House delegate and aims to shed light on the aviation enigma, though experts caution that newly released documents may not necessarily alter the most widely accepted conclusions about her fate.</p>

          <p>The FBI has reportedly terminated 15 to 20 agents who were photographed kneeling at a 2020 racial justice protest following George Floyd's death, with their termination letters citing an alleged "lack of judgment." The FBI Agents Association strongly condemned these dismissals, asserting that the agents' rights had been violated and warning that such actions weaken the Bureau's ability to recruit and retain skilled personnel. These reported firings are perceived as part of the Trump administration's broader effort to purge what it views as "left-wing" and "woke" policies and officials from federal government agencies, sparking controversy and debate.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's unprecedented willingness to openly discuss actions that previous presidents would have meticulously concealed, suggesting it fundamentally alters how the U.S. public perceives political scandal. Observers argue that his brazen approach, including public calls for legal action against political opponents and admissions of firing officials over investigations, perversely earns him credit for authenticity. This strategy, coupled with a rapid news cycle and a Republican party largely aligned with him, appears to desensitize the public and diminish the impact of once career-ending revelations, posing a challenge to traditional notions of accountability and governance.</p>

          <p>A new study published in Science has found that wild chimpanzees regularly consume significant amounts of alcohol from naturally fermented fruit, ingesting a daily dose equivalent to a human drinking over half a liter of beer. Researchers observed chimps in Uganda and the Ivory Coast consuming fruit with an average alcohol content of 0.3%, suggesting that regular alcohol consumption may have deeper evolutionary roots in our closest relatives than previously thought. This discovery challenges the notion that alcohol consumption is solely a human cultural phenomenon and opens new avenues for understanding the social and ecological factors influencing primate behavior and evolution.</p>
