          <p>Tributes have poured in following a fire at Bicester Motion in Oxfordshire that resulted in the deaths of two firefighters, Jennie Logan and Martyn Sadler, and a 57-year-old civilian, David Chester. The fire broke out on Thursday, rapidly spreading through a former aircraft hangar, and its cause remains unknown, prompting an unexplained death investigation by police. Firefighters formed a guard of honor at Bicester Fire Station, and floral tributes have been left at the scene, including messages from Thames Valley Police and members of the public. The community is mourning the loss, with Oxfordshire County Council opening a book of condolence at Garth House and encouraging floral tributes to be laid in Garth Park.</p>

          <p>Severe storms and tornadoes have ravaged the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions, resulting in at least 21 deaths and widespread destruction. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear reported at least 14 fatalities in his state, while Missouri officials confirmed seven deaths, five in St. Louis. The storms downed power lines, caused severe damage to buildings, and prompted emergency responses from the National Guard and local authorities. St. Louis Mayor Cara Spencer described the devastation as "truly, truly horrendous," with over 5,000 homes affected and a curfew imposed in the most damaged areas. More severe weather is expected in North Texas and the southern plains.</p>

Dundee United manager Jim Goodwin condemned the incident as "a disgrace," and MacKenzie received stitches for his injuries.

          <p>Chinese scientists have identified a new strain of bacteria, named niallia tiangongensis, aboard the Tiangong space station. This microbe, a variant of a known terrestrial bacteria, exhibits enhanced abilities to combat oxidative stress and reverse radiation-induced damage, which could have implications for space technology, agriculture, and medicine. The study, published in the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology, emphasizes the importance of understanding microbial characteristics during long-term space missions to protect astronaut health and spacecraft functionality.

          <p>US judges who have ruled against the Trump administration's policies are facing increased verbal abuse and threats, raising concerns about their safety and judicial independence. Legal experts and former judges warn that the attacks from the president and his allies are creating a hostile climate. Anonymous pizza deliveries to judges, some made in the name of a judge's deceased son, are seen as intimidation attempts. The Justice Department's actions, including the arrest of a Milwaukee judge, are also criticized as attempts to intimidate the judiciary, leading to worries among judges about their safety.</p>

          <p>Nissan Motor Co. is contemplating the closure of two plants in Kanagawa Prefecture, near Tokyo, as part of its broader restructuring efforts. This decision follows the company's announcement earlier this week that it would shut down seven vehicle plants and reduce its workforce by 20,000 globally, a response to a net loss of 670.90 billion yen ($4.6 billion) for fiscal year 2024. The move reflects the challenges facing Japan's third-largest automaker as it seeks to streamline operations and improve financial performance in a competitive global market.</p>

          <p>Colin Jost, the longest-running "Weekend Update" host on Saturday Night Live, has found comedic success by embracing his persona as a punching bag. Instead of trying to be the witty center of attention, Jost allows cast members like Sarah Sherman and Michael Che to mock his privileged background and perceived out-of-touch perspectives. By willingly taking the brunt of the jokes, Jost has become a pressure-release valve for cultural anxieties, making him more relatable and sympathetic to audiences. His willingness to be the target has ultimately solidified his legacy on the show.</p>

The trip and its outcomes have highlighted the administration's evolving strategies and transactional nature in international relations.
