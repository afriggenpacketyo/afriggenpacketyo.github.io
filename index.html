        <p>Stephen Moore, a former economic advisor to President Trump, criticized the president's recent tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China, warning of a potentially unstable economy. He argued that tariffs are detrimental and advocated for the swift passage of Trump's tax cut extension as a necessary economic stimulus.  While Trump and Commerce Secretary Lutnick downplayed recession fears, Moore's concerns highlight the economic uncertainty surrounding the new tariffs.</p>

        <p>The White House asserts that President Trump's tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China are successfully encouraging US manufacturing expansion.  Several major companies, including automakers and electronics firms, are reportedly planning to increase US production to avoid the tariffs.  This suggests that the tariffs are achieving their intended goal of boosting domestic manufacturing, although the long-term economic effects remain to be seen.</p>

        <p>The US pause in military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine has negatively impacted Ukraine's military operations in the Kursk region, leading to territorial losses.

        <h2>Home equity loan considerations before the March Fed meeting</h2>
        <div class="timestamp">2025-03-10 17:23:09</div>

      <div class="flip-card-back">
        <p>The article discusses the advisability of taking out a home equity loan before the March Federal Reserve meeting.  While interest rates are currently relatively low compared to other loan types, the possibility of future rate changes necessitates careful consideration.  The article advises potential borrowers to shop around for the best rates and terms before applying, but doesn't suggest rushing a decision due to the expected rate stability in March.</p>
