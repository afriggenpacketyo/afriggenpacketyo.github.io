          <p>A new blood test for Alzheimer's disease is being trialed across the UK, potentially transforming diagnosis for dementia patients. The test, which detects key protein biomarkers, aims to increase diagnostic accuracy from 70% to over 90%, offering a faster and more accessible alternative to current methods like PET scans. If successful, this £100 test could become a standard part of NHS procedure, improving patient access to support and new treatments for the early stages of the disease.</p>

This massive growth is fueled by significant deals, including one with OpenAI, indicating a seismic shift in the cloud computing landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

The race was heavily influenced by concerns over federal job cuts under the Trump administration, as the district has one of the highest concentrations of federal workers in the country.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles County employee, Bhavin Patel, faces felony hate crime charges for allegedly breaking into a government building and leaving death threats on the desk of an Asian co-worker. Prosecutors state that Patel illegally entered the Kenneth Hahn Hall of Administration on three separate occasions to place the threats, which were intended to instill fear in the victim. If convicted on all charges, which include making criminal threats and violation of civil rights, Patel could face up to 13 years in prison.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed a memorandum to increase enforcement of transparency and accuracy laws governing direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical ads, particularly on social media and digital platforms. The administration plans to send hundreds of cease-and-desist letters to companies and will scrutinize online pharmacies and paid influencers for failing to properly disclose risks and side effects. The action aims to rebuild public trust by using existing regulations to ensure patients receive balanced information, though it stops short of an outright ban.</p>

          <p>More than 2,000 actors and filmmakers, including Emma Stone and Ava DuVernay, have signed an open letter pledging to boycott Israeli film institutions they deem "implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people." The campaign, organized by Filmmakers for Palestine, states that the boycott targets institutional complicity with the Israeli government's actions, not Israeli individuals. The initiative is modeled after a similar 1980s boycott by filmmakers against apartheid South Africa and has been called "profoundly misguided" by an Israeli film group.</p>

Despite the loss, he expressed satisfaction with the learning opportunity it provided for the team's development, emphasizing the need for his players to adapt to the pressures of top-tier international football.</p>

          <p>The White House is facing persistent questions about President Trump's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt denying the authenticity of a birthday card and other documents linking the two. Trump's uncharacteristic refusal to comment on a "dead issue" and his efforts to sue media outlets for reporting on the connection have only intensified scrutiny. Critics argue that by avoiding transparency, Trump is fueling speculation that more damaging information may be contained in the unreleased Epstein files.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in Doha, Qatar, reportedly targeted a senior Hamas negotiator, an act that fundamentally challenges Qatar's status as a safe ground for U.S.-backed ceasefire negotiations. While Hamas claims its lead negotiator survived, the attack signals that Israel, potentially with U.S. awareness, no longer views the mediation process as viable and considers Hamas members legitimate targets anywhere. This escalation undermines Qatar's long-cultivated role as an indispensable intermediary in regional conflicts and suggests a grim outlook for remaining hostages.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has issued a temporary stay, allowing the Trump administration to continue withholding nearly $5 billion in foreign aid that Congress had previously appropriated. President Trump had announced he would not spend the funds, intended for UN operations and development projects, by employing a "pocket rescission" just before the end of the fiscal year. A lower court had ordered the administration to release the money, but Chief Justice John Roberts has paused that order.</p>

In an effort to control spending and adhere to borrowing rules, departments must now demonstrate they have maximized savings before requesting reserve funds for unforeseen pressures. The move signals a period of fiscal tightening as the Labour government prepares its first budget amid pressure to balance public finances while fostering economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>
