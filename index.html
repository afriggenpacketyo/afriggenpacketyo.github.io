          <p>Tesla's planned robotaxi launch in Austin, Texas, places it in a competitive market already populated by Waymo, Zoox, and Avride. Austin's appeal includes its tech talent, affordable housing, and favorable regulations, particularly a 2017 Texas law that limits municipal control over autonomous vehicles. While Tesla uses camera-based systems, Waymo relies on sophisticated sensors, and each company is working to improve safety and reduce costs. The industry faces regulatory uncertainty and the need to build public trust, especially after incidents involving autonomous vehicles from other companies. Optimism remains that autonomous vehicles can improve road safety, but companies must prioritize safety to avoid regulatory backlash.</p>

          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka is suing Alina Habba, interim U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey, for malicious prosecution following his arrest outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility. Baraka alleges Habba and Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin politicized his arrest by promoting a false narrative, accusing him of attempting to "storm" the facility, despite being invited onto the property. The lawsuit claims Baraka was kept in custody for an extended period before his court appearance, an unusual treatment for a petty trespassing offense. A federal judge admonished prosecutors for the rushed charges, which were later dropped, suggesting the case was politically motivated.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many Americans use personal loans to cover various expenses, but repayment can become challenging due to high interest rates or job loss. True "forgiveness" of personal loan debt is rare, as these loans are unsecured, but debt settlement can reduce the balance owed. To qualify, borrowers typically need to be behind on payments and demonstrate financial hardship, offering a lump-sum payment of 50% to 70% of the balance. Alternatives include debt management plans, debt consolidation loans, and communication with lenders to explore possible solutions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is publicly criticizing Republican senators, particularly Rand Paul, who are threatening to impede the passage of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." Paul opposes the bill due to its debt ceiling increase, arguing it would "explode deficits," while Trump insists on maintaining current entitlement programs. Trump is actively engaging with senators to secure support for the legislation, which extends his 2017 tax cuts and increases spending for military and border security. The bill's future in the Senate remains uncertain as some Republicans seek larger spending cuts, while others oppose any reductions to Medicaid.</p>

          <p>A debate has emerged within the Democratic Party regarding whether to prioritize populist policies focused on combating corporate power or abundance-based reforms aimed at reducing red tape and increasing the supply of housing and infrastructure. A recent poll suggests voters prefer a populist message, but the article argues that Democrats do not need to choose between these approaches. It contends that abundance policies, by increasing economic growth and the availability of essential goods, can complement progressive goals of wealth redistribution and improved living standards. The article advocates for evaluating abundance liberalism based on its substantive merits rather than its rhetorical appeal.</p>

          <p>The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has reduced its forecast for UK economic growth, citing US tariff barriers and high interest payments on government debt. The OECD now expects the UK economy to grow by 1.3% this year, down from its previous forecast of 1.4%. The think tank also highlighted the UK's limited buffer in public finances, urging Chancellor Rachel Reeves to increase tax revenue and cut spending. The report suggests that the state of public finances poses a significant risk to the UK's economic outlook.</p>

          <p>Closing arguments are underway in Harvey Weinstein's second sex crimes trial in New York, a case that could serve as a litmus test for the #MeToo movement. After his 2020 conviction was overturned, this new trial features a different judge, jurors, and fewer accusers due to a court ruling limiting testimony. The trial coincides with a changed social climate, where some men accused of misconduct have returned to public life, while others in the entertainment industry continue to face accountability. The accusations at the heart of the case involve three women who allege Weinstein sexually assaulted them.</p>

          <p>An inmate has confessed to writing threatening letters to President Trump in an attempt to frame Ramon Morales-Reyes, a migrant who was subsequently accused by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The inmate, Demetric Deshawn Scott, aimed to have Morales-Reyes deported to prevent him from testifying in an upcoming trial. Scott admitted to investigators that he wrote the letters and included Trump's name to ensure the Secret Service would become involved.
