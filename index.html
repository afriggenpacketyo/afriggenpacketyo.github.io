His work often addressed human rights violations, exemplified by "Verletzungsworte" (Words That Hurt), which translated words describing abuse into local languages.

          <p>An article discusses the historical context of the Trump administration's attacks on universities like Harvard and Columbia, tracing the roots back to the 1970s. A letter from former Republican congressman John LeBoutillier highlights the conservative critique of universities as left-leaning institutions. The article argues that Project 2025's Mandate for Leadership provides a blueprint for the Trump administration's actions, which include targeting diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, and redirecting funding to trade schools. The author suggests that these actions are part of a broader effort to undermine universities for political reasons and counter the trend of college-educated voters favoring the Democratic party.</p>

India has reduced tariffs on some goods, but the U.S. seeks to reduce its trade deficit with India. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's ambassador to China emphasized the need for China and Japan to improve public opinion towards each other, amidst concerns about tariffs imposed by U.S. President Trump. He noted that negative perceptions persist in both societies and highlighted that travel between the two countries has not fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Relations between Beijing and Tokyo have been strained by historical issues, territorial disputes, and China's import ban on Japanese seafood. Political friction has increased as Tokyo has aligned more closely with Washington's efforts to contain China.</p>
