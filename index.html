          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass reports that recent immigration raids by federal agents have instilled deep fear throughout the city's large immigrant communities. She criticizes the tactics used, such as agents wearing masks and driving unmarked cars, which she claims resemble kidnappings and intimidate residents, including legal citizens. While acknowledging the administration's help during past wildfires, Bass asserts that the current immigration enforcement is purely punitive, disrupts the city's workforce and culture, and that the accompanying military presence is an unnecessary misuse of taxpayer funds.</p>

          <p>Representative Tim Burchett, a Tennessee Republican, has reiterated his call for the Department of Justice to release evidence related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. He emphasized the need for transparency while also cautioning that any release must protect the identities of victims and innocent individuals mentioned in the files. Burchett expressed frustration with the slow pace of disclosure in Washington but viewed President Trump's directive to Attorney General Pam Bondi to begin unsealing grand jury evidence as a positive first step.</p>

          <p>A deadly fire broke out on the KM Barcelona 5 passenger ferry in Indonesia, resulting in the deaths of at least five people, including a pregnant woman. Over 280 individuals were successfully rescued, many of whom had to jump into the sea to escape the flames engulfing the vessel. The incident, which occurred in the waters near Talise island, highlights ongoing concerns about maritime safety standards in the Indonesian archipelago, a region where ferry accidents are tragically common due to various factors including poor weather and regulation.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has publicly demanded that the Washington Commanders and Cleveland Guardians sports franchises revert to their previous names, which were changed due to being considered racially insensitive to Native Americans. In a social media post, he claimed that a large number of Native Americans want the names back to honor their heritage and prestige. The former president's call comes years after both teams, facing prolonged criticism and a national conversation on race, adopted their new monikers to move away from controversial branding.</p>

          <h2>Former Obama Speechwriter Advocates for 'Neutral Ground' to Bridge Political Divides</h2>

          <p>In a commentary piece, former Barack Obama speechwriter David Litt suggests that finding "neutral ground" is more crucial than searching for "common ground" in a divided society. Drawing from his experience learning to surf with his politically different brother-in-law, Litt argues that shared activities can foster friendships and meaningful discussions, even when fundamental disagreements persist. He posits that these shared, non-political spaces allow people to connect as individuals, which is a vital step toward overcoming the animosity that permeates modern political discourse.</p>

          <p>A cast member of the opera "Il trovatore" unfurled a large Palestinian flag on stage during the final curtain call at London's Royal Opera House. Video of the incident shows an official attempting to take the flag from the performer, who resisted and continued the silent protest. The Royal Ballet and Opera condemned the unauthorized action, stating it was inappropriate and contrary to their commitment to political impartiality. The protest, which occurred on the opera's closing night, drew a mixed reaction from the audience.</p>

          <p>A large-scale Ukrainian drone attack on Russia led to the temporary closure of Moscow's major airports, causing the cancellation or redirection of over 270 flights. The Russian defense ministry reported downing more than 230 drones across the country, with dozens intercepted over the capital region. The disruption highlights Ukraine's continued ability to strike deep within Russian territory. Meanwhile, Russian air strikes on Ukraine reportedly killed at least three people, as both sides continue their long-range attacks in the ongoing war.</p>

Citing extensive data, the physician argues that the U.S. childhood vaccine schedule is safe, rigorously tested, and has been historically successful in preventing millions of illnesses and deaths.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece argues that traditional U.S. labor market metrics, such as the unemployment rate and job creation numbers, are becoming obsolete in the modern economy. The author contends that with the rise of the gig economy, remote work, and "over-employed" individuals holding multiple jobs or side hustles, "jobs" are no longer a reliable measure of economic well-being. The article proposes a shift to measuring the percentage of the population earning above a certain income threshold, suggesting this would provide a more accurate picture of financial health.

Now, local residents and business owners are planning events, tours, and improvements to attract the expected influx of tourists and caravan travelers celebrating the centennial, aiming to revitalize their town while preserving its "frozen in time" rural character.</p>

          <p>Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is facing bipartisan criticism for his efforts to restore the Confederate-era names of several U.S. Army bases, an action that appears to flout a 2021 law. To circumvent the mandate, Hegseth claims the bases are being renamed after different historical soldiers who happen to share the same last names as the original Confederate namesakes. This move has been rebuked by members of Congress, including some Republicans, who accuse the secretary of "sticking his finger in the eye of Congress" and insulting the nation.</p>
