          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testified before House and Senate committees, defending the Trump administration's proposed budget and significant workforce reductions at HHS. Kennedy outlined his priorities, including tackling chronic diseases, mental health, and addiction, while also focusing on cost reduction and eliminating diversity, equity, and inclusion funding. He faced criticism from Democratic Rep. Rosa DeLauro, who argued that the cuts would harm the department's life-saving work. Kennedy also addressed concerns about his views on vaccines, stating his support for measles and polio vaccines while confirming the CDC will study the potential link between vaccines and autism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) indicates that a growing number of Americans cannot afford a basic standard of living. The report considers factors beyond daily necessities, including technology, education, and healthcare costs, to assess a "minimal quality of life." The findings reveal that the bottom 60% of U.S. households, earning an average of $38,000 per year, need $67,000 to afford essential items. LISEP Chairman Gene Ludwig warns that this disparity could lead to social unrest, as the American dream becomes increasingly unattainable for many. The cost of a basic level of economic security has doubled since 2001, while median earnings for lower-income earners have fallen.</p>

          <p>Mexico has significantly reduced its controversial tourism tax on cruise ship passengers following strong criticism from the cruise industry. The Non-Resident Duty, initially set at $42 per passenger, has been lowered to $5, with incremental increases planned for future years. The Florida-Caribbean Cruise Association (FCCA) praised the move, stating that it safeguards cruise tourism and benefits local communities. Industry experts anticipate that the revised tax will prevent passengers from skipping Mexico as a destination. The adjustment reflects a compromise aimed at balancing revenue generation with maintaining the attractiveness of Mexican ports for cruise lines.</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, were resentenced, bringing them closer to potential freedom. Judge Michael Jesic reduced their sentences from life without parole to 50 years to life, making them eligible for parole under California's youthful offender law. The brothers argued the killings were in self-defense, citing sexual abuse by their father, claims that have gained renewed attention. The judge cited their rehabilitation efforts in prison, but their fate now rests with state parole officials and California Governor Gavin Newsom. The brothers have a parole hearing scheduled for June 13.</p>

Advocates argue the bill protects children and family values, while critics argue it sanctions hate and repression.

CEO Lisa Su stated that the expanded program reflects the board's confidence in AMD's strategic direction, growth prospects, and ability to generate strong free cash flow. Share buybacks can boost a company's stock price by reducing the number of outstanding shares, increasing earnings per share, and signaling management's belief that the company's stock is undervalued.

          <p>Israel tried to assassinate Muhammad Sinwar, a key Hamas leader in Gaza, but the long-term strategic impact of his death is uncertain. Sinwar is considered a major obstacle to a cease-fire, but Hamas has weathered the assassinations of many leaders, remaining resilient. While his death could undermine the group, it may not alter Hamas's strategic outlook or soften Israel's approach to negotiations. The war's trajectory depends on both Hamas and Israel, with the latter needing to soften its position for a cease-fire. Hamas has also been able to replace slain members of its lower ranks. The group's ability to adapt and continue fighting underscores the complexities of the conflict.</p>
