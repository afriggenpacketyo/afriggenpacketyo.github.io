          <p>Nvidia has announced its expectation to resume selling its H20 AI chips to Chinese clients after receiving assurances from the U.S. government that the necessary sales licenses will be granted. The sales of these GPUs, which were specifically designed to comply with U.S. export controls, had been halted in April. This development occurs as part of a broader, preliminary trade agreement between Washington and Beijing aimed at easing tech export restrictions. Nvidia's CEO has been a vocal opponent of the controls, arguing they undermine American tech leadership and have significantly reduced the company's market share in China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Over 50 million people across the U.S. Northeast are currently under flood watches as slow-moving storms bring intense rainfall to the region. The National Weather Service has issued flash flood warnings for major metropolitan areas including New York City, Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, cautioning of potentially life-threatening conditions. Rainfall rates have reached up to four inches per hour in some areas, leading to widespread flooding reports and stranded vehicles.

          <p>One year after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, Senator Josh Hawley is urging the Department of Homeland Security to declassify all related documents. In a letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, Hawley emphasized the need for government transparency to preserve public trust surrounding the national crisis. The senator cited what he described as stonewalling from the Biden-era Secret Service and DHS, which he claims has obscured facts about the security failures that allowed the shooter to get a clear shot. Hawley's request includes a complete inventory of materials and a timeline for their public release.</p>

          <p>China's economy expanded by 5.2% in the second quarter, a figure that slightly surpassed economists' forecasts but represented a slowdown from the previous quarter. The growth occurred against a backdrop of ongoing trade tensions with the United States and persistent domestic challenges, including a property market downturn and weak consumer spending. While industrial output was strong, other indicators like retail sales and fixed asset investment showed signs of weakness. Economists remain cautious, highlighting underlying fragility and calling for additional government stimulus to ensure sustainable growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly ordered the destruction of nearly 500 metric tons of high-energy biscuits intended for children in Afghanistan and Pakistan. According to government employees, the food, purchased by USAID for approximately $800,000, is set to expire and will be incinerated at an additional cost of $130,000. This action follows a halt on foreign assistance programs, with requests to ship the aid reportedly going unanswered by new agency leadership. The move comes despite assurances from Secretary of State Marco Rubio that food aid would not be wasted and amid a global hunger crisis.</p>

          <p>A group of prominent UK landowners, including wealthy estates and charities, has initiated a High Court challenge against the government's recent leasehold and freehold reforms. They argue that the 2024 Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act, which aims to make it cheaper and easier for leaseholders to extend leases or buy freeholds, infringes on their property rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. The claimants contend the new law could cause them significant financial losses without adequate compensation.

          <p>Daniel Serafini, a former Major League Baseball pitcher, has been found guilty of first-degree murder for the 2021 killing of his father-in-law, Robert Spohr. Prosecutors argued the attack, which also included the attempted murder of Spohr's wife, was financially motivated, stemming from a dispute over a ranch renovation project. Security footage showed a hooded figure entering the home hours before the attack, where Serafini waited before shooting the victims. Serafini, who played for six MLB teams, faces a potential life sentence. A second defendant pleaded guilty to being an accessory in the crime.</p>

          <p>Bob Becker, an 80-year-old runner from Fort Lauderdale, has made history by becoming the oldest person to finish the Badwater 135, widely considered the world's most difficult foot race. The ultramarathon covers 135 miles through California's Death Valley, where temperatures can exceed 120°F, and involves significant elevation gain. Becker completed the race with three hours to spare, settling a score after he narrowly missed the 48-hour cutoff time in 2022. His determination and successful finish serve as an inspiration, demonstrating that age is not a prohibitive factor in pursuing extreme endurance challenges.</p>

Fire officials are deploying specialized aircraft, including Super Scoopers from Canada, to assist in the fight, but heavy smoke and thick tree canopies are complicating aerial firefighting efforts in the remote region.</p>

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles experienced its busiest June in its 117-year history, processing a record number of shipping containers. Port executives attribute the surge to a "tariff whipsaw effect," as importers raced to bring in goods from China before a potential increase in U.S. tariffs. This rush to beat deadlines for taxes on Chinese goods highlights the uncertainty and shifting timelines in international trade policy. While the monthly numbers show an 8% improvement over last year, officials anticipate that cargo volume will likely decrease in the coming months once new, higher tariffs are in place.

          <p>Shares of fintech companies, including Block and PayPal, rallied on Monday after experiencing sharp declines late last week. The initial drop was triggered by reports that JPMorgan Chase plans to charge data aggregators for access to customer financial information, sparking fears of increased operational costs for the fintech sector. However, market analysts have since downplayed the threat, with firms like Evercore ISI and Morgan Stanley suggesting the potential impact would be negligible for larger platforms. They argue the new fees would only slightly increase costs for one-time account verifications and not be a business-breaking expense. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent decision to arm Ukraine and threaten Russia with tariffs was driven less by a strategic shift and more by personal frustration with Vladimir Putin, according to White House insiders. This article suggests that by repeatedly ignoring Trump's calls for a ceasefire and escalating attacks, Putin made the U.S. president feel humiliated and appear weak. Trump, who initially believed he could broker a quick peace deal, grew increasingly angry as his diplomatic overtures were rebuffed. The policy change is therefore seen as a reaction to being personally slighted rather than a newfound commitment to Ukraine's defense.</p>
