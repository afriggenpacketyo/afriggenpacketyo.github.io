          <p>A knife attack at the central train station in Hamburg, Germany, resulted in at least 17 people being injured, with four in critical condition. Police believe a 39-year-old woman acted alone and have taken her into custody, suspecting mental distress as a possible motive. The attack occurred on a crowded platform in front of a waiting long-distance train, causing chaos as the attacker randomly stabbed travelers. This incident follows another recent knife attack in Germany, raising concerns about public safety and security measures at transportation hubs.</p>

          <p>The use of facial recognition technology by a private organization, Project N.O.L.A., has come under scrutiny during the manhunt for 10 inmates who escaped from a New Orleans jail. Authorities claim the technology aided in recapturing one fugitive, but concerns have been raised by civil rights organizations and politicians regarding privacy and potential biases. Critics argue that citizens are being scanned without their explicit consent or awareness, and that the technology may be racially biased and error-prone, especially with people of color, older people, and women. The New Orleans Police Department's partnership with Project N.O.L.A. has sparked a debate over the balance between public safety and individual rights in the age of advanced surveillance technology.</p>

          <p>The UK government has delayed the publication of its child poverty strategy, initially due in the spring, with a spokesperson stating the strategy will be published later this year to ensure fully-funded measures address the root causes of child poverty. The Child Poverty Taskforce, co-chaired by Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall and Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson, is considering various measures, including whether to scrap the two-child benefit cap. While some criticize the delay, others suggest it allows for a more substantial and effective strategy to protect children from hunger and hardship. The delay has sparked debate about the government's commitment to tackling child poverty and the potential impact of policy changes.</p>

The 76-year-old singer was advised by his doctor to refrain from performing while undergoing physical therapy. NPH occurs when excess cerebrospinal fluid builds up in the brain, disrupting brain-related functions, and is more likely to occur in older people. Fans who purchased tickets will receive automatic refunds, and Joel looks forward to returning to the stage when his health improves.</p>

The lawsuit alleges the administration's move was retaliatory and violated the First Amendment, the Due Process Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act. The Trump administration claimed Harvard failed to comply with requests for information on student visa holders and perpetuated an unsafe campus environment hostile to Jewish students. Harvard President Alan Garber called the order a critical step to protect the rights of international students and scholars.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is moving to significantly reduce the size and scope of the US National Security Council (NSC), with staff dealing with major geopolitical issues receiving termination notices. The restructuring aims to grant more authority to the state department, the defense department, and other agencies. The goal is to reduce the NSC's staff to a few dozen people, a considerable decrease from previous administrations. Those cut from the NSC will be moved to other government positions.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed four executive orders aimed at accelerating the construction of nuclear power plants, including small, advanced reactors. The orders direct the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to streamline rules and approve applications for new reactors within 18 months. The administration also set a goal of quadrupling the nation's nuclear power capacity by 2050. These actions enjoy bipartisan backing in Congress, with some Democrats supporting nuclear power due to its lack of planet-warming emissions and Republicans emphasizing energy security.</p>

China is seeking to establish a permanent regional presence, but faces competition from Russia and others. This scramble for Arctic resources and strategic positioning is increasing tensions in the region.</p>

The case was reopened when the nanny, after her relationship with Worrell ended, provided crucial information to authorities.

          <p>This guest essay reflects on the life and ideals of Sarah Milgrim, who was killed in a politically motivated attack outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington. The author, Yasmina Asrarguis, emphasizes that Milgrim was a quiet peace builder who sought dialogue and coexistence between Jews and Muslims. Asrarguis argues that Milgrim's legacy should not be co-opted or weaponized for political gain, but rather remembered as a symbol of hope and commitment to Middle East peace.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to dismiss criminal charges against a top MS-13 leader, Vladimir Antonio Arevalo-Chavez, in order to deport him to El Salvador. Critics suggest this move aims to prevent Arevalo-Chavez from testifying about Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele's past ties to the gang. Arevalo-Chavez is a member of the "Ranfla Nacional" and faces charges including racketeering, terrorism, and conspiring to commit narco-terrorism. The DOJ claims the dismissal is for "sensitive and important foreign policy considerations".</p>
