          <p>The US government has agreed to pay $5 million to the family of Ashli Babbitt, who was fatally shot by a Capitol Police officer during the January 6th riot. Babbitt, a US Air Force veteran, was attempting to enter the House of Representatives chamber when she was shot. Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger expressed his disappointment with the decision, emphasizing that the officer's actions were deemed justified in previous reviews. The settlement has sparked controversy, with some viewing it as a message that undermines law enforcement efforts to protect government officials and buildings during times of crisis.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration's request to lift a lower court's injunction, allowing them to end the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for approximately 350,000 Venezuelan migrants while legal challenges continue. The TPS program provides temporary immigration protections for migrants from countries experiencing unrest, natural disasters, or other dangerous conditions. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, indicating she would have denied the administration's request for emergency relief. This decision could potentially lead to the deportation of Venezuelans who rely on TPS for work permits and protection from deportation.</p>

          <p>Linda Stermer, a Michigan woman, has been sentenced to life in prison for the second time for the murder of her husband nearly two decades ago, after failing to convince a jury of her innocence in a retrial.

Her initial conviction in 2010 was overturned by a federal appeals court in 2020, granting her a new trial. Throughout the proceedings, Stermer has maintained her innocence, claiming her husband's death was an accident.</p>

          <p>A Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating has added complexity to Republican efforts to pass a major tax and spending cut package, as the ratings firm cited ongoing gridlock in Congress and the potential for increased federal deficits. Fiscally conservative Republicans are leveraging the downgrade to push for deeper cuts to federal programs, including Medicaid and food assistance. Speaker Mike Johnson aims to bring the bill to a vote by Friday, but faces challenges from both anti-deficit conservatives and moderate Republicans concerned about political fallout from social program cuts. The Republican plan is projected to add roughly $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that one in four pupils in England experience a decline in engagement when transitioning to secondary school, with enjoyment, trust, and safety perceptions sharply decreasing. Girls are more likely to report feeling unsafe or worried, while pupils eligible for free school meals experience lower levels of trust, enjoyment, and belonging. Lower engagement is linked to increased absenteeism, with highly engaged pupils being less likely to be persistently absent. Researchers suggest that disengagement is more pronounced in England compared to other countries, indicating unique challenges within the English education system.</p>

          <p>Faced with long-term threats like debt, decoupling, and demographic challenges, China is pursuing three key strategic directions reinforced by trade and technology restrictions from the United States. First, China is avoiding massive stimulus and property market support. Second, the government is prioritizing technological self-sufficiency and innovation. Third, China aims to strengthen trade and investment ties with other countries, particularly through the Belt and Road Initiative. These strategies aim to navigate economic pressures and secure long-term growth.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden's recent diagnosis of advanced prostate cancer has prompted discussions among oncology experts about the disease's progression and potential reasons for the delayed detection. Although some people were left wondering why the cancer was caught only after reaching a Gleason score of 9, oncology experts told ABC News that it's not uncommon for older prostate cancer patients to receive a diagnosis after the disease has advanced or spread. The delay has raised questions about whether he underwent regular PSA screenings and if the cancer was present during his presidency. Experts suggest that the cancer could have grown rapidly or that Biden may have chosen to forgo screening due to his age.</p>

Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer among men, and early detection is crucial. Symptoms include urinary problems and blood in urine or semen, though many cases are asymptomatic. Screening involves PSA tests and digital rectal exams, and treatment options vary based on the cancer's stage, ranging from active surveillance to surgery, radiation, hormone therapy, and chemotherapy. Survival rates are high for localized cancer, but decrease when the cancer spreads.</p>

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles, heavily reliant on trade with China, is preparing for potential impacts from new tariffs following a 90-day truce between the US and China. Despite a recent surge in container units, driven by importers rushing to get cargo in before tariffs take effect, uncertainty remains. The port's executive director highlighted the potential for a tariff-induced shipping panic, underscoring the volatility created by trade tensions between the two countries. The port's business relies heavily on trade with China, where nearly 45 percent of its business comes from.</p>

          <h2>Mortgage Rates Surge After Moody's Downgrades U.S. Debt Rating</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average interest rate for a 30-year mortgage climbed back above 7% following Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. The increase reflects market concerns about the government's growing debt levels and the impact on Treasury yields. Despite the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts last year, mortgage rates have remained elevated, exacerbating affordability challenges for aspiring homebuyers. High home prices and rising borrowing costs are limiting the number of affordable properties available, creating a challenging market for potential buyers. (not investment advice)</p>
