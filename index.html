          <p>England secured a 1-0 T20 series victory against New Zealand after the third match in Auckland was abandoned due to heavy rain, allowing only 3.4 overs. This marks Harry Brook's first overseas series win as England's white-ball captain, demonstrating an encouraging start with seven wins in eight completed T20s. Despite the weather limiting fine-tuning before the T20 World Cup, the series was largely overshadowed by the upcoming Ashes.

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly in discussions with quantum computing firms like IonQ and Rigetti Computing to acquire equity stakes in exchange for federal funding, extending a strategy seen in rare earths and semiconductors. This initiative reflects a broader ideological shift towards government intervention in industries deemed vital for U.S. national security and economic competition, particularly against China. The aim is to ensure the U.S. benefits from the success of companies receiving public funds in strategically critical technologies. This approach seeks to bolster domestic supply chains and maintain technological dominance in fields like AI and quantum computing.</p>

          <p>Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić denounced a shooting and arson incident outside the parliament in Belgrade as an "awful terrorist attack," which left one person injured. A 70-year-old man was apprehended after firing a gun at a tent camp, pitched by Vučić's supporters, and then setting it on fire. Vučić stated the perpetrator was politically motivated and sought a "suicide by cop" outcome. The suspect faces charges including attempted murder, with the incident occurring ahead of an anniversary rally for a deadly train station collapse that sparked anti-graft protests.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-23 05:16:41 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sweden's Volvo Cars experienced a remarkable 40% surge in its shares, marking its best trading day ever, after reporting stronger-than-expected third-quarter operating income of 6.4 billion Swedish kronor. This significant profit beat, up from 5.8 billion kronor a year prior, was largely driven by an ongoing 18 billion kronor cost-saving program and one-off items. CEO Håkan Samuelsson noted solid results in a tough market, with a return to slight sales growth in September and a ramp-up of Battery Electric Vehicle sales. Despite challenges like price competition and U.S. import tariffs, the company anticipates further positive effects from cost-cutting in the final quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thames Water has been issued a one-star environmental rating by the Environment Agency for 2024, the lowest possible score, as part of a damning assessment of England's water companies. This collective performance, with serious pollution rising by 60% from 2023, marks the worst combined score since assessments began in 2011. Only Severn Trent achieved a top rating, while others "required improvement." The EA attributes the decline to wet weather, historic underinvestment, and increased monitoring, highlighting the scale of change needed for improvement.</p>

          <p>New U.S. sanctions targeting Russian energy giants Rosneft and Lukoil are causing significant concern within China's oil industry, which relies on Russia for about 20% of its crude imports. Chinese refiners, both state and private, now face pressure to maintain supplies while avoiding crippling secondary penalties, such as being cut off from Western banking systems or markets. The dilemma involves losing access to deeply discounted Russian oil if they comply with sanctions, or risking severe repercussions if they continue dealings with the blacklisted entities. China's Foreign Ministry has expressed opposition to unilateral sanctions not authorized by the UN Security Council.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has imposed "tremendous" new sanctions on Russia's largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, aiming to pressure Moscow to end the war in Ukraine and target its "war machine." These measures, the first direct energy interventions by the Trump administration, blacklist firms accounting for nearly half of Russia's crude exports. The sanctions represent a significant shift after Trump's frustration with stalled peace talks and are intended to materially impact Russia's industrial capacity. While they may not immediately alter the military balance, analysts suggest they could push Russia to reconsider its position, though ripple effects on global oil prices and major customers like China and India are anticipated.</p>

          <p>"The Disappearance of Josef Mengele," a new film directed by Kirill Serebrennikov, delves into the post-war escape of the infamous Nazi physician who conducted sadistic experiments at Auschwitz. Based on Olivier Guez's book, the drama chronicles Mengele's evasion of justice in South America, aided by a network of collaborators. The film portrays Mengele as an aging, lonely figure unable to escape his past, still spouting fascist lies. It aims to explore the roots and consequences of ideological extremism, cautioning against dogma by depicting the frighteningly short path from an ordinary person to a criminal and sadist.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military has expanded its controversial anti-drug trafficking campaign to the Pacific, destroying two boats and killing five people in recent strikes. These incidents follow earlier Caribbean strikes that resulted in at least 32 deaths, drawing strong condemnation from Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who labeled them "murder" and a violation of international law. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth controversially equated alleged drug traffickers to 9/11 terrorists. The White House justifies the actions under dubious legal theories, claiming cartels are "designated terrorist organizations" and invoking presidential self-defense powers, despite lack of concrete evidence linking cartels to foreign governments.</p>

While Prime Minister Netanyahu has previously supported annexation, he has refrained from pursuing it due to the risk of alienating the U.S. and Arab allies.

          <p>President Trump's federalization and deployment of National Guard troops to Portland and Chicago are facing intense legal challenges, including an appeal to the Supreme Court, questioning the president's authority. These cases center on whether courts should defer to Trump's assessment of "lawless" cities, despite local leaders' objections. While a 9th Circuit panel overturned one restraining order in Portland, another remains, and the 7th Circuit upheld a block in Chicago. Experts anticipate these decisions will clarify the president's power to use military force domestically and could embolden the administration, potentially leading to more confusion in future litigation.</p>

          <p>A significant U.K. study, published in The Lancet, has compiled data from over 150 clinical trials to compare the physical side effects of 30 different antidepressants. The analysis, representing more than 58,000 patients, details how each medication can affect weight, blood pressure, heart rate, and cholesterol, among other health aspects. While commonly prescribed SSRIs generally show fewer physical side effects, older drugs like nortriptyline can have more significant impacts. The research aims to help clinicians and patients make individualized decisions, although it has limitations, such as focusing on short-term data and not evaluating sexual or gastrointestinal issues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. housing market faces a persistent scarcity of affordable "starter homes," locking many first-time buyers out, despite cooling bidding wars and potential mortgage rate dips. This shortage is attributed to rising construction material costs, low profit margins for builders on smaller homes, and existing homeowners being reluctant to sell due to low mortgage rates. Local zoning regulations, like those in Austin, also contribute by limiting new construction. Solutions include deregulation, community development financial institutions offering assistance, and buyers considering homes further from city centers to maximize their chances.</p>

CEO Luca de Meo acknowledged the performance remains "far below that of the market" but reinforced commitment to a turnaround, evidenced by recent decisions like selling its beauty unit to L'Oreal for $4.7 billion.

Chinese policymakers are unlikely to provide significant additional support to the sector, instead prioritizing technological development due to the current geopolitical landscape. The government's focus on high-tech manufacturing, which grew 9.6%, contrasts with the property market's decline. This divergence in priorities means that while some easing measures have been introduced, they are insufficient to reverse the trend, and the slump continues to weigh heavily on China's overall economic growth.
