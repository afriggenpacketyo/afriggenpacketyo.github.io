          <p>Singapore's inflation rate remained steady at a four-year low of 0.9% in March, coinciding with preparations for a general election on May 3. Core inflation, excluding private transport and accommodation costs, slightly decreased to 0.5%. Prime Minister Lawrence Wong acknowledged cost-of-living concerns, attributing them to global conflicts and supply chain disruptions. Singapore previously eased its monetary policy for the second time in April, anticipating potential zero growth for the year after a lower-than-expected GDP expansion in the first quarter. The Ministry of Trade and Industry has downgraded its GDP forecast for 2025 to 0%-2% due to declines in manufacturing and some service sectors.</p>

Companies like Klarna and Affirm have reported significant growth in travel bookings processed through BNPL plans. While convenient, especially for younger travelers, financial experts warn that BNPL loans can lead to debt accumulation and credit score damage if not managed responsibly. Some companies, like Affirm, don't charge late fees and vet customers, while others don't; some financial advisors recommend using BNPL only when travelers already have the funds available, viewing it as a way to secure deals or splurge on upgrades.</p>

          <p>Country music star Jelly Roll, whose real name is Jason DeFord, is seeking a pardon to clear his criminal record from his teenage years, which included time spent in detention. He credits songwriting during his incarceration as a life-changing experience and now wishes to travel internationally for performances, which his criminal past complicates. The Tennessee Board of Parole has recommended a pardon, with the final decision resting with Governor Bill Lee. Jelly Roll has been open about his past, often visiting jails and advocating against the fentanyl crisis.</p>

          <p>Six major U.S. automotive policy groups are collectively lobbying the Trump administration to prevent the implementation of 25% tariffs on auto parts, scheduled to take effect by May 3. Representing dealers, suppliers, and major automakers, the groups warn that the tariffs could endanger U.S. automotive production and harm already struggling suppliers. The organizations say they represent the country's largest manufacturing sector, supporting 10 million jobs and contributing $1.2 trillion to the economy annually. They are hoping Trump will reconsider the tariffs, similar to recent relief granted to consumer electronics and semiconductors.</p>

Tommy Edman and Freddie Freeman contributed offensively for the Dodgers, but pitching struggles and missed opportunities ultimately led to their defeat.

These adjustments reflect concerns that tariffs announced by the U.S. and its trading partners pose a "major negative shock to growth."
