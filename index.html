          <p>Former President Donald Trump has proposed a 100% tariff on all films produced outside the United States, citing concerns over the decline of the American film industry and incentives offered by other countries to attract filmmakers. He argues that this is a threat to national security, labeling foreign films as propaganda. The Motion Picture Association has not yet responded, but data shows that Hollywood films generated $22.6 billion in exports in 2023. This move follows Trump's history of imposing tariffs on various goods to promote domestic production.</p>

          <p>Mark Zaid, a lawyer who represented a whistleblower in Donald Trump's first impeachment case, is suing the Trump administration for allegedly revoking his security clearance in retaliation. Zaid argues that the decision was due to his representation of Brian Murphy, who alleged Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden. The lawsuit claims the revocation violates the Administrative Procedures Act, the First Amendment, and the Fifth Amendment. Zaid seeks reinstatement of his clearance and argues that security clearances should not be used as political weapons. The lawsuit references Trump's past remarks calling Zaid a "sleazeball."</p>

The de minimis rule, which exempted imports under $800 from tariffs, has ended for shipments from China, leading to higher prices. However, both companies are adopting localization strategies, such as onboarding American sellers and shipping goods in bulk to U.S. warehouses.

          <p>A New York Times article describes a catastrophic humanitarian emergency in Gaza, exacerbated by an Israeli blockade that has cut off humanitarian aid and commercial supplies. Two million Palestinians are surviving on minimal meals, and signs of starvation are increasing. The author, Sean Carroll, argues that Israel is exploiting aid as a tool of war, violating international law and potentially aiming to expel Palestinians. He calls for immediate resumption of aid, secure humanitarian corridors, and a political agreement guaranteeing Palestinian security and self-determination.</p>

          <p>A dental practice in Sheffield, England, is struggling to provide NHS services to 4,000 new patients due to a loss of funding. Darnell Dental Clinic, despite investing £466,000 in expansion, faces a £544,000 funding cut, leading to potential patient list reductions. Staff have reported verbal abuse from patients unable to secure appointments. The situation highlights broader issues in NHS dentistry, with a recent report finding that only half of the English population can access an NHS dentist. Local MP Clive Betts has condemned the funding cut.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is asking a court to dismiss a lawsuit from GOP-led states aiming to restrict access to the abortion drug mifepristone. Justice Department attorneys argue the states lack legal standing to sue.

The administration maintains that the states are challenging actions taken beyond the statute of limitations. Abortion is banned at all stages of pregnancy in Idaho, while Missouri and Kansas have varying restrictions.</p>

The ongoing search across Europe aims to provide a dignified burial to every person who died in the war, regardless of their role.
