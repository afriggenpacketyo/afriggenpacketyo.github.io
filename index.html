Despite previous restrictions on visitation due to concerns about Decker's mental health, there were no apparent warning signs before the incident, as he was considered an active and loving father. The ex-wife and her attorney are now advocating for improved mental health resources for veterans and reforms to the Amber Alert system.</p>

          <p>An investigation reveals that young offenders in many states are denied credit for "dead time" spent in juvenile detention, unlike adults who receive credit for time served while awaiting trial. This practice extends the duration of confinement for youth, impacting their rehabilitation and straining resources. Experts argue that the lack of time credit stems from the juvenile justice system's focus on rehabilitation rather than punishment, leading to unequal application of rights. The issue is exacerbated by backlogs and limited access to rehabilitative programs in detention centers, leaving young people languishing without progress.</p>
