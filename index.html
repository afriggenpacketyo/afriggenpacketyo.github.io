          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has dropped its lawsuit against the cryptocurrency exchange Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao.  The case, filed in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. This dismissal marks a significant shift in the U.S.'s approach to cryptocurrency regulation, particularly given the Trump administration's apparent pro-crypto stance and the Justice Department's disbanding of its crypto enforcement team.  The move signals a potential end to one of the most aggressive crypto crackdowns in U.S. history.</p>

          <p>President Trump commuted the federal prison sentence of Larry Hoover, founder of the notorious Gangster Disciples street gang.  Hoover, 74, was serving multiple life sentences for various crimes, including conspiracy, extortion, and drug trafficking.  While Hoover has publicly disavowed gang life and advocated for criminal justice reform, authorities allege he continued to lead his gang from prison. This commutation is part of a larger series of clemency actions taken by the president.</p>

          <p>A Wall Street meme, "TACO trade" (Trump Always Chickens Out), mocks President Trump's fluctuating tariff policies.  The meme highlights Trump's tendency to announce tariffs, then later delay or reduce them, creating market volatility. Investors exploit this volatility by buying stocks at lower costs after tariff announcements, profiting when Trump backs down. Trump vehemently denies the accusation, defending his trade decisions as beneficial to the U.S. economy.</p>

          <p>A CBS News poll reveals a slightly improved outlook on the U.S. economy compared to winter, although overall sentiment remains negative. While more Americans plan summer vacations than last year, financial concerns and stress are more prevalent than feelings of security.  The poll highlights a disparity between higher-income earners, who feel more financially secure, and lower-income individuals, who experience greater financial stress.  The study underscores the ongoing impact of inflation and income inequality on Americans' financial well-being.</p>
