          <p>John Woeltz, a cryptocurrency investor, and Beatrice Folchi were arrested in New York City for allegedly kidnapping and torturing an Italian tourist for three weeks in a Manhattan townhouse. The victim, who arrived from Italy on May 6, was reportedly tied up, beaten, shocked with electric wires, and threatened with a gun in an attempt to obtain his Bitcoin password. The victim managed to escape and alert the police, who found Polaroid photos of the sexual assault and torture devices inside the residence.

          <p>Jon Worrell, a Georgia man, was arrested and charged with the 2006 murder of his wife, Doris Worrell, after investigators found new evidence in Costa Rica. Initially, authorities believed Doris died in a robbery attempt at their family business, Jon's Sports Park. However, the investigation went cold until the family's former live-in nanny, Paola Yarberry, who had an "inappropriate relationship" with Jon, cooperated with investigators in Costa Rica. The information corroborated existing evidence, leading to Jon's arrest. Doris's sister described her as overly kind, which ultimately led to her death.</p>

          <p>Under new government plans, developers who leave housing sites unfinished for years could have their land handed over to local councils to speed up the construction of new homes. Housebuilders will need to commit to delivery time frames before receiving planning permission and submit annual progress reports to councils. Those who repeatedly fail to meet targets could be denied future permissions and face penalties per unbuilt home. The government aims to build 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029 to address the housing crisis.</p>
