        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Beijing has issued a sharp rebuke of the new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, warning that such protectionist measures will ultimately harm all parties involved. A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs reiterated the nation's clear and consistent position that there are no winners in trade or tariff wars. The new duties will affect most Asian economies with levies between 15% and 20%, while some nations like India, Laos, and Myanmar face significantly higher rates. While the adjusted tariffs are lower than previously threatened for some smaller economies, analysts note they still represent a major increase in trade barriers. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy added only 73,000 jobs in July, falling well short of expectations and signaling a rapidly deteriorating labor market. Compounding the concerns, job growth figures for May and June were revised downward by a combined 258,000, indicating prior months were much weaker than initially reported. This poor performance, with the unemployment rate rising to 4.2%, has increased pressure on the Federal Reserve to consider lowering interest rates to stimulate the economy. The report also highlighted President Trump's strong criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not acting sooner. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Aircraft manufacturer Joby Aviation is partnering with defense giant L3Harris to create a next-generation military craft capable of both piloted and autonomous flight. The collaboration will integrate Joby's hybrid vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) technology with L3Harris's expertise in military systems. The companies aim to develop a smaller, cheaper, and more adaptable alternative to traditional military aircraft like the Apache helicopter. Testing is expected to begin this fall, with a focus on applications such as surveillance, reconnaissance, and logistics in contested environments, followed by operational demonstrations in 2026.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two Federal Reserve governors, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, publicly explained their recent dissents against the decision to hold interest rates steady. Both argued for a quarter-point rate reduction, stating that the central bank's cautious "wait and see" approach poses a significant risk to the U.S. labor market and overall economic growth. They believe the inflationary impact of tariffs is temporary and that delaying rate cuts could cause policy to fall behind the curve. Their statements represent a rare public disagreement within the Fed's leadership, highlighting a growing debate over the correct monetary policy path. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Switzerland has been hit with a surprisingly high 39% tariff rate by the White House, a move that has shocked the nation's business and economic sectors. The decision was unexpected, as Switzerland believed it was close to negotiating a deal with lower rates, similar to those secured by the EU and Japan. The U.S. is a critical market, accounting for about one-sixth of Swiss exports, and the new tariff is expected to deliver a devastating blow to the economy, particularly the tech and manufacturing industries. While the Swiss government still hopes for a negotiated solution before the tariffs take effect, the news has already caused the Swiss franc to slide. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hundreds of U.S. Department of Education employees are marking their last day after a mass layoff that will cut the agency's staff by roughly half. The reduction is part of President Trump's plan to return education oversight to the states. Departing civil servants, some with decades of experience, expressed concern that the cuts will undermine crucial functions like managing grants, collecting data, and enforcing civil rights protections for students. They argue that decimating the department will create a self-fulfilling prophecy of government inefficiency and leave students, particularly those with disabilities, vulnerable and without federal accountability.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has fired Carolyn Feinstein, a forensic auditor, citing a "lack of candor" related to her husband's controversial ICEBlock app. The app allows users to crowdsource and report the locations of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. Feinstein, who had a 20% ownership stake in the company for emergency purposes, claims she was left in the dark about the specific reasons for her termination. The Justice Department defended the firing, stating it will not tolerate threats against law enforcement, while Feinstein's attorney described the wave of firings as a form of political retribution that is exacerbating staff shortages.</p>

          <p>An interest-free payment pause for millions of federal student loan borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan's forbearance has ended as of August 1st. This means that interest will once again begin to accrue on their education debt, potentially adding hundreds of dollars to their balances each month if payments don't cover the new charges. The SAVE plan, which offered more generous repayment terms, was blocked by legal challenges and ultimately repealed by Congress. Experts are now advising borrowers to quickly find a new repayment plan, such as the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan, to avoid seeing their debt grow significantly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a reflective essay for Vox's Future Perfect, a departing journalist looks back on seven years of covering the world's most important and underreported problems. The author questions the real-world impact of their work, noting that while their coverage on pandemic prevention was prescient, a devastating pandemic still occurred. The piece grapples with the role of journalism in preventing catastrophes and the frustration of seeing well-researched solutions to global issues ignored or dismantled by political forces. Despite the grim state of the world, the author finds comfort in the fact that humanity has faced and overcome worse crises before.</p>

While the exact amount of the bid was not confirmed, it reportedly fell short of Newcastle's valuation of approximately £150 million. Isak, who wants to explore a move away from the club, was left out of the team's pre-season tour and is currently training alone. Liverpool manager Arne Slot is reportedly very keen to add the 25-year-old striker to his squad before the new season begins.

          <p>Many international aid organizations are choosing to remain silent in the face of dramatic funding cuts from the Trump administration, a strategy some experts term "anticipatory silence." Fearing further targeting or hoping to negotiate privately for restored funding, these groups have avoided public outcry over the termination of programs that support global health and development. This quiet approach is controversial within the sector, as critics argue it allows the administration to control the narrative and may ultimately be ineffective. The debate highlights the precarious position of non-profits that are financially dependent on the same government whose policies they oppose.</p>

          <p>Founded in 1903, Detroit's Pewabic Pottery has survived over a century of the city's economic booms and busts by staying true to the Arts and Crafts movement's focus on handcrafted quality over mass production. The studio is renowned for its unique, iridescent glazes and architectural tiles, which can be found in museums and buildings across the country. While the world industrialized around it, Pewabic continued to use its original equipment and hand-pressing techniques. Now operating as a nonprofit, the pottery had its best year ever in 2024, proving that its commitment to traditional craftsmanship remains a successful business model.</p>

          <p>Moderna has revised its full-year revenue forecast downward, lowering the top end of its outlook from $2.5 billion to $2.2 billion. The adjustment is due to a delay in shipping spring COVID-19 boosters to the U.K., which will now be delivered in the first quarter of 2026 instead of late 2025. Despite the lowered outlook, the company's second-quarter results beat Wall Street expectations, posting a smaller-than-expected loss. The company attributed the better-than-anticipated performance to significant cost-cutting measures, including a recent 10% reduction in its workforce, as it navigates declining COVID vaccine sales.

This move away from its long-standing open-seating policy could add hundreds of dollars to a family's travel costs, aligning the carrier more closely with its rivals. For example, a preferred seat on a flight during a holiday week could cost an additional $46 each way. The change is part of a broader overhaul prompted by activist investors, which also includes new baggage fees, as the airline seeks to maximize revenue in a competitive market.</p>

          <p>A new peer-reviewed study suggests that a mass die-off of monarch butterflies in southern California in early 2024 was likely caused by pesticide exposure. Researchers found hundreds of dead or twitching butterflies near a wintering site, a common sign of neurotoxic poisoning. Subsequent testing of the insects revealed an average of seven different pesticides in each, with levels of pyrethroids suspected to be lethal. While difficult to prove definitively in the wild, the findings provide strong evidence that pesticides are a key factor in the dramatic decline of monarch populations in recent decades.</p>
