The retailer cited the negative impact of U.S. trade tariffs as a primary reason for the revised guidance, anticipating a decline in sales and an operating loss for 2025. The company's new CEO acknowledged internal shortcomings and the need for a brand reset amid challenging market conditions and elevated inventory levels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hundreds of current and former NASA employees have signed a letter protesting what they describe as "rapid and wasteful changes" at the space agency. The letter raises concerns about significant budget and personnel cuts that they claim are undermining NASA's mission and defying congressional appropriations law. This internal turmoil comes at a time of broader uncertainty for the agency, which is also experiencing high-level leadership departures and is without a permanent administrator.</p>

          <p>Organizers of the Tour de France were forced to alter the route for Stage 19, shortening the race by 35 kilometers. The decision was made to bypass the Col des Saisies mountain pass after the discovery of contagious nodular dermatitis, a disease affecting a herd of cattle in the area. To prevent any disruption and out of respect for the affected farmers, the race was rerouted, skipping two of the day's planned climbs.</p>

          <p>The chief executive of England's Football Association, Mark Bullingham, has stated his opposition to expanding the use of the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system. Amid reports that football's law-making body might consider using VAR for decisions like corner kicks or second yellow cards, Bullingham argued that the current model already causes enough interruptions to the game. The FA's position is that the system is in a "good place" and does not need to be extended at this time.</p>

          <p>Ranchers in southern Mexico are struggling to contain an outbreak of the New World screwworm, a parasite whose larvae eat the flesh of living animals. The rapid spread of the parasite in livestock has prompted the United States to suspend cattle imports from Mexico, fearing it could reach U.S. herds and cause major economic damage. With a new sterile fly production plant not ready until next year, local ranchers are facing soaring medicine costs and resorting to home remedies to combat the infestation.</p>

The initiative aims to "de-medicalise" the process, giving individuals more choice and dignity when purchasing essential gluten-free products from supermarkets and shops. While a pilot scheme was praised for its convenience, some participants noted the financial support only partially covers the higher cost of a gluten-free diet.</p>

With a new quarterback and a move into the Big Ten conference, Riley believes the team is close to turning a corner and winning the close games it lost last year.</p>
