          <p>U.S. stock markets experienced a significant downturn, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling over 500 points. The decline is attributed to a weaker-than-expected July jobs report, which showed the addition of only 73,000 jobs, and major downward revisions for May and June. Investor sentiment was further dampened by the White House's announcement of new, high tariff rates on more than 60 countries, creating uncertainty about future trade relations and economic stability.

          <p>President Trump has fired Erika McEntarfer, the Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, just hours after the agency released a surprisingly weak jobs report. The report indicated only 73,000 new jobs in July and included significant downward revisions for the previous two months, totaling a loss of 258,000 previously reported jobs. In a social media post, Trump accused the commissioner, a Biden appointee, of manipulating data, a move that drew sharp criticism for undermining the independence of federal statistical agencies.

The transfer occurred shortly after she met with a top Justice Department official, prompting outrage from victims who condemned the move as preferential treatment. The Bureau of Prisons has not provided a reason for the transfer, which places her in a facility with less perimeter security and a lower staff-to-inmate ratio.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued an order blocking the Trump administration from using a fast-track deportation process on migrants who entered the U.S. legally under humanitarian parole. This ruling could curtail a controversial practice where ICE agents arrest migrants at courthouses to place them in expedited removal proceedings, which bypass the longer immigration court system. The judge found the administration's actions illegal, noting that the targeted migrants had followed the rules by entering with permission and attending their hearings, raising a fundamental "question of fair play."</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has indicated he will not be swayed by President Trump's ultimatum to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine, stating his troops are advancing along the entire front line. While expressing openness to future peace talks, Putin dismissed the US pressure, attributing any disappointment to "inflated expectations." This response comes despite the threat of new US sanctions and follows one of Russia's deadliest recent air attacks on Kyiv, signaling that a diplomatic breakthrough is not imminent.</p>

          <p>A debate has been reignited in Germany over the possibility of raising the retirement age beyond 67 to address the country's aging population and sinking worker-to-pensioner ratio. The economy minister's call to "work more and longer" has met with strong opposition from political partners and trade unions, who argue it would unfairly penalize workers in physically demanding jobs. While the current government has pledged not to raise the age, experts suggest comprehensive reform combining multiple levers, such as incentives and including more workers in the public system, is urgently needed.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order to revive the Presidential Fitness Test, a standardized set of exercises for schoolchildren that was phased out in 2013. The test, which included drills like the one-mile run and push-ups, was a staple of American physical education for over 50 years. The administration argues its return is necessary to combat declining physical well-being and rising obesity rates, which it frames as a threat to national vitality. Educators express cautious optimism, hoping a revamped version will prioritize lifelong health over pure competition.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed repealing its 2009 finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health, a move that specifically targets California's long-held authority to set its own stricter vehicle emissions standards. The proposal documents repeatedly reference the repeal of California's waivers, which are foundational to the state's plan to ban new gas-powered cars by 2035. The EPA's own analysis suggests that without California's rules and federal tax credits, national EV adoption would decline and gasoline prices would rise, yet the agency frames the rollback as an economic benefit.</p>
