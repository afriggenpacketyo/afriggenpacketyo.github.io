          <p>Gary Cohn, former National Economic Council director, stated that the U.S. job market has "degraded," citing a significant drop in monthly job creation figures over recent months. He explained this trend by noting that companies, facing rising input costs and unable to raise consumer prices, are reducing labor costs to protect their profit margins. Cohn believes this shift is occurring across the board, not just in the tech sector, and that the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut acknowledges this economic cooling. This analysis comes as the Fed aims to balance its dual mandate of controlling inflation and maintaining full employment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the wake of Charlie Kirk's death, Rabbi Pinchas Taylor of the American Faith Coalition remembered the conservative commentator as a man of deep faith who staunchly defended Israel. Taylor told Fox News that Kirk was a "voice of sanity, reason and principle" who stood with the Jewish people at a time of rising antisemitism. The tribute highlights Kirk's role in building bridges between communities based on shared Judeo-Christian values. The rabbi's comments provide a specific religious and political perspective on Kirk's legacy as thousands gathered for his memorial service in Arizona.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump commented on new Pentagon restrictions that severely limit journalists' ability to report on U.S. military matters, suggesting the rules would be ineffective by stating, "Nothing stops reporters." The new directive, issued by the recently rebranded Department of War, requires journalists to pledge not to gather unauthorized information, even if unclassified, or risk losing their press credentials. Press freedom advocates have condemned the policy as a direct assault on independent journalism and a form of prior restraint. The move follows increased hostility toward media organizations from Secretary of War Pete Hegseth.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strongly condemned the United Kingdom's decision to formally recognize a Palestinian state, calling it an "absurd prize for terrorism." He argued that such a move emboldens Hamas and endangers Israel's existence, vowing to fight against what he termed "slanderous propaganda." The reaction from Israel's government was swift, with its foreign ministry claiming the recognition is a direct result of the October 7th massacre. The decision has intensified debate within Israel, with far-right ministers calling for annexation of the West Bank in response.</p>

          <p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan initiated a one-day trial banning vehicle traffic from a section of Oxford Street, calling it the start of a "fight back to rescue this street." The event, which closed a half-mile stretch to vehicles, is a precursor to a potential permanent pedestrianization plan aimed at increasing footfall and retail spending. While many pedestrians welcomed the safer, more pleasant atmosphere, the proposal has faced opposition over concerns about accessibility for those with mobility issues and the diversion of traffic onto smaller residential streets. The mayor's plan depends on gaining new planning powers from the central government.</p>

Gloninger explained that while Earth's natural long-term cycle should indeed be one of cooling, this trend was sharply reversed by human activity over the last 150 years. He emphasized that the current rate of warming, driven by carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels, is unprecedented in human history and far steeper than any natural cycle.

According to advocacy groups, the detainees are demanding access to medical care, prescription medications, clean drinking water, and basic hygiene products. The facility, which the Trump administration opened in a former prison camp known as Camp J, allegedly lacks required services like a law library and religious programming. Advocates call the situation an emergency, warning that people are being denied life-saving medication in unsafe and degrading conditions.</p>

          <h2>Political Analyst Suggests Trump's Authoritarian Push Faces Declining Public Support</h2>

          <p>An opinion article in The Atlantic argues that President Donald Trump is in a race against time, as his efforts to consolidate power are occurring alongside his declining public support. The author contends that worsening economic indicators, such as rising grocery prices and stalled job growth, are eroding his political capital. This makes it harder for him to pressure officials like Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute his political opponents, as they must calculate the personal risks of collaboration if Trump's power wanes. The piece suggests that Trump's hold on power is fragile and susceptible to these external pressures.</p>

          <p>Germany's governing coalition has reduced the budget for the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development by 8%, to just under €10 billion. Development Minister Reem Alabali Radovan acknowledged that in light of increasing global crises, Germany is investing far less than is needed. Aid organizations have warned the cuts will have drastic consequences, with one NGO estimating that over 4 million people will lose food aid as a result. The move is part of a broader trend of Western donor countries reducing financial commitments to multilateral aid systems.</p>

          <p>America's national railway, Amtrak, is reportedly experiencing a significant increase in popularity, signaling a boom in rail travel across the country. The government agency has been actively promoting its services, including through popular social media channels, to highlight improvements and new offerings. A key example is the launch of the new "next-gen" Acela train, which operates on the Boston to Washington, D.C. corridor. This surge in interest suggests a growing preference among Americans for train travel, moving the nation's transportation landscape slightly closer to European-style rail systems.</p>

          <p>Despite the S&P 500 reaching new record highs, some Wall Street strategists predict that the stock market rally may not be over. They attribute the sustained optimism to the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut and the transformative potential of artificial intelligence, which they believe justifies higher stock valuations by boosting productivity and corporate earnings. While some express concern about a speculative "melt-up" driven by investor FOMO rather than fundamentals, the prevailing view is that the market's current tech-heavy composition supports continued growth in the near term.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to aging expert Elissa Epel, chronic stress can speed up the aging process at a cellular level by shortening telomeres, the protective caps on our chromosomes. While telomeres naturally shrink with age, prolonged stress accelerates this decline, which can have long-term health consequences. However, Epel notes that this damage is not irreversible. She recommends daily practices to de-stress and restore cellular health, such as taking short meditative breaks, eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, and prioritizing deep rest through activities like yoga or breathwork.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrats are re-evaluating their long-held opposition to national ID cards, a policy they helped scrap in 2010. Party leader Sir Ed Davey stated that "times have changed" and suggested the party should not have a "knee-jerk" reaction, especially with reports that the Labour government plans to introduce a digital ID scheme. While many party members remain concerned about civil liberties and data security, Davey indicated he could support a system focused on empowering individuals to access public services, distinguishing it from more authoritarian models. The potential policy shift reflects a changing political and technological landscape.</p>

The voluntary ban follows similar actions by other coastal councils and retailers after a public campaign highlighted the threat. The council is also calling on the Welsh and UK governments to support a nationwide legislative ban on the sale of these harmful toys.</p>
