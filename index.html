          <p>Former President Donald Trump has demanded the immediate removal of homeless individuals from Washington, D.C., suggesting they be relocated to distant areas. In a series of social media posts, he also hinted at a federal takeover of the city's law enforcement to combat what he claims is rampant crime, despite official data showing a significant decrease in violent crime. Trump's statements, which followed an alleged assault on a former staffer, have been met with pushback from D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who defended the city's declining crime rates and local governance. The former president plans to hold a press conference to detail his proposals for the capital.</p>

          <p>A significant gorse fire broke out on Arthur's Seat, a prominent landmark in central Edinburgh, prompting a major response from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service. The blaze spread rapidly across the hill, sending large plumes of smoke over the city during one of its busiest tourist weekends with the Edinburgh festivals underway. Authorities closed a large section of Holyrood Park and urged the public to avoid the area to allow emergency services to operate. While there were no reported casualties, the incident occurred during a summer marked by unusually warm and dry conditions, which have heightened wildfire risks across Scotland.</p>

          <p>NASCAR Xfinity Series driver Connor Zilisch sustained a broken collarbone after an accident during his victory celebration at Watkins Glen. After winning the race, the 19-year-old was climbing onto his car's roof when he slipped and fell headfirst onto the pavement. He was transported to a local hospital where CT scans of his head were clear, but the collarbone fracture was confirmed. This unfortunate incident occurred after a dramatic race where Zilisch recovered from a collision with a teammate to secure his sixth win of the season, capping an eventful day with an unexpected injury.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Hawaii has overturned a Trump administration directive, ruling that commercial fishing remains illegal within the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument. The decision blocks a letter from the National Marine Fisheries Service that had permitted fishing in areas previously protected by the Obama administration. Environmental groups, representing Native Hawaiian interests, successfully argued that the administration violated federal law by changing the rules without public notice and comment. This ruling is a significant victory for conservationists, protecting a vast and ecologically vital area home to pristine coral reefs, numerous shark species, and other vulnerable marine life.</p>

          <p>A large wildfire burning on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius near Naples, Italy, has forced authorities to close all hiking trails to the famous volcano. Firefighters, supported by the army and six Canadair planes, are battling the blaze which has consumed over 1,200 acres of the national park since Friday. The fire is concentrated on the densely vegetated Mount Somma side, with smoke visible from the nearby ancient city of Pompeii, which remains open to tourists. The incident highlights the growing threat of wildfires across Europe, exacerbated by intensifying summer heatwaves linked to climate change, with an investigation into the fire's origin now underway.</p>

He deleted the original post and stated he was clarifying, not retracting, his sentiment. Paul's co-founder Nakisa Bidarian had asserted that calling the officially sanctioned fights "staged" was defamatory and damaging to their brand's integrity, prompting the public relations standoff.</p>

          <p>Ford is utilizing an autonomous robot to pilot its Ranger Super Duty truck through a grueling durability test at its proving ground in Australia. The test occurs on a man-made track called Silver Creek, designed with 300 random bumps to simulate ten years of harsh driving conditions in a single run. To avoid the severe physical toll on a human driver, the robot operates the vehicle 24/7, pushing the truck's chassis, suspension, and mounts to their absolute limits while fully loaded to its maximum gross vehicle mass. This rigorous, automated testing process aims to validate the "Built Ford Tough" slogan by ensuring the truck can withstand extreme punishment.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's revamped lineup, featuring four new summer signings, displayed both brilliant attacking potential and defensive vulnerabilities in their Community Shield loss to Crystal Palace. Newcomers Hugo Ekitike and Jeremie Frimpong both scored on their competitive debuts, but the team twice surrendered a lead, finishing 2-2 before losing on penalties. The performance highlighted the creative impact of record signing Florian Wirtz in midfield, but also exposed defensive frailties, particularly at full-back and in central defense. Coach Arne Slot acknowledged that the new squad needs time to adapt and that further defensive reinforcements are necessary before the transfer window closes.</p>

He then contributed a crucial 31 runs with the bat during the chase, steadying the innings after a mid-order wobble. Despite a late scare, the Rockets successfully reached their target with four balls remaining, maintaining their unbeaten start to the tournament thanks in large part to Ahmed's decisive contributions.</p>

          <p>A 24-year-old man in Austria survived a dangerous ride clinging to the outside of a high-speed train after it departed a station without him. The incident occurred in Sankt Poelten when the passenger, who had stepped onto the platform for a cigarette break, missed the train's departure and jumped onto the space between two carriages. He banged on windows to alert staff, prompting the conductor to make an emergency stop, after which he was brought aboard. A railway spokesman condemned the act as highly irresponsible, noting such incidents are often fatal, while police escorted the man away upon arrival in Vienna.</p>

His coaches and teammates note his intense focus and bruising running, a grit he says was forged through activities like powerlifting, running hills, and patiently breaking horses on his family's property.

          <p>Firefighters have made significant progress in battling the Canyon fire in Ventura County, California, achieving 62% containment as of Sunday morning. The blaze, which has burned 5,370 acres near the Los Angeles county line, is no longer growing, and all evacuation orders for residents have been lifted. The fire, which started during a heatwave, has destroyed seven structures and resulted in injuries to three firefighters, one of them serious. Crews remain vigilant, monitoring hotspots and strengthening containment lines amid forecasts of continued high temperatures and potential wind gusts, while some personnel may be released to assist with other incidents.</p>

          <p>Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has publicly responded to former President Trump's threats to federalize the city's police force, asserting that local crime rates are decreasing. Bowser acknowledged a crime spike in 2023 but highlighted that violent crime has since fallen by 26%, countering White House claims of a public safety crisis. She expressed concern over the potential deployment of the D.C. National Guard, stating they are not law enforcement officials. While open to collaboration on shared priorities, Bowser emphasized that the conditions required by law for a presidential takeover of the city's police do not currently exist.</p>

          <p>Police in Downpatrick, Northern Ireland, have launched a murder investigation after a man's body was discovered in a house in Marian Park. A 30-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder in connection with the death. Detectives suspect the case may be linked to a separate, serious assault on a local priest, Fr. John Murray, who was attacked in his church with a bottle on the same day and remains in serious condition. The local community has been left horrified by the violent events, and political representatives have expressed their deep sadness and condolences to the families affected.</p>

          <p>NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte stated that former President Trump's upcoming meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska will serve to "test" the Russian leader's seriousness about ending the war in Ukraine. Rutte praised Trump's diplomatic efforts, suggesting he "broke the deadlock" by initiating dialogue, but emphasized that Ukraine must be involved in any final negotiations about its territory or security. The bilateral summit has drawn some concern, with critics like Senator Mark Kelly calling Putin a war criminal and questioning the value of the meeting. Ukraine's ambassador expressed hope that the diplomatic push will convince Putin to cease his aggression.</p>

          <p>Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi has issued a warning that the U.S. economy is on the brink of a recession, pointing to a concerning trend in the labor market. He noted that over 53% of the approximately 400 industries tracked in the payroll survey are now shedding jobs, a sign that has historically accompanied economic downturns. While official data does not yet confirm a recession, Zandi highlights that recent job growth has been minimal and largely confined to the healthcare sector. He suggests that future revisions to employment data could reveal that the economy is already in a decline. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple's stock experienced a remarkable 13% rally last week, a move attributed to a significant short squeeze rather than fundamental market optimism. Before the surge, many investors were betting against Apple, citing its perceived lack of a clear AI strategy and potential financial headwinds from antitrust rulings and tariffs. However, when former President Trump exempted Apple from tariffs and the company pledged further U.S. investment, sentiment shifted abruptly. This forced short-sellers to buy back shares to cover their positions, fueling a powerful rally that masked negative trends in the broader market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Heavy rainfall and subsequent flash flooding forced the cancellation of the final day of the Wisconsin State Fair and caused widespread disruption across the Milwaukee area. Some areas received up to 10 inches of rain, leading to flooded fairgrounds, power outages for nearly 47,000 customers, and numerous road closures. The Milwaukee Fire Department responded to over 600 calls, including multiple water rescues, as city crews worked to manage the dangerous conditions. The severe weather, part of a larger system affecting several Midwest states, also led to the cancellation of a major triathlon event in the city.</p>

          <h2>Conservative Commentator Criticizes Trump's Potential Move to Reclassify Marijuana</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Conservative podcaster Charlie Kirk has publicly criticized former President Donald Trump for considering the reclassification of marijuana to a less dangerous drug category. In a social media post, Kirk expressed his opposition, stating, "Everything already smells like weed, which is ridiculous," and argued for protecting public spaces. The Trump administration is reportedly exploring moving marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III drug, which would ease federal restrictions and provide tax breaks for cannabis companies. This potential policy shift follows lobbying efforts from major players in the marijuana industry during a recent fundraiser.</p>
