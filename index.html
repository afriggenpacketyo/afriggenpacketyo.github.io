          <p>Authorities in Merced County, California, discovered 134 cats inside a U-Haul van, with about one-fifth of them deceased from heat and neglect. The animals, ranging from kittens to adults, were found without food or water on a day when temperatures reached 100 degrees. A 69-year-old woman from Long Beach was arrested and faces 93 counts of animal cruelty. The surviving cats were taken to a local shelter for treatment and will be available for adoption once medically cleared.</p>

          <p>Beijing has imposed sanctions on former Philippine lawmaker Francis Tolentino, barring him from entering mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's factory activity among export-oriented manufacturers showed surprising growth in June, according to the private Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI, which rose to 50.4. This figure contrasts with the official government PMI that indicated a third consecutive month of contraction, though the surveys use different sample sizes and methodologies. The Caixin rebound was largely driven by a rise in export orders, potentially due to companies front-loading shipments to avoid upcoming U.S. tariffs. This suggests resilience in some sectors of the Chinese economy despite ongoing trade headwinds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed into law significant housing legislation designed to accelerate construction by easing environmental regulations. The new laws, AB 130 and SB 131, exempt most urban housing projects from the lengthy California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) review process, a move long sought by developers but opposed by some labor and environmental groups. Newsom forced the legislation through by linking it to the state budget, a tactic he defended as necessary to overcome years of political gridlock on the issue and address the state's severe housing crisis.</p>

          <p>The White House has asserted that Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney rescinded a planned digital services tax on large U.S. technology firms after "caving" to pressure from President Donald Trump. After Trump threatened to raise tariffs and called off trade talks, Canada announced it would scrap the 3% tax, which would have affected companies like Amazon, Google, and Meta. Canadian officials framed the move as part of a broader negotiation, and trade talks between the two countries have since resumed, marking a de-escalation in the recent trade dispute.</p>

          <p>A 56-year-old detention officer, Francisco Flattes, was shot and killed in Cherokee County, North Carolina, after a federal inmate he was escorting managed to seize his weapon during a scuffle at a medical facility. The inmate, identified as 48-year-old Kelvin Simmons, was being treated for foot pain and was under a heightened escort protocol due to a previous escape attempt. After the shooting, Simmons allegedly carjacked a vehicle and fled but was later apprehended; he now faces a first-degree murder charge in addition to his existing federal bank robbery charges.</p>

          <p>A study by Chinese scientists has identified betaine, a compound naturally produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise, as a key factor in slowing the aging process. The research, published in the journal Cell, found that betaine helps prevent inflammation and aging in multiple organs by inhibiting a specific enzyme. These findings provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms behind the health benefits of exercise and could inform future anti-aging strategies that simulate the effects of physical activity. The study was a joint effort by researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p>
