          <p>President Trump announced that India and Pakistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire after mediation talks led by the United States, though officials from both countries contradicted Trump's claims of US involvement, stating the deal was worked out directly between them. The ceasefire follows days of escalating tensions and military operations between the two nuclear-armed nations, prompting global leaders to urge dialogue for de-escalation. The agreement aims to halt the conflict stemming from a deadly shooting of tourists in the disputed Kashmir territory. The situation remains sensitive, but the ceasefire offers a potential path toward stability.</p>

          <p>Ric Edelman, founder of Edelman Financial Engines, criticizes the U.S.'s poor financial literacy education, especially among young investors, who are increasingly drawn to risky 'get-rich-quick' schemes promoted by new investing websites. He emphasizes the importance of credible financial education and cautions against overly complex financial products designed to exploit consumers. Edelman highlights that younger generations should be wary of corporate America that complicates consumer finance and encourages them to seek financial advice from credible sources instead of platforms like TikTok. He points out that the lack of mandated personal finance courses in high schools leaves young adults unprepared for crucial financial decisions.</p>

          <p>A creative writing teacher describes the transformative impact of her prison classroom for incarcerated women in Maine, including a transgender woman who found acceptance and self-discovery within the prison walls. The federal government revoked over $1.4 million in grant funding from Maine's Department of Corrections because the state housed a transgender woman in a women's facility, following medical recommendations and the federal Prison Rape Elimination Act. This decision led to the elimination of vital rehabilitation programs, including substance use treatment, re-entry support, and creative arts initiatives. The author and other volunteers were suspended for advocating for the incarcerated women, highlighting the conflict between rehabilitation and retribution in the prison system.</p>

The proposed overhaul includes strictly time-limited work visas for jobs not requiring graduate-level skills and potential loss of the right for foreign students to stay after graduation. Companies failing to recruit UK-based staff may lose the ability to sponsor foreign workers, and judges will review the application of Article 8 of the Human Rights Act.

          <p>Following President Donald Trump's initial tariff announcement, prices of common household items have increased, according to a Telsey Advisory Group industry note. The price of a Target-exclusive Barbie doll rose by nearly 43%, while a Whirlpool washing machine at Lowe's went up by nearly $82. Other items, such as leggings and power drills, also saw price hikes. While the analysis acknowledged that the price changes shouldn't be viewed as definitive evidence of tariff impact, retailers and brands indicate that higher costs will likely be passed on to consumers.</p>

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy unveiled a plan to replace dated radar and communications systems, potentially requiring over $30 billion in funding from Congress. The plan follows recent equipment failures and a deadly air crash, highlighting the urgency to fix lingering problems, particularly in the busy airspace around New York City.

The initiative comes as Russia's unilateral three-day ceasefire concludes, and European leaders are calling on Russia to stop obstructing efforts to secure an enduring peace.

Policies such as less expensive housing, universal pre-K, support for new parents, better schools, and more affordable healthcare could help close the gap between desired and actual family size.

          <p>This article examines how part-time jobs have become a trap for many American workers, with employers circumventing labor laws by offering too few hours rather than too many. The rise of just-in-time scheduling and the prevalence of part-time workforces allow employers to avoid paying benefits and maintain flexibility, but it leads to income instability and underwork for employees. Proposed solutions include requiring employers to set schedules in advance, incentivizing full-time hiring, and allowing workers to choose their preferred work arrangement. The article argues that addressing the issue of underwork is crucial for ensuring stable and prosperous lives for low-wage workers.</p>
