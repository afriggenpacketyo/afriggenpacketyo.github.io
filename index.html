          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey has been indicted by a federal grand jury in Virginia on charges of making a false statement and obstruction of justice. The charges relate to his 2020 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, specifically regarding alleged leaks of information concerning an investigation into Hillary Clinton's email use. This indictment follows public demands from President Donald Trump to prosecute perceived enemies, and the replacement of a U.S. Attorney who expressed doubts about the case. If convicted, Comey faces a maximum of five years in prison, marking a significant development in a politically charged legal battle.</p>

          <p>Parents of Cile Steward, an 8-year-old girl still missing after devastating floods killed 27 people at Camp Mystic, have condemned the camp's decision to reopen its sister site in 2026. They argue that reopening while a child remains unrecovered and families are grieving is "unthinkable" and insensitive. The floods, which occurred on July 4, hit cabins in known flood zones, leading to significant loss of life among campers and counselors. Affected families are demanding full accountability and a halt to reopening plans until the missing child is found and safety concerns are fully addressed.</p>

          <p>Costco has surpassed Wall Street's expectations for its quarterly earnings and revenue, reporting significant double-digit growth in both membership income and its e-commerce sector. The warehouse club's success is attributed to attracting more members, including a growing demographic of younger shoppers, and its ability to manage tariff costs by introducing private-label alternatives and adjusting merchandise. Despite a slight dip in same-store sales growth, the company plans to open 35 new warehouses in the coming fiscal year. Membership fee increases also contributed to the strong financial performance.

          <p>Raynae Madison and her family from Oklahoma discovered a nearly 3-carat chocolate brown diamond at Crater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas. Madison initially thought the stone was too large to be a diamond but it was later identified by park staff. Named the "William Diamond" in honor of her nephew, the 2.79-carat gem is the third-largest found at the park this year. The article explains that brown diamonds from the Crater are formed through plastic deformation, reflecting light to create their unique color. The park, a popular destination for diamond hunting, has seen over 75,000 diamonds unearthed since 1906.</p>

          <p>The Samaritans, a suicide prevention charity, is facing a potential exodus of hundreds of volunteers if plans to close over 100 branches in the UK and Ireland are approved. Critics argue these changes, which include a shift towards remote working and larger offices, will decimate local community work and compromise the charity's ability to answer calls. Volunteers express strong opposition, with many indicating they would leave if their branches close or if remote volunteering becomes the primary model. The charity's leadership maintains the proposals will improve service and volunteer recruitment, but faces growing distrust and calls for a vote of no confidence.</p>

          <p>British energy major BP has seen its shares climb over 32% since April, outperforming rivals and effectively stepping out of the takeover spotlight it occupied months prior. This improved sentiment is attributed to a fundamental strategic reset, a leadership shake-up, progress on cost-cutting initiatives, and recent oil discoveries. CEO Murray Auchincloss emphasized the company's focus on growth rather than acquisition. Analysts have upgraded BP's rating and price targets following stronger-than-expected second-quarter results, signaling a period of renewed stability and confidence in the company's direction.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers clinched their 12th National League West division title in 13 years with an 8-0 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks. Despite a regular season marked by injuries, bullpen struggles, and failing to meet "superteam" expectations, the team enters the postseason with renewed momentum, winning 12 of their last 17 games. The article highlights strong performances in the clinching game, including home runs from Freddie Freeman and Shohei Ohtani, and a scoreless six-inning start from Yoshinobu Yamamoto.

          <p>This article explores various indicators, both traditional and unconventional, that might signal an impending recession. While economists rely on factors like unemployment and interest rates, folk wisdom suggests clues from consumer behavior, such as declining sales of men's underwear or rising demand for instant noodles. The article notes that some pop-culture indicators, like cardboard box production, have proven reliable proxies for economic activity. Despite economists predicting a recession since 2022, it hasn't officially arrived, yet consumer sentiment reflects widespread economic anxiety, leading to a "boom time for talking about recession indicators."

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued a presidential memorandum aimed at "investigating, disrupting and dismantling all stages of organized political violence and domestic terrorism," specifically targeting what he calls a "radical leftwing domestic 'terror network'." The initiative, involving the FBI and Justice Department, has raised fears among critics of a broad crackdown on political opponents. Trump vaguely implicated figures like George Soros and Reid Hoffman as funders of "anarchists and agitators." The memorandum follows recent violent incidents, which Trump and his allies have attributed to the left, despite authorities finding no evidence of group affiliation in one case.</p>

Multnomah County Sheriff Nicole Morrisey O'Donnell confirmed the arrest and acknowledged the error, stating, "This should not have happened." Sage, facing charges for the death of a 15-year-old, had been denied bail, but an initial release order incorrectly indicated a $5,000 bail.

          <p>The Prime Minister has likened Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham's economic proposals, which include a 50p top rate of income tax, to the "disaster" of former Tory Prime Minister Liz Truss's policies. These comments come amidst speculation that Burnham is positioning himself for a leadership challenge to Sir Keir Starmer. The Prime Minister emphasized the importance of fiscal rules for economic stability, warning against abandoning them for either tax cuts or spending.

Some warn of the "twilight of shale" and that "drilling is going to disappear" due to rising costs and a perceived lack of understanding of shale economics from the administration.

          <p>European NATO leaders appear increasingly prepared for potential direct, albeit limited, conflict with Russia following a series of brazen air incursions into NATO airspace. Incidents like Russian drones entering Polish territory and fighter jets violating Estonian airspace have shifted the focus from de-escalation to deterrence. Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski explicitly threatened to shoot down future unauthorized aircraft, a stance surprisingly echoed by President Donald Trump. This signals a significant hardening of Western policy, with calls for increased air defense investment, though Russian officials have warned such actions would mean war.</p>

          <p>Late billionaire Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's longtime partner, contended that "really fancy houses" often make people less happy, not more. Despite his vast wealth, Munger lived in the same modest Los Angeles home for seven decades, deliberately avoiding a grand lifestyle. He believed excessive homes, while good for large-scale entertaining, were expensive and could negatively influence children's values. The article notes Munger's perspective challenges the common belief that larger homes equate to greater satisfaction, especially amidst current high housing costs and upkeep frustrations. This philosophy suggests that true happiness stems from stability rather than material excess. (not investment advice)</p>

Democrats have condemned this as an intimidation tactic, accusing President Trump of using the threat of mass firings to gain leverage in spending negotiations.
