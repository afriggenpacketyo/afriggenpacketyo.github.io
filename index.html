          <p>An article reports that public transportation services in Japan are implementing AI to improve lost-and-found operations. Find Inc.'s platform, used by 30 organizations at 2,300 locations, utilizes AI to categorize and catalog lost items based on photos taken by staff. Owners can inquire through messaging apps, entering item details, and the AI matches the description to the database. Keio Corp. has seen a significant increase in the return rate of lost possessions, and Yurikamome Inc. has reduced inquiry volume, with users expressing gratitude for the convenient service. The system has handled 1.5 million lost items, returning around 480,000.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military reported that North Korea fired multiple presumed short-range ballistic missiles into its eastern waters from the Monsanto area, with the missiles traveling up to 800 kilometers. South Korea is collaborating with the U.S. and Japan to analyze the launch, which Japan's defense ministry indicated had no impact on their country. Experts suggest the launch could be a test of missiles intended for export, potentially to Russia for use in the Ukraine conflict. North Korea's ballistic missile program is banned under UN Security Council resolutions, but the country has continued to develop missiles of all ranges.</p>

          <p>Tarek Bazrouk, a 20-year-old New York man, has been charged with federal hate crimes for three separate assaults on Jewish protesters in Manhattan. According to prosecutors, Bazrouk targeted individuals wearing religious attire or carrying Israeli flags at demonstrations over the war in Gaza. The incidents occurred over nine months, and Bazrouk was arrested after each one, but allegedly continued to commit acts of violence. His cellphone revealed pro-Hamas propaganda and messages where he identified himself as a "Jew hater," according to the F.B.I. Each hate crime count carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce his first trade agreement since implementing tariffs that roiled stock markets. Trump hinted at the announcement on social media, stating that the deal is with "A BIG, AND HIGHLY RESPECTED, COUNTRY," but did not reveal the country's name or the terms of the agreement. The announcement comes after a period of trade talks with partners following the imposition of tariffs on imported goods and reciprocal tariffs aimed at countries with unfavorable trading practices.

Pakistan claims to have shot down five Indian planes and one drone, including Rafale fighter jets, MIG-29 fighter aircraft, Su-30 fighter jet, and a Heron drone, although these claims have not been independently verified. India reported that two or three of its aircraft went down within its own border. The New York Times was unable to independently verify these claims. The Rafale is a twin-engine fighter jet manufactured by Dassault Aviation, and India had signed a deal to purchase additional aircraft from France.</p>

According to multiple sources, ICE agents visited dozens of restaurants, carry-out spots, and bars across several neighborhoods, requesting to see I-9 forms to verify employee identities and employment authorizations. While no arrests were made, some restaurant owners preemptively closed their establishments following the visits. Mayor Muriel Bowser expressed concern over the ICE activity, stating that it was disrupting neighborhoods and did not appear to be targeting criminals.</p>

          <p>Apple is asking a court to pause a recent contempt ruling in its case against Epic Games, seeking to reinstate commissions on in-app transactions that link out for payment. A judge had found Apple in violation of an earlier order to allow developers to link to external payment options. Apple argues that the required changes would cost the company "substantial sums." Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney believes the ruling forces Apple to compete. The judge also made a criminal referral, saying Apple misled the court about its reasons for charging 27% for external payments.</p>

          <p>India said it carried out strikes on Pakistan in retaliation for a terrorist attack that killed 26 civilians in Kashmir. The Indian government stated that its forces struck nine sites in Pakistan and on Pakistan’s side of the disputed Kashmir region. Pakistan military officials said that more than 20 people had been killed and dozens injured after six places were hit on the Pakistani side of Kashmir and in Punjab Province. The targeted locations included Bahawalpur, Kotli, Bagh, Shakargarh, and Muridke. The Indian government called its military action "Operation Sindoor," signaling its intention to avenge the widowed women from the April 22 terrorist attack.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the Trump administration's policies are undermining the Western world order, echoing mistakes of past rulers. The author claims that Trump's tariffs, attacks on NATO allies, and undermining of democratic norms are accelerating a loss of faith in the Western project. They draw parallels between Trump's actions and those of past leaders whose hubris and divisiveness led to the decline of their empires. The article suggests that the West is at an inflection point, and the decisions of its leaders will determine its future.</p>

          <p>Salt Lake City and Boise have adopted official pride flags to circumvent Republican-led bans on flying unofficial flags on government property. Salt Lake City's mayor proposed three new city flags featuring the city's traditional sego lily design superimposed over a pride flag, a trans flag, and a Juneteenth flag. Boise's mayor issued a proclamation retroactively making the pride flag an official city flag. These actions are a direct response to state laws restricting the types of flags that can be flown on government property.</p>

AMD CEO Lisa Su emphasized the need to balance national security with boosting the American chip industry.

The United States diplomatic mission in Pakistan issued a security alert, and President Trump said he wants to see the two countries work it out.

          <p>UnitedHealth Group is facing a lawsuit from investors who allege the company misled them by withholding information about the impact of a backlash following the killing of CEO Brian Thompson. Investors claim UnitedHealth artificially inflated prices by projecting earnings per share of $29.50 to $30, despite the backlash and a Senate report on claim denials. The lawsuit follows UnitedHealth's decision to cut its 2025 forecast for adjusted profit per share to between $26 and $26.50.
