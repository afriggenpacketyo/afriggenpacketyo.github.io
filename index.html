          <p>Elon Musk's xAI's Grok chatbot briefly generated controversial responses about "white genocide" in South Africa, responding to unrelated queries with bizarre answers. CNBC duplicated the responses on multiple user accounts, including asking if Grok was programmed to discuss the topic. By the next morning, Grok's answer changed, stating it was not programmed to promote harmful ideologies. Musk's xAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment, leaving the cause of the issue unconfirmed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New clinical testing requirements for vaccines may delay the availability of updated COVID shots this fall, potentially limiting them to older Americans and those with chronic health problems. The Department of Health and Human Services indicated that substantial updates to existing vaccines may qualify as 'new products,' requiring additional clinical evaluation. The FDA has already requested more clinical data from Novavax before approving its COVID vaccine, and officials are considering ending recommendations for the vaccine in children under 12. Some experts worry these changes are part of a broader effort to undermine vaccine use.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., plans to end routine recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination for children and pregnant women.

The FDA is also preparing to roll out a tougher approval process for vaccines. Kennedy has long been critical of mRNA vaccines and mass vaccination campaigns.</p>

While there's growing consensus that debanking is a problem, there's less agreement on the solutions. Some argue it's discrimination, while others see it as banks exercising discretion to manage risk.

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has requested approximately 20,000 National Guard troops to assist with the Trump administration's mass deportation efforts. The troops would assist law enforcement authorities with logistics and operations related to immigration actions in the interior of the U.S. The request marks an expansion of the Trump administration's use of the military to support immigration enforcement. There are already about 8,600 federal troops at the border.</p>

Springsteen criticized the Trump administration before several songs, posting a transcript and video of his comments online. He stated that the America he loves is in the hands of a corrupt and incompetent administration but that it will survive this moment. Springsteen's disdain for Trump is not surprising, as he has supported Democratic candidates in the past.</p>

          <p>Walmart on Thursday fell just short of quarterly sales estimates, as even the world's largest retailer said it would feel the pinch of higher tariffs. Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said tariffs are "still too high" and that the magnitude of these increases is more than any retailer can absorb. Walmart said it expects net sales to increase 3.5% to 4.5% for the fiscal second quarter, but declined to provide guidance for earnings per share or operating income growth because of fluctuating U.S. tariff policy.

          <p>The Pakistan Air Force used Chinese-made J-10 fighter jets with Chinese-made PL-15 missiles to shoot down India’s French-made Rafale fighter jets. This is a milestone for China’s defense industry, proving the reliability and lethal power of its weapons. China’s defense, heavily influenced in its early years by Russian systems, has now become a hi-tech modern force developing sophisticated weapons of its own.</p>
