          <p>May Davis Mailman, a longtime insider of the Trump administration, has resigned from her position as deputy assistant to the president and senior policy strategist. Sources indicate she is the highest-ranking official to leave voluntarily during the president's second term. Mailman, who served throughout the first term, was considered a key figure in establishing the operational framework of the second White House. She plans to start a government affairs firm but will continue as a special government employee to finalize some of her policy work, including negotiations with Harvard University over research funding.</p>

          <p>A group of approximately 30 Democratic lawmakers have fled Texas for Illinois to prevent a vote on a new congressional map that could create five new Republican-leaning districts. By leaving, they deny the state legislature the necessary quorum to conduct business, effectively halting the proceedings of a special session called by Governor Greg Abbott. The Democrats accuse Republicans of holding disaster relief funds hostage to force through a gerrymandered map favored by Donald Trump. The lawmakers face potential daily fines and arrest for their actions, a measure introduced after a similar walkout in 2021.</p>

          <p>A Palestinian American man, Khamis Ayyad, has died from smoke inhalation in the Israeli-occupied West Bank village of Silwad. His death occurred after Israeli settlers allegedly set fire to homes and vehicles in the area, which is located near several Israeli settlements. The U.S. State Department confirmed the death, condemned the violence, and is providing consular assistance to the family. This incident marks the second death of a Palestinian American in the West Bank in three weeks and occurs amid a significant increase in violence in the region since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.</p>

          <p>Sources indicate that Senate Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, engaged in intense negotiations to secure the release of several billion dollars in government funds in exchange for confirming a slate of President Trump's nominees. The requested funds were designated for various programs, including the National Institutes of Health, the Global Fund, and UNICEF. A potential deal to advance about 20 nominations was reportedly close before President Trump rejected it. The failed negotiations leave approximately 140 Trump nominees awaiting confirmation until at least September, highlighting the deep partisan gridlock in Washington.</p>

          <p>The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) dispatched fighter jets to intercept a civilian aircraft that violated a temporary flight restriction zone over President Trump's Bedminster, New Jersey retreat. The aircraft was one of five unauthorized incursions over the weekend, with flares used in this instance to get the pilot's attention before escorting the plane out of the area. NORAD officials emphasized that the flares are used with the highest regard for safety and burn out completely, posing no danger to people on the ground. Pilots are being strongly urged to check all FAA notices before flying.</p>

          <p>An Israeli official has stated that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is advocating for an expanded military operation in Gaza to secure the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas. This push for a "military solution" comes as diplomatic efforts have seemingly stalled, with a growing belief in Israel that Hamas is not interested in a deal. The news emerges as thousands protested in Tel Aviv, demanding the government prioritize the return of the approximately 20 living hostages. Simultaneously, international concern is growing over the severe hunger crisis and rising death toll from malnutrition within Gaza.</p>

          <p>U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has indicated that the recently announced tariff rates on dozens of trading partners are "pretty much set" and are unlikely to be negotiated down. The statement follows a White House executive order establishing a baseline 10% tariff on all imports starting August 7, with some countries like Canada facing higher rates. Greer defended the administration's strategy as a necessary step to rebalance trade and address the overseas migration of manufacturing jobs. The move has prompted concern from economists, who predict the tariffs will slow economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Marvel's "The Fantastic Four: First Steps" remained at the top of the North American box office but experienced a steep 66% drop in its second weekend, earning $40 million. This decline is notably larger than that of Marvel's previous film, "Thunderbolts." The superhero movie's global total has reached $369 million. New releases, including the animated comedy "The Bad Guys 2" and the parody "The Naked Gun," took the second and third spots with $22 million and $17 million, respectively. Analysts note that while the summer box office started strong, its overall success will depend on the longevity of upcoming films.</p>

          <p>The White House is defending President Trump's decision to fire Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, pointing to downward revisions in recent jobs reports as evidence of potential issues. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett argued the revisions were a "historically important outlier" that raised doubts, though he did not provide specific evidence of the data being "rigged" as the president claimed. The move has drawn sharp criticism from economists and former officials, who warn it undermines the credibility of government data and sets a dangerous precedent for politicizing statistical agencies.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a new court filing, Department of Justice lawyers for the Trump administration have denied the existence of a daily quota for immigration arrests. This contradicts earlier media reports and a public statement from White House adviser Stephen Miller, who said the administration was looking to set a minimum goal of 3,000 arrests per day. The government's legal filing claims that while the figure may have been discussed as a "goal," no such policy directive was ever issued to ICE. The discrepancy arose during a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of immigration enforcement tactics in Southern California.</p>

          <p>Florida has unexpectedly become a national leader in solar energy, adding more utility-scale solar capacity than California last year. This growth is driven primarily by large utilities like Florida Power & Light, which are capitalizing on streamlined regulations and favorable economics, making solar a cheaper option than natural gas. However, the state's momentum faces challenges from the rollback of federal tax credits and emerging grid constraints. The success of solar-powered communities like Babcock Ranch, which maintained power through Hurricane Ian, demonstrates the resilience and potential of localized, renewable energy systems.
