The new entity, named Anglo Teck, will be headquartered in Canada with listings in New York, Toronto, London, and Johannesburg. Anglo American shareholders will own 62.4% of the combined company, a move that caused Anglo American's shares to surge by 9%.

          <p>A year after CEO Brian Niccol took over from Chipotle, Starbucks is undergoing a significant revamp aimed at recapturing its "third place" identity, but the results are mixed. While initiatives like the "Green Apron Service" program and a focus on hospitality have shown some promise, same-store sales and traffic continue to shrink amid competition. Niccol's changes, including layoffs and a stricter return-to-office policy, have caused friction with some employees and the chain's unionized workers. Investors remain cautious, with the stock down 7% over the past year as the turnaround proves more challenging than expected.</p>

          <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics has issued a significant downward revision, indicating the U.S. labor market added 911,000 fewer jobs in the year ending March 2025 than initially estimated. This annual benchmark revision, which is larger than economists predicted, suggests the labor market was cooling more dramatically than was understood. The data is based on a more comprehensive census of employment that better accounts for business openings and closures. Economists believe this revision strengthens the case for the Federal Reserve to consider cutting interest rates.</p>

          <p>Chester-based artist Hayden Richard is gaining attention for a powerful painting of a bald eagle, created to celebrate the spirit of the Philadelphia Eagles football team. The artwork, which focuses solely on the bird to represent strength and freedom, was started even before the team's last Super Bowl victory. After losing his job as a chef, Richard returned to his passion for art, which he has practiced since childhood in Trinidad. He hopes his painting will be acquired by the team's ownership or players, viewing it as a tribute to "Bird Nation."</p>

The incident, which is not being treated as terror-related, occurred when a can of CS spray was discovered, causing irritation to people in the vicinity. Around 20 individuals were treated by ambulance services at the scene for minor symptoms before being discharged. Hundreds of people were evacuated for about three hours before the terminal was deemed safe and reopened.</p>

          <p>This opinion article analyzes recent comments by Donald Trump in which he suggested that violence within a home, such as "a little fight with the wife," should not be counted in crime statistics. The author argues that this view aligns with archaic legal standards that denied women rights within the private sphere and normalized domestic abuse. The piece connects Trump's stance to his administration's policies, which have sought to cut funding for domestic violence services, and his own history of accusations of sexual assault.

          <h2>Debit Cards Gain Popularity as Consumers, Especially Gen Z, Seek to Avoid Debt</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-09 11:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A cultural shift towards debt aversion is driving the increasing popularity of debit cards over credit cards in the United States, particularly among younger generations. Many Gen Z consumers, wary of accumulating debt after observing phenomena like the student loan crisis, prefer the direct-from-account nature of debit spending as a way to maintain financial control. In response, financial companies like Venmo and Chime are launching debit cards with rewards programs to attract this demographic. This trend reflects a broader consumer desire to live within their means, even as it alters the landscape of personal finance.</p>

          <p>House Democrats have publicly released a 238-page scrapbook given to Jeffrey Epstein for his 50th birthday, renewing focus on the sex offender's extensive network of powerful associates. The book contains numerous glowing and often highly sexualized letters from figures in business, politics, and academia. One note, allegedly from Donald Trump, mentions sharing a "wonderful secret" and includes a sketch of a nude female form, which Trump has previously denied writing. The release has amplified public pressure for greater transparency regarding Epstein's activities and the individuals who were part of his circle.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett has drawn criticism for her response when asked if the Twenty-Second Amendment's two-term limit for presidents is "cut and dry." In a Fox News interview, Barrett replied by stating what the amendment says without explicitly affirming its clear-cut nature, a response some observers found evasive. This has caused concern, particularly as President Trump has made ambiguous comments about potentially seeking a third term. While Barrett has previously written that the Constitution "leaves no room for second guessing" on term limits, her televised answer was seen by some as less definitive.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government could be forced to refund between $750 billion and $1 trillion in tariffs if the Supreme Court upholds lower court rulings that President Donald Trump's levies were illegal. The Trump administration has urgently asked the high court to rule on the matter, warning of "ruinous" economic consequences if it must repay the funds collected. Two lower courts have found that Trump overstepped his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners. The case creates significant uncertainty for both the government and the companies that have paid billions in these duties.</p>

          <p>Argentine President Javier Milei's right-wing party, La Libertad Avanza, has suffered a landslide defeat in key legislative elections in the province of Buenos Aires. The loss to the Peronist coalition is being interpreted as a public referendum on Milei's stringent austerity measures, which have reduced inflation but also suppressed wages. The election results caused an immediate negative reaction in the financial markets, with the Argentine peso weakening and the Merval stock index dropping sharply. Milei has acknowledged the defeat and pledged to "correct what needs to be corrected" in his government's approach.</p>

          <p>A public inquiry into the deadly Southport knife attack heard harrowing testimony about a young girl who was stabbed six times while protecting her younger sister. The girls' mother told the inquiry that her eldest daughter, though severely wounded herself, shielded her sister after the attacker, Axel Rudakubana, turned on them. Both girls survived the attack, which killed three children and seriously injured eight others in July 2024. The inquiry is examining the killer's history and potential failures by agencies that may have missed opportunities to prevent the tragedy.</p>

          <p>Americans are feeling more optimistic about their retirement prospects, according to a new report from Natixis Investment Managers. The survey found that only 21% of respondents believe it will "take a miracle" to retire securely, a significant drop from 41% in 2021, partly due to strong stock market performance. However, significant anxieties persist, with 69% worrying about financial instability. Top concerns include outliving their savings, potential cuts to Social Security, and the fear that high inflation will erode the value of their retirement funds over time.</p>
