          <p>DNA testing has confirmed that human remains exhumed in County Monaghan, Ireland, are not those of Joe Lynskey, one of the 'Disappeared' victims of the Troubles.  The Independent Commission for the Location of Victims Remains is continuing its search for the remaining missing individuals.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's embrace of open-source AI models, spearheaded by DeepSeek's R1, is accelerating innovation and adoption within the country.  Major tech companies like Baidu are following suit, releasing their own open-source LLMs, challenging the dominant proprietary models of US companies like OpenAI and potentially disrupting the industry's established business models.  This shift raises questions about the long-term viability of high-cost, closed-source AI development.</p>

          <h2>UK Councils Warned to Publish Pothole Repair Progress or Face Funding Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-03-24 04:02:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>English councils must publish annual reports detailing their progress in fixing potholes to receive full government funding.  The Department for Transport will distribute Â£1.6bn for road maintenance, but councils deemed to be underperforming risk losing 25% of their allocation.  The Local Government Association argues for a focus on preventative measures rather than solely reactive repairs.</p>
