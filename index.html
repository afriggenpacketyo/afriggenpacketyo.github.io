          <p>Ryan Routh was found guilty on all five counts for attempting to assassinate Donald Trump. Following the verdict, a chaotic scene unfolded as Routh tried to stab himself in the neck with a pen before being restrained and removed from the courtroom. Representing himself, Routh had argued he never intended to pull the trigger, a claim the jury rejected after about two hours of deliberation. He is scheduled for sentencing on December 18 and faces up to life in prison.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has proposed a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas, causing alarm within the tech sector over its potential impact on talent acquisition. While some executives like Netflix's Reed Hastings praised the move for prioritizing high-value jobs, many experts argue it could severely hamper startups that cannot afford such costs. Critics warn the policy could "kneecap startups," stifle innovation, and drive highly skilled foreign professionals to competing countries like China. The change is part of a broader effort to overhaul the visa program for skilled workers.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) used journalists' phone numbers to check for unauthorized contact with its officers and staff. The investigation found 21 unlawful uses of covert powers to uncover reporters' sources, double the previously known figure. This practice, described as "defensive operations," involved checking thousands of calls against hundreds of journalists' numbers without legal advice. The PSNI's Chief Constable acknowledged the need to improve processes while the report raised significant data protection and freedom of expression concerns.</p>

          <h2>US Mortgage Demand Plateaus as Interest Rates Fluctuate</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 07:40:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a significant 58% weekly surge in refinancing, overall mortgage demand saw minimal growth last week, rising just 0.6%. This stall occurred despite the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate falling to its lowest level since September 2024. Refinance applications increased by only 1%, while purchase applications remained flat, suggesting that while homebuyer demand is seasonally strong, the market is reacting to rate volatility. The previous week's dramatic spike was largely driven by a temporary dip in rates before they rose again following a Federal Reserve meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In response to the fatal stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a Charlotte light rail train, North Carolina lawmakers have passed "Iryna's Law." The bill aims to eliminate cashless bail for many offenses and imposes stricter pretrial release guidelines for defendants charged with violent crimes or those with extensive criminal histories. Proponents argue the law is necessary to prevent violent offenders from being released back onto the streets and to enhance public safety. The legislation now awaits the signature of Governor Josh Stein.</p>

          <p>In his first address to the United Nations General Assembly in six years, Donald Trump launched a scathing attack on the global body, calling it feckless and corrupt. He urged world leaders to abandon "the failed experiment of open borders," embrace nationalism, and expel foreigners, accusing the UN of funding an assault on their countries. The speech marked a significant moment, raising questions among diplomats about how the international system will function without reliable American leadership. Trump's address was a clear articulation of his "America First" foreign policy on a global stage.</p>

While the number of journalists murdered for their work has decreased and the country's press freedom ranking has slightly improved, intimidation and politically motivated prosecutions persist. Rights groups highlight the case of journalist Frenchie Mae Cumpio, detained for over four years on "trumped-up charges," as a sign of continued challenges. Critics argue that while overt hostility from the head of state has lessened, a culture of impunity and online harassment continues to create a chilling effect on the media.</p>

The prosecution argued that statements from two other soldiers, one deceased and one unwilling to testify, are the only evidence capable of proving Soldier F fired at civilians.

          <p>Researchers have announced a historic breakthrough in treating Huntington's disease, a devastating and fatal neurodegenerative disorder. A new one-time gene therapy, administered via brain surgery, has been shown to slow the disease's clinical progression by an average of 75% in trial patients three years after treatment. The therapy works by reducing levels of the toxic huntingtin protein that kills brain cells, offering hope for decades of improved quality of life. While the treatment is complex and expected to be expensive, it represents a major step toward potentially preventing symptoms from ever emerging in those who carry the gene.</p>

The speech addressed the chilling effect of the FCC chairman's threats and positioned the comedian as a central figure in a national debate over free speech under the Trump administration.

          <p>A trend of "job hugging" is emerging in the U.S. labor market, as anxious workers are choosing stability over seeking new opportunities, with the job quits rate falling to levels not seen since 2016. This reluctance to switch jobs, driven by economic uncertainty, has broad implications for both employees and the economy. While it lowers turnover for companies, it can also lead to worker disengagement and underutilized skills, costing businesses in lost productivity. For the broader economy, reduced labor mobility could flatten wage growth and lead to a period of stagnation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Anti-Vaccine Movement Aligns with Conservative Politics Through Nostalgia for a Pre-Vaccine Era</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The modern anti-vaccine movement is increasingly aligning with conservative politics, partly through a shared nostalgia for a past perceived as healthier and more "natural." Figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. champion a return to a time before widespread vaccination and processed foods, framing modern medicine as an impurity. This perspective often overlooks the severe dangers of the past, such as high infant mortality rates and deadly outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases like measles and polio. This romanticized view of a pre-vaccine world is a fantasy with potentially lethal consequences, as it fosters a false sense of security about the natural world.</p>

          <p>Following his assassination, conservative activist Charlie Kirk is being transformed into the first martyr of the MAGA movement, a process that mirrors how early religions used veneration to grow. This narrative shifts Kirk from a political commentator to a revered religious figure, with his Pentecostal background being broadened into a generic "Christian" identity to unify various factions of the religious right. This hagiography serves a political purpose, galvanizing supporters and potentially creating a faith-based movement that could outlast Donald Trump's direct leadership. The process involves recasting Kirk's legacy to fit a narrative of sacrifice for a political-religious cause.</p>

          <p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has indicated the league may seek to renegotiate its massive media rights deals as early as 2026, four years ahead of the current contract's opt-out clause. With NFL games dominating television ratings, an early renegotiation could add billions more to the league's revenue and allow its media partners to secure the valuable rights for a longer term. Goodell noted the rapidly changing media landscape as a key reason for wanting the flexibility to move earlier on a new deal. Such a move could significantly impact league finances, player salary caps, and franchise valuations.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy shift, President Donald Trump has declared that Ukraine can win back all territory lost since Russia's 2022 invasion, citing Russia's economic troubles. This reversal came after a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the UN and contrasts sharply with Trump's previous suggestions that Kyiv would need to cede land for peace. Zelenskyy hailed the change as a "big shift," while the Kremlin dismissed Trump's assessment of Russia's economy and suggested he was influenced by the Ukrainian leader's perspective. The change introduces new unpredictability into U.S. foreign policy regarding the conflict.</p>

The episode highlighted an escalating conflict, with Trump posting new threats against Kimmel's network, ABC, on social media. The incident has moved beyond a typical late-night feud, becoming a focal point in the broader struggle between the media and a presidential administration actively seeking to punish its critics.</p>

          <p>Six months into Donald Trump's second term, some influential right-leaning podcasters who helped elect him are showing signs of disillusionment. While loyalists like the "Full Send Podcast" remain supportive, other major hosts such as Joe Rogan, Theo Von, and Andrew Schulz have grown more critical of the administration's actions. They have voiced disappointment over issues like tariffs, government transparency regarding the Epstein case, and a perceived failure to deliver on campaign promises. This fragmentation within the "manosphere" could present a challenge for the MAGA movement, as these hosts command a large audience of young, male voters.</p>

          <p>Jimmy Kimmel's return to ABC after his suspension represents a notable, if partial, victory for a new form of celebrity-led resistance against the Trump administration. The pushback was driven not by political institutions but by hundreds of actors, comedians, and influencers who used their platforms to pressure Disney into reversing its decision. However, the victory has its limits, as major station groups Sinclair and Nexstar are still refusing to air the show in nearly a quarter of the country. This situation demonstrates how individual and grassroots efforts can successfully challenge corporate acquiescence to political pressure, while also revealing the persistent power of ideologically aligned media entities.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Times column contrasts the messages delivered at the memorial for conservative activist Charlie Kirk. His widow, Erika Kirk, offered a message of Christian forgiveness for her husband's killer, stating "the answer to hate is not hate... but love." Minutes later, President Trump took the stage and delivered a speech filled with vengeance, explicitly stating, "I hate my opponent and I don’t want the best for them." The author argues this stark disconnect highlights Trump's role as an "inciter in chief" rather than a uniter, undermining traditional presidential duties and religious teachings alike.</p>

          <p>California Democrats are adopting a more pragmatic, centrist approach to governance, moving beyond partisan resistance to focus on key voter concerns like affordability and crime. In San Francisco, new mayor Daniel Lurie is hiring more police and partnering with businesses, while Governor Gavin Newsom has reformed environmental laws to streamline housing and energy projects. This shift reflects an effort to be more responsive to voters, particularly after Republicans gained ground in several counties in the 2024 election.
