            <h2>Trump Tariffs Threaten Irreversible Damage to American Businesses, Experts Warn</h2>

            <p>Experts are warning that President Trump's tariffs on China could cause irreversible damage to many American businesses, particularly small businesses. Supply chain executives report canceled freight orders and abandoned freight from China, impacting industries like furniture, toys, apparel, and footwear. Economist Erica York suggests the high tariffs could halt most trade between the U.S. and China, with companies unable to absorb the costs. Stephen Lamar of the American Apparel & Footwear Association emphasizes the unpredictable policy changes are disrupting supply chains, leading to lost sales and product shortages.

            <p>Animal rights groups are praising the Trump administration's recent moves to phase out animal testing at the FDA and EPA. The FDA is ending animal testing requirements for antibody therapies, favoring human organ model-based testing. EPA chief Lee Zeldin is reinstating a 2019 policy to eliminate animal testing at the agency, reversing the Biden administration's delays. Groups like PETA and White Coat Waste Project are celebrating the decisions as a win for ethics and taxpayers, while some biomedical research advocates warn that alternatives may not yet fully replace the need for animal testing.</p>

            <p>Bangladeshi authorities have issued an arrest warrant for British MP Tulip Siddiq, who is being investigated for allegedly illegally receiving land. The investigation is part of a broader probe into the regime of her aunt, Sheikh Hasina. Siddiq's lawyers deny the charges, calling them politically motivated and stating that the ACC has not presented any evidence or informed Siddiq about the warrant. The UK lists Bangladesh as a 2B extradition country, requiring clear evidence before any decision is made.</p>

            <p>Searches for "parenting styles" have surged, with interest in authoritative parenting being particularly high. Authoritarian parenting is characterized by a rigid, top-down approach with high control and low warmth, while authoritative parenting balances clear boundaries with warmth and open communication. Experts warn against authoritarian parenting due to its potential negative impact on children's mental health and communication skills. Authoritative parenting, on the other hand, fosters a more positive and connected relationship between parents and children.</p>
