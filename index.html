          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 18:17:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>OPEC+ agreed to increase oil production for a second consecutive month, causing U.S. crude oil futures to fall by over 4%. The decision to raise output by another 411,000 barrels per day in June follows a similar increase in May. Goldman Sachs had predicted a much smaller production hike, but concerns over rising tariffs and potential recession fears impacting demand are weighing on the market. Lower oil prices have already affected the earnings of major oil companies like Chevron and Exxon, and are expected to constrain international upstream spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Brazilian police arrested two individuals in connection with an alleged plot to detonate a bomb at a free Lady Gaga concert in Rio de Janeiro, which drew approximately 2 million fans to Copacabana Beach.

The concert, funded by the city to revitalize the economy, was Lady Gaga's largest show ever, and organizers estimated it would bring in around $106 million.

          <p>The bodies of 13 security guards kidnapped from a major Peruvian gold mine, La Poderosa, were discovered after they were abducted by informal miners allegedly linked to criminal gangs. La Poderosa stated that 39 of its workers have been killed since 1980 due to conflicts over mine control in Pataz. The company criticized the state of emergency and police presence for failing to prevent the violence. Mining is a significant economic driver in Peru, but illegal mining has surged, leading to increased crime and extortion.</p>

          <p>Marvel Studios' Thunderbolts* debuted at the top of the US box office, earning $76 million in domestic ticket sales. While the opening was solid, it fell short of Marvel's typical blockbuster launches, raising questions about the studio's ability to consistently deliver high-performing superhero films. However, the film has received positive reviews and strong word-of-mouth, which could lead to sustained success in the coming weeks.
