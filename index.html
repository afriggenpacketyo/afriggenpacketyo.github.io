Combs faces charges including sex trafficking and could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted.

          <p>Coco Gauff experienced a significant upset at Wimbledon, losing her first-round match to unseeded Dayana Yastremska shortly after her triumphant victory at the French Open. Gauff admitted to feeling mentally overwhelmed following her recent championship win, which she felt contributed to a performance marked by numerous unforced errors. This early exit makes her one of only three women in the Open era to be eliminated in Wimbledon's first round immediately after winning the French Open title, highlighting the difficulty of the clay-to-grass court transition.</p>

          <p>France has enacted a stringent new law that bans smoking in most public outdoor areas, such as parks, beaches, and the vicinity of schools, in an effort to "denormalize" the habit. Those who violate the ban face substantial fines of up to €700, though an initial grace period is anticipated. Despite long-standing bans in restaurants and bars, over 30% of French adults still smoke, and the government hopes these new measures will curb its popularity, especially among young people. Café terraces remain a notable exception to the widespread ban.</p>

          <p>During a recent press conference, President Trump made comments suggesting the potential for arresting his political adversaries, specifically naming New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani and former Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Trump referred to Mamdani as a "communist" and implied he could be arrested for interfering with ICE operations. He also said he would consider prosecuting Mayorkas, who was previously impeached by the House, for his actions in office, raising concerns about the potential use of the justice system against political foes.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska cast a pivotal vote that ensured the passage of President Trump's major tax-and-spending bill through the Senate. Her support was secured after she successfully negotiated key provisions for her state, including increased funding for rural hospitals and a two-year exemption from the bill's cuts to the SNAP food assistance program. While expressing that she did not like the bill overall, Murkowski stated she had an obligation to protect Alaska's unique interests, a move that drew criticism from some fellow Republicans for adding "pork" to the legislation.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw is nearing the historic milestone of 3,000 career strikeouts, placing him among the elite in baseball history.
