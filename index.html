          <p>Mahmoud Abbas, the President of the Palestinian Authority, appointed Hussein al-Sheikh as his deputy, a move viewed by some as signaling al-Sheikh as his preferred successor. This decision comes amid succession fears and internal political maneuvering within the Palestinian leadership. However, many Palestinians criticize the leadership's focus on internal politics, especially given the ongoing conflict in Gaza and the Israeli military operations in the West Bank. The appointment also raises concerns about the PA's legitimacy and its ability to address the pressing needs of the Palestinian people.</p>

          <p>Following a disastrous February bar exam marred by technical issues, California State Senator Thomas Umberg is urging the State Bar to reinstate the traditional national exam format. The State Bar's decision to use its own AI-generated questions, intended to save costs and allow remote testing, led to widespread complaints and calls for accountability. Critics, including law school deans and professors, argue that the State Bar's leadership has lost credibility and must prioritize a fair and reliable exam for future test-takers. The State Bar will ask the Supreme Court to adjust test scores for those who took its February bar exam.</p>

          <p>Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein who accused Prince Andrew of sexual assault, has died at the age of 41. Her family confirmed that she took her own life, citing the lifelong trauma of sexual abuse and sex trafficking. Giuffre's allegations against Epstein and Prince Andrew brought international attention to the issue of sexual abuse and trafficking. Her courage in speaking out inspired other victims and led to legal battles and settlements, though she ultimately succumbed to the weight of her experiences.</p>

          <p>Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas appointed Hussein al-Sheikh as the first-ever vice president of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), a move widely seen as designating a successor.

While the appointment does not guarantee al-Sheikh the presidency, it positions him as the frontrunner to succeed Abbas, though the move is unlikely to improve Fatah's image among Palestinians.</p>
