        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Democrats, led by Governor Gavin Newsom, are initiating a special election to redraw the state's congressional maps. This move is a direct counter to a Republican plan in Texas aimed at making several Democratic-held districts more favorable to the GOP. While Texas Republicans can alter maps through the normal legislative process, California Democrats face a more complex path, likely requiring a constitutional amendment approved by voters. The political maneuvering highlights the intense national battle over congressional control ahead of the midterm elections.</p>

          <p>Firefighting crews are battling multiple large and deadly wildfires across the European continent, fueled by a severe heatwave. In Greece, progress has been made against several blazes, though the risk remains extremely high, while neighboring Albania and Turkey have reported fatalities among residents and forestry workers. The fires have stretched resources thin, prompting international cooperation, with the EU deploying assets to assist various nations. Authorities attribute the fires to a combination of natural causes, negligence, and suspected arson, highlighting the growing threat posed by hotter, drier weather conditions.</p>

          <p>During a White House event, President Donald Trump responded to criticism from Senator Elizabeth Warren by stating she "has got to take a drug test." The comment came after Trump was asked about Warren's claims that his administration is trying to cut Social Security. Trump called Warren a "liar" and a "nutjob," referencing her past claims of Native American heritage and her energetic endorsement of a New York mayoral candidate. This exchange is the latest in a long history of sharp personal and political attacks between the two figures.</p>

In a public statement, Bradbury claimed she was told to "sleep with someone at the Rugby Football League" to improve the club's situation. The club, which is already facing significant financial difficulties and poor performance, has stated it will conduct a thorough internal investigation into the allegations. The incident has prompted a supporters' group to proceed with a planned protest march.</p>

She achieved the record during the final round of the British Chess Championships, beating 60-year-old grandmaster Peter Wells. Sivanandan, who only started playing during the COVID-19 pandemic at age five, has been hailed as a trailblazing prodigy in a sport traditionally dominated by men.

          <p>Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) experienced an $8 billion writedown on its "gigaprojects," such as the futuristic city of Neom, at the end of 2024. Despite its total assets under management growing to nearly $1 trillion, the value of these ambitious domestic projects declined amid lower global oil prices and a growing fiscal deficit for the kingdom. The fund's annualized returns have also dropped, and it has broadened its funding base with public and private debt. This financial pressure has forced the kingdom to scale back or shelve some of its Vision 2030 projects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The upcoming summit between Presidents Trump and Putin is being held in Alaska, a location with deep historical ties to both the U.S. and Russia. Once a Russian colony sold to the U.S. in the 19th century, Alaska became a strategic military outpost during the Cold War. Today, its proximity to Russia makes it a geographically convenient meeting point for the two leaders to discuss the war in Ukraine. The state's unique history as a former Russian territory and a current U.S. defensive line adds a layer of symbolism to the high-stakes diplomatic talks.</p>

          <p>Logistics experts are warning that the full inflationary impact of recent tariffs has not yet reached consumers because the higher-priced goods are currently stored in warehouses. U.S. importers rushed to bring in products to avoid higher rates, creating a backlog in the "middle mile" of the supply chain. This front-loading of inventory has strained warehouse capacity and increased storage costs, but has delayed broad price hikes on store shelves. Analysts expect this inventory to start moving in the fall, at which point consumers will likely see higher prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's decision to assert federal control over Washington D.C., citing crime, is an act of profound hypocrisy. The author points out that the most violent recent event in the city was the January 6, 2021 Capitol attack, incited by Trump himself, and that current data shows violent crime is at a 30-year low. The piece frames the move as a right-wing attack on diverse, Democratic-leaning cities and an authoritarian power grab based on false pretenses. The author also connects the action to a broader strategy of distracting from other issues.</p>

          <h2>Legal and Political Constraints May Prevent Federal Intervention in Other U.S. Cities</h2>

          <p>While President Trump has deployed the National Guard and taken control of police in Washington D.C., a similar intervention in other major cities would be far more difficult. D.C.'s unique status as a federal district gives the president direct authority over its National Guard and the ability to federalize its police during emergencies. In contrast, state governors command their own National Guard units, and federal law generally prohibits using the military for domestic law enforcement. This legal framework means that threats to intervene in cities like New York or Los Angeles face significant constitutional barriers.</p>

          <p>Yue Wa, one of the last traditional grocery markets in L.A.'s Chinatown, is closing after 18 years. The owner, Amy Tran, cited a combination of factors making the business unsustainable, including repeated burglaries and assaults, the economic effects of the pandemic, and the impacts of gentrification. The market was a vital source of affordable, fresh produce for the neighborhood's elderly and low-income residents. Its closure represents the loss of a community hub and highlights the immense pressures facing small, family-run businesses in rapidly changing urban enclaves.</p>

Authorities state that McGann, a teacher with no known criminal history, admitted to the killings after his arrest and that his DNA matched evidence from the scene.

          <p>First Lady Melania Trump's lawyers have threatened to sue Hunter Biden for more than $1 billion if he does not retract a claim he made in an interview. Biden alleged that the First Lady was introduced to Donald Trump by the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. In a legal letter, Mrs. Trump's attorneys called the statement "false, defamatory and inflammatory" and demanded an apology, citing significant reputational harm. Hunter Biden has defended his comments, stating he is not going to apologize and would welcome the opportunity for depositions if a lawsuit is filed.</p>

          <p>Pakistani authorities have detained numerous Afghan refugees in Islamabad as part of a wider crackdown, including individuals who were approved for relocation to Germany. These individuals, including former local staff for German institutions, were fleeing the Taliban and awaiting transfer.

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are set to meet in Alaska for their first summit in six years, centered on ending the war in Ukraine. Trump aims to leverage his personal relationship with Putin to secure a ceasefire, a key campaign promise, though Ukraine's President Zelensky has been excluded from the direct talks. The meeting follows a U.S. threat of new sanctions, creating a tense backdrop for negotiations. While Trump has expressed varied levels of optimism, Russia has maintained its firm position, making the outcome of this bilateral discussion highly uncertain.</p>

          <p>The European Union has dispatched two firefighting planes to Spain to help combat severe wildfires after the country recorded its third fire-related death. The deployment marks the first time Spain has activated the EU's disaster assistance mechanism, as a persistent heatwave with temperatures up to 44°C exacerbates conditions. Authorities have arrested several individuals on suspicion of arson, and thousands of people have been evacuated from their homes across the country. This event is part of a broader crisis in Southern Europe, where countries like Greece are also battling devastating fires.</p>

          <p>A jury has ruled that 14-year-old Ruth Szymankiewicz, who died after self-harming at a mental health hospital, was unlawfully killed. Ruth was supposed to be under constant supervision but was left alone for 15 minutes by an agency staff member who had used false credentials and had no prior psychiatric hospital experience. The failing hospital, which has since closed, had insufficient staffing, and the jury found that her care was unsuitable. Her parents stated that the system meant to keep her safe had instead "locked her away and harmed her."</p>

          <p>This opinion piece highlights a new Department of Energy report on climate change, praising it for taking a middle-ground approach. The report, organized by a group of independent scientists, affirms that human activity contributes to warming but questions the severity of some projected impacts, such as the frequency of hurricanes and droughts. It also suggests that the economic damage from warming may be less than commonly claimed. The author argues that this nuanced perspective is a welcome, evidence-based contribution to a debate often polarized by alarmism and denial.</p>
