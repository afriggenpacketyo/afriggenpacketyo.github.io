          <p>This article details the story of C.C. Opanowski, who was attacked by her ex-boyfriend, Shawn Doyle, in 1996. Doyle physically restrained her, held scissors to her throat, and cut off her ponytail. Opanowski's roommate called the police, but she felt the police did not take the matter seriously at the time. Years later, Opanowski learned that Doyle had murdered Lori Leonard, a young mother, in 2005. Opanowski bravely testified against Doyle at his trial, helping to secure his conviction, and hopes her story will encourage others to be vigilant and speak out about potential dangers.</p>

          <p>Saudi Aramco's net profit for the first quarter of 2025 decreased by 5% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to lower oil prices and production volumes. The company's net income for the quarter reached $26 billion, slightly exceeding analyst expectations. Free cash flow also declined from $22.8 billion to $19.2 billion. These figures indicate ongoing financial pressures for the Saudi state oil giant as it navigates fluctuating crude prices and slowing global demand.</p>

          <p>The new German government under Chancellor Friedrich Merz is facing scrutiny due to the appointment of several cabinet members directly from the business world, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest and lobbying. Critics are questioning the influence of business interests on political decision-making, particularly with the new ministers for economic affairs, culture, and digitalization all having recent ties to major corporations. While lobbying is regulated in Germany, experts argue that existing rules are insufficient to effectively address potential conflicts of interest.</p>

          <p>Facing the threat of "new and massive" sanctions from European leaders, President Vladimir Putin has called for direct talks between Russia and Ukraine to be held in Turkey. The European leaders, visiting Ukraine, demanded a full, unconditional 30-day cease-fire, but Putin brushed this aside, proposing a meeting in Istanbul on May 15 without preconditions. Ukraine has yet to respond, and an hour after Putin's announcement, reports emerged of Russian drone attacks in several cities, including Kyiv.</p>

          <p>RÃ¼meysa Ã–ztÃ¼rk, a Tufts University student from Turkey, has vowed to continue her legal battle after being released from an immigration detention center. She was held for more than six weeks after being arrested for her political speech. A federal judge ordered Ã–ztÃ¼rk's release pending a decision on her claim that she was illegally detained following an op-ed she co-wrote criticizing her universityâ€™s response to Israel and the war in Gaza. She maintains her faith in the American justice system and is supported by Senator Ed Markey.</p>
