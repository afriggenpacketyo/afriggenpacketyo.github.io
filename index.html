          <p>India's foreign ministry has responded to threats of increased tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump by highlighting that it only began significant Russian oil imports after traditional supplies were diverted to Europe post-2022. The ministry asserted it was being unfairly "targeted," pointing out that both the U.S. and E.U. maintain substantial trade with Russia, which is not driven by the same vital national needs as India's energy imports. This defense comes after Trump accused India of profiting from discounted Russian oil and threatened to impose steeper duties on Indian exports. The article notes that U.S. officials had previously encouraged India's purchases to stabilize global energy markets.</p>

          <p>Recovery and clean-up operations are ongoing across Scotland after Storm Floris caused significant travel disruption and power outages. Gusts reaching up to 90mph left approximately 50,000 homes without electricity, with Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks working to restore service. Network Rail is clearing tracks after reporting 119 incidents, including numerous fallen trees, which will continue to affect some train services. The Scottish government held an emergency meeting, advising against travel until the situation stabilizes, while event cancellations included the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo and some Edinburgh Fringe Festival shows. The storm has been described as the most damaging summer storm in recent memory.</p>

          <p>More than 40 individuals were arrested during a protest in New York City on Monday evening against the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Organized by the Jewish-American group IfNotNow, hundreds of demonstrators gathered to demand an end to the violence and call for the Trump administration to pressure Israel to allow more humanitarian aid into the territory. Speakers, including NYC Comptroller Brad Lander, framed their opposition to Israel's actions as a moral imperative rooted in their Jewish faith. The protest moved from Columbus Circle to the Trump International hotel, where demonstrators blocked the street, leading to arrests by the NYPD for civil disobedience.</p>

          <p>A large wildfire, named the Gifford fire, is burning through Los Padres National Forest in central California, having scorched over 72,000 acres and threatening more than 450 structures. The blaze, which is only 5% contained, has prompted evacuation orders in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. At least three injuries have been reported, including a motorist who suffered burns and two contract workers whose vehicle overturned. Over 1,000 firefighters are battling the flames in difficult, rugged terrain, with their efforts complicated by smoke and the forecast of hotter, drier weather expected to fuel the fire's growth.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. border agents have been instructed to stop deportations under President Trump's asylum ban following a federal appeals court ruling. The court determined that while the government can pause access to the asylum system, it cannot ignore laws protecting migrants from being returned to countries where they face persecution or torture. This decision effectively lifts a sweeping policy that had suspended the right to claim asylum for those entering the U.S. illegally, a measure the administration credited for a record drop in migrant apprehensions. Migrants will now be processed under standard immigration law, which allows for asylum claims, though the administration may appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has directed a federal prosecutor to present evidence to a grand jury regarding the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation. This move follows claims by President Trump and his allies that the probe was a politically motivated conspiracy, or "Russiagate," designed to undermine his presidency. The order comes after the Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, declassified a report accusing the Obama administration of politicizing intelligence. While it remains unclear who might be charged or with what crimes, this development escalates a long-standing political battle over the legitimacy of the 2016 election interference investigation.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has ordered the civil arrest of Democratic state lawmakers who left Texas to prevent a vote on a Republican-drawn congressional redistricting map. By leaving the state, the Democrats broke the legislative quorum, halting proceedings on a bill that would create five new GOP-leaning districts. In response, the Republican-led House voted to issue civil arrest warrants to compel their return, an order Abbott directed state law enforcement to carry out. Democrats argue their quorum break is a constitutionally protected tool to fight against what they call an authoritarian move to silence voters, while Republicans accuse them of dereliction of duty.</p>

          <p>Prominent market analyst Tom Lee of Fundstrat suggests that any market selloff in August will likely be temporary, advising investors to "buy the dip." He argues that recent economic data, including a weaker-than-expected July jobs report, is solid yet soft enough to prompt the Federal Reserve to implement "insurance" interest rate cuts. Despite concerns over rising inflation and unemployment sparking stagflation fears, market optimism is growing for a rate cut at the September FOMC meeting. Lee's firm believes that this potential for lower lending rates will likely outweigh short-term economic worries for the stock market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A declining number of volunteer firefighters across the U.S. is straining emergency services and could force more communities to switch to costly paid departments. Volunteers constitute nearly 70% of the nation's fire crews and save taxpayers an estimated $46.9 billion annually, but their numbers dropped by over 20% between 1985 and 2020 while emergency calls tripled. This shortage creates resource gaps that can delay response times and lead to burnout among remaining volunteers. Lawmakers are considering incentives like student loan forgiveness to boost recruitment, as the alternative for many towns is a significant increase in local taxes to fund professional firehouses.</p>

The justice cited an incident where Bolsonaro addressed supporters via a phone call at a rally, which was then posted online by his son. Bolsonaro's legal team denies any breach and plans to appeal the ruling, which also prohibits him from receiving most visitors and using a phone.</p>

The president contrasted the campaign with what he termed "woke" advertising from other brands, celebrating Sweeney as a "registered Republican."

However, the report also suggests a blockade would not be a low-risk option for Beijing.

This led to a 12% annual jump in incidence from 2019 to 2022, suggesting that first-time screenings are successfully detecting cancers earlier.

The letter suggests that a viable Palestinian state would need to recognize Israel and ensure its security, including the disarmament of Hamas. This move comes as several key U.S. allies have recently pledged to recognize Palestinian statehood, though the Trump administration has stated it views such a step as "rewarding Hamas."</p>

          <p>Firefighters on Maui successfully battled a brush fire that broke out in Ka'anapali, just a few miles north of where devastating wildfires occurred nearly two years ago. The fire, which started near an old Sugar Cane Train warehouse, prompted the closure of both lanes of the Honoapiʻilani Highway due to smoke and firefighting efforts. The Maui County Fire Department reported that the blaze was slowly being contained and asked motorists to avoid the area. The incident occurred near the location of the 2023 Lahaina fires, which were among the deadliest in U.S. history, claiming over 100 lives and destroying thousands of homes.</p>

The 44-year-old was found guilty of sexually assaulting two men and has refused to resign from his position as the independent member for Kiama. In response, the NSW House of Representatives planned to expel him, but Ward's lawyers are seeking a Supreme Court injunction to block the move. NSW Premier Chris Minns has condemned the situation as "unconscionable," urging Ward to step down as he continues to be paid by taxpayers while incarcerated.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied Sean “Diddy” Combs’ request for release on bail, ordering him to remain in custody at the Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center until his sentencing on October 3. Combs was convicted on two prostitution-related charges, though he was cleared of racketeering and sex trafficking, and faces up to 10 years in prison for each count. The judge was not convinced by arguments that Combs was not a flight risk or that he faced significant danger at the facility. The decision came despite a letter of support from one of the trial's victims, who claimed Combs had made efforts to change.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer stated that the stock market's strong rebound on Monday was driven by the impressive earnings and performance of the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks. After a weak jobs report caused a dip on Friday, the major indexes surged, with Cramer attributing the resilience to the strength of companies like Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet. He highlighted Microsoft's "flawless" quarter, Meta's massive user base, and Alphabet's broad success across its platforms. Cramer argued that these cash-rich, dominant companies are difficult to beat, providing a solid foundation for the market even amidst economic uncertainty and potential Fed rate cuts.

Emma Ambler has campaigned for stricter laws since her sister's family was killed in 2020 by her partner, who had lied on his shotgun application. The new rules, effective August 5, require two character references for shotgun applications instead of one and mandate that police speak with partners to identify signs of domestic abuse. The Home Office said the changes aim to ensure only those meeting the highest safety standards can access firearms.</p>
