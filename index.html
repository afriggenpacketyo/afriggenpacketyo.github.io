          <p>A new report from House Republicans identifies approximately 50 US-China joint educational programs as "high-risk" and demands their termination. The report flags partnerships with institutions like New York University and Johns Hopkins, citing concerns that they could advance Beijing's military and technological ambitions. Factors contributing to the high-risk designation include connections to China's defense sector or intelligence end-uses. This move represents a significant escalation in the political campaign to curb academic collaboration between the two nations, framing it as a matter of national security.</p>

          <p>An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent shot and killed Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez in Franklin Park, Illinois, during what officials described as a targeted vehicle stop. According to the Department of Homeland Security, Villegas-Gonzalez resisted arrest and attempted to drive into the agents, striking and dragging one officer who then opened fire. The incident, part of a broader enforcement operation, has drawn calls for transparency from Illinois officials and scrutiny from the community. The FBI is assisting in the investigation into the fatal encounter.</p>

          <p>Tiana Mangakahia, a celebrated former Syracuse women's basketball player, has died at the age of 30 following a prolonged battle with breast cancer. Initially diagnosed in 2019, she underwent extensive treatment before returning to play for Syracuse and later professionally in Russia, France, and Australia. A second diagnosis forced her to transition into coaching, where she continued to be an inspirational figure in the sport. Basketball Australia and Syracuse Athletics mourned her passing, remembering her for her exceptional courage, strength, and resilience both on and off the court.</p>

          <p>The sequel to the iconic 1984 mockumentary, titled "Spinal Tap II: The End Continues," reunites the original cast for one last concert but struggles to recapture the magic of its predecessor. The film sees Nigel Tufnel, David St. Hubbins, and Derek Smalls brought back together, yet the plot feels more like a feature-length outtake reel than a fresh comedic take. While offering some smiles for long-time fans, the review suggests that the reliance on celebrity cameos dilutes the satirical tension that made the original a classic. The sequel is seen as a pleasant but ultimately unnecessary nostalgia trip.</p>

Cook highlighted the superior quality and durability of Corning's "ceramic shield" technology as a key factor in the decision to deepen the partnership. The major investment is expected to triple the plant's production and increase its workforce by 50%, reinforcing the facility as a world-leading site for specialized glass manufacturing.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Uber, alleging widespread and routine discrimination against passengers with disabilities. The suit claims that drivers for the ride-hailing giant have frequently refused service to individuals with service animals, illegally charged cleaning fees, and failed to accommodate mobility devices. According to the lawsuit, these actions have caused disabled individuals to miss appointments and be stranded. While Uber states that its policies prohibit such discrimination and that it takes action against violations, the government is seeking $125 million for affected individuals.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have passed Senate Bill 79, a significant piece of legislation designed to address the state's housing crisis by overriding local zoning laws. The bill mandates the construction of higher-density housing, with buildings up to nine stories tall, near major transit corridors like train stations and bus routes. Proponents, including Sen. Scott Wiener, argue the measure is crucial for increasing housing supply and affordability, while critics and some local officials call it a state overreach that strips communities of control. The bill, which gained momentum after securing support from a major construction labor union, now awaits Governor Gavin Newsom's signature.</p>

The author suggests that Cox's appeals for Americans to "disagree better" and log off social media almost seemed directed at Trump and his supporters.

          <p>The 33-hour manhunt for the suspect in Charlie Kirk's assassination concluded with the arrest of 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, an announcement first made public by President Trump on a morning TV show. Robinson was taken into custody after his father reportedly recognized him from FBI photos and facilitated his surrender with the help of a youth pastor. According to Utah's governor, surveillance footage tracked the suspect's movements on campus, and messages on the Discord app referenced the rifle used in the attack. The recovered weapon and bullet casings were found to have politically charged inscriptions engraved on them.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has placed an agent, Anthony Pough, on administrative leave and revoked his security clearance after he made a negative post on Facebook about the recently assassinated Charlie Kirk. In the post, Pough wrote that Kirk had "spewed hate and racism" and suggested his death was a result of karma. Secret Service Director Sean Curran issued a memo reminding all employees of their duty to operate without political bias and stating that such public actions compromise the trust essential to their mission. An investigation into the agent's conduct has been launched.</p>

          <p>Stellantis's Ram brand has officially canceled the development of its all-electric Ram 1500 pickup truck, attributing the decision to slowing consumer demand for battery electric vehicles in North America. The project had already faced multiple delays from its original 2024 launch target. Instead of a fully electric model, the company will now focus on launching an extended-range electric truck, the Ram 1500 REV, which includes a gasoline engine that acts as a generator. This strategic shift reflects a broader reassessment of EV product strategy within Stellantis under its new leadership.</p>

          <p>A significant water supply failure at the U.S. naval base in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, has forced the relocation of migrants and raised further doubts about the facility's capacity to handle large populations. A disruption to an underwater pipeline in late August cut off water to the Migrant Operations Center, requiring migrants to be moved to a different part of the base. The incident underscores concerns from critics who argue the base's infrastructure is inadequate for the 30,000 migrants the Trump administration intends to send there. Water is not expected to be fully restored for at least another week.</p>

Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell stated that Kalshi is offering wagers on sports outcomes under the guise of "events contracts." The state is seeking a court order to halt these activities. Kalshi has previously argued that its regulation by the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission supersedes state-level rules, setting the stage for a legal battle over jurisdictional authority.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the political response to Charlie Kirk's murder, noting that leading Democrats from across the party's ideological spectrum immediately and strongly condemned the attack. Despite this unified condemnation, some influential voices on the right have focused on finding and amplifying isolated social media posts from private citizens celebrating the killing to suggest widespread support on the left. The author argues this narrative is necessary to justify their own political rhetoric. The piece contrasts the Democratic Party's marginalization of violent sentiment with President Trump's rhetoric, which has been seen as excusing right-wing radicalism.</p>

          <p>This article examines the significant and lasting influence of the late Charlie Kirk on Gen Z, arguing he was a generational figure who redefined conservatism for many young people. Kirk's organization, Turning Point USA, transformed the landscape of campus politics by making right-wing activism culturally relevant and creating a vast network for young conservatives. He mastered the new media ecosystem, using viral debate clips and a confrontational style to build a powerful personal brand that resonated with a generation skeptical of established institutions. His approach tapped into a desire for open debate, making him a pivotal, if polarizing, force in youth politics.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is urgently appealing a court ruling that blocked the president from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. In a filing, the Justice Department asked a federal appeals court to allow Cook's removal before the Federal Open Market Committee's crucial interest rate meeting next week. The administration argues the president has broad discretion to remove officials "for cause," citing allegations of mortgage fraud against Cook, which she denies. Cook's attorneys argue her removal would disrupt the Fed's stability and potentially impact global markets, calling the government's request an unwarranted disruption. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the arrest of a suspect in the assassination of Charlie Kirk, this article explores the broader trend of rising political violence in America. Experts note that such violence often doesn't follow simple left-right political lines, but is instead frequently committed by individuals influenced by a mixture of extremist ideologies or a desire for violence itself. In the current climate of intense partisanship and division, these acts are often immediately interpreted through a political lens, with different sides projecting their own beliefs onto the situation. The data shows a clear increase in violent political attacks since 2016.</p>

The article highlights how Brazil's judicial system held Bolsonaro accountable, a process the author suggests serves as a potent example for the United States. It also criticizes President Trump's attempt to intervene in the case by threatening Brazil with tariffs, framing it as a departure from democratic principles.</p>

          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby has publicly predicted the demise of Spirit Airlines, stating that the ultra-low-cost carrier is destined to go out of business. Speaking at an industry conference, Kirby claimed the discount airline model, which relies on low base fares and numerous additional fees, is fundamentally broken and unsustainable because customers dislike it. Spirit, which recently filed for bankruptcy for the second time in a year, has been struggling with weak demand and high costs. The pointed comments highlight the intense competition and shifting dynamics within the U.S. airline industry.</p>
