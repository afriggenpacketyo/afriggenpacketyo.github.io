          <p>A retired judge, Deborah Taylor, will lead a public inquiry into the Nottingham attacks, where three people were fatally stabbed by Valdo Calocane in June 2023. The inquiry aims to address criticisms from the victims' families regarding the authorities' handling of the case. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood assured Parliament that the probe would be thorough and conducted swiftly, with the power to compel witnesses. The inquiry follows reviews into mental health services and the Crown Prosecution Service's handling of Calocane's case, aiming to provide answers, truth, justice, and accountability for the victims' families. </p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio is proposing a reorganization of the State Department that would involve shuttering 132 agency offices and eliminating roughly 700 D.C.-based civil and foreign service positions. The proposal includes merging bureaus, reducing the scope of others, and eliminating several special envoys and their offices. A senior State Department official stated that no layoffs are expected immediately, and leaders will have 30 days to analyze and implement the plan. The stated goal is to streamline operations and reduce bureaucracy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Data indicates a steep drop in Chinese freight vessel traffic to the U.S. ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, attributed to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods and recession fears. The number of freight vessels leaving China for these ports is down 29% week-over-week and 44% year-over-year. This slowdown is impacting ground transport linked to the ports, with a significant drop in available truck loads. However, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has suggested that a trade deal between the U.S. and China is still possible.</p>

          <p>The death of Freddie Gray in April 2015, while in police custody, triggered seismic events in Baltimore, leading to widespread protests and unrest. Gray's life, marked by poverty and lead poisoning, culminated in his arrest for making eye contact with police. The aftermath included a $6.4 million settlement for Gray's family, criminal charges against six officers (none of whom were convicted), police reform mandates, and a consent decree with the federal government. While some promises remain unfulfilled, Gray's legacy includes police reform, body cameras, and reduced police violence, though some residents feel that promises of change remain unfulfilled.</p>

          <p>The United Nations commemorated Yom HaShoah with an event that omitted any mention of Israel and featured a "Holocaust" exhibit that removed references to Israel's connection to the Holocaust. Critics argue this is part of a broader agenda to equate the Holocaust with the experiences of Palestinian Arabs and redefine the Holocaust itself. The UN's exhibit also replaced graphic images of Jewish suffering with more generic displays about hatred and prejudice. Critics argue that this revisionism undermines the understanding of antisemitism and the unique depravity of Nazi treatment of Jews.</p>

          <p>Explosions occurred at a Russian ammunition depot east of Moscow, leading to a state of emergency and the evacuation of nearby residents. Russia's defense ministry attributed the incident to a fire caused by a "violation of safety requirements when working with explosive materials." The site, a key ammunition storage facility for the Russian army, experienced a raging blaze and mushroom clouds from the explosions. While no casualties were reported, a commission has been established to investigate the incident, and local authorities have warned against sharing unofficial information.</p>

The survey found a significant divide along party lines, with Democrats holding strongly negative views of Musk while Republicans are more positive.
