        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene in a legal battle over its policy on gender markers for passports. This policy mandates that passports reflect a person's "biological sex at birth" and eliminates the use of an "X" marker for nonbinary individuals. A lower court had issued an injunction against the policy, finding it was likely motivated by animus toward transgender people and violated their right to equal protection. The administration argues the policy is lawful and necessary for foreign policy and to reflect what it terms "scientific reality."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the monthly costs for Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) have become more affordable for homeowners. The article breaks down the potential monthly payments for a $50,000 HELOC, showing a significant decrease compared to costs from previous months and the prior year. As HELOCs have variable rates, they adjust with the Fed's decisions, making them a cheaper borrowing option compared to credit cards or fixed-rate home equity loans in the current climate.

          <p>A UK cabinet minister has dismissed President Donald Trump's suggestion that the British military should be used to address illegal migration across the English Channel. During a state visit, Trump advocated for using military force to stop crossings, but UK Trade Secretary Peter Kyle stated that this responsibility lies with the UK Border Force. Kyle emphasized that the military's primary focus is on national defense and global security issues, although a functional relationship with the Border Force already exists for support if needed.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates have fallen to a three-year low, providing relief for homebuyers and prompting a surge in refinance applications. Experts suggest that rates could fall further by the end of 2025, potentially into the high 5% range, if the Federal Reserve enacts more anticipated rate cuts and inflation continues to ease. However, the article cautions that persistent economic concerns could limit how low rates can go, advising borrowers to weigh the benefits of locking in current rates against the risk of waiting.

          <p>An Eritrean man has been returned to France from the UK under a new bilateral migration deal after the government won a last-minute court challenge to his removal. This marks a significant legal victory for the government's strategy to deter Channel crossings. The "one in, one out" pilot scheme involves the UK returning a migrant to France in exchange for accepting another migrant from France who has a strong case for asylum in the UK, with the first such arrival expected soon.</p>

          <h2>Investigation Reveals Walmart's Online Marketplace Growth Fueled by Lax Vetting, Leading to Counterfeits</h2>

          <p>An investigation has found that Walmart's push to rapidly expand its online marketplace involved relaxing its vetting process for third-party sellers, which led to a significant problem with counterfeit and fraudulent goods. The report details how shoppers received fake products and how some sellers used the stolen identities of legitimate businesses to open accounts on the platform. In the wake of these findings, Walmart has reportedly begun to tighten its verification requirements for sellers in certain product categories, such as health and beauty.</p>

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook has clarified that the recent price increase for the new iPhone 17 Pro is not a result of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. He explained that Apple has proactively shifted its supply chain to countries like India and Vietnam to mitigate the financial impact of the tariffs. Cook's comments address widespread speculation that the price hikes were a direct consequence of the ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China.</p>

          <p>The Treasury Department and IRS have issued proposed regulations clarifying President Trump's "no tax on tips" law, which allows certain workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually. The new guidance specifies that workers in certain professional fields, such as healthcare and legal services, are not eligible for the tax break. Additionally, the rules confirm that automatic or mandatory gratuities do not qualify as tips because they are not given voluntarily by the customer. (not investment advice)</p>

The legislation proposes that adults with a prognosis of six months or less to live could apply for an assisted death, subject to approval from doctors and a special panel. To address significant concerns from opponents, a new committee will be formed to provide additional scrutiny of the bill's details.</p>

          <p>President Trump's 2026 budget proposal includes the elimination of all funding for the Migrant Education Program (MEP), a nearly 60-year-old federal initiative that supports the children of seasonal farm workers.
