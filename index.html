          <p>Nancy Pexton, 69, has been charged with the murder of her 69-year-old sister, Jennifer Abbott, also known as Sarah Steinberg, who was found stabbed to death in her Camden flat. Abbott was discovered by her niece and neighbors after family members had not heard from her for several days, prompting them to break down her door. A post-mortem examination revealed that Abbott's cause of death was sharp force trauma. Pexton appeared in Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court, confirming her name and date of birth during a brief hearing. The case is centered around a missing Rolex watch.</p>

Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko instructed the Ministry of Sports to cancel the training, stating it would now take place in Dakar. Reports indicate that five players and 13 officials were denied visas, preventing them from joining other team members and their coach already in the US for AfroBasket tournament preparations. The US State Department declined to comment on individual cases, citing confidentiality laws, but the visa refusals come amid reports of potential new travel restrictions on 25 more African countries, including Senegal.</p>

The bill, which seeks to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, has now moved to the House of Representatives. Circle's stock has risen dramatically since its initial public offering on June 5, driven by growing investor interest in stablecoins. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to another asset, typically the U.S. dollar, and are gaining traction among banks and payment firms due to their potential for faster and cheaper payments.

          <p>The band Haim's new album, "I Quit," explores themes of unraveling commitments and breakups, tailored for a generation wary of marriage. The album is influenced by Fleetwood Mac and Heart, but with a more nonchalant approach. The sisters were each single while recording, and the album title conveys liberation, suggesting that an exit can also be an entrance. The music is described as unshackled, with songs delving into post-breakup grief, anger, and horniness, while also capturing the drama of experiencing life as a purely internal, self-directed struggle.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller indicated that the central bank could consider cutting interest rates as early as July, as he does not anticipate tariffs significantly boosting inflation. Waller stated that the Fed should move slowly but begin easing to avoid potential labor market slowdown. His comments came after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted to hold interest rates steady for the fourth consecutive time. While the FOMC voted unanimously to hold rates, individual expectations for future rates are dispersed, reflecting uncertainty among policymakers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study published in Jama Pediatrics indicates that stricter state gun control laws are associated with a relative decrease in firearm deaths among children aged up to 17. The research divided states into categories based on the strength of their gun control measures and analyzed pediatric firearm death rates over a 12-year period. States with more permissive gun laws saw a notable increase in children's deaths from gun violence, while states with stricter laws experienced stagnant or declining rates. Experts emphasize the need for lawmakers to prioritize measures such as universal background checks and safe-storage regulations to protect children.</p>

          <p>For half a year, a heated debate has raged over whether US President Donald Trump ’s return to office would push Europe and China closer together. Pragmatists, realpolitikers and Beijing’s allies argued that the EU could not afford a trade war with both of the world’s largest economies while footing the bill for a hot war in Ukraine. For months, EU leaders fuelled the speculation by voicing openness to deeper trade ties with Beijing, in a dramatic rhetorical shift from the previous three years of hostilities. But the debate appears to have been settled this week with a resounding “no”.</p>

The Asian tiger mosquito, known for transmitting diseases like dengue and Zika, is expanding its range, while the Asian hornet preys on crucial pollinators, including honeybees.

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump "likely acted within his authority" in federalizing the California National Guard amidst protests over immigration raids. The court indefinitely blocked a lower court order that would have returned control of the guard to the governor. The judges cited acts of violence during the protests as justification for the federalization. The ruling allows the Trump administration to retain control of the guard as the case proceeds through the courts.</p>

Members of Parliament voted to change abortion legislation, aiming to prevent the prosecution of women in England and Wales for ending their pregnancies. Additionally, the House of Commons backed a change in the law to allow assisted dying, a move likened to historical social changes such as the Abortion Act of 1967 and the decriminalization of homosexuality. While the assisted dying vote still needs approval from the House of Lords, it is now considered likely to pass.</p>

          <p>A recent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report warns that low-income children and families would be significantly impacted by Republican's One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The bill, intended to fund an extension of the 2017 Trump tax cuts, proposes changes to key social safety net programs like Medicaid, CHIP, and SNAP. These changes could lead to reduced healthcare access and food assistance for millions of children. While Republicans argue the bill protects and strengthens Medicaid, CBO estimates it would cut federal spending on Medicaid by roughly $800 billion over the next decade.</p>
