          <p>Comedian Jimmy Kimmel made an emotional return to his late-night show, addressing the controversy surrounding his comments on the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. He clarified it was never his intention to make light of the tragedy and used his monologue to criticize what he termed "anti-American" threats to free speech, specifically calling out the FCC chairman and President Trump. The broadcast was not aired by some ABC affiliates, including those owned by Nexstar and Sinclair, highlighting the ongoing tensions between media outlets and political figures over controversial content.</p>

          <p>With the COP30 climate summit approaching, only a fraction of nations have submitted their updated 2035 climate goals, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs), representing just 24% of global emissions. Major emitters like China, the EU, and India are still pending, creating uncertainty about global progress toward the Paris Agreement's temperature targets. While the UK has submitted an ambitious goal, the EU has only issued a statement of intent, and the US has formally withdrawn from the agreement under President Trump, complicating international climate action efforts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant reversal of his previous stance, U.S. President Donald Trump stated that Ukraine could win back all of its territory from Russia, including its original pre-war borders. He attributed this change to Russia's economic troubles, calling the nation a "paper tiger" and urging Ukraine to act with support from Europe and NATO. This new position emerged following discussions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the UN, who hailed the development as a "big shift" and a positive signal of U.S. support.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of European defense companies experienced a significant rally following U.S. President Donald Trump's unexpected shift in policy towards the war in Ukraine. After Trump declared that Ukraine could win back all its territory with NATO support, the Stoxx Europe Aerospace and Defense Index gained 1.4%, with firms like Sweden's Saab and Germany's Hensoldt rising by 5%. The market reaction reflects investor belief that the change in U.S. rhetoric could lead to prolonged or increased military support and spending in the region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's home secretary has initiated an urgent review into the high cost of using taxis to transport asylum seekers to appointments following a BBC investigation. The report found that some individuals were being taken on long-distance journeys costing hundreds of pounds, such as a £600 trip for a doctor's visit. While asylum seekers receive a weekly bus pass, other necessary travel is often covered by taxis, but the Home Office stated it does not track the total expenditure, prompting calls for greater oversight and accountability.</p>

          <p>England rugby centre Megan Jones has become one of the standout players at the World Cup, her on-field success fueled by immense personal tragedy. Jones lost both of her parents within four months last year; her father died of cancer, and her mother, who struggled with alcoholism, passed away shortly after. Jones has channeled her grief into her performance, describing the rugby pitch as her "safe haven" and playing with a new fearlessness born from perspective, which has elevated her game to an elite level.</p>

          <p>The White House has launched an investigation into whether an escalator malfunction during President Trump's visit to the United Nations was an intentional act of sabotage. The moving stairway stopped abruptly while Trump and the First Lady were on it, an incident the president later referenced in his speech along with a faulty teleprompter. A UN spokesperson explained that a safety mechanism was likely triggered accidentally by a videographer, but the White House press secretary vowed to hold any responsible staff accountable for the mishap.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman addressed concerns about the company's massive infrastructure investment, which totals approximately $850 billion for a 17-gigawatt supercomputing buildout with partners like Oracle and Nvidia. Standing at a future data center site in Texas, Altman acknowledged public worry but insisted the spending is necessary to meet the soaring demand for AI, highlighting ChatGPT's tenfold usage increase. He framed the historic investment as essential for delivering the next generation of AI, stating that the biggest bottleneck for the technology is not chips or money, but electricity.

          <p>Shohei Ohtani pitched a season-high six shutout innings in a masterful performance against the Arizona Diamondbacks, but the Los Angeles Dodgers ultimately lost 5-4 due to another bullpen collapse. After Ohtani exited with a 4-0 lead, rookie relievers allowed three runs, and closer Tanner Scott gave up two more in the ninth for his 10th blown save of the season. The loss highlights the team's critical weakness in its relief pitching, overshadowing Ohtani's excellent start and raising serious concerns as the team heads toward the postseason.</p>

The court determined the blaze was an "anticipated disaster," finding that CEO Park Soon-kwan and other executives failed to implement proper safety measures or adequately train workers. This marks the longest sentence imposed under the country's industrial safety law, which holds business owners accountable for fatal workplace incidents.</p>

          <p>Super Typhoon Ragasa has caused widespread devastation in East Asia, killing at least 14 people and leaving over 150 missing in eastern Taiwan after triggering a lake burst that sent mud and water through Guangfu township.

          <p>The city of Datong in northern China successfully avoided disaster during heavy summer rains, a success attributed to a major infrastructure project completed over 15 years ago. Former mayor Geng Yanbo led an initiative to widen the city's main river and reinforce its banks, a move that was controversial at the time but is now credited with saving the city from severe flooding. Economists suggest that such long-term investments in urban resilience not only protect cities but can also serve as effective short-term economic stimuli.</p>

While one of its sites will reopen, the original, 99-year-old location was too damaged to resume operations; a memorial for the victims will be built on the grounds.</p>
