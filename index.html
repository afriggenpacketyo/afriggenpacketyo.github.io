          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that the U.S. government expects an equity stake in Intel in return for CHIPS Act funds, converting previously committed grants into non-voting equity under the Trump administration. This initiative aims to ensure domestic semiconductor production and reduce reliance on foreign manufacturers, aligning with efforts to reshore U.S. manufacturing. Intel's shares rose following the news, despite the company's recent struggles in the AI chip market and a slowdown in its Ohio factory construction. The administration seeks to ensure taxpayer benefit from such investments, potentially pursuing similar arrangements with other CHIPS recipients. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Silicon Valley is seeing a rise in "zombie startups" as major tech companies like Google, Meta, and Microsoft acquire AI talent through high-priced licensing deals rather than full acquisitions. This practice, often seen as a workaround to antitrust scrutiny, leaves remaining employees and investors in limbo, with significant cash flowing primarily to founders and top engineers. Examples include Windsurf, whose founders joined Google, and Scale AI, which saw layoffs after a Meta investment. Critics argue this trend stifles innovation and raises concerns about market consolidation, despite some companies maintaining operations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A California family raising twin boys found a "surrogate grandmother," Janet Firestein Daw, through a Facebook group called Surrogate Grandparents USA. The family, lacking active grandparents, sought a "village" for their children. Janet, who desired grandchildren, connected with them and became an integral part of their lives, affectionately known as "Nana J." This heartwarming arrangement provides mutual fulfillment, with Janet considering the boys her own, even after her biological child had a baby. The growing Facebook group facilitates these unconventional family bonds, emphasizing discretion and safety.</p>

          <p>An Israeli government official, Tom Artiom Alexandrovich, a division head at the Israel National Cyber Directorate, was arrested in Las Vegas for allegedly soliciting a minor. He believed he was meeting a 15-year-old girl for sexual contact and brought a condom to the rendezvous. The State Department denied any U.S. government intervention in his release after bond was posted, countering speculation, including from Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. Alexandrovich has since returned to Israel, and his LinkedIn page has been deleted, while Israeli media reported his leave from the Cyber Directorate.</p>

          <p>The PGA Tour will return to Donald Trump’s Blue Monster course at Trump National Doral in Miami in 2026 for the Miami Championship, ending a decade-long absence. The WGC-Cadillac Championship was moved from Doral in 2016 due to sponsorship issues, though it coincided with Trump’s political rise. This $20 million Signature Event marks Doral's 56th time hosting a Tour event and signifies a new era for the PGA Tour, expanding its roster of high-profile events. The return is part of the Tour's evolution and comes after Doral became a regular site for the LIV Golf series.</p>

          <p>Israel is demanding the release of all 50 hostages held in Gaza, casting doubt on a new 60-day ceasefire proposal agreed to by Hamas. While Qatar stated the proposal is "almost identical" to a previously accepted U.S. plan, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not publicly commented, emphasizing Hamas is "under immense pressure." The proposal would see a phased release of hostages and prisoners, but Israel insists on the full release of all captives. This comes as Netanyahu faces pressure from both far-right coalition partners to continue the war and families of hostages to secure a deal.</p>

          <p>This column critically assesses former President Trump's relationship with Vladimir Putin, arguing that it yields no tangible benefits for the U.S. but comes at a significant cost to Ukraine. The author highlights Trump's perceived deference to Putin during their Alaska summit, where the former U.S. president reportedly softened his stance on sanctions and suggested Ukraine cede territory. The article contends that Putin greatly benefits from this dynamic, gaining time to regroup and acquire land without full military conquest, while Trump's claims about preventing the Ukraine invasion are undermined by ongoing Russian aggression. The piece underscores concerns about the implications for U.S. foreign policy.</p>

          <p>Twenty states and the District of Columbia have sued the Justice Department, challenging a new Trump administration rule that ties billions in federal crime victim grants to immigration enforcement. The lawsuit argues that this condition, which requires compliance with federal immigration law and access for DHS agents, is illegal and forces states into an untenable position. Primarily Democratic states, which collectively receive over $500 million annually, contend the rule undermines trust between law enforcement and immigrant communities. They seek an urgent block on the new rules, fearing forfeiture of critical resources for vulnerable crime victims.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that interviews for the next Federal Reserve chair will commence after Labor Day, with a list of 11 strong candidates. The White House is keen to accelerate the selection process, pushing for interest rate cuts to stimulate the U.S. housing market. Bessent believes lower rates could facilitate a boom in home building, ultimately helping to keep prices down. While the Fed's next policy meeting is in September, current Chair Jerome Powell is expected to deliver his final keynote address at the Jackson Hole symposium, potentially signaling the Fed's stance on future rate decisions.

          <p>This article provides an overview of current Certificate of Deposit (CD) interest rates, highlighting their appeal as safe investments with returns often exceeding inflation. It notes that while national average rates are lower, online banks offer competitive rates, with short-term CDs (six months to one year) currently yielding higher returns due to an inverted yield curve. Strategies for securing good rates include looking at online banks and considering a "CD laddering" approach to balance high short-term rates with long-term savings. CDs offer predictability and FDIC/NCUA insurance, making them a secure savings option. (not investment advice)</p>
