          <p>A new Senate committee report reveals that the U.S. Secret Service denied or failed to fulfill at least ten requests for additional security resources for Donald Trump's 2024 campaign prior to the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. The report, from the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, specifies that requests for assets like counter-snipers and enhanced counter-drone systems were not met. The investigation accuses former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle of providing false testimony to Congress regarding these denials. The findings point to a pattern of communication failures and negligence within the agency.</p>

          <p>Barbara Rae-Venter, a retiree who began researching her family tree as a hobby, has become a key figure in forensic science by pioneering the use of genetic genealogy to solve crimes. Her work was instrumental in identifying and capturing the notorious Golden State Killer in California. Since that breakthrough, Rae-Venter has partnered with investigators on numerous cold cases, including the recent solving of a nearly three-decade-old sexual assault case in Ohio. Her methods involve using public DNA databases to build family trees of unknown suspects, providing crucial leads for law enforcement.</p>

These services aim to boost confidence for those who struggle with writing or social anxiety. While some users find it a helpful way to break the ice, the trend raises questions about authenticity and the risk of misrepresenting oneself in the search for a connection.</p>

          <p>Former acting ICE director Tom Homan has defended the new "Alligator Alcatraz" detention center in Florida against criticism from lawmakers regarding its conditions and location. Homan argued that the facility meets all U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement standards, which he described as the highest in the industry. He contrasted the lawmakers' complaints with what he termed their silence on the high number of migrant deaths and child trafficking incidents that occurred during the previous administration. Homan asserted that critics were complicit in past border crises by not advocating for stronger security measures.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing the last day of a significant heatwave, with temperatures reaching 31.2C in Scotland on Sunday. Amber heat health alerts remain in effect for central and southern England, but are expected to end Monday as a cooler front moves in, bringing heavy rain to many areas. The intense heat led to disruptions, including train cancellations, and prompted warnings about wildfire risks and water safety.

          <p>Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal are spearheading a bipartisan effort to impose severe new sanctions on Russia and any countries that support its war effort in Ukraine. The proposed legislation, which has garnered 85 co-sponsors, would grant the president the authority to levy tariffs up to 500% on nations like China, India, and Brazil that purchase Russian oil. The senators described the package as a "sledgehammer" designed to cripple Vladimir Putin's war machine by targeting its financial lifelines.

          <p>Muhammadu Buhari, the former president of Nigeria, has passed away in London at the age of 82 following a prolonged illness. A presidential spokesperson confirmed his death on Sunday. Buhari's tenure as leader was marked by two distinct periods: first as a military ruler in the 1980s and later as a democratically elected president from 2015 to 2023. His presidency was often shadowed by concerns and secrecy surrounding his health, which required long absences for medical treatment in the UK.

The Washington Democrat, who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, is pushing for a major investment to upgrade forecasting infrastructure, including Doppler radar and data analytics at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Cantwell argued that such federal investments can save lives by providing more advanced warnings.

          <p>Despite the administration's focus on deporting dangerous criminals, recent government data indicates that the majority of individuals detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have no criminal convictions. According to ICE's own statistics from late June, over 71% of the nearly 58,000 people in detention had no criminal record. Immigration policy experts point to a significant disconnect between the rhetoric of targeting "the worst of the worst" and the reality of enforcement actions, which overwhelmingly affect those without criminal histories. The data suggests a recent surge in arrests has disproportionately increased the number of non-criminal detainees.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in the al-Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza has killed ten people, including six children, who were waiting to collect water, according to local emergency officials. Eyewitnesses reported that a drone fired a missile into the crowd. The Israeli military acknowledged the incident, stating that a "technical error" caused a munition intended for a militant target to miss its mark, and expressed regret for any harm to uninvolved civilians. The strike comes amid an escalation of Israeli attacks across Gaza and adds to a growing number of aid-related deaths documented by humanitarian groups.</p>

          <p>Search and recovery operations for victims of the catastrophic July 4 floods in Kerr County, Texas, were suspended Sunday due to a new flood threat. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning as heavy rains hit the same area where the Guadalupe River's surge killed at least 129 people. Officials, concerned about the safety of rescue crews, evacuated the river corridor until the danger passed. More than 160 people remain missing, and the renewed flooding complicates the massive, ongoing effort to locate them amidst the debris and difficult terrain.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's security agency, the SBU, announced that it has killed the Russian agents believed to be responsible for the assassination of a senior SBU colonel in Kyiv. The officer, Ivan Voronych, was shot and killed in a daylight attack on Thursday. The SBU stated that the suspects were killed in the Kyiv region after resisting arrest. Voronych was reportedly involved in covert operations within Russian-occupied territories. The bold assassination and subsequent lethal response by Ukrainian forces underscore the intense intelligence and counter-intelligence war running parallel to the conventional military conflict.</p>

          <p>The family of 94-year-old Betty Matteson, whose historic home on the Guadalupe River was destroyed in the Texas floods, intends to rebuild despite the financial cost and risk of future disasters. Matteson and her family survived by sheltering in the attic as the water surged through their home of nearly 60 years. Lacking flood insurance due to its high cost, the family faces an estimated half-million-dollar repair bill. Despite the clear dangers of climate change and more frequent extreme weather, the family's deep emotional connection to the property is driving their decision to restore it.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly defended Attorney General Pam Bondi against criticism from some of his own supporters regarding the handling of files related to Jeffrey Epstein. In a social media post, Trump urged critics, including prominent conservative figures, to "let Pam Bondi do her job." The backlash emerged after a Justice Department memo stated there was no "incriminating client list" and that Epstein's death was a suicide, findings that contradicted the expectations of many who anticipated major revelations. The controversy has highlighted a reported rift between the Justice Department and the FBI over the case.</p>

          <p>The dispute between FIFA and the global players' union, Fifpro, has intensified over decisions regarding mandatory rest periods for professional soccer players. While FIFA announced support for principles like a 72-hour gap between games and a three-week summer break, Fifpro executives were reportedly not included in the meeting that produced the announcement. The conflict is fueled by concerns over player welfare and an increasingly crowded fixture calendar, highlighted by the launch of an expanded 32-team Club World Cup. Fifpro has previously filed a lawsuit against FIFA, accusing it of expanding the schedule without proper consultation.</p>

          <p>An investigation by U.S. media outlets reports that federal regulators granted appeals to remove numerous buildings at Camp Mystic from official flood risk maps years before the deadly July 4 disaster. Records reportedly show that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) initially designated the camp as a high-risk flood zone in 2011, but the camp successfully challenged the designations. This would have exempted it from requirements like mandatory flood insurance and stricter building regulations. The revelations raise serious questions about risk assessment and safety protocols at the camp, where at least 27 children died.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid geopolitical tensions with China, the U.S. is increasingly looking towards recycling electronic waste as a domestic source for rare earth metals and other critical materials. China's dominance over the supply chain for elements vital to technology, from smartphones to military hardware, has spurred innovation in e-waste processing. Next-generation recyclers are developing methods to extract valuable materials like neodymium, copper, and lithium from discarded electronics and spent EV batteries. This "urban mining" presents a strategic opportunity to reduce reliance on foreign imports and strengthen U.S. supply chain independence. (not investment advice)</p>
