          <p>Friedrich Merz has assumed the role of Germany's chancellor following a dramatic election process marked by an initial failed vote, revealing underlying divisions within the coalition government. Experts suggest that the focus will soon shift to the government's policy decisions, particularly regarding economic reforms and investments. The new government, composed of the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party, faces pressing issues such as internal disagreements on migration, geopolitical tensions, and a struggling economy, needing to build trust to enact swift legislative changes. The chancellor's ability to navigate these challenges will be critical for Germany's economic future.</p>

The strikes marked a significant escalation as they targeted locations in mainland Pakistan, a move not seen in over half a century. Both countries have activated air defense units and closed airports, raising concerns about a potential full-scale military confrontation in the disputed Kashmir region.</p>

The proposed change would deem an attacker onside if any part of their body is in line with the last defender.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's strategy of proposing substantial tariffs and then scaling back those proposals has inadvertently made existing tariffs seem less significant, a psychological effect known as anchoring. While investors initially panicked at the prospect of a trade war, the moderation of some tariffs has been met with relief, even though significant tariffs remain in place. Despite the perceived acceptance of tariffs, the United States still maintains a 10% universal tariff on most imports and higher tariffs on specific goods, leading to increased costs for consumers. This approach has created uncertainty and forced companies to reassess investment and hiring plans.</p>

The Hornsea 4 project, which would have added 2,400 megawatts of capacity, has been deemed no longer viable in its current form. The decision represents a setback for Britain's clean energy goals. Orsted will retain the project rights and seek to develop it in a more value-creating way in the future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta attributes the club's recent lack of trophies to unfortunate timing, arguing that success depends on being in the right place at the right time. Arteta highlighted that Liverpool won the Premier League with fewer points than Arsenal achieved in previous seasons, suggesting that his team has been competitive but not fortunate enough. As Arsenal prepares to face Paris St-Germain in the Champions League semi-final, Arteta remains hopeful that his team can seize the opportunity to win silverware this season.</p>

          <p>Israel's plan to capture more land in Gaza and relocate thousands of civilians has deepened the sense of despair among Palestinians, many of whom have already been displaced multiple times since the war began. The displacement plan would worsen the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, where hunger has soared due to Israel's blockade on aid supplies. The announcement has prompted Hamas to withdraw from cease-fire negotiations, further complicating efforts to alleviate the suffering of Gazan civilians. With limited access to food and medicine, and repeated displacement, residents express a sense of helplessness and fear for the future.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have identified a gene in upland rice roots linked to drought resistance, potentially enabling the transformation of widely cultivated irrigated rice into drought-tolerant varieties. Researchers identified the HMGB1 gene, which obstructs the development of deeper, thicker roots essential for drought resistance. By removing this gene, irrigated rice developed traits similar to upland rice, allowing it to thrive in water-scarce environments. These findings could significantly enhance food security in regions facing water scarcity.</p>
