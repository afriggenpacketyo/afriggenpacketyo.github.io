          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has escalated a tomato recall affecting Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina to a Class I recall, indicating a high risk of serious health consequences or death. The tomatoes, sourced from Williams Farms Repack, LLC, are potentially contaminated with Salmonella. The FDA advises consumers who have purchased these tomatoes to either return them for a full refund or discard them immediately. Salmonella infection can lead to symptoms such as fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, particularly endangering young children, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to his biographer Stephen Witt, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, despite leading a company valued at nearly $3.4 trillion, is significantly motivated by a fear of failure. Witt, who interviewed Huang for six hours, notes that this anxiety fuels Huang's drive and work ethic, pushing him to avoid letting people down. Huang's unusual discomfort when things are going well distinguishes him from other CEOs, who are often motivated by more positive emotions. While an Nvidia spokeswoman declined to comment, Witt's observations provide insight into the mindset of one of the world's most successful leaders.</p>

          <p>The German Cabinet has approved several measures to tighten asylum laws, including simplifying the process for designating "safe countries of origin" to facilitate deportations. This decision follows a court ruling that deemed previous border pushback policies unlawful. The new measures would grant the government sole authority in determining safe countries, removing the need for approval from the Bundesrat. These reforms, part of Chancellor Friedrich Merz's efforts to curb irregular migration, face criticism from legal experts and human rights groups, who argue they could complicate asylum regulations and undermine constitutional rights.</p>

This action coincides with Trump's push for his "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" in Congress, which faces opposition from some Republican members due to concerns about the national debt and changes to Medicaid. Elon Musk has also criticized the bill, calling it an "abomination." The tariffs took effect as Trump met with Senate Republicans to advocate for the bill's passage.</p>

          <p>The U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has temporarily halted its aid distribution in Gaza due to security concerns, following reports of numerous Palestinian deaths near its distribution hubs. The move comes after the GHF announced it would close its Swiss office due to regulatory issues and after a U.S.-based consulting firm severed ties with the group. The organization has requested the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to enhance security measures and provide clearer guidance for civilians seeking aid. The IDF has accused Hamas of sabotaging the GHF effort, while the UN has refused to work with the GHF, criticizing it as a distraction.</p>

          <p>A conservative student newspaper at Brown University is facing disciplinary hearings after publishing questions styled after Elon Musk's tweets regarding the work of university staff. The newspaper's use of the DOGE meme format in its questioning led to accusations of harassment and prompted the university to take action. The incident has sparked debate over free speech and the boundaries of satire on college campuses. The outcome of the disciplinary hearings could have implications for the future of student journalism at Brown University.</p>

          <p>Dana Chandler was convicted of the 2002 murders of her ex-husband, Mike Sisco, and his girlfriend, Karen Harkness, after three trials. The case involved circumstantial evidence, including Chandler's history of stalking Sisco and inconsistent alibis. Her own daughter, Hailey Seel, testified against her, sharing secretly recorded conversations in which Chandler expressed violent thoughts about Sisco. While the first conviction was overturned due to prosecutorial misconduct, the third trial resulted in a guilty verdict, with Chandler representing herself in court.

          <p>A coordinated nationwide crackdown on organized retail crime resulted in hundreds of arrests across 28 states last week. The operation, led by the Cook County regional organized crime task force in Illinois, involved over 100 jurisdictions and more than 30 retailers, including Home Depot, Macy's, and Target. Authorities emphasized that the focused effort sends a deterrent message to criminals. Retailers have reported significant increases in shoplifting incidents and associated losses in recent years, prompting increased law enforcement efforts and calls for stricter enforcement and felony thresholds.</p>

Mortgage rates are more closely tied to the 10-year Treasury yield than to Fed policy changes. Factors like inflation and the strength of the job market will heavily influence future rate decisions. While some forecasts suggest rates could dip to around 6.2% or 5.5% by late 2025 or 2026, experts advise potential homebuyers to consider purchasing now if they are financially ready, citing less competition and the potential for rising home prices (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>CDs offer an opportunity to earn higher returns than standard savings accounts, with the added benefit of FDIC or NCUA insurance.

To secure a good CD rate, consider online banks, which typically offer more competitive rates due to lower overhead costs.
