          <p>Elizabeth Holmes, the former CEO of Theranos, had her appeal of her 2022 fraud conviction denied by the 9th Circuit of Appeals. Holmes is currently serving an 11-year prison sentence for defrauding investors in the failed blood-testing startup. The federal panel rejected Holmes' request for a hearing before the court, with no judge requesting a vote to hear the case, effectively upholding the original conviction. The case underscores the legal consequences for executives found guilty of misleading investors about their company's capabilities.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump announced he would seek a new candidate for the top federal prosecutor in Washington DC after Senator Thom Tillis withdrew his support for Ed Martin. Martin, a loyalist of Trump, faced opposition due to his support for pardoning January 6 insurrectionists and controversial social media activity. Tillis cited Martin's stance on January 6 as the primary reason for his lack of support, emphasizing his intolerance for anyone involved in the Capitol riot. Martin's withdrawal highlights the challenges Trump faces in appointing officials who align with his views, particularly when they conflict with established norms and bipartisan values.</p>

          <p>Graham Parsons, a philosophy professor at West Point, resigned after 13 years, criticizing the academy's shift away from core educational principles under the Trump administration. Parsons cited censorship of the curriculum to align with the administration's ideological preferences, including prohibiting instruction on theories deemed "un-American." Courses on race, gender, and power dynamics were removed, and faculty were pressured to revise or eliminate related content. Parsons argues that West Point's submission to the administration damages its mission and values of free thought and political neutrality.</p>

When wastewater treatment plants process sewage, the resulting sludge is often used as fertilizer, but it can contain PFAS, which have been linked to health problems. The article discusses how some states are becoming dumping grounds for contaminated sludge and provides guidance on how communities can learn more about PFAS levels in their local wastewater and biosolids, as well as ways to prevent PFAS from entering treatment operations.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump unveiled a trade deal outline with the United Kingdom, the first since implementing new tariffs in April.

The CNBC article notes that the deal includes commitments on intellectual property, labor, and the environment, and requires negotiating an alternative to steel and aluminum tariffs. Some experts suggest the deal's impact is limited and may not be easily replicated with countries where the U.S. has a trade deficit.</p>
