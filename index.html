          <p>A new COVID-19 variant, NB.1.8.1, linked to a surge in China, has been detected in multiple U.S. locations, with symptoms similar to earlier strains, including respiratory issues and fatigue. Experts suggest that while this variant appears more transmissible, it does not necessarily lead to more severe illness. The Trump administration plans to limit booster vaccine access to specific groups, such as seniors and those with underlying medical conditions, requiring new clinical trials for wider use, which could create barriers and confusion for the broader population, potentially reducing vaccination rates. Experts advise continued preventative measures such as good hygiene and mask-wearing to minimize the spread of respiratory viruses.</p>

          <p>iPhone shipments from India to the U.S. experienced a significant 76% increase in April, driven by Apple's efforts to diversify its manufacturing base amid trade tensions with China. While India surpassed China in iPhone shipments to the U.S. in March, this growth is expected to plateau due to limited manufacturing capacity, with U.S. demand projected to be met by 2026. Analysts caution that protectionist measures from both Washington and Beijing could impede India's ability to expand its iPhone production, with Trump threatening tariffs on iPhone shipments not manufactured domestically.

          <p>Data from the 2024 election and subsequent polling suggest a split within Gen Z, with older members (25-29) leaning more Democratic and progressive, while younger members (18-24) show increased openness to Republican ideas. This divide is influenced by factors such as the pandemic, the rise of smartphones, inflation, and the Trump presidency. Polling data indicates that younger Gen Z members hold more favorable views of Republicans in Congress and Trump, with a slightly larger share identifying with the GOP. Increased religiosity among younger Gen Z men may also correlate with more conservative views.</p>

          <p>A new era of nuclear risk is emerging, characterized by renewed tensions between superpowers, the rise of China as a nuclear power, and the collapse of arms control treaties. The war in Ukraine exemplifies the dynamics of this new era, with nuclear threats looming over the conflict. The recent India-Pakistan conflict highlighted the potential for escalation between nuclear rivals. Some experts believe that the U.S. needs to re-evaluate its nuclear posture and consider arms control agreements to mitigate these risks.</p>

          <p>The National Endowment for the Arts has terminated previously awarded grants to arts organizations, citing a shift in funding priorities to projects reflecting the nation's artistic heritage as prioritized by the President. Affected institutions include theater companies and publishers specializing in international literature. The decision is politically motivated and targets projects deemed insufficiently American, diminishing the diversity and scope of the arts.</p>

          <p>The European Union has approved the creation of a 150 billion-euro arms fund driven by fears of a Russian attack and doubts about U.S. security commitments. The Security Action for Europe (SAFE) scheme will use joint EU borrowing to provide loans to European countries for joint defense projects. The initiative aims to boost the continent's defense industry and break down national barriers by financing joint projects, with a strong emphasis on "buy European" policies.</p>

          <p>A former flight attendant from England was allegedly caught with 101 pounds of synthetic drug in her suitcases at Sri Lanka airport. Sri Lankan authorities have seized nearly 60 kilograms of potent synthetic cannabis that foreigners tried to smuggle in this month in three separate cases, a customs official said Saturday. The South Asian island has long been considered a transit point for international drug smugglers, and all three suspects â€” from Britain, India and Thailand â€” could face life imprisonment if convicted.</p>
