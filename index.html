          <p>The United States, under the Trump administration, has revoked all visas for South Sudanese passport holders and blocked new entries, citing South Sudan's failure to accept its citizens deported from the U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that this action was necessary because South Sudan was "taking advantage of the United States." This measure is the first of its kind since Trump's return to the White House, highlighting his administration's stance on immigration. The decision comes amid growing concerns about tensions within South Sudan and fears of a potential resurgence of civil war.</p>

          <p>Men are more likely to die prematurely than women in the UK, facing higher risks of heart disease, lung cancer, and liver disease. This article explores the reasons behind these disparities, including lifestyle choices, biological factors, and a lack of engagement with health services. Experts emphasize the need for targeted interventions, such as making health checks more accessible to blue-collar workers and addressing the impact of deprivation on men's health. Mental health support is also crucial, as men are disproportionately affected by suicide.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to impose sweeping tariffs on imported goods marks a significant shift away from globalization and free trade, potentially impacting the US economy. The move is based on the idea that countries with trade surpluses are "cheating" the US, leading to reciprocal tariffs designed to eliminate trade deficits. This approach deviates from conventional economic theories and could lead to retaliatory measures from other countries. The article argues that while some sectors may benefit from reshoring manufacturing, the overall impact could be messy, with potential consequences for inflation, stock markets, and global trade relations.</p>

          <p>Sarah Boardman, the artist behind the official portrait of Donald Trump that he publicly criticized, claims her business is now "in danger of not recovering" due to the president's comments. Trump described the portrait as "truly the worst" and suggested Boardman had lost her talent. Boardman stated that the allegations that she purposefully distorted the portrait have negatively impacted her business, which has received overwhelmingly positive reviews for 41 years before Trump's criticism.</p>

          <p>The Israeli army has admitted that its soldiers made mistakes in the killing of 15 emergency workers in southern Gaza on March 23, but claims that some of them were linked to Hamas. Israel initially stated that troops opened fire because the convoy approached suspiciously in darkness without headlights. However, video footage shows the vehicles were clearly marked and had lights on. The IDF insists at least six of the medics were linked to Hamas but has not provided evidence, promising a thorough examination of the incident.</p>

          <h2>DeepSeek Introduces New AI Reasoning Method as Next-Gen Model Anticipation Rises</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>DeepSeek, a Chinese AI start-up, has unveiled a new method for improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in anticipation of its next-generation model. The technique combines generative reward modelling (GRM) and self-principled critique tuning. The resulting DeepSeek-GRM models outperformed existing methods, achieving competitive performance with strong public reward models. The academic paper, published on arXiv, comes amid speculation about the start-up's next move following the global attention garnered by the firm's V3 foundation model and R1 reasoning model.</p>
