          <h2>DoorDash Acquires SevenRooms Amidst Revenue Miss</h2>

          <p>DoorDash has announced its acquisition of SevenRooms, a restaurant booking platform, for $1.2 billion in an all-cash deal expected to close in the second half of 2025; this announcement coincided with the release of DoorDash's first-quarter revenue figures, which fell short of analysts' expectations at $3.03 billion against the expected $3.09 billion. Despite the revenue miss, DoorDash reported a rise in total orders to 732 million, marking an 18% increase year-over-year, and expects adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization for the second quarter to range from $600 million to $650 million. The company believes that both SevenRooms and Deliveroo will expand its ability to grow local commerce and support financial goals.</p>

          <p>Shares of Hugo Boss experienced a significant jump after the fashion retailer announced a smaller-than-anticipated decline in first-quarter sales, alongside reaffirming its financial outlook for the year. The company reported a 2% drop in revenue, adjusting for currency fluctuations, which totaled 999 million euros, slightly surpassing analysts' predictions of 979 million euros. While weaker sales were largely attributed to decreased demand in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly China, the group remains cautiously optimistic, monitoring macroeconomic developments and global trade tensions, while forecasting full-year sales to align with the previous year's figures, ranging from 4.2 billion to 4.4 billion euros.</p>

The companies plan to initially deploy Pony.ai's robotaxis on the Uber platform in a key Middle Eastern market, with further international expansion planned; Uber users will have the option to select a Pony.ai autonomous vehicle for their rides, with a safety operator present during the initial pilot phase. This collaboration is strategically crucial for Pony.ai's global expansion and enables Uber to integrate autonomous vehicles more swiftly and safely, as Uber also partners with Waymo in the U.S.</p>

He maintains his innocence and criticizes the administration's rationale as laughable, stating his advocacy for justice and peace should not be seen as undermining U.S. policy; Mahdawi's case is ongoing, with an appeals court set to review his and another student's cases.</p>

While affirming a bond with the UK Labour Party, she stressed the importance of standing up for Wales' interests, drawing a parallel to the relationship in the BBC sitcom Gavin and Stacey, where what suits Essex may not suit Barry.</p>

          <p>Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic's abrupt cancellation of his US visit and uncertainty surrounding a planned trip to Moscow highlight a potential crisis in Serbia's foreign policy strategy. Vucic's alleged attempt to meet with Donald Trump informally at a Republican National Committee event was reportedly unsuccessful, raising questions about waning US support for his regime. The EU has also strongly opposed a potential visit to Moscow, warning it could jeopardize Serbia's EU membership aspirations; analysts suggest that Vucic's actions are driven by a need to repair his image as a globally recognized leader amid rising domestic pressure.</p>

The judge also ordered the state board of elections to certify the results, which showed Riggs winning by a narrow margin; the decision is currently stayed for seven days, pending a potential appeal from Riggs' Republican challenger, Jefferson Griffin.</p>

          <p>New trade data indicates that U.S. exports are experiencing a broad decline due to the implementation of tariffs, with the agricultural sector being particularly affected. Ports across the country are seeing decreased export volumes, especially for key farm products like soybeans, corn, and beef; the drop in exports is linked to a decrease in containerships arriving in the U.S. and changes in global demand resulting from U.S. trade policies. Retailers are warning consumers to buy sooner rather than later, as supply chain disruptions could lead to leaner inventories and higher prices during the holiday shopping season.</p>

          <p>Daniel Kehlmann's novel, 'The Director,' explores the moral compromises made by Austrian filmmaker G. W. Pabst during his collaboration with the Third Reich. The book delves into the gray zone between victim and perpetrator, examining the rationalizations and self-deceptions that lead to complicity. Kehlmann draws on historical events and his own family's experiences to depict Pabst's journey, asking how far one can go in compromising their morals for the sake of art.

This revelation undermines the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act and raises questions about its criticism of media coverage.

          <p>Watford has terminated the contract of head coach Tom Cleverley after the team failed to qualify for the Championship play-offs, finishing 14th in the league. Cleverley, a former player for Manchester United and Watford, was appointed as interim boss in March 2024 before being confirmed permanently the following month. Sporting director Gian Luca Nani expressed the need for a change to build on the team's young talent; Watford is now searching for its tenth permanent head coach since 2020.</p>

          <p>Russia has accused Ukraine of launching a drone attack on Moscow days before a World War Two parade, leading to the temporary closure of Moscow's major airports. While Ukraine has not commented on the alleged attack, it comes ahead of a ceasefire ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin to coincide with the May 9 parade. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has dismissed Russia's ceasefire plans as a "theatrical play" and has been pushing for a longer truce. The Ukrainian foreign ministry has called on foreign states to refrain from participating in the parade in Moscow.</p>
