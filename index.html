          <p>A growing number of singles, particularly from Gen Z, are utilizing artificial intelligence to enhance their dating app experiences. AI dating assistants like Rizz and Keepler offer services that help users craft witty opening messages, suggest replies, and even navigate difficult conversations like ending a relationship. While these tools can boost confidence for those who struggle with writing, their rising popularity raises questions about authenticity in online dating. Experts suggest that while AI can be a helpful supplement for initiating conversations, it should not become a substitute for genuine human connection and self-representation.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 17:34:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has warned that his country will impose reciprocal tariffs on U.S. goods if the Trump administration proceeds with a threatened 50% tariff. The U.S. threat is linked to the criminal trial of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, an action many in Brazil view as foreign interference in domestic affairs. Despite the U.S. normally having a trade surplus with Brazil, the move has created rare political unity within the divided nation against what is seen as external pressure. Analysts suggest this could inadvertently strengthen President Lula's political standing while creating significant economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of infamous drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, has pleaded guilty to federal drug trafficking and continuing criminal enterprise charges. As a leader of the "Los Chapitos" faction of the Sinaloa cartel, he admitted to running a massive fentanyl trafficking operation that supplied vast quantities of the opioid to the United States. As part of his plea deal, Guzman Lopez will forfeit $80 million and must provide substantial cooperation to the government. This cooperation could involve testifying against other cartel members, including his own brother, who is also in custody.</p>

          <p>A preliminary investigation into the fatal Air India Flight 171 crash has found that the fuel control switches for both engines were moved to the "cutoff" position just three seconds after takeoff. The Boeing 787, which crashed in Ahmedabad killing 260 people on board and 19 on the ground, lost thrust immediately after this action. According to the cockpit voice recorder, one pilot asked the other why the fuel was cut, and the other denied doing so. The report does not assign blame or explain why the switches were moved, but it focuses on pilot actions rather than mechanical failure.</p>

The incident reportedly involved a physical altercation with his ex-girlfriend, with whom he shares two children, during a dispute over picking up the children.

During her time off, she lived a more normal life, attending college and traveling before gradually returning to training.

Critics argue that these weapons are being used against peaceful protesters without justification, violating a state law that restricts their use to situations with immediate threats.

          <p>Bitcoin's price has soared to a new all-time high, briefly exceeding $118,000, driven by a massive surge in institutional investment. On Thursday, Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced their largest single day of inflows for the year, totaling $1.18 billion. This influx of capital reflects growing institutional confidence, partly fueled by expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve and potential fiscal policies that could increase the federal deficit. The rally triggered over $550 million in short liquidations, further propelling the cryptocurrency's price upward in a classic short squeeze. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The proliferation of generative AI is creating new challenges for recent college graduates, as technology begins to automate tasks common in entry-level corporate roles. According to career platform Handshake, listings for such jobs have fallen by 15% while applications per job have surged 30%. Economists note that AI is currently best at the repetitive functions that often form the foundation of early-career positions, leading to a redefinition of what these roles entail. This trend is contributing to a higher unemployment rate for young degree holders compared to the national average, forcing them to adapt to a changing labor market.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has overturned a plea agreement for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and his co-defendants, who are accused of planning the September 11, 2001 attacks. The deal would have allowed them to plead guilty in exchange for life sentences, avoiding the death penalty. However, the court ruled 2-1 that the Defense Secretary had the authority to withdraw from the agreement, a move made last year. This decision effectively nullifies the deal and sends the case back into legal limbo, prolonging the two-decade-long effort to bring the defendants to trial and frustrating families of the victims seeking resolution.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced his intention to impose a 35% tariff on all goods imported from Canada, set to begin on August 1. The threat was delivered via a letter on social media, which also tied the tariffs to Canada's alleged failure to stop fentanyl trafficking and existing levies on U.S. dairy products. This move escalates trade tensions between the two close partners, who were already navigating existing tariffs on steel, aluminum, and autos. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney stated his government would continue to protect its industries and workers in response to the new threat.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace is poised to lose its historic spot in the Europa League due to UEFA's multi-club ownership regulations, with Nottingham Forest set to take their place. The issue stems from Palace's part-owner, John Textor, who also holds a stake in French club Lyon, which also qualified for the competition. UEFA has ruled that both clubs cannot compete, giving the spot to the higher-finishing Lyon. Palace argues Textor lacks decisive influence and missed a deadline to alter its ownership structure, a step Forest took preemptively. The club is now expected to appeal the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.</p>

While details are not yet public, possibilities could include cheaper business-class fares without perks like lounge access or higher-end suites with more amenities. This focus on premium cabins comes as revenue from these high-end seats continues to grow and show more resilience than main cabin sales.</p>

The flight is seen as a symbol of Ukrainian resilience and a logistical success, as the aircraft managed to depart from a warzone without incident.

Lawmakers expressed concern that the trip could legitimize entities that threaten U.S. national security and that Nvidia's actions could inadvertently support China's AI and chip industries.

Customs duties for the month were over 300% higher than the previous year, following the administration's implementation of broad new tariffs on imports. This influx of revenue helped offset ongoing government spending, though the fiscal year-to-date deficit still stands at $1.34 trillion.
