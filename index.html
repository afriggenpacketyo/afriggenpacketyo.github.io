          <h2>Animated Show "Family Guy" Mocks Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in a Recent Episode</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 21:36:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The animated comedy "Family Guy" has once again satirized Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in its latest episode, marking the second time the show has targeted the couple. The joke compared their marriage to historical negative events, prompting a comedic cutaway gag featuring an animated Prince Harry reacting to the show. This follows a previous jab in 2023 that mocked their Netflix deal and sponsored content, a trend also seen in other animated series like "South Park." The article notes the couple has not publicly responded to these satirical portrayals.</p>

          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, have announced a significant reduction in the number of individuals reported missing following severe flooding earlier in the month. After extensive follow-up work by state and local agencies, the count of missing persons has dropped from nearly 100 to just three. Many of those initially reported as unaccounted for have since been verified as safe. The update provides a measure of relief amid the ongoing recovery efforts, though the overall death toll from the statewide flooding remains over 130.</p>

          <p>England's rugby team achieved a decisive 40-5 victory against the United States in a Test match in Washington, D.C., that was significantly delayed by nearby lightning strikes. The game was paused for nearly two hours in total, with both the kick-off and a portion of the first half being held up for safety reasons. Despite the interruptions, England maintained its momentum, scoring six tries and showcasing a strong performance to conclude their tour with a perfect record. The match also served as an opportunity for several players to make their England debuts.</p>

          <p>More than three years after 13-year-old Iran Moreno was killed by a stray bullet in his Pasadena home, two suspects have been charged with his murder. The Los Angeles County District Attorney announced that Muhammad Abdul-Malik, 38, and Teraeja Laquanna Flemmings, 31, face charges for the shooting, which occurred while Moreno was playing video games. A breakthrough in the case came after recently enhanced surveillance video provided new leads, resulting in the suspects' arrests.

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced plans for a new law aimed at preventing mass violent attacks by individuals who are not motivated by a specific ideology. The proposed legislation seeks to close a legal gap, allowing police to intervene and charge suspects who are found to be planning attacks, similar to existing counter-terrorism powers. This initiative follows the tragic attack in Southport, where the perpetrator was not classifiable as a terrorist despite his violent intent. The new power would enable authorities to act on preparatory steps to stop potential attackers before they can act.</p>

The article details how drivers coordinate with arriving passengers to pick them up just outside the paid zone, risking fines for illegal parking.

However, opponents, including many teachers, contend that the long break is essential for rest, rejuvenation, and planning.

          <p>The Los Angeles Clippers are giving strong consideration to signing veteran point guard Chris Paul, according to the team's president of basketball operations, Lawrence Frank. Paul, who previously played for the Clippers for six seasons, would add significant playmaking depth and veteran leadership to the roster. The team is reportedly looking to add more ball-handlers to support James Harden and Bradley Beal. If signed, Paul would likely accept a reserve role, contributing to a deep and versatile guard rotation as the Clippers aim to build a championship-contending team.</p>

          <p>Goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger was the hero for Germany, leading her team to a 6-5 penalty shootout victory over France in the Euro 2025 quarterfinals.

Berger, a two-time cancer survivor, made a crucial save, scored a penalty herself, and then saved the final French penalty to secure the win.

          <p>After years of being promoted as the language of the future, Mandarin is seeing a significant decline in popularity among learners in Western nations. Data from the US, UK, and New Zealand shows a notable drop in university and secondary school enrollments for Chinese language studies since their peak in the mid-2010s. This shift is attributed to a variety of factors, including geopolitical tensions, changing perceptions of China, and a pivot in cultural and economic focus. The trend marks a reversal from the previous decade, where interest in learning Mandarin had been rapidly growing.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed new restrictions on flights from Mexico and is threatening to terminate the partnership between Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico. The move is a response to the Mexican government's actions that limited flights into Mexico City's main airport, which the U.S. argues violates their bilateral aviation agreement. Under the new order, all Mexican airlines must seek U.S. government approval for their flight schedules. This escalation in the trade dispute could significantly impact the travel industry and the economies of both countries.</p>
