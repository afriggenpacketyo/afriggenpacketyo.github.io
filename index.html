          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce stated that there are currently no trade negotiations occurring with the United States, refuting claims made by the White House about potential easing of trade tensions. A spokesperson emphasized that all reports suggesting progress in bilateral talks should be disregarded. China maintains that any resolution requires the U.S. to completely eliminate all unilateral tariffs imposed on Chinese goods, insisting on equal treatment in any future discussions. This stance echoes previous statements from Chinese officials, highlighting a firm position amidst ongoing trade disputes between the two nations. Optimism regarding near term de-escalation is low.</p>

          <p>Gold prices have surged as investors seek safe-haven assets amidst trade turmoil and concerns about the U.S. economy, while U.S. Treasurys and the dollar have weakened. Analysts attribute this shift to waning confidence in U.S. assets and the perception of gold as an inflation hedge. Unlike currencies or government bonds, gold carries no credit risk and is not tied to the economic or political trajectory of a single nation. This trend underscores the evolving dynamics in global financial markets and the renewed appeal of gold as a store of value during times of uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>SK Hynix, a key supplier to Nvidia, reported strong quarterly earnings driven by demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) used in AI chipsets. Despite exceeding revenue and operating profit estimates, the company cautioned about potential demand volatility in the second half of the year due to macroeconomic uncertainties, including U.S. tariff policies. While anticipating limited impact from tariffs on AI server demand, SK Hynix expects consumer electronics to benefit from AI functionalities in new products. The company credited AI's impact on the memory market for its strong performance.</p>

          <p>China is adjusting its scientific journal ranking system, potentially aiming to reshape the global scientific publishing landscape and promote its scientific soft power. Updated rankings by the National Science Library under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) downgraded some established international journals while elevating domestic Chinese publications. This shift is significant as the ranking system influences research evaluation, promotions, and even graduation requirements within Chinese institutions. Experts suggest these changes reflect Beijing's ambition to highlight its growing scientific capabilities and influence.</p>
