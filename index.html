CEO Corie Barry mentioned that the company has already increased prices on some items as a last resort to offset these rising costs, although she did not specify which products were affected. Best Buy is adapting to tariffs by encouraging vendors to diversify manufacturing locations, negotiating lower costs, and adjusting its merchandise mix.

          <p>Stock markets experienced a surge following a federal court's decision to block certain tariffs imposed by President Trump on China and other trading partners. The U.S. Court of International Trade invalidated levies on numerous countries, which Trump had previously paused for trade negotiations. The ruling centered on Trump's use of the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, with the court arguing it does not explicitly permit tariffs. The Trump administration appealed the ruling swiftly, leaving the future of the tariffs uncertain.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's recent earnings report highlighted the company's continued sales growth, particularly in its data center division driven by demand for GPUs in AI software. However, U.S. export controls are limiting Nvidia's potential in China, a market estimated at $50 billion. Cloud providers, including Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services, remain Nvidia's most significant customers, accounting for about half of its data center revenue. Nvidia is also seeing surging demand for its GPUs in AI inference, where AI models are served to millions of customers, requiring more computing power for "reasoning."</p>

          <p>Despite a U.S. court blocking President Trump's across-the-board tariffs, trade experts and America's trading partners remain cautious. While the ruling offers a fragile chance at reprieve, Trump could pursue other legal routes to enact tariffs. The decision does not roll back sector-specific tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars, leaving ongoing negotiations on those sectors. The ruling has sparked uncertainty, as the United States tries to reinstate tariffs, and global partners watch to see if that will be possible.</p>

          <p>Nigerian President Bola Tinubu defended his government's economic reforms, stating they are "working" despite high consumer prices. The reforms include devaluing the naira and cutting electricity and petrol price subsidies. While the World Bank acknowledged Nigeria's highest economic growth in 10 years, inflation has soared, leading to protests and arrests. Critics, like Omoyele Sowore, denounce the government's actions, citing the end of petrol subsidies for low-income individuals and security concerns.</p>

The attorney general sent a letter to Florida's law enforcement agencies stating that he couldn't prevent officers from enforcing the law, despite the judge's order.
