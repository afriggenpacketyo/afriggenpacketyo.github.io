          <p>Following the NBA Draft lottery, Cooper Flagg, a highly anticipated prospect, is expected to be drafted by the Dallas Mavericks, who secured the first overall pick. Flagg, who played for Duke, excelled in various statistical categories and earned the Naismith Player of the Year Award. The Mavericks' acquisition of the top pick marks a positive turn after trading Luka Donƒçiƒá to the Lakers, which led to fan unrest. The NBA Draft is scheduled for June 25, where Flagg's future team will be officially confirmed.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump has endorsed Jack Ciattarelli in the New Jersey gubernatorial race, boosting Ciattarelli's chances in the Republican primary. Ciattarelli, who narrowly lost to the Democratic governor in 2021, has openly sought Trump's support after initially distancing himself. The endorsement could be a double-edged sword, as New Jersey leans Democratic and Trump remains a polarizing figure. The article also notes the competitive Democratic primary and the shifting voter registration landscape in New Jersey, which could impact the general election.</p>

          <p>A new book alleges that Joe Biden's decision to remain in the 2024 presidential election for too long severely hampered Kamala Harris's subsequent campaign after he withdrew. Former Obama campaign advisor David Plouffe described Harris's campaign against Donald Trump as a 'fucking nightmare' due to Biden's actions. The book details concerns about Biden's cognitive decline and attempts by his staff to shield him. It also recounts efforts by prominent figures to persuade Biden to step aside, warning of the potential damage to his legacy.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to impose and then reduce triple-digit tariffs on Chinese products highlights the power and limitations of U.S. trade policy. Trade talks in Geneva resulted in an agreement to lower levies, but without significant concessions from China beyond a commitment to continue discussions. The tariffs caused disruptions for American businesses, leading to canceled orders and warnings of higher prices. The agreement represents a partial retreat, raising questions about the effectiveness of Trump's trade war strategy.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering accepting a $400 million luxury jet from Qatar for use as Air Force One, raising ethical and national security concerns. The plane would eventually be transferred to his presidential foundation, effectively gifting him a valuable personal asset. Critics argue this arrangement constitutes bribery and violates the Constitution's foreign emoluments clause. The plan has drawn scrutiny for its potential implications on U.S. policy and the integrity of the presidency.</p>

          <p>Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey has filed a lawsuit against Liberty Utilities following an explosion that killed a 5-year-old boy. The lawsuit alleges the utility violated state safety laws by failing to properly mark a gas line before another company drilled into it. The explosion destroyed a home in Lexington, Missouri, also injuring the boy's sister and father. Bailey is seeking a $10,000 fine for each day the gas line was unmarked and the appointment of a special monitor to ensure compliance.</p>

          <p>The US food additive approval process is under scrutiny due to the GRAS (generally recognized as safe) loophole, which allows companies to self-certify the safety of many chemicals without FDA approval. This contrasts with Europe, where new additives are presumed unsafe until proven otherwise. Researchers estimate that regulators are unaware of roughly 1,000 chemicals in the food supply. Safety studies also tend to be narrow in focus, mostly looking for cancer, genetic mutations or organ damage in animal or laboratory studies, not more subtle effects on long-term health.</p>

Investors are cautiously optimistic, but warn that the market rally could falter as the end of the tariff pause approaches.
