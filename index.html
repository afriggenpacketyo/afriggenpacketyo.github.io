          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed David A. Wright to chair the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for a new five-year term, following a contentious and partisan vote. The confirmation came despite Democrats raising concerns about a potential "hostile takeover" of the independent agency by the Trump administration. Supporters argued Wright's experience is crucial for advancing the president's agenda to significantly expand the nation's nuclear power capacity by the year 2050.</p>

          <p>A gunman opened fire in a Park Avenue office building, shooting a police officer and another individual, prompting a shelter-in-place warning for the midtown area. The suspect, armed with a long rifle, created a tense scene in the building that houses corporate offices for the NFL and Blackstone. Authorities later confirmed the gunman died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, ending the immediate threat. The two victims were transported to a hospital for treatment of their injuries.</p>

          <p>A tragic collision between a barge and a small sailboat on Biscayne Bay near Miami Beach resulted in the deaths of a 7-year-old and a 13-year-old girl. The sailboat was carrying five children and an adult from a summer camp, all of whom were thrown into the water. Two other children remain in critical condition, while one child and the camp counselor were rescued with less severe injuries. The incident has prompted a major investigation, and a safety zone has been established around the submerged sailboat.</p>

This change aims to level the playing field for reservations, which previously would vanish within minutes of becoming available online. The system, which is free to enter, will hold drawings seven months in advance and includes a points system to give unsuccessful applicants a better chance in future lotteries.</p>

The verdict is highly politicized, drawing condemnation from Uribe's allies and praise from his rivals, and he now faces a potential prison sentence of up to 12 years.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge has dismissed a lawsuit that aimed to force the Federal Reserve to open its interest rate-setting meetings to the public. The suit, filed by investment fund Azoria Capital, argued the meetings should be subject to the federal "Sunshine Act."
