          <p>An editorial argues that summer is an overrated season, challenging the idealized view of beaches, vacations, and freedom. The author points out the harsh realities of extreme heat, high travel costs, and the lack of significant events to break up the monotony. They argue that summer is often a disappointment, with the collective action problem of slowed-down activities and a barren cultural landscape. The piece suggests lowering expectations to enjoy summer more, while also acknowledging the biological and industrial forces that perpetuate its appeal.</p>

Berenberg Chief Economist Holger Schmieding told CNBC that the six-week window until tariffs kick in was probably not enough time to "settle all detailed questions." (not investment advice)</p>
