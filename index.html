          <p>A private funeral service was held for Minnesota lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, who were killed in a politically motivated attack that has shocked the state. The ceremony honored the couple, who were laid in state at the Minnesota Capitol, following what law enforcement describes as a planned assault targeting Democratic officials. The incident is highlighted within a broader context of increasing political polarization and threats against public figures in the United States, prompting the family to call for community-building actions in the couple's memory.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the University of Florida suggests that body mass index (BMI) is a flawed and unreliable predictor of mortality risk compared to body fat percentage. Researchers found that individuals with high body fat were 78% more likely to die over a 15-year period and had a significantly higher risk of death from heart disease. The study advocates for using more accurate methods like bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) in clinical settings, as BMI fails to distinguish between muscle and fat, potentially misclassifying health risks for many individuals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This year's Fourth of July celebrations may be impacted by increased costs and potential shortages of fireworks due to U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. The American pyrotechnics industry is heavily reliant on China, which supplies 99% of consumer fireworks and 90% of professional display products. Industry representatives express concern that the tariffs will give consumers "less bang for their bucks" and are especially worried about planning for the nation's 250th birthday celebrations in 2026 amid trade uncertainty.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has postponed its decision on a contentious Louisiana congressional redistricting case, creating uncertainty about the future of the Voting Rights Act. The case centers on whether a new map with a second majority-Black district, created to comply with the Act, constitutes an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. Legal experts are closely watching for the eventual ruling, as it could significantly alter the enforcement of Section 2 protections against diluting minority voting power, joining other pending cases that challenge the landmark 1965 law.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is intensifying its use of specialized interceptor drones as a countermeasure against a surge in Russian Shahed drone attacks on its cities. These domestically produced drones are faster and more maneuverable than standard models, making them effective at downing the high-altitude Russian drones that evade ground-based defenses. This strategic shift is seen as a more cost-effective solution than using expensive anti-aircraft missiles, with Ukraine ramping up production and training new pilot units to protect its infrastructure and defense systems.</p>

          <p>A policy rift has emerged within Germany's coalition government regarding the future of nuclear power, challenging the country's long-standing energy consensus. The conservative Economy Minister has expressed openness to all low-emission technologies, including nuclear, clashing with the Social Democratic Environment Minister, who remains committed to Germany's nuclear phase-out. This fundamental disagreement on energy strategy also extends to debates over the construction of new gas-fired power plants, creating uncertainty around Germany's path to achieving its climate goals.

          <p>A prominent economist from China International Capital Corporation argues that the country already has a significant "comparative advantage" in the global race to develop stablecoins. He contends that mature third-party payment platforms like WeChat Pay and Alipay function in a very similar manner to stablecoins, as they are pegged 1:1 with fiat currency. Furthermore, these platforms operate within a relatively mature regulatory framework, providing China with a foundational advantage over nations building such systems from scratch.

This move, which would require export permits and proof of legal capture for species like the Japanese eel, faces strong opposition from Japan, a major consumer.

The author argues that such events reveal the true conflict is not a cultural divide between urban and rural areas, but one between ordinary people and unaccountable wealth.</p>
