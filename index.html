          <p>Burberry is set to reduce its global workforce by approximately 1,700 positions as part of a broader restructuring effort aimed at revitalizing the luxury brand by 2027. The announcement follows a slight dip in fourth-quarter sales, with a 6% decrease attributed to macroeconomic challenges and geopolitical uncertainties, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. Despite these challenges, Burberry's CEO, Joshua Schulman, remains optimistic about the company's future and its ability to achieve sustainable growth. The company is also closely monitoring the potential impact of escalating geopolitical tensions on tariff risks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former US President Donald Trump's policies, including proposed tariffs and budget cuts, are injecting uncertainty into the renewable energy sector, potentially slowing its growth despite incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act. Trump's open disdain for wind power and his administration's attempts to halt funding for green energy projects are causing concern among investors and developers. While clean energy has seen significant growth in recent years, the potential impact of tariffs on Southeast Asia, a key region for solar components, could lead to higher prices for renewable energy projects. Experts believe that the sector will continue to grow, but at a slower pace, which could jeopardize the US's global competitiveness.</p>

          <p>Sony Group shares experienced a rise of over 2% amidst volatile trading following the announcement of a 250 billion yen ($1.7 billion) share buyback. The company's operating income for the last three months of the financial year exceeded analyst estimates, despite a slight decrease compared to the previous year. Sony also revealed plans for a partial spinoff of its financial unit through dividends to shareholders. However, the company's outlook for the current financial year was impacted by concerns over former U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war, though this impact could change based on the recent trade deal between the U.S. and China.</p>

          <p>BBC Director General Tim Davie has pledged to address the growing 'crisis of trust' in the UK by enhancing the broadcaster's fact-checking services, countering disinformation, and expanding local journalism. Davie argues that the BBC can play a crucial role in strengthening democracy, boosting education and economic growth, and improving digital access. Proposed measures include utilizing artificial intelligence to create personalized learning experiences and advocating for a national plan to transition to internet-only delivery of programs by the 2030s. The BBC aims to double down on its Freely service and consider launching a streaming media device to cater to those who have not yet adopted streaming.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has accused members of Congress of committing felonies during an altercation at a Newark immigration detention center, criticizing their actions as attacks on law enforcement.

She called for the lawmakers to be censured and removed from their committees, arguing their behavior was hypocritical and criminal.

          <p>Kanye West, also known as Ye, has released a controversial song containing antisemitic content, including references to Nazi slogans and imagery, which has been banned from several major platforms but remains on X.

The article contrasts this with the United States, where freedom of speech protects even hate speech, sparking a debate about the responsibilities of tech companies in regulating offensive content.

The increase will take effect on June 1, pending another hearing, and the company has agreed to refrain from implementing new non-renewal programs through the end of 2025.

They are also competing with banks, private equity firms, and hedge funds for top talent, while young employees are reluctant to work at family offices due to a lack of clear corporate structure and perceived career risks.

          <p>Climate data from oyster fossils is challenging the belief that Antarctica was ice-free during the Cretaceous period, a time when dinosaurs dominated, and offers insights into climate behavior today. An international team of scientists found that the mid-latitudes of the southern hemisphere experienced seasonal temperature changes of up to 16 degrees Celsius and polar ice was present during that time. The team's findings suggest that as global warming continues, the world may transition from perennial glacier ice to seasonal ice, shifting from a predominantly white winter planet to a blue one.</p>

          <p>British businesses are expressing concerns that the UK government's plans to tighten immigration rules on foreign workers could lead to labor shortages, particularly in sectors heavily reliant on migrant staff, such as health and social care. The government's proposals include raising English-language requirements and skill levels for migrants, as well as extending the residency requirement for indefinite stay. While the government aims to boost training and recruitment among British personnel, businesses worry that Brits cannot or will not fill the gap created by worker and skills shortages. Care England warns that the immigration plans could have serious consequences for the already strained care industry, which currently has 131,000 vacancies.</p>

          <p>A bag containing an inflammable signal flame tube fell from a U.S. military helicopter over the Motobu peninsula in northern Okinawa Prefecture, Japan, on Tuesday. According to a local Defense Ministry bureau, the U.S. Marine Corps confirmed that the UH-1 helicopter inadvertently dropped the 18-kilogram bag during a routine drill.

          <p>Iran has proposed a joint nuclear-enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washington's demand that it dismantle its nuclear program. According to Iranian officials, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi presented the idea to American special envoy Steve Witkoff during talks in Oman. The proposal entails Iran enriching uranium to a low grade and shipping it to other Arab countries for civilian use, with representatives from participating countries providing oversight. While the venture idea is new and untested, some experts believe it could address several of America's concerns and lead to a more permanent solution than the 2015 nuclear deal.</p>

          <p>U.S. retail egg prices fell in April for the first time in months, declining from a record high of $6.23 in March to $5.12 per dozen, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Despite the decrease, egg prices remain near historic highs due to a persistent outbreak of bird flu that has wiped out flocks of egg-laying hens. Experts predict that prices will continue to fall in May and June due to decreased consumer demand after Easter and fewer bird flu outbreaks at commercial poultry operations. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is investing $1 billion to help farmers improve their biosecurity measures to fight bird flu, and the U.S. has increased imports of eggs from other countries.</p>

          <p>U.S. energy officials are reassessing the risk posed by Chinese-made power inverters, critical components in renewable energy infrastructure, after the discovery of undocumented communication devices inside some of them.

The U.S. Department of Energy is working to address any gaps in disclosures through "Software Bill of Materials" and other contractual requirements.

However, the Dodgers anticipate a boost with Clayton Kershaw's season debut on Saturday against the Angels, which comes at a crucial time as Roki Sasaki joins Blake Snell and Tyler Glasnow on the injured list.

This increase in abuse coincides with a polarising presidential election campaign and comes after an initial outpouring of compassion from Poles following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. While many Poles continue to support Ukraine, research suggests that public opinion of Ukrainians is worsening, with fewer Poles in favor of accepting Ukrainian refugees. The situation highlights the challenges faced by Ukrainian refugees and the complexities of navigating a new country amid shifting political and social dynamics.</p>
