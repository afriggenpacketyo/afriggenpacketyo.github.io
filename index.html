          <p>Hundreds of pro-Israel demonstrators, led by the UK's chief rabbi, marched through central London to demand the release of hostages held in Gaza and to show support for the country. Protesters also expressed anger at the UK government's conditional plan to recognize a Palestinian state, viewing it as a reward for Hamas. The Metropolitan Police reported three arrests for assault and public order offenses during the event, which drew an estimated 2,000 participants and saw minor scuffles with pro-Palestinian counter-protesters. The demonstration highlighted ongoing concerns for the hostages' safety and what participants described as rising antisemitism in the UK.</p>

          <p>Actor James van der Beek, 48, has shared that the first warning sign of his stage 3 colorectal cancer was a change in bowel movements, a symptom he initially dismissed as an effect of his coffee consumption. Despite being in excellent physical shape, his diagnosis came after a colonoscopy, highlighting the importance of screening, with the recommended age now lowered to 45 for average-risk individuals. Medical experts commenting on the case emphasize that changes in bowel habits, fatigue, and abdominal discomfort are key red flags. The article underscores that early detection is crucial as many colorectal cancers develop without obvious symptoms.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended his plan for a military offensive in Gaza City, calling it the "best way" to defeat Hamas and free hostages, while denying that Israel is starving Gazans. His remarks came as Israel faced heavy criticism at a UN Security Council emergency meeting, where nations like the UK and France warned the plan could violate international humanitarian law and further endanger hostages. The UN warned of a potential "calamity," and China and Russia condemned the plan as collective punishment and a reckless escalation. Netanyahu's three-step plan for increasing aid was also met with skepticism.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly shooting at the CDC's Atlanta headquarters, a union representing the agency's employees is demanding that the federal government unequivocally condemn vaccine disinformation. The union stated the attack, which killed a police officer, was not random and put scientists at risk, compounding what they describe as months of vilification. The suspect reportedly blamed the COVID-19 vaccine for his health issues before the attack. The union is also calling for improved security and for staff not to be forced to return to work next to bullet holes while the investigation is ongoing.</p>

          <p>A new NPR series, "The World, Reordering," explores the ongoing fragmentation of the post-World War II liberal international order, which was long defined by globalization and U.S. leadership. The article notes that factors like U.S. tariff policies and skepticism toward alliances such as NATO are prompting other nations to form new security and defense partnerships to fill a perceived vacuum. This shift is creating new, uncertain international dynamics that may be laying the groundwork for a new system of global relations. The series aims to analyze these changes and what they might mean for future global progress and stability.</p>

The high-stakes battle has drawn national attention, with Democratic governors from New York and Illinois accusing Republicans of "cheating" to undermine democracy. The dispute highlights the intense partisan fight over electoral maps ahead of midterm elections.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has defended his government's decision to suspend exports of certain arms to Israel that could be used in a Gaza City offensive. Merz clarified that while Germany's solidarity and commitment to Israel's self-defense remain, his government cannot supply weapons for a conflict that could kill thousands of civilians. The decision marks a significant policy shift and has drawn criticism from within Merz's own conservative CDU/CSU bloc, though it is supported by coalition partners. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu criticized the move, stating Merz had "buckled" under pressure from false media reports.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is facing turmoil following the deaths of three patients who received a gene therapy from Sarepta Therapeutics for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The treatment, which costs $3.2 million per patient, received accelerated approval in 2023 despite some internal concerns over limited clinical data. The recent deaths from acute liver failure prompted the FDA to ask Sarepta to suspend the drug's distribution, causing the company's stock to plummet. This case highlights the significant dilemma the FDA faces in balancing rapid access to treatments for rare diseases against the risks of approving drugs with incomplete data.</p>

Eyewitnesses described seeing a small plume of smoke quickly grow into large flames that covered the hillside, forcing them to evacuate. The event occurred amid the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and sold-out Oasis concerts, and follows a series of wildfire warnings in Scotland after an unusually warm and dry summer.</p>

She pointed to data showing a two-year drop in violent crime, contradicting White House claims of a crisis.

The relocation is seen as the latest slight in the ongoing tensions between Trump and his predecessors.

However, positive developments, including an apparent exemption from India-related tariffs after pledging further U.S. investment, triggered a panic among short-sellers, forcing them to buy back shares and drive the price up.

          <p>The Japanese practice of "forest bathing," or shinrin-yoku, is gaining popularity as a mindfulness technique for its proven mental health benefits. The practice involves slowly and deliberately immersing oneself in nature using all senses, which research shows can lower stress and improve focus. Certified guides explain that it's a contrast to our typically hurried and tech-connected lives, encouraging people to disconnect from devices and be present in a natural setting. The benefits can be achieved even through short, 15-minute sessions in a local park or backyard, making it an accessible way to combat daily stress.</p>

          <h2>Expert Argues Personal Branding is a Vital Career Tool, Especially for Introverts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 10:05:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Branding expert Goldie Chan, a self-described introvert, argues that developing a personal brand is a crucial tool for career advancement, particularly for those who are naturally less outspoken. In her view, a personal brand is simply what people know you for, and actively shaping that narrative allows introverts to showcase their talents and avoid being underestimated. She advises starting with small, consistent actions, like posting one professional update a week, to build confidence and presence. Chan emphasizes that branding exists both online and offline, through hobbies and social groups, which all contribute to a unique professional identity.</p>

          <p>Allies of the late Alex Salmond have dismissed claims made by former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in her upcoming memoir that Salmond himself may have leaked details of the sexual misconduct investigation against him. In the book, Sturgeon denies she was the source of the leak but suggests it would have been a "classic Alex" move. Leaders of the Alba party, which Salmond founded, called the suggestion a "fabrication" and "hypocrisy," reigniting the bitter feud that fractured their political partnership. The controversy stems from a 2019 government probe into Salmond, which was later deemed unlawful, and his subsequent acquittal on all criminal charges in 2020.</p>

          <p>U.S. fashion designer Willy Chavarria has issued an apology after a shoe he created with Adidas Originals, the Oaxaca Slip-On, drew widespread criticism for cultural appropriation. The design was inspired by traditional Mexican huarache sandals but was reportedly made in China without consulting or crediting the Indigenous communities who originated the craft. The backlash was significant, with even Mexico's president speaking out against it. Chavarria expressed deep regret that the shoe was not developed in a "meaningful partnership with the Oaxacan community," and promotional images have since been removed from social media.</p>

          <p>An in-depth analysis from The Atlantic explores the complex dynamics behind President Trump's upcoming meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, a summit aimed at fulfilling a major campaign promise to end the war in Ukraine. The article details how the meeting came about through back-channel talks and highlights the significant risks involved, as Trump may offer concessions, such as redrawing Ukraine's borders, that would alienate Kyiv and European allies. While Trump views himself as a peacemaker, his history of skepticism towards Ukraine and rapport with Putin have created deep anxiety in global capitals that he might strike a deal at Ukraine's expense.</p>

          <p>Powerful storms with gusts over 80 mph swept through eastern Nebraska, resulting in one fatality and widespread damage. A woman was killed when a large tree fell on her vehicle in a state park, and a man with her was critically injured. The high winds also caused significant damage to two housing units at the Nebraska State Penitentiary in Lincoln, forcing the displacement of 387 inmates, though no injuries were reported among staff or prisoners. The storms knocked out power for thousands and are part of a larger weather system affecting several Midwest states.</p>
