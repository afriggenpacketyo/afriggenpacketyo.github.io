          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-23 05:01:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ofgem, the UK's energy regulator, has confirmed a price cap fall that will reduce the typical gas and electricity bill by £11 a month starting in July, urging households to explore fixed-rate energy deals for potential annual savings of up to £200. Tim Jarvis of Ofgem acknowledges that while the price drop reflects a fall in wholesale gas prices, energy costs remain high, and many households continue to struggle. Dame Clare Moriarty from Citizens Advice notes the price cap announcement provides little comfort to those burdened by debt, advocating for targeted support and energy efficiency measures. Gillian Roberts from Salford highlights the ongoing struggle to manage energy costs, while Prime Minister Starmer has signaled a partial U-turn on cuts to winter fuel payments for pensioners.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Army will implement a new Army Fitness Test (AFT) on June 1, 2025, replacing the current Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT) with updated scoring standards emphasizing readiness and combat effectiveness. The AFT consists of five events: the three-repetition maximum deadlift, hand-release push-ups, sprint-drag-carry, plank, and a two-mile run. Sgt. Maj. Christopher Mullinax states that the AFT is designed to improve soldier readiness and ensure physical standards, while experts note that the test is challenging but achievable for individuals with a basic fitness foundation. Scoring requirements are more demanding, with combat roles held to the highest standards, and combat standards are sex-neutral for the 21 direct combat roles, a change designed to ensure fairness and operational readiness.</p>

          <p>The article explores some of the more unusual clauses found in NFL player contracts, such as performance escalators, homework clauses, weight clauses, and even an "end of the world" clause. Kyler Murray's contract with the Cardinals initially included a clause mandating four hours of independent film study per week, while Dez Bryant had a "security agreement" with strict rules to curb off-the-field issues. Offensive linemen like Trent Brown and running backs like Eddie Lacy have had weight-related bonuses, and Akili Smith missed out on significant incentives due to poor performance. Rick Mirer's contract even included a clause ensuring payment until "the end of the world."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>General Stephen Whiting, head of US Space Command, has warned that China's expanding arsenal of anti-satellite weapons is forcing Washington to accelerate defenses in orbit. The ambitious defence system known as the Golden Dome is a response to how China had spent the past three decades preparing to target American space infrastructure. Whiting said Beijing’s strategy included deploying weapons in orbit, developing jamming systems and fielding kinetic anti-satellite missiles – all with the explicit aim of blinding and disrupting US military operations during a crisis. Unveiled this week with an initial US$25 billion investment, the Golden Dome is a sweeping plan to build a layered missile defence architecture to protect the US from long-range and hypersonic threats.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republicans are aiming to punish states that provide health insurance to unauthorized immigrants by slashing federal Medicaid reimbursements. The proposed legislation, titled the "One Big Beautiful Bill," targets 14 states, mainly Democratic-led, that offer such coverage, potentially costing California $3 billion annually. The bill's passage would pose political and economic challenges for affected states, with some having "trigger" laws that could terminate Medicaid expansions if federal funding is reduced. Critics argue the measure is hostile to immigrants, while supporters claim it disincentivizes unauthorized border crossings, though the Affordable Care Act already prohibits the use of federal funds for unauthorized immigrants' healthcare, except for emergencies.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shenzhen, China's top exporting city, experienced a 2.9% year-on-year decline in exports in April, despite an 8.1% national export growth. This decline is attributed to ongoing trade tensions with the US. Peng Peng of the Guangdong Society of Reform noted the volatility in Shenzhen's export performance, suggesting the city's trade remains susceptible to global tensions. The drop was primarily driven by an 8.3% decrease in general trade, although bonded logistics saw a 15.5% increase. As a city with relatively high dependence on foreign trade, Shenzhen’s economy is inevitably facing a degree of unpredictability and limited room for policy manoeuvres.</p>

          <p>Trade upheaval resulting from the tariff war ignited by US President Donald Trump appears to have cast a long-lasting impact on the mindset of Chinese policy influencers, with thoughts of “preparing for the worst” spreading at a forum in Beijing. With exporters rushing to secure US-bound shipments during the 90-day truce period, many ex-official and policy advisers have urged the government to guard against any future barrage of American punches, and to also rally the support of major trading partners and forge stronger relations with Global South nations. Zhang Jun, former Chinese ambassador to the United Nations, called the China-US talks in Geneva a positive development, but he explicitly warned that the tariff war has already inflicted deep and lasting harm.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has revoked Harvard University's ability to enroll foreign students, citing concerns over antisemitism, pro-Hamas sympathies, and coordination with the Chinese Communist Party. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that Harvard's refusal to provide pertinent information and its perpetuation of an unsafe campus environment led to the revocation. Harvard rejected the government's allegations, vowing to support its nearly 6,800 international students, while China criticized the "politicization" of educational exchanges. This action could significantly impact Harvard's finances and academic mission, drawing condemnation from university officials and international observers.</p>

          <p>President Trump's meeting with South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa turned into a spectacle of humiliation, focusing on a racist narrative of white South Africans facing genocide. Trump hijacked the meeting to display a video promoting this false narrative, despite Ramaphosa's efforts to discuss serious issues between the two countries, such as tariffs and aid cuts. The article argues that Trump was not interested in making a deal but rather in scoring points with his base, while ignoring the complex realities of South Africa's political and economic landscape.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to block Harvard from enrolling international students, particularly those from China, is viewed as damaging to one of the last positive aspects of the US-China relationship. The flow of Chinese students to the US has been a reliable ballast despite geopolitical tensions. While other symbols of American culture have lost appeal, elite universities like Harvard have remained highly regarded in China. The move is seen by some as accelerating China's ascent, with potential benefits for Chinese universities as talent and revenue may shift eastward.</p>
