          <h2>Trump Administration Announces Disputed Link Between Acetaminophen and Autism</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 18:22:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has unveiled controversial conclusions suggesting a link between autism and the use of acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, during pregnancy. President Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that pregnant women should limit their use of the medication, a claim widely contested by the international scientific community. The administration also promoted further investigation into the drug leucovorin as a potential treatment for some autism symptoms. This announcement has drawn sharp criticism from scientists and medical groups, who label the claims as "fearmongering" and not based on robust scientific evidence.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An examination of the evidence behind the Trump administration's announcement linking Tylenol to autism reveals the claims are based on limited and inconclusive science. While some small observational studies have suggested an association, they fail to prove causation and are contradicted by larger, more rigorous research, such as a study of 2.5 million children in Sweden that found no link. Medical experts emphasize that fever during pregnancy is a known risk factor for neurodevelopmental issues, and discouraging the use of acetaminophen, a primary treatment, could pose its own health risks. Most scientists attribute the rise in autism diagnoses primarily to increased awareness and evolving diagnostic criteria.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Walt Disney Company announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to the air, nearly a week after being indefinitely suspended. The suspension followed comments Kimmel made regarding the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which drew criticism from FCC Chairman Brendan Carr and prompted major affiliate station owners like Nexstar and Sinclair to pull the show. Disney stated the suspension was to avoid inflaming a tense national situation, and the decision to reinstate the show came after "thoughtful conversations" with Kimmel. The move had faced significant backlash from free speech advocates and Hollywood figures.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new policy imposing a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applications is causing confusion and concern among immigration attorneys, employers, and visa holders. The fee, intended to encourage hiring American workers, applies to initial applications and is typically paid by the employer, a cost that could deter many companies from participating in the program. While the White House clarified that the fee does not apply to current visa holders or renewals, ambiguity remains regarding travel for those with pending applications. Immigration lawyers are currently advising H-1B employees to avoid international travel until further guidance is provided.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has launched a new immigration pathway, dubbed the "Trump Gold Card," which offers a fast track to permanent residency for wealthy foreigners. The program allows individuals to obtain an EB-1 or EB-2 visa in exchange for a $1 million "unrestricted gift to the Department of Commerce," which the president stated would generally be used to pay down national debt. This policy differs from the existing EB-5 investor visa program, which requires investment in American businesses that create jobs. Critics suggest the new program redefines the American dream as a transaction, prioritizing personal wealth over other qualifications for immigration.</p>

Democratic leaders have requested the meeting, stating they will not support a spending bill that doesn't address their healthcare priorities and blaming Republican leadership for the impasse. The president has acknowledged the possibility of a shutdown, creating uncertainty as both the House and Senate have left Washington for a recess.</p>

          <p>England's National Health Service (NHS) is introducing a new initiative called "Jess's Rule" to help general practitioners avoid potentially deadly diagnostic errors. The rule urges doctors to "think again" if a patient presents with the same symptoms three times without a clear diagnosis or if their condition worsens. It is named after Jessica Brady, a 27-year-old who died from cancer in 2020 after her symptoms were repeatedly dismissed over five months. The guidance encourages actions like ordering more tests, seeking a second opinion, or referring to a specialist to improve patient safety and prevent similar tragedies.</p>

          <p>Struggling low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines plans to furlough about one-third of its flight attendants, affecting approximately 1,800 employees, starting December 1. The move is part of a broader effort to cut costs and rightsize the airline as it works to regain profitability following a second Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in August. The company's COO stated that while voluntary leave programs were initially used, involuntary furloughs are now necessary for the airline's restructuring. This decision follows recent flight schedule reductions and the suspension of service to several airports as the carrier navigates severe financial challenges.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Gabrielle has rapidly intensified into a major Category 4 hurricane in the central Atlantic, with sustained winds reaching 140 mph. The storm's wind speed increased by 55 mph in just 24 hours, a phenomenon known as rapid intensification that has become more common due to warming oceans. While Gabrielle is not expected to make a direct landfall, it is passing near Bermuda and generating life-threatening surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast from North Carolina northward. Forecasters are also monitoring two other weather systems in the Atlantic for potential tropical development in the coming days.</p>

          <h2>Supreme Court to Re-evaluate Landmark Precedent on Presidential Power to Fire Agency Heads</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 16:56:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has agreed to reconsider a 90-year-old legal precedent that limits a president's power to fire officials at independent federal agencies without cause. The case stems from President Trump's removal of Federal Trade Commission member Rebecca Slaughter, which the court has allowed to proceed for now. The 1935 ruling, Humphrey's Executor, established that officials at agencies like the FTC, designed to be insulated from political pressure, could only be removed for specific reasons. A decision to overturn this precedent could fundamentally reshape the separation of powers, granting the president significantly more control over the federal bureaucracy.</p>

          <p>A man accused of firing shots at an ABC affiliate station in Sacramento reportedly left a note citing the government's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case as a motive. According to a federal court filing, the note also threatened top Trump administration officials, including FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi, stating they were "next." Prosecutors believe the shooting was politically motivated, possibly influenced by recent events like the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show. The suspect, a retired lobbyist, now faces multiple federal and state weapons charges.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old man charged with misdemeanor assault for attacking a pro-Palestinian encampment at UCLA with a pipe has been granted judicial diversion. This resolution means he will avoid jail time and a criminal conviction if he completes the program's terms, which include staying away from the UCLA campus, performing community service, and undergoing anti-bias training. The judge cited the man's age and lack of a prior criminal record in the decision, which was made over the objection of prosecutors. The case was one of the few criminal proceedings to arise from the violent mob attack on the student encampment in May 2024.</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers are urging treasury watchdogs to investigate allegations that Tom Homan, President Trump's border czar, accepted $50,000 in cash from an undercover FBI agent. The alleged payment was reportedly in exchange for promises of future immigration-related government contracts once Homan officially joined the administration. A Justice Department investigation into the matter was reportedly shut down after Trump took office. Democrats are now calling for scrutiny into whether Homan reported the payment for tax purposes, while the White House has denied the allegation and defended Homan, stating he did nothing wrong.</p>
