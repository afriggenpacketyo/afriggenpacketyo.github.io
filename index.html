          <p>President Trump's 46% tariffs on Vietnamese imports are significantly impacting major U.S. retailers like Nike, Deckers, and Wayfair.  These companies, having shifted manufacturing from China to Vietnam, now face increased costs that could lead to price hikes for consumers. The tariffs, effective April 9th, add to existing economic pressures from inflation, potentially dampening consumer spending further.</p>
