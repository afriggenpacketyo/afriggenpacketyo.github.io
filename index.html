Major benchmarks like Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi recorded notable gains, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 also saw an increase. Investors are closely monitoring upcoming economic data, including Singapore's consumer price index, and eagerly anticipating artificial intelligence giant Nvidia's earnings report. This market optimism follows robust performances by the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite at the close of last week's trading session, reflecting a hopeful outlook for global economic stability.

          <p>Selena Gomez's fiancé, Benny Blanco, generated significant online backlash after sharing a TikTok video featuring a $200 box of individually packaged blueberries. Blanco, 37, expressed awe at the size and taste of the fruit, calling them "a f---ing meal," but his lavish display quickly drew criticism from followers. Many social media users voiced their frustration, highlighting their own financial struggles to afford everyday necessities and contrasting their situations with the producer's expensive indulgence. This incident emerged as Blanco and Gomez navigate demanding schedules that have temporarily postponed their wedding plans since their engagement in December.</p>

          <p>France has summoned US Ambassador Charles Kushner to Paris following his open letter in the Wall Street Journal, where he accused France of failing to adequately address a surge in antisemitism. Kushner, whose son is married to Ivanka Trump, echoed Israeli criticism, claiming an "explosion of hatred" towards Jews in France since the Gaza war began. The French foreign ministry firmly refuted these "unacceptable allegations," emphasizing that ambassadors are not permitted to interfere in a country's internal affairs under the 1961 Vienna Convention. This diplomatic friction comes as France plans to formally recognize a Palestinian state in September, a move criticized by both Kushner and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>

          <p>Jerry Adler, a distinguished figure who transitioned from a decades-long career behind the scenes on Broadway to a notable acting presence in his 60s, has died peacefully at the age of 96. Adler was widely recognized for his roles as Tony Soprano's adviser Hesh Rabkin in "The Sopranos" and law partner Howard Lyman in "The Good Wife." Before his on-screen success, he contributed to 53 Broadway productions as a stage manager, producer, or director, working with legends like Marlene Dietrich. His unexpected acting career, sparked by a casting director's hunch, brought him consistent work for over 30 years. Adler published a memoir last year and expressed a deep enjoyment for his work, considering retirement "a road to nowhere."</p>

The mission's objectives included a booster landing burn test with an intentionally disabled engine and a Starship suborbital trajectory with satellite deployment and an in-space engine restart. The Starship program is crucial for launching next-generation Starlinks and for NASA's Artemis moon landing mission, which relies on numerous successful Starship flights for in-space refueling, making the 2027 moon landing target increasingly challenging.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan opposition leaders and civil society groups reported Sunday that President Nicolás Maduro's government released 13 individuals who had been jailed following a crackdown after last year's disputed elections. Opposition figure Henrique Capriles lauded the move as a "step forward," indicating that eight people were fully freed, while five others were released under house arrest. These releases come over a year after the tumultuous presidential elections, where Maduro was declared the winner, a result rejected by the international community and opposition, leading to street protests, deaths, and thousands of detentions. Civil society organizations assert that approximately 1,000 people remain in detention for political reasons, a claim Venezuelan authorities continue to deny.</p>

Although prosecutors have not yet stated if LA County funds directly constituted new bribes, they seek to demonstrate a long-standing pattern of illicit activity by Smartmatic's leadership.

          <p>President Trump issued a strong rebuke to Maryland Governor Wes Moore's invitation for a public safety walk in Baltimore, stating he would only visit after Moore "clean[ed] up this crime mess" and threatening to re-evaluate federal funding for the Francis Scott Key Bridge replacement. Moore had extended the invitation after Trump's critical remarks about Baltimore's crime and his deployment of the National Guard to Washington, D.C. On Truth Social, Trump reiterated his view of Baltimore as "out of control, crime ridden," dismissing Moore's reported 20% decrease in statewide homicides. This escalating public dispute underscores significant federal-state tensions regarding crime policy, the role of the National Guard in domestic policing, and the allocation of critical infrastructure funding.</p>

Approximately 2,000 National Guard personnel, including hundreds from Republican-led states, are currently stationed in the city, primarily tasked with protecting landmarks and managing crowds, without reports of threats requiring weaponry. Local officials, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, continue to assert the federal initiative is unwarranted, pointing to declining violent crime rates in D.C., contrary to President Trump's assertions of an "epidemic of crime."</p>

          <p>Mississippi health officials have declared a public health emergency in response to the state's infant mortality rate reaching its highest level in over a decade, at 9.7 deaths per 1,000 live births—nearly double the national average. This alarming trend disproportionately affects Black infants, who are more than twice as likely to die before their first birthday. The state's action plan includes expanding prenatal services, establishing regional obstetric care systems, and enhancing home visiting programs to address leading causes such as premature birth and congenital malformations. However, experts caution that individual and clinical interventions alone are insufficient, emphasizing the critical role of systemic issues like poverty and healthcare access, further complicated by recent federal funding cuts to maternal and infant health monitoring programs.</p>

Immigration law experts note that cartel violence doesn't neatly fit the five recognized asylum grounds, often forcing victims to claim political asylum due to cartel influence over government. With a backlog of four million cases and increased detention, many applicants face prolonged limbo and fear of deportation, highlighting a critical gap in US immigration policy.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries accused President Trump of "manufacturing a crisis" to justify deploying federalized National Guard troops to Chicago, overriding local leaders' authority. This comes as the Pentagon confirmed planning for Guard deployment to Chicago, following similar actions in Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson condemned the potential move as a "flagrant violation of our constitution," asserting the city's crime rates have significantly dropped. Democrats argue Trump's actions are politically motivated and an abuse of power, aiming to distract from his unpopularity, while Pritzker stated Illinois received no requests for assistance, challenging the legal basis for federal intervention.</p>

          <p>Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse has been removed as Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), with Christine Bordine assuming the acting role. Congressional intelligence committee leaders were notified but given no reason for the ousting, prompting Senator Mark Warner to criticize the Trump administration for treating intelligence as a "loyalty test." This move follows the DIA's assessment that military strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities only set back Tehran's program by months, contradicting President Trump's claim of "decades" of setback. The firing, which caught DIA employees off guard, fueled widespread concerns within the agency about the politicization of their work. Two other military officials were also removed from their posts.</p>

          <p>The first confirmed human case of the flesh-eating screwworm parasite in the United States has been identified in a person in Maryland who recently traveled from Guatemala. This development marks an escalation of an outbreak that began in Central America and southern Mexico last year, posing a significant public health and agricultural threat. While the individual received treatment, the lack of transparency from the CDC on the case has drawn criticism from state veterinarians. The presence of screwworm could severely impact the US beef and cattle futures market, which is already experiencing record-high prices due to tight supplies, and presents a political challenge for USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins, who pledged to keep the pest out of the country.</p>

          <p>The National Weather Service has issued a Flood Advisory for portions of San Diego and Riverside counties, effective until 4:12 p.m. on Sunday, due to heavy rainfall from ongoing thunderstorms. Doppler radar indicated that up to 0.75 inches of rain had already fallen in some areas, with an additional 0.5 to 1 inch anticipated, which could trigger minor flooding, particularly in low-lying regions and areas with inadequate drainage. Authorities strongly advise drivers to take precautions, especially in hilly or rural areas where numerous low-water crossings can rapidly become impassable, emphasizing the critical safety message, "Turn around, don't drown." This weather event represents the first significant rainfall for San Diego County in several months, attributed to monsoon activity.</p>

Three passengers in the BMW—a 23-year-old woman, a 14-year-old boy, and a 15-year-old girl—were killed, while the 25-year-old male driver survived with major injuries. The 35-year-old driver of the Sentra also died, and his 22-year-old passenger was hospitalized in critical condition.

His research focuses on China-US relations and US security and foreign policy.

Da Wei believes both sides desire an agreement, ideally by autumn, though the definition of success remains open to interpretation.

Trump's remarks, made on social media, echoed his previous deployments to Washington D.C. and Los Angeles, framing them as a necessary crackdown on crime. Democrats, including Governor Moore and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, fiercely criticize these actions as an "abuse of power" and a "manufactured crisis," arguing that crime rates are actually declining in cities like Baltimore. The Pentagon confirmed plans for up to 1,700 National Guardsmen to mobilize in 19 states, further fueling the debate over federal intervention in local law enforcement.</p>

Forecasters predict Fernand will experience slight strengthening through Monday before gradually weakening on Tuesday, with its projected path keeping it over open waters well east and northeast of Bermuda. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has forecasted an above-normal hurricane season for this year, and Fernand follows Hurricane Erin, which previously intensified into a ferocious Category 5 storm in a similar area earlier in August.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's new £200 million attacking lineup, featuring Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, and Benjamin Sesko, is experiencing early "teething problems" in scoring goals from open play. Despite a pre-season win, the team has managed only one open-play goal in four subsequent matches, relying on penalties and own goals. Manager Ruben Amorim attributes some struggles to new players adapting and the team's tendency to defend leads rather than maintain offensive pressure. While individual talents like Cunha have shown promise, the attack currently lacks cohesion. With a quiet European schedule, the club has time to integrate its new signings, but pressure mounts to translate significant investment into tangible on-field improvements.</p>
