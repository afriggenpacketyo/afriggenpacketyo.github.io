          <p>U.S. electricity companies are struggling to accurately forecast the power demand that will result from the artificial intelligence boom, creating a multi-billion dollar infrastructure question. Tech companies are reportedly shopping the same large data center projects to multiple utilities, making it difficult to gauge real need and raising concerns about overbuilding costly infrastructure. While experts agree a historic increase in electricity consumption is coming, the uncertainty complicates grid planning and could impact consumer energy prices. The debate continues on whether the surge represents a sustainable transformation or an overstated bubble. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The classic 60/40 stock and bond investment portfolio is facing renewed challenges as gold and cryptocurrencies experience significant rallies. Some market strategists are now advocating for a 60/20/20 model, which reduces bond allocation in favor of alternative assets like precious metals and bitcoin. This shift is driven by factors such as persistent inflation, geopolitical risks, and the observation that stocks and bonds are increasingly moving in tandem. The surge in gold prices, fueled by central bank demand and de-dollarization trends, is leading investors to reconsider it as a core holding rather than a fringe asset. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown extends into its third week, Democratic lawmakers cite a profound lack of trust in President Donald Trump as a primary obstacle to forming bipartisan negotiating groups. In past stalemates, informal coalitions known as "gangs" have helped break legislative deadlocks, but none have emerged in the current crisis. Democrats express concern that the president could unilaterally reject any agreement reached with Republican legislators, a pattern they say has occurred previously. This deep-seated wariness has prevented meaningful cross-party talks, leaving the federal government in a prolonged state of paralysis with no clear resolution in sight.</p>

          <p>A Russian investment envoy for President Vladimir Putin has publicly pitched a proposal to Elon Musk and his Boring Company to construct an undersea rail tunnel across the Bering Strait. Kirill Dmitriev, head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, framed the project as the "Putin-Trump Tunnel," a 70-mile link symbolizing unity between the nations. He suggested that The Boring Company's technology could drastically reduce the estimated $65 billion cost to just $8 billion. The proposal was made following a call between Putin and President Donald Trump to discuss the war in Ukraine, though it faces immense logistical and geopolitical challenges.</p>

          <p>Following the recent ceasefire agreement, key regional powers like Egypt, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia are strategically positioning themselves to influence the future of post-war Gaza. Egypt aims to leverage its role as a mediator to reassert its diplomatic importance and secure international financing for reconstruction projects, utilizing its own construction industry. Qatar seeks to maintain its indispensable role in negotiations, balancing its ties with both the U.S. and Hamas's political leadership. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia is working behind the scenes to ensure regional stability for its economic diversification plans, conditioning its involvement on the disarmament of Hamas.</p>

          <p>This editorial from The Guardian argues that the U.S. justice system is shifting from a check on executive power to a tool for political retribution under President Donald Trump. It points to the recent criminal charges against high-profile critics, including former National Security Adviser John Bolton, former FBI Director James Comey, and New York Attorney General Letitia James. The article suggests these prosecutions are politically motivated, aimed at punishing opponents and satisfying a desire for vengeance.

The program will utilize partnerships with pharmacies like Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drugs and Alto Pharmacy for nationwide delivery.

          <p>Actress Reese Witherspoon has co-authored her first adult fiction novel, a thriller titled "Gone Before Goodbye," with writer Harlan Coben. In an interview, she explained her motivation to create a female protagonist whose value lies in her unique skills as a surgeon, rather than her sex appeal, contrasting it with the bikini-clad women in James Bond films she watched growing up. Witherspoon, whose production company focuses on female-centric stories, noted that the plot was inspired by her upbringing in a medical military family. The book centers on a talented surgeon facing a career setback who becomes entangled in a dangerous conspiracy.</p>

This display of resolve, which some officials say backfired on Vladimir Putin's attempt to divide the allies, has created a rare alignment between European leaders and President Trump on pressuring Russia.

While the risk to the general public remains low, authorities are urging preventative measures, especially for high-risk groups. They emphasize that early detection, testing, and receiving both doses of the JYNNEOS vaccine are crucial for controlling the spread of this more virulent strain.</p>

          <p>John Bolton, who served as national security adviser under President Donald Trump, has pleaded not guilty to 18 federal charges related to the unlawful retention and dissemination of classified documents. The indictment alleges that Bolton shared sensitive national defense information, written in "diary-like entries," with relatives. This case is the latest in a series of high-profile prosecutions by the Trump administration against its perceived political adversaries. Bolton was released on his own recognizance after the hearing, with a deadline for pretrial motions set for mid-November as the legal proceedings move forward.</p>

          <p>The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), the federal agency responsible for maintaining the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile, is preparing to furlough approximately 80% of its employees as its funding runs out due to the ongoing government shutdown. The chairman of the House Armed Services Committee warned that the agency's carry-over funds are nearly depleted, forcing it to place about 1,400 employees on leave. This development raises significant national security concerns, as the furloughs will impact personnel who manage and handle critical strategic assets. The shutdown, now the third-longest in modern history, continues with no resolution in sight.</p>

          <p>A potential meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump in Budapest faces significant logistical challenges due to a blanket ban on Russian aircraft in EU airspace. For Putin to travel to Hungary, his presidential plane would require special permission, or a derogation, from individual EU and NATO member states whose airspace he would need to cross. While Hungarian officials have assured he can enter the country, the flight path would likely need to be circuitous, possibly involving transit over Turkey and non-EU Balkan nations. The situation highlights the diplomatic complexities of arranging such a high-stakes summit amid current geopolitical tensions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Dutch government's recent seizure of chipmaker Nexperia was motivated by national security fears that its Chinese parent company, Wingtech, planned to transfer manufacturing operations to China. According to a former CEO, Dutch authorities were concerned that Wingtech had built a new factory in China capable of taking over production from Nexperia's European facilities. This would have resulted in the loss of one of Europe's largest chip manufacturers, a critical technological asset. The unprecedented government intervention, which involved ousting the company's Chinese CEO, has escalated technological and diplomatic tensions between the Netherlands and Beijing.</p>

          <p>A historic international agreement to mandate emissions reductions for the global shipping industry has been abandoned after the United States and Saudi Arabia successfully derailed the final approval talks. President Trump had labeled the plan a "green scam," and his administration reportedly threatened other nations with tariffs if they supported the deal. At the final meeting, a Saudi-led motion to adjourn the talks for a year passed by a narrow margin, effectively killing the agreement's timeline. The collapse is a major setback for climate action, disappointing environmental advocates and industry groups that sought consistent global standards for cleaner fuels.</p>

          <p>California State Senator Scott Wiener, a prominent Democrat known for his pro-housing legislation, will reportedly run for the congressional seat currently held by former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. While Wiener had previously established an exploratory committee, his decision to formally enter the race was apparently accelerated by the entry of another progressive candidate. Pelosi, who is 85 and has represented the San Francisco district since 1987, has not yet announced if she will seek another term. If elected, Wiener, a leading advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, would be the first openly gay person to represent San Francisco in Congress.</p>

          <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has condemned a local authority's decision to ban fans of Israeli soccer team Maccabi Tel Aviv from attending an upcoming match against Aston Villa in Birmingham. Starmer called the move "the wrong decision," asserting that the police's role is to ensure all fans can enjoy games without fear. The ban was recommended by a local safety advisory group and supported by police, who cited public safety concerns and previous violent incidents involving the team's fans in Amsterdam. Following the Prime Minister's criticism, the local Police and Crime Commissioner has requested a review of the decision.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides guidance on whether debt collectors can pursue legal action against individuals who are already making payments on a delinquent account. While establishing a payment plan is a positive step, it does not automatically protect a debtor from being sued unless a formal, written agreement explicitly states otherwise. Debt collectors may still file a lawsuit to secure a legal judgment, which grants them more powerful collection tools like wage garnishment. To minimize legal risk, individuals should always request payment agreements in writing, adhere strictly to the plan, and understand their rights under both state and federal consumer protection laws.</p>

          <p>Small businesses across the U.S. are facing significant financial distress due to President Donald Trump's tariffs, which have dramatically increased the cost of imported goods. Unlike larger corporations, small companies have less capacity to absorb these costs, forcing them to take on high-interest loans, raise consumer prices, freeze hiring, and delay investments. Many business owners report that these measures are already leading to softer sales and creating immense personal and financial stress. Economists warn that the struggles of these smaller enterprises could be a leading indicator of broader economic challenges to come for larger businesses as well. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The bodybuilding community is increasingly moving away from the traditional "dirty bulking" method, which involves consuming massive amounts of calories from any source to gain mass, toward a more moderate approach known as "lean bulking." This newer trend emphasizes a slight caloric surplus from healthy, whole foods to build muscle more slowly while minimizing fat gain. The shift is driven by a growing awareness of the long-term health risks associated with processed foods and a cultural desire to maintain a lean, chiseled physique year-round. However, experts caution that even lean bulking can lead to extreme dieting and body image issues.</p>
