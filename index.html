          <p>The Anti-Defamation League reported that Desmond Holly, the teen shooter at Evergreen High School in Colorado, was active on a "violent gore" website months before the attack. Holly, who officials say was radicalized by an extremist network, frequented a site known for hosting white supremacist content and graphic violence. The ADL noted that several other school shooters have also been active on the same website, which can be easily accessed by anyone, according to the ADL's Oren Segal. Beverly Kingston from Colorado University emphasized the importance of preventing interest in such sites by fostering connection and belonging on the pro-social side. The ADL shares findings with law enforcement to address the broader trend of violence influenced by nihilistic online spaces, rather than treating them as isolated incidents. Optimism score is not applicable to this type of event.</p>

          <p>China's Victory Day parade, featuring Xi Jinping alongside Putin and Kim Jong Un, sent a message to middle powers in the Global South, signaling an alternative to Western partnerships. Kim's attendance marked his first multilateral international appearance since the pandemic, providing North Korea with legitimacy without denuclearization. The parade projected an image of China as a diplomatic lifeline for isolated regimes, suggesting alignment with Beijing offers rehabilitation without reform. This trilateral display reassured domestic audiences, showed Global South nations alternatives to Western partnerships exist, and signaled to Washington that its sanctions regime has limits. The optics suggest not an axis of evil but an axis of the excluded – nations rejecting Western terms of engagement.</p>

          <p>Following the death of Charlie Kirk, the Trump administration requested an additional $58 million from Congress for security services to protect executive and judicial branch members. The request comes as House Democrats prepare for a security briefing after Kirk's killing, which has sparked anger and concern among conservatives who blame liberals and left-wing activists. Instances of political violence have been rapidly increasing in recent years, with over 520 plots and acts of terrorism in the first six months of 2025. House speaker Mike Johnson stated congressional leaders are reviewing security for members of congress, emphasizing the need to protect those who run for public office.</p>

          <p>East Los Angeles held its 79th annual Mexican Independence Day parade, marked by a renewed sense of defiance and pride amidst the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. Many felt it was crucial to show up and stand tall, fighting for their rights and others unable to fight for themselves. Concerns about immigration raids and a Supreme Court ruling allowing agents to detain individuals suspected of being in the U.S. illegally led some, like one attendee's grandmother, to stay home. Despite the fears, the parade proceeded with expressions of Latino joy and resistance, as participants waved Mexican and American flags, while signs protesting Trump and ICE lined the streets.</p>

          <p>Zheng Yongnian argues that China needs to rebuild its own knowledge system, expressing concerns about "intellectual colonialism" in the age of artificial intelligence. He believes that Western social science theories, based on Western methods and experiences, fail to explain Confucian, Islamic, and Indian societies. Zheng emphasizes the importance of embracing China's secular civilization to play a proper role in the international order. He advocates for Chinese researchers to develop theories rooted in their own cultural and societal contexts to better understand and shape the meaning of society and technology. The goal is to avoid relying solely on Western frameworks that may not be applicable to China's unique circumstances.</p>

          <p>Two men were arrested in Utah on suspicion of placing an incendiary device under a news media vehicle in Salt Lake City; the device did not detonate. Police and fire department bomb squads responded to the scene, determining the device had been lit but failed to function. A search warrant at a home in Magna led to the discovery of explosives, firearms, illegal narcotics, and hoax weapons of mass destruction. The suspects could face charges related to weapons possession and threats of terrorism, though a motive has not been released and the relationship between the two men is unknown.</p>

The roommate, who is reportedly in a romantic relationship with Robinson, has been described as "extremely cooperative" with the FBI and unaware of Robinson's alleged plans. The relative believes the roommate's views may have influenced Robinson's actions, suggesting he became progressively worse and more angry over the past year.

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a victim of Jeffrey Epstein, stated that Lord Mandelson should never have been appointed as the UK ambassador to the United States. Giuffre's brother, Sky Roberts, said the appointment reflected deep corruption within the system, while Business Secretary Peter Kyle admitted it was "highly unlikely" Mandelson would have been appointed had the extent of his relationship with Epstein been known. Mandelson was sacked after emails showed supportive messages to Epstein while he faced jail for sexual assault offenses, prompting calls for an independent inquiry into what was known about Mandelson's friendship with Epstein prior to his appointment. Giuffre took her own life in April, and her family continues to seek accountability for those involved with Epstein.</p>

Edmunds reports that 26.6% of trade-ins had negative equity in Q2 2025, with an average amount owed of $6,754. Factors like longer loan terms and smaller down payments contribute to this issue, which becomes problematic when selling or trading in the vehicle. Experts recommend researching credit scores and pre-approving for auto loans, and also suggest considering gap insurance to cover the difference between the vehicle's worth and what is owed if the vehicle is totaled.</p>

The US government claims the aid was benefiting terrorist groups, but the Taliban denies these allegations.

          <p>Buy now, pay later (BNPL) plans are gaining popularity among consumers as an alternative to credit cards, allowing purchases to be split into short-term, interest-free installments. However, banks and credit card companies are wary of BNPL, as it reduces card transaction activity and utilization. BNPL is attractive to those who either don't want to use credit cards or don't have enough open credit. The increasing use of BNPL also creates a gap in understanding consumer credit quality, posing a challenge for traditional financial institutions.

          <p>Following the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk at a Utah university, the state's open carry permit law is under renewed scrutiny. The law, which allows people with concealed-carry permits to openly carry firearms on college campuses, has raised concerns among university staff. While it's unclear if the suspected shooter was legally allowed to own or carry the rifle on campus, the timing of the bill's passage has drawn attention. Utah's gun laws, generally second amendment-friendly, have faced criticism for their potential impact on campus safety, with some arguing that increased accessibility to guns can deter violence, while others emphasize the need for more comprehensive safety measures.</p>

          <p>Texas Republican Rep. Michael McCaul, a leader in foreign policy, announced he will not seek reelection in 2026 after 11 terms, stating he is looking for a "new challenge" in the national security and foreign policy realm. McCaul has served as chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and has been a strong advocate for U.S. support for Ukraine. He disputed President Trump's comments about Russian drones over Poland and said the Sept. 11 attacks changed his life. McCaul's announcement comes during a time of change for Texas Republicans and amid redistricting efforts.</p>

          <p>More than 100,000 Paris Hilton mini fridges have been recalled due to fire and burn hazards, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission announced. The recall involves both 4-liter and 10-liter models sold online and in stores from November 2022 through July 2025. There have been at least 27 reports of the mini fridges overheating and catching fire, though no injuries have been reported. Consumers are advised to immediately stop using the fridges, unplug them, and register for the recall to receive a refund, which requires submitting photographs of the marked fridge and cut cord.</p>

          <p>Barron Trump, son of Donald and Melania Trump, is attending NYU, but has chosen to stay near his parents by enrolling in the NYU D.C. program. The NYU D.C. program, which combines coursework with internships tied to the government, accepts a limited number of students each semester. While Barron was initially enrolled in the NYU Stern School of Business, it is unclear if he will change his major to something more political. This decision allows Barron to remain close to his family, particularly his parents, during his college experience.</p>
