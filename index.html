          <p>A rare dust storm swept through northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, dramatically reducing visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue warnings for the Chicago area. The article describes how the dust storm, originating near Bloomington, Illinois, was fueled by strong winds from thunderstorms lifting dry soil from parched farmlands. The phenomenon, termed a haboob, caused near-zero visibility on major highways, creating hazardous driving conditions, and significantly impacted Chicago, reducing visibility to a quarter-mile at Midway Airport. This event marks only the second time the Weather Service office in Romeoville has issued a dust storm warning, highlighting the unusual nature of the event for the city, with comparisons drawn to the Dust Bowl era.</p>

          <p>India's recent military engagement with Pakistan, triggered by a terrorist attack, has underscored the ongoing strategic challenges posed by its neighbor, hindering India's aspirations as a major diplomatic and economic power.

          <p>Clayton Kershaw's season debut for the Dodgers was shaky, as the Angels secured an 11-9 victory.

Despite a strong offensive showing from the Dodgers, including a three-run homer by Andy Pages, the Angels ultimately prevailed with Logan O'Hoppe contributing a career-high five RBIs.

          <p>Elton John has criticized the UK government's plans to exempt technology firms from copyright laws, calling the proposals "theft" and accusing ministers of betraying artists. The article explains that the government's decision to allow AI firms to use artists' content without payment has sparked outrage among musicians and playwrights, who fear it will rob young people of their income and legacy. John specifically called out Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Technology Secretary Peter Kyle, threatening legal action if the government does not change its plans, as the issue is being debated in the House of Lords and the House of Commons.</p>

          <p>This commentary discusses the challenges in bringing despots like Vladimir Putin to justice, highlighting the limitations of international law and the lack of universal support for international courts. The article points out that while the establishment of a Special Tribunal for the Crime of Aggression against Ukraine is a positive step, it is unlikely to lead to Putin's swift trial and incarceration due to factors such as the outdated convention of head-of-state immunity and the rejection of international jurisdiction by autocratic allies and powerful states like the US. It suggests that the ineffectiveness of international law enforcement exacerbates global crises and undermines the post-1945 global order.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's corruption is not an isolated phenomenon, but rather part of a long-standing trend of foreign influence in American politics. The article highlights the Trump family's various business dealings with foreign entities, including a new cryptocurrency business and investments directed through Jared Kushner. It also points to past instances of foreign money influencing American politicians, such as the Clinton Foundation's acceptance of donations from foreign regimes. The author suggests measures to combat foreign corruption, such as preventing former politicians from serving as foreign lobbyists and barring family members of high-ranking officials from engaging in foreign lobbying or deals.</p>

The author suggests that America's car-centric culture is detrimental to happiness and mental health, and that investing in rail networks would offer a more sustainable and community-oriented way forward.</p>

Additionally, the Sunday Times reports on the establishment of a new Home Guard to protect against terror attacks, reflecting broader anxieties about national security in a pre-war era, and The Observer reveals that the UK's gambling regulator has "secretly" put 38 failing companies into special measures in the last five years.</p>
