          <p>Christine Lagarde, the president of the European Central Bank, cautioned that President Trump's attempts to influence the Federal Reserve pose a significant threat to both the U.S. and global economies. Lagarde emphasized the importance of the Fed's independence and noted that the U.S. Supreme Court would likely prevent Trump from dismissing a Fed governor without gross misconduct. She also expressed concern about the potential collapse of the French government and its impact on the Eurozone, while remaining optimistic about the stability of the French banking system. The article highlights the interconnectedness of global economies and the potential repercussions of political instability. Optimism is tempered by the potential economic dangers mentioned.

          <p>ScotRail has eliminated peak rail fares, allowing passengers to travel during busy weekday rush hours at lower prices. This initiative aims to encourage more commuters to switch from cars to trains, providing environmental benefits and financial relief for travelers. A previous pilot scheme in 2023 showed limited success, but First Minister John Swinney believes the new scheme will be financially sustainable through increased passenger numbers. If the scheme does not become self-financing, the costs will be covered by the ScotRail budget. The article conveys a sense of cautious optimism regarding the scheme's potential to improve public transport usage. </p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have engineered an elastic rubber band capable of converting body heat into electricity, potentially revolutionizing wearable devices like smartwatches.
