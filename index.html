          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to focus on the market's third-quarter winners, despite ongoing government shutdown headlines, suggesting these top performers offer a valuable roadmap for the year's final stretch. He highlighted companies like AppLovin, Western Digital, Seagate, and Warner Bros. Discovery for their substantial gains, attributing success to factors like AI demand and balance sheet improvements. Cramer believes many of these can continue rallying through the end of the year, but cautioned that the biggest gains for the year may have already been realized. Fund managers often acquire these successful stocks in the fourth quarter to present strong portfolios to clients, indicating potential sustained interest. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 17-year-old male in New Jersey has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder following a deadly hit-and-run incident. The teen allegedly struck and killed two girls, Maria Niotis and Isabella Salas, who were riding an electric-bike on Monday evening, leading to their deaths at area hospitals. Neighbors revealed that the suspect had reportedly been parked outside one of the girls' homes for months, and complaints made by the family were not acted upon.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Professor Nita Forouhi from the University of Cambridge offers expert guidance on selecting and using cooking oils, dispelling common myths. She affirms that sunflower and vegetable oils are beneficial, being low in saturated fats and rich in healthier mono- and polyunsaturated fats essential for heart and brain health. Modern margarines are also deemed healthy, with negligible trans fats, and can help reduce bad cholesterol. While extra virgin olive oil is ideal for dressings, basic olive oil suits shallow frying, and vegetable or sunflower oil is recommended for deep frying due to their higher smoke points, ensuring healthier cooking.</p>

          <p>Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has granted captain Martin Odegaard "total freedom" on the field, recognizing his inherent creativity as a crucial asset for the team. Despite a shoulder injury disrupting his early season, Odegaard's recent performances, including his pivotal role in Arsenal's 2-0 Champions League victory over Olympiacos where he contributed to both goals, underscore his importance. Arteta expressed confidence in the 26-year-old midfielder's ability to take risks and generate space, indicating that Odegaard's return to form is making a significant difference for the Gunners as they compete at Europe's top level.</p>

          <p>Hackers, operating under the name Radiant, who attempted to extort a nursery chain by publishing stolen images and private data of approximately 8,000 children on the darknet, now claim to have deleted all the information. This unusual reversal follows widespread public condemnation and direct threatening phone calls to parents, with the group stating, "We are sorry for hurting kids." Kido Schools reportedly did not pay the estimated £100,000 ransom. While the reliability of hackers' claims to delete data is often questionable, this incident highlights a rare instance where public outcry appears to have influenced cybercriminals' actions, suggesting an unexpected ethical boundary was crossed.</p>

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood and London Mayor Sir Sadiq Khan condemned the "disturbing" scenes. While investigations by the Independent Office for Police Conduct are underway, critics, including Mina Smallman, whose daughters were victims of police misconduct, emphasize that deep-seated cultural issues within the Met will require extensive effort to eradicate.</p>

          <p>Major tech companies, including YouTube, Meta, and X, have collectively paid nearly $60 million to settle lawsuits with Donald Trump concerning the suspension of his accounts post-January 6 Capitol riot. This capitulation, though a small financial sum for these giants, is viewed as an act of corporate cowardice that effectively validates Trump's claims and undermines their prior content moderation decisions. Critics argue this move allows tech firms to retreat from difficult editorial responsibilities, reinforcing their long-standing argument of being neutral platforms to avoid liability. This strategic pivot aligns with a broader political climate where demonstrably false beliefs are increasingly normalized.</p>

Democrats, conversely, assert they are fighting to secure vital healthcare funding guarantees for lower-income Americans, which Republicans oppose.

          <p>Manchester City twice squandered a lead, resulting in a 2-2 draw against Monaco in the Champions League after conceding a 90th-minute penalty. Star striker Erling Haaland, who netted both of City's goals, openly criticized the team's performance, stating they "don't deserve to win" and lacked sufficient energy in the second half. This result extends a concerning pattern for City of conceding crucial late goals, which has negatively impacted their standings in both the Premier League and Champions League.

          <p>Actor Eric Dane, diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is now dedicating his efforts to advocacy, championing the Accelerating Access to Critical Therapies for ALS Act. This crucial legislation, set to expire in 2026, provides vital funding for research and facilitates early access to treatments, which Dane emphasizes is essential given the often-delayed diagnosis for many patients. Initially filled with anger over his condition, Dane now expresses a fierce determination to fight for his life, aspiring to witness his daughters' significant life milestones. His public advocacy, despite a slight speech impediment, is inspiring hope for others affected by ALS.</p>

          <p>The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) prominently displayed a banner on its website blaming the "Radical Left" for the government shutdown, claiming they demand a $1.5 trillion wish list. This highly partisan message prompted the nonprofit Public Citizen to file a complaint, alleging a "blatant violation" of the Hatch Act, which restricts political activities by federal employees. White House and HUD spokespersons defended the messaging, while ethics experts criticized the administration for undermining ethics enforcement offices. This incident underscores the intense partisan blame game and political weaponization surrounding the ongoing government shutdown.</p>

          <p>Eight months into the Trump administration's second term, aggressive efforts to compel "sanctuary" cities and states to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement have yielded limited tangible results. Despite numerous lawsuits, threats of funding cuts, and increased ICE raids, most Democratic-led jurisdictions continue to uphold their policies. Federal courts have largely blocked attempts to withhold funds, with only Louisville, Kentucky, and the state of Nevada reversing their stances. Advocates for sanctuary policies argue they build community trust with local police, while opponents contend they obstruct federal law enforcement and compromise public safety.</p>

          <p>North Korea's military strategy is undergoing a fundamental shift, moving beyond its traditional reliance on nuclear deterrence to a comprehensive modernization of its conventional armed forces. Leader Kim Jong-un signaled this change, likely influenced by the Ukraine conflict's demonstration of conventional military capabilities. This evolution includes integrating cutting-edge technologies like unmanned systems and artificial intelligence, potentially with Russian assistance. The article emphasizes that this development introduces a critical and escalating new variable to the security situation across the Korean peninsula and the wider region, demanding global attention to the heightened military threat.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning "fundamental changes" to its asylum system, which will require refugees to wait longer than the current five years before they can apply for permanent settlement rights. Additionally, the automatic route for refugees to bring close relatives to the UK, temporarily suspended in September, will be permanently abolished. The prime minister justified these changes by stating that "settlement must be earned by contributing to the country," aligning with stricter rules for other legal migrants. Critics, including the Refugee Council, argue these measures will not deter illegal migration but instead push desperate individuals into the hands of smugglers.</p>

Bermuda's Minister of National Security, Michael Weeks, issued a dire warning, emphasizing the "seriousness of this threat" and urging immediate preparedness. Additionally, swells generated by Imelda and Hurricane Humberto are extending to the U.S. East Coast, creating life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.

          <p>The ongoing US government shutdown is significantly impacting federal agencies responsible for wildfires, weather, and disaster response, halting "nonessential" operations nationwide. The U.S. Forest Service will close extensive public lands and reduce fire prevention efforts, though active firefighting will continue. While core functions of the National Weather Service and FEMA are largely maintained, the shutdown jeopardizes state grants for forest management and could prevent FEMA from replenishing its critically low Disaster Relief Fund. Experts warn that a prolonged impasse could lead to severe backlogs and funding shortfalls, further weakening agencies already strained by budget cuts.</p>
