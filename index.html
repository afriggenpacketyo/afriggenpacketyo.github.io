          <p>WhatsApp is planning to roll out new features that will change how users interact with brands and provide companies with more opportunities to monetize user engagement. The new subscription model will allow channel admins to offer exclusive content for a monthly fee, enabling them to earn money from their most engaged followers. WhatsApp will also integrate ads into the "Updates" tab, allowing users to directly message brands if they see a product or service they want. Meta introduced the "Updates" tab on WhatsApp a year ago, and it is now visited by 1.5 billion people daily, with the "Chats" tab remaining end-to-end encrypted and ad-free.</p>

          <p>Bangladesh is preparing for elections following the resignation of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, with the interim government promising a credible poll, though law and order remain a significant concern. An agreement was reached between interim leader Muhammad Yunus and BNP leader Tarique Rahman that polls could be held in February 2026 if sufficient reforms are made, including constitutional changes and boosting judicial independence. However, the restoration of law and order to allow for a credible election that includes all major parties remains a priority, with concerns about the law and order situation, unruly mobs, and depoliticization being obstacles. The Awami League was banned last month pending trials for alleged crimes against humanity, but some observers believe the party should be allowed to participate in the upcoming polls because it still enjoys broad support.</p>

          <p>In the Sean "Diddy" Combs trial in New York City, a juror was dismissed due to inconsistencies in his statements about where he lived. The judge expressed concerns about the juror's candor and whether he shaded answers to get on and stay on the jury. The dismissed juror was a 41-year-old Black man who claimed to live in the Bronx, but there was debate about whether he actually lived there or in New Jersey. He was replaced with a 57-year-old white man from Westchester, and the trial resumed with a paralegal presenting charts and texts sent by Combs' staff. </p>

          <p>Leaders of the world's largest advanced economic powers are gathering in Canada for the Group of Seven summit, with trade instability and turmoil in Ukraine and the Middle East dominating talks. Uncertainty over these major issues largely arises from the White House's economic and foreign policy, prompting allies to question U.S. President Donald Trump's stance on major geopolitical points. The summit takes place while Trump's 90-day pause on "reciprocal" tariffs is still in effect, with Japan and the EU looking to strike a deal before the July 9 deadline. Bilateral meetings between Trump and leaders looking for a trade deal are expected to take place, but the odds of any big bang deals being struck are uncertain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With potential Federal Reserve rate cuts on the horizon, experts are weighing in on which certificate of deposit (CD) term is the most beneficial for savers. Short-term CDs are currently offering the highest interest rates, while long-term CDs provide longer-term security and predictability, though they may have lower rates. A CD ladder, which involves opening several CD accounts with varying term lengths, can provide the best of both worlds by offering flexibility and access to cash at regular intervals. Regardless of the chosen term, experts recommend doing research and shopping around to find the most competitive CD rates, as there can be significant differences depending on the bank or credit union.

          <p>The United States' year of hosting major soccer events, including the Club World Cup and Concacaf Gold Cup, has begun with underwhelming attendance figures. Despite enthusiasm from analysts, the spectacle felt flat, with attendances reflecting this sentiment, as evidenced by unsold tickets and price cuts. The United States men's national team's win against Trinidad and Tobago was satisfying, but only a small crowd turned up, and Mexico also failed to pack out SoFi Stadium. However, some exciting moments were salvaged from the proceedings, including Lionel Messi's performance and Al Ahly's challenge of Inter Miami, highlighting the enduring appeal of soccer despite the commercial aspects.</p>

As part of the agreement, At Home expects to transition ownership to its lenders, and the majority of its stores will remain open.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home lending experts have outlined three possible mortgage rate scenarios for this summer, anticipating limited movement unless there's a clear break in labor or inflation unexpectedly cools. The most optimistic prediction sees a modest decline, with 30-year fixed mortgage rates potentially averaging around 6.6% by August. If inflation jumps above 3% or the economy grows too fast, mortgage interest rates could rise, while a cooling economy could lead to a decline in rates. However, experts caution against trying to time the market perfectly, and advise focusing on variables you can control and consulting a mortgage lender to lock in a rate soon.

The parade, which included tanks, missiles, airplanes, and parachutists, was met with a small turnout and a low-energy crowd. The event contrasted sharply with large-scale protests across the country, with millions taking to the streets in displays under the banner “No Kings.” The parade was seen as an attempt by Trump to celebrate his seizure of power and underscore his determination to quash dissent, using the armed forces as an ornament to his ego and a threat to his enemies.</p>

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was examining the reports, and the health ministry reported that many of the casualties on Monday had suffered gunshot wounds, including to the head. Before Monday's incident, the health ministry said that at least 300 people had been killed and more than 2,600 wounded near aid distribution sites since the GHF began operations in Gaza on 26 May.</p>

Smith is being kept alive via life support without her family’s prior consent so that her unborn child can continue to gestate until delivery. Emory University Hospital’s decision was influenced by Georgia’s abortion ban, but the ethical questions involved are more related to deciding who ought to make decisions for permanently incapacitated people. From the pro-life vantage point, Smith’s story is not solely about abortion; it’s about preserving Smith’s life, too, as principled pro-life beliefs apply not only to fetuses but to the incapacitated as well.</p>
