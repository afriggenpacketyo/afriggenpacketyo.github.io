            <p>President Trump paused his administration's reciprocal tariffs after the bond market reacted negatively, signaling investor concerns about the potential economic impact. The bond market's reaction, characterized by sliding bond prices and rising yields, prompted economists to raise concerns about recession risks and reignited inflation. This situation mirrors past instances where presidents like Clinton and Obama faced bond market pressure over fiscal policies. Increased bond yields could strain the federal budget, highlighting the bond market's role as a check on government policies. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>New York City's Garment District is bracing for the impact of President Trump's tariffs, which are raising costs and creating business risks for apparel companies. Fabric importers are seeing customers put on the brakes, seeking alternative production locations due to the increased import taxes. These tariffs, intended to revitalize domestic manufacturing, are expected to impact nearly every aspect of garment production, leading to higher costs for both businesses and consumers. Some predict a rise in the secondhand market as shoppers seek cheaper alternatives, while domestic manufacturers fear the shift is happening too quickly.</p>

His pairing with Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley, who has stated Mickelson is unlikely to be involved this time, adds another layer of intrigue.

            <p>A CNBC/Survey Monkey poll reveals that 73% of Americans are financially stressed, with 66% attributing this stress to tariff wars. Rising prices for essentials like food, energy, and shelter, driven by inflation, supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical events, contribute to the stress. While inflation has cooled, its impact on purchasing power remains a concern, and experts warn that Trump's trade war could further pressure prices. A majority of those surveyed oppose Trump's tariff policy and are concerned about its impact on their personal finances. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A Los Angeles judge ruled in favor of Sony Pictures Television, granting the company the right to take over distribution of its game shows 'Jeopardy!' and 'Wheel of Fortune' from CBS. Sony had filed a breach-of-contract lawsuit, alleging that CBS entered into unauthorized licensing deals for the shows. CBS plans to appeal the ruling, arguing that the contract with Sony is not yet terminated. The outcome of the case could significantly impact the distribution and revenue streams for these popular game shows.</p>

            <p>India's efforts to engage with the Trump administration and make concessions on tariffs have not resulted in the desired exemptions. The US announced a reciprocal tariff on India, citing high tariffs charged by the country, leading to disappointment in New Delhi. Despite India's proactive engagement with Trump's team, the US-India relationship has not significantly improved. The situation highlights the challenges of navigating trade relations with the US under the current administration.</p>

            <p>President Trump acknowledged 'transition problems' and 'difficulty' as US markets fell amid uncertainty over his global tariff war. Despite pausing tariffs on most countries, Trump pressed on with trade war with China, who increased retaliatory tariffs. China also said it would cut the number of American-made films shown in its cinemas, and claimed the tariff dispute has dampened audience appetite for Hollywood. The European Union meanwhile said it would be pausing the countermeasures it had planned to impose on the US from 15 April also for 90 days.</p>

The swings also hit the bond market despite a better-than-expected report on inflation. U.S. crude oil prices fell more than 3%.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is considering placing Columbia University under a consent decree, a dramatic escalation in the federal government’s crackdown on the Ivy League institution, over allegations that the school failed to protect students from antisemitism on campus. If Columbia resists, the justice department would need to present its case for the agreement in court, a process that could drag on for years with the university risking its federal funding in the interim. Federal immigration authorities arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia graduate and prominent Palestinian activist who participated in campus protests. He remains in detention.</p>

            <p>U.S. stocks closed sharply lower, wiping away some of the previous day's rally as investors digested President Donald Trump's decision to suspend some tariffs while escalating a trade war with China. Hours after markets opened, the White House said U.S. tariffs on China stand at 145%, more than the 125% levy that had been widely reported a day earlier. The news sent shares falling further than they had earlier in the day. China rebuked the U.S. early Thursday morning in response to Trump's decision to hike cumulative tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%. Beijing said it would restrict imports of Hollywood films.</p>

The Chinese president wants to show his people that the country can withstand the economic pain from President Donald Trump's tariffs and stand up to what Beijing is calling America's "bullying," according to experts. Trump's trade war also feeds into the strategy that Xi has been working on for years: become less reliant on the United States.</p>
