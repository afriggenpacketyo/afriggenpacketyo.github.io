          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed several key foreign policy issues in an interview, including the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia, where the Vatican has offered to host direct meetings. Rubio mentioned Russia's openness to such a meeting under the right conditions and noted a potential prisoner exchange. He also addressed U.S. patience with diplomatic efforts and the possibility of a direct conversation between President Trump and Vladimir Putin. Regarding Venezuela, Rubio rejected the intelligence community's assessment on the Tren de Aragua gang, asserting its ties to the Maduro regime and its involvement in violence abroad. Finally, he addressed the Middle East, emphasizing the U.S.'s support for ending Hamas's governance in Gaza and working towards a peaceful future for the region.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has initiated extensive ground operations throughout the northern and southern Gaza Strip, signaling a new phase in the ongoing conflict with Hamas. This intensified campaign aims to pressure Hamas into releasing hostages and ultimately dismantling the group or forcing its surrender. Despite the military's claims of targeting Hamas infrastructure and operatives, many civilians, including children, have been killed. The expansion of military operations occurs alongside indirect cease-fire talks in Doha, Qatar, with Prime Minister Netanyahu indicating a willingness to discuss terms for a broader deal to end the war, though Hamas has remained firm in its rejection of disarming. This article highlights the dire situation for Gazan civilians, who are facing near-constant bombardment and the threat of displacement.</p>

Sinner, who was returning from a three-month doping ban, put up a strong fight but ultimately couldn't match Alcaraz's dominance, especially in the second set. Alcaraz expressed his happiness at seeing Sinner back at a high level and praised his own mental approach and tactical play during the match.</p>

          <p>Authorities have identified 25-year-old Guy Edward Bartkus as the suspect in the Palm Springs fertility clinic bombing, believing he acted intentionally and died in the blast. The FBI described Bartkus as having 'nihilistic ideations' and indicated he may have attempted to livestream the attack, which they are treating as an act of terrorism. The explosion, caused by a large vehicle-borne improvised explosive device, resulted in one death (the suspect) and injured four others. While the clinic's office space was damaged, the IVF lab and stored embryos remained secure, with the facility expected to reopen soon.</p>

          <p>Russia launched one of its largest drone attacks on Ukraine, primarily targeting Kyiv, just before President Trump's planned discussion with President Vladimir Putin. Ukrainian officials reported that approximately 273 drones and decoys were detected, resulting in one woman's death and several injuries. The Ukrainian Air Force claimed to have intercepted 88 drones, while 128 others disappeared from radar. This attack is part of a pattern of escalating aerial bombardments, with waves of over 100 drones becoming increasingly common, as Russia appears to be attempting to demonstrate its strength before diplomatic talks.</p>

          <p>This article discusses how Desi Arnaz, a Cuban immigrant, revolutionized television by insisting on playing Lucille Ball's husband in "I Love Lucy," despite network executives' doubts about a Latino man being accepted in such a role. Arnaz's vaudeville tour with Ball proved their chemistry, leading CBS to film a test episode, sponsored by Philip Morris cigarettes. His success challenged racism and pushed for diversity in the entertainment industry. Furthermore, Arnaz innovated television production by filming the show, enabling reruns and creating a syndication market, leaving a lasting impact on Hollywood's business model and representation of Latino stories.</p>

Trump's recent actions, including shaking hands with Syria's new leader and lifting sanctions, signal a departure from decades of prioritizing Israel's interests. While the U.S. is not abandoning its ties with Israel, Trump's focus on negotiating peace deals and business deals with Gulf States indicates a new dynamic where Israel is less central.

          <p>Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who previously defended former President Joe Biden's fitness, now admits Biden made a mistake in running again, though he denies any cover-up. Khanna acknowledged his error and emphasized the need for an explanation from Biden's advisors. Despite this, Khanna praised Biden's accomplishments, including the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. He also reiterated his focus on a working-class economic agenda, termed "economic patriotism," and expressed support for Trump's efforts to secure a nuclear deal with Iran and get aid into Gaza.</p>

          <p>Student loan borrowers are bracing for wage garnishment as the Trump administration resumes collection activity on defaulted loans after a half-decade pause. This policy shift could affect millions of borrowers, with more than 5 million currently in default and the total potentially rising to 10 million. Many borrowers, like special education teacher Jason Collier and retiree Marceline Paul, fear the financial strain of having their wages or Social Security benefits garnished. Experts warn that such withholdings can force people to choose between vital expenses, especially in an environment where the cost of living remains stubbornly high. (not investment advice)</p>
