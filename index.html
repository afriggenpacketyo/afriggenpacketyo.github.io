          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is set to announce new sanctions targeting Russia at the G7 summit, aiming to increase economic pressure on the Kremlin and restrict Vladimir Putin's war efforts in Ukraine. The sanctions, designed to squeeze Russia's energy revenues and reduce funds for the illegal war, are expected to be unveiled alongside other Ukraine allies. However, it appeared unlikely that the US would join the move after Donald Trump signalled his opposition to further measures during the G7 summit in Canada, saying the sanctions "cost [the US] a lot of money". Starmer emphasized that Russia doesn't hold all the cards, indicating a strong stance against Russian aggression. </p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump has urged residents of Tehran to evacuate the city after Israel launched heavy missile attacks on the Iranian capital. Trump posted on his Truth Social account, stating, "Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!" He also reiterated that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.

          <p>The number of Americans aged 55 and older experiencing homelessness is increasing, with estimates projecting a near tripling by 2030. Many factors contribute to this trend, including the death of a spouse, job loss, eviction, and mounting medical issues. Health workers are concerned about the vulnerability of this aging population, who often have multiple complex chronic medical conditions. Experts suggest that the trend is linked to the Baby Boomer generation's economic struggles and the impact on healthcare systems. The article highlights the challenges faced by older individuals navigating homelessness and the need for supportive services. </p>

          <p>A survey suggests that awareness of nicotine pouches among young people under 18 is increasing. The percentage of 11-17 year olds aware of the pouches grew from 38% in 2024 to 43% this year. The survey indicates that nearly 4% of children in this age group have tried a nicotine pouch. Action on Smoking and Health (Ash) is urging the government to prioritize the Tobacco and Vapes Bill, which will ban the marketing and sale of nicotine pouches to under 18s. Nicotine pouches are small rectangles containing nicotine and are considered less harmful than smoking, but they are highly addictive and not recommended for teenagers. </p>

          <p>Japan, traditionally known for its pacifist constitution, is increasingly focused on global arms exports. This shift aims to deepen ties and enhance interoperability with allies and partners. By exporting arms, Japan can improve interoperability through standardized maintenance and joint training. This move also supports the development of Japan's defense industrial base, which has been struggling. Veteran investor David Roche suggests that building domestic capacity is crucial for Japan's security, especially given potential changes in U.S. defense policy. </p>

          <p>Donald Trump is leaving the G7 summit early due to escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, with potential U.S. involvement.
