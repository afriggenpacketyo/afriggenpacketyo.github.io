          <p>The Group of Seven (G7) summit in Canada is focusing on ongoing trade instability and geopolitical turmoil in Ukraine and the Middle East. Uncertainty surrounding these issues, largely stemming from the White House's economic and foreign policy, prompts allies to question President Trump's alignment with them. Trade tariffs imposed by Trump and the potential for a global trade war are key concerns, though the U.K. has secured a trade deal with Washington. Bilateral meetings are expected, but the likelihood of significant trade deals remains uncertain. Optimism for immediate resolution is tempered by existing tensions and policy differences.</p>

          <p>Vance Luther Boelter, 57, has been apprehended in Minnesota on suspicion of fatally shooting Democratic state representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and wounding Democratic State Senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette.

Boelter, armed at the time of his arrest, surrendered peacefully and faces multiple charges, including second-degree murder and attempted murder.

          <p>Airbus has overtaken Boeing as the world's largest planemaker, driven by Boeing's recent struggles with technical failures and production issues. The Air India Flight 171 crash, which resulted in numerous fatalities, further underscores concerns about operational safety. Boeing reported a significant operating loss in 2024, delivering fewer commercial airplanes than Airbus, while Airbus posted a substantial operating profit. The contrast in handling their largest aircraft, the A380 and 787 Dreamliner, respectively, highlights the different approaches and outcomes for each company. The rivalry between Airbus and Boeing extends to government subsidies and competition in the space and defense sectors.</p>

The site, previously run by the Bon Secours Sisters, was found in 2016 to contain significant quantities of human remains of babies and children. The Office of the Director of Authorised Intervention (ODAIT) is overseeing the excavation, aiming to recover, analyze, and respectfully bury the remains. The initial phase involves setting up the site with security and hoarding to ensure forensic integrity, with family members and survivors to be given the opportunity to view the site perimeter in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p>In Hawaii, scientists are using drones to release male mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia bacteria to combat avian malaria, which threatens native honeycreepers. These lab-reared male mosquitoes don't bite and, when they mate with wild females, their eggs do not hatch, reducing the overall mosquito population. The warming climate allows mosquitoes to climb to higher elevations where the last remaining honeycreepers live, and this is a race against time to save these endangered birds. This approach has been successful in other parts of the world to combat human diseases.</p>

Trump warned Iran against retaliating against U.S. targets and suggested a deal between Iran and Israel was possible. He also spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin about the conflict.</p>

This regulatory approval clears the final hurdle for the transaction, which remains subject to customary closing conditions. The golden share typically allows the holder veto power over significant company decisions. The transaction is expected to be completed promptly. (not investment advice)</p>

Critics argue that Trump and his administration have blurred the lines between public duties and private profit-making, with examples ranging from real estate deals to cryptocurrency ventures. These actions have drawn condemnation from ethics watchdogs and raised concerns about the erosion of ethical norms. Trump's team dismisses these concerns, asserting that his actions are in the best interests of the American public.</p>

          <p>Millions of people relying on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) are facing potential changes that could reduce benefits and restrict food choices. The Trump administration is allowing more states to ban sugary foods and drinks purchased with SNAP, and the budget reconciliation bill proposes significant program cuts. These changes could force recipients to make difficult choices between nutritional needs and mere survival. New work requirements and limited childcare options add further challenges for single parents, while some states may opt out of the program entirely, impacting low-income families severely.</p>
