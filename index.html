          <p>Lando Norris of McLaren emerged victorious in a dramatic Miami Grand Prix sprint race, capitalizing on a timely safety car deployment. Oscar Piastri, Norris's teammate, initially led after overtaking Kimi Antonelli, but the safety car period allowed Norris to pit for slick tires and gain the lead. Max Verstappen faced a challenging race, finishing fourth but receiving a 10-second penalty for an unsafe pit release that damaged Antonelli's car. The race was marked by a crash involving Fernando Alonso and Liam Lawson, contributing to the overall chaos of the wet-dry conditions.</p>

Rubio had criticized the move as tyranny, but the German foreign ministry defended the decision as a result of a thorough and independent investigation to protect the constitution and rule of law. The BfV, Germany's domestic intelligence service, designated the AfD as an extremist threat due to its xenophobic stances and incompatibility with the country's democratic order.</p>

          <p>The United States has imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, potentially increasing prices for new and used vehicles, repairs, and insurance. The tariffs, ordered by President Trump to promote domestic manufacturing, follow earlier tariffs on imported cars. While the tariffs aim to incentivize domestic production, they are expected to raise costs for consumers and create uncertainty for automakers. Exemptions for parts from Canada and Mexico will ease the burden on some companies, but the overall impact is expected to be significant.</p>
