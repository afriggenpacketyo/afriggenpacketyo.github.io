        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" faced a setback in the House of Representatives as Republicans failed to advance the tax breaks and spending cuts package. Disagreements among Republicans include the extent of budget cuts, with some demanding steeper reductions to avoid increasing America's public debt. Contentious items include cuts to Medicaid, with some lawmakers arguing against any reductions to healthcare for lower-income constituents. Another point of contention is the proposed tripling of a local tax deduction, which some lawmakers from high-tax states find insufficient.</p>

          <p>Teachers at Westbourne Academy in Ipswich are on strike, citing concerns over pupil behavior, including students throwing objects and disrupting classes, and a lack of support from the senior leadership team. Teachers report feeling unsafe and struggling with their mental health, leading some to resign. Social media and mobile phones are seen as contributing factors to the poor behavior, with students believing they don't need to work hard. Parents have expressed mixed opinions, with some supporting the strike and others criticizing it, while the school acknowledges a minority of pupils whose behavior does not meet expectations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ahead of a UK/EU summit, youth mobility and fishing rights have emerged as key negotiating points. The EU seeks a "youth mobility scheme" allowing citizens aged 18-30 to stay up to four years, but concerns exist about its impact on UK immigration numbers. Fishing rights are another sticking point, with the EU pushing for an extension of current arrangements, while UK fishing groups want changes. Brexit has impacted both youth movement and fishing, with fewer EU students coming to the UK and challenges for UK fish exports to the EU.</p>

          <p>Tesla has changed its corporate bylaws to require shareholders to hold at least 3% of the company's stock to sue for breach of fiduciary duties, taking advantage of a Texas state law. This move follows Tesla's shift of incorporation from Delaware to Texas after a court ruling against Elon Musk's compensation package. Experts note this change creates a significant barrier for shareholders seeking legal action against Tesla insiders. The move comes as Tesla appeals the decision to rescind Musk's 2018 CEO compensation package.</p>

          <p>President Trump suggested that his past criticism of Taylor Swift has negatively impacted her popularity. Trump posted, "Has anyone noticed that, since I said 'I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,' she's no longer 'HOT'?" A White House official stated Trump is qualified to comment on celebrity trends. The comments follow Swift's endorsement of Kamala Harris in the past. Trump has previously questioned Swift's liberal political views, expressing surprise that a country star could be successful while being liberal.</p>

          <p>A woman discovered she unknowingly traveled to Madrid under the wrong identity after British Airways mistakenly issued her a boarding pass with another person's name. She was able to board the flight and sit in business class without anyone noticing the discrepancy. The airline later claimed she was a no-show, cancelling her return flight. BA has offered a goodwill voucher and refunded the cost of the extra ticket. The incident raises security concerns as the airline's security protocols failed to identify the mismatch between the boarding pass and passport.</p>

Moody's expects federal deficits to widen, reaching nearly 9% of GDP by 2035. The downgrade came as the House Budget Committee rejected a tax cut package, including extending tax cuts first enacted in 2017. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In Blackwood, New Jersey, an 18-year-old girl escaped from her home, alleging that her stepfather and mother had imprisoned her for seven years, subjecting her to sexual abuse and confinement, including being locked in a dog crate and chained in a bathroom. Prosecutors have announced charges against her mother, Brenda Spencer, and stepfather, Branndon Mosely, including assault, criminal restraint, and kidnapping. The case has drawn comparisons to a similar episode in Connecticut. The girl's younger sister had also been removed from school to conceal the abuse.</p>
