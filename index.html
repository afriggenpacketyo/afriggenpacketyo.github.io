          <p>Experts at a CNBC conference in Bangkok emphasized the importance for nations, particularly in emerging economies, to develop "sovereign AI" to maintain strategic autonomy. This involves creating AI technologies and large language models tailored to local languages and cultures, rather than relying on English-centric systems from companies like OpenAI. Panelists suggested that utilizing open-source AI models and accessible cloud computing services can democratize access and empower countries to build their own AI ecosystems. This approach aims to ensure the benefits of the rapidly growing AI market are distributed more inclusively.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has frozen an estimated $6.8 billion in federal education funds, with California set to lose over $811 million. The withheld funds, appropriated by Congress for the current fiscal year, were designated for teacher training, after-school programs, and support for English learners and migrant students. California's Superintendent of Public Instruction, Tony Thurmond, condemned the action as illegal, stating it will immediately harm students as school districts had already budgeted for these resources. The administration's move targets programs it aims to eliminate, citing a need to de-emphasize bilingualism. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A coalition of six Republican state legislators in California has formally requested that President Trump direct immigration enforcement to prioritize violent criminals over non-criminal workers. In a letter, the lawmakers stated that recent widespread ICE raids are causing fear within communities and creating labor shortages in critical industries like construction and hospitality. They argue that the current tactics harm businesses and families, exacerbating the state's affordability crisis. The letter also calls for an expansion of legal guest worker programs and a pathway to legal status for non-criminal immigrants.</p>

Tolentino was a principal author of the Philippine Maritime Zones Act, which formalizes Manila's territorial claims and has been strongly opposed by China.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A private survey indicated that China's factory activity among export-oriented manufacturers unexpectedly expanded in June, contrasting with official data that showed a contraction. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI rose to 50.4, surpassing expectations and rebounding from May's contraction, driven largely by a rebound in export orders. This divergence is attributed to the Caixin survey's focus on smaller, export-focused firms that may be front-loading shipments to avoid potential U.S. tariffs. While official PMI figures suggest broader manufacturing weakness, both surveys point towards some recovery in the sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom successfully pushed significant housing reform legislation through the California Legislature, aimed at speeding up construction by easing environmental review standards. The new laws, AB 130 and SB 131, exempt most urban housing projects from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a law often blamed for delaying development. To ensure passage, Newsom attached the legislation to the state budget, effectively forcing lawmakers to approve it. Experts believe these are the most consequential CEQA reforms in decades and will immediately unlock numerous housing projects.</p>

Canadian officials framed the move as part of a "bigger negotiation," and trade talks between the two nations have since resumed.

          <p>A top U.S. military commander has proposed reassigning 200 of the 4,000 National Guard troops deployed to Los Angeles to assist with wildfire preparations elsewhere in California. The deployment, ordered by President Trump to handle protests against ICE, has been controversial and legally challenged by Governor Gavin Newsom, who argued it was illegal and depleted firefighting resources. State officials had warned the move left its wildfire force at only 40% capacity ahead of an expected active fire season.

          <p>The Los Angeles County medical examiner has identified 54-year-old Kevin Devine as the 18th victim of the deadly Eaton fire. Devine, an actor and substitute teacher, was last seen outside his Altadena apartment on January 7, the day the fire ignited. His remains were discovered in April, and it was confirmed he died from burns and smoke inhalation. This identification brings the total number of known fatalities from the combined Palisades and Eaton fires to 30, with one victim still unidentified.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, the man accused of murdering four University of Idaho students in 2022, has reportedly been offered a plea deal to avoid the death penalty. An attorney for the family of victim Kaylee Goncalves confirmed the proposed deal, which was met with fury by the family, who expressed their frustration with the prosecutor's office on social media. The deal would reportedly involve Kohberger pleading guilty to the four murders in exchange for life in prison. Kohberger was arrested weeks after the stabbings and linked to the crime scene through DNA evidence.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government is confronting a significant internal rebellion over proposed changes to the welfare system, particularly to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip). Despite holding a large majority, Prime Minister Keir Starmer is engaged in a major persuasion effort to convince dozens of his own MPs to support the plan. Many backbenchers are concerned that tightening eligibility criteria will harm vulnerable people and that a planned review will conclude too late to influence the changes. The government argues the reforms are necessary for the long-term financial stability of the welfare state.</p>

          <p>A study by Chinese scientists has discovered that betaine, a compound naturally produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise, can help slow the aging process. The research, published in the journal Cell, reveals that betaine acts as a messenger that prevents inflammation and organ aging by inhibiting a specific enzyme. This finding provides insight into the molecular mechanisms behind the anti-aging benefits of physical activity. The discovery could also lead to new anti-aging strategies that simulate the effects of exercise.</p>
