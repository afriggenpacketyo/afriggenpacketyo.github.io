          <p>Former Cleveland Browns running back Nick Chubb has agreed to a one-year deal with the Houston Texans, potentially worth up to $5 million. The agreement, contingent on a successful physical, includes a base salary of $2.5 million.

          <p>Asian needle ants, an invasive species with a potentially fatal sting, have been detected in more than a dozen states across the U.S., primarily in the Southeast. These ants, technically known as Brachyponera chinensis, pose a particular risk to individuals with allergies to bee and ant stings, potentially causing anaphylactic shock. Experts advise vigilance and caution, especially in areas with logs, rotting wood, or rocks where the ants tend to nest. The ants also disrupt local ecosystems by outcompeting native ant species crucial for seed dispersal.

Miliband argued that improved economic stability allowed for the change, while maintaining that the wealthiest pensioners should not receive the payment. Critics, including Conservative shadow chancellor Mel Stride, questioned the funding source and criticized the initial cuts, while the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggested the funds could be better used to address poverty among families with children.

          <p>American fund managers are lobbying Congress to amend Section 899 of President Trump's tax bill, warning that it could lead to foreign investors withdrawing from U.S. stock markets. The Investment Company Institute (ICI) argues that the provision, intended to penalize foreign-owned firms from countries with "unfair foreign taxes," could inadvertently impact most foreign investments in U.S. equities. The ICI suggests that the U.S. fund management industry, which has invested around $18 trillion in U.S. stock markets, would suffer "collateral damage" due to the provision's impact. The article discusses the potential economic consequences of the proposed tax measures. (not investment advice)</p>
