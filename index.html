          <p>Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, 81, was hospitalized with significant injuries, including a fractured thoracic vertebrae, after his vehicle was struck from behind at high speed. The incident occurred in New Hampshire after Giuliani had stopped to assist a woman who reported being a victim of domestic violence. According to his spokesperson, Giuliani is recovering and in good spirits, and the collision is not believed to have been a targeted attack. The statement urged the public to respect his privacy and avoid speculation during his recovery.</p>

          <p>A protest in Epping, Essex, against the housing of approximately 140 asylum seekers at The Bell Hotel resulted in at least two arrests. Clashes occurred as around 200 demonstrators gathered, prompting police to enforce a dispersal order. Tensions in the area have been high since an asylum seeker housed at the hotel was charged with sexually assaulting a teenage girl last month. The protest followed a Court of Appeal decision to overturn an injunction that would have blocked the use of the hotel for housing migrants, with police urging peaceful demonstration.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has announced that Abu Obeida, the prominent spokesman for Hamas's armed wing, was killed in an airstrike in Gaza City. The operation, a joint effort by the IDF and Shin Bet, targeted an apartment building where he was located, based on prior intelligence. While Hamas has not yet confirmed his death, Israel's Defence Minister praised the "flawless execution" of the strike. The event occurs as Israel prepares for a potential larger offensive into Gaza City, raising concerns about further civilian casualties and the fate of remaining hostages.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington D.C. has issued an emergency order to stop the Trump administration's plan to deport nearly 700 unaccompanied Guatemalan children. The ruling came after immigrant advocates filed a lawsuit, arguing the plan was illegal and deprived the minors of their due process rights to seek asylum. Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan's order, which applies for at least 14 days, required that children already on planes be returned to Office of Refugee Resettlement facilities. The government contended it was reuniting children with their families, a claim disputed by the children's lawyers.</p>

          <p>White House trade adviser Peter Navarro strongly criticized a recent U.S. Court of Appeals decision that ruled most of President Trump's tariffs illegal, calling it "weaponized partisan injustice." Navarro stated that if the ruling is upheld by the Supreme Court, "it will be the end of the United States." The court found that Trump overstepped his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose sweeping tariffs. The administration plans to appeal the decision, with Trump falsely claiming on social media that the tariffs have already generated trillions of dollars for the country.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security announced plans to expand its immigration enforcement operations in Chicago, a move met with strong opposition from local and state leaders. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed that more resources would be allocated to the city, following President Trump's criticism of Chicago's crime rates and sanctuary city policies. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson have condemned the plan, with Pritzker calling a potential deployment of troops "an invasion." Mayor Johnson signed an order barring city police from assisting federal immigration enforcement efforts.</p>

          <p>Liverpool defeated Arsenal 1-0 at Anfield after a late, brilliantly executed free-kick from Dominik Szoboszlai in the 83rd minute. The match, billed as an early-season test between title contenders, was largely a cautious and tactical affair. Arsenal, under manager Mikel Arteta, adopted a conservative approach that seemed aimed at securing a draw but ultimately left them with nothing. The loss extends Arsenal's winless streak at Anfield to 13 Premier League games, a significant psychological blow for a team with high aspirations after a major summer spending spree.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has declared his intention to issue an executive order requiring identification for all voters in U.S. elections, a move widely considered unconstitutional. The U.S. Constitution grants states, not the president, the primary authority to regulate elections. Trump also stated he wants to ban most mail-in voting, despite having used it himself. This push is rooted in his baseless claims of fraud in the 2020 election. Critics argue that such measures would disproportionately disenfranchise minority, low-income, and disabled voters, as a significant percentage of the electorate lacks state-required forms of ID.</p>

          <h2>Op-Ed Argues Trump's Unpredictable Ukraine Policy Creates Stalemate Benefiting Putin</h2>

          <p>An opinion article argues that President Trump's contradictory and improvisational approach to the war in Ukraine has created a confusing stalemate that ultimately benefits Vladimir Putin. The author contends that while Trump claims he can end the war, his vacillating policy signals a lack of a coherent strategy, allowing Putin to exploit the uncertainty and prolong the conflict. The piece suggests that unless Trump adopts a clear and forceful policy to coerce Putin, he risks being seen not as a peacemaker but as a president who inadvertently helped Russia achieve its imperial ambitions.</p>

          <p>Bishop Montgomery High School in Torrance has fired its football coach and co-athletic director, Ed Hodgkiss, amid a growing sports scandal that critics say the Archdiocese of Los Angeles should have prevented. The school was forced to forfeit a major game after five transfer students were declared ineligible by the Southern Section for providing false information. The situation mirrors a previous scandal at another Catholic school, St. Bernard, where an aggressive push to build a top team with transfers led to investigations and the eventual collapse of its football program.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has finalized a £10 billion agreement to supply the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 anti-submarine frigates, marking the UK's largest-ever warship export deal by value. The warships will be constructed at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow, a move the government says will support 4,000 UK jobs. This strategic partnership strengthens NATO's northern flank by creating a combined fleet of 13 British and Norwegian frigates designed to operate jointly. The deal represents a significant win for the British defense industry over competitors from France, Germany, and the United States.</p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has reported the death of a baby from whooping cough, the first such fatality in the UK this year. The infant's mother had not been vaccinated against the illness during pregnancy. This tragic event follows government warnings about declining vaccination rates, with none of the main childhood vaccines in England meeting the 95% uptake target for herd immunity last year. Health officials are re-emphasizing the critical importance of the whooping cough vaccine for pregnant women, as it provides passive immunity to newborns during their most vulnerable first weeks of life.</p>

          <p>Maryland Governor Wes Moore is engaged in a public dispute with President Donald Trump regarding how to address crime in Baltimore. After Trump called the city a "hellhole" and threatened to send in the National Guard, Moore invited the president on a public safety walk, an offer Trump rebuked. Moore criticized the president's approach as "arrogant criticism" and called the federal deployment in Washington, D.C. "performative." He argued that instead of threatening military intervention, the federal government should provide serious support like increased funding for local law enforcement to build on recent progress in crime reduction.</p>

          <p>At an informal meeting in Copenhagen, EU foreign ministers discussed new ways to bolster support for Ukraine, as the war with Russia continues. Among the ideas floated were imposing secondary sanctions on Russia's trading partners and establishing "safe haven" sites within the EU for Ukrainian arms production. Ministers also revisited the contentious debate over seizing some €200 billion in frozen Russian central bank assets to aid Kyiv. Additionally, there was broad support for a plan to eventually move the EU's military training mission for Ukrainian troops from Poland and Germany onto Ukrainian soil.</p>

          <p>The highly anticipated Old Firm derby between Rangers and Celtic ended in a lackluster 0-0 draw, a result described as one of the worst encounters between the rivals in recent memory. Rangers, under manager Russell Martin, showed defensive resilience and fight, which was a welcome change despite it being their worst league start since 1983. In contrast, Celtic's performance was criticized as "powder-puff," with the team failing to create any significant attacking opportunities and looking disjointed. The result leaves both managers with considerable work to do to improve their squads' performances.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly setting its sights on America's public universities, potentially impacting everything from funding to campus culture. This focus comes after a period of heightened student activism, particularly protests related to the war in Gaza, which have drawn criticism from conservative circles. The article suggests that potential policy shifts could challenge the autonomy and academic environment of institutions like UCLA, which has been a focal point for both its academic rankings and its recent history of campus demonstrations. The move is seen as part of a broader culture war targeting higher education.</p>

The demonstrations were largely fueled by public anger over a new monthly allowance for lawmakers that is nearly ten times the minimum wage in Jakarta. The unrest escalated after a ride-sharing driver was killed by a police vehicle during a protest. President Prabowo stated that some allowances would be curtailed and a moratorium on overseas trips would be imposed to quell the dissent.</p>

          <p>A major kelp restoration project off the coast of Southern California has achieved remarkable success by removing nearly 5.8 million purple sea urchins from the ocean floor. Over the past decade, a combination of pollution, overfishing, and a boom in the urchin population, which devours kelp, led to an 80% decline in the vital underwater forests. The Bay Foundation led the effort, employing divers to manually smash the destructive urchins, clearing over 80 acres of reef. This has allowed the fast-growing kelp to return, reviving a critical habitat for hundreds of marine species.</p>
