          <p>Upon returning from their August recess, members of the U.S. Congress have immediately resumed efforts to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein. A bipartisan group of lawmakers, led by Representatives Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna, is utilizing a discharge petition to force a vote on the matter, creating a difficult political situation for House Speaker Mike Johnson. The renewed focus includes testimony from Epstein's victims at the Capitol, intensifying pressure on leadership to act despite potential political fallout.</p>

          <p>Dr. Jerome Adams, who served as surgeon general during the first Trump administration, has publicly urged the president to fire Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Adams argues that Kennedy's policies, particularly those limiting access to vaccines and causing turmoil at the CDC, are dangerous and put the nation's health at risk. His comments follow a contentious Senate hearing where Kennedy's leadership was criticized by both Democrats and some Republicans. Adams co-authored a bipartisan op-ed expressing grave concerns that recent actions threaten the CDC's integrity and public well-being.</p>

The board, chaired by fundraiser Rufus Gifford and including figures like Antony Blinken and Steve Ricchetti, will manage the significant fundraising required for the museum and archive. While Biden has deep roots in Pennsylvania, the decision honors Delaware as the foundation of his extensive political career. The project aims to create a center for history, learning, and civic leadership.</p>

          <p>The South Korean government is mounting an "all-out" response following an immigration raid at a Hyundai-affiliated battery plant in Georgia that resulted in the detention of over 300 of its citizens. Seoul has dispatched diplomats to the site, and LG Energy Solution, a partner in the facility, is suspending most business trips to the U.S. while working to secure the release of its employees. The raid, which U.S. officials defended as enforcement against illegal employment, has caused shock in South Korea and raised concerns about its potential impact on foreign investment and trade relations.</p>

Over 100 firefighters and 15 engines were dispatched to tackle the blaze, which started in the early hours and was described as "complex." Parts of the iconic building, now home to apartments, studios, and commercial spaces, were evacuated as a precaution. Crews worked for over 12 hours to control the fire, with no immediate reports on the cause or extent of the damage.</p>

          <p>A new conservation chapter is beginning at California's Point Reyes National Seashore after a multimillion-dollar buyout deal led to the departure of 12 organic dairy and cattle operations. The Nature Conservancy, which financed the agreement, is now leading a five-year restoration effort across 16,000 acres to revive native ecosystems and enhance biodiversity. The plan controversially includes using targeted cattle grazing to manage invasive plants, aiming to create a resilient landscape. While the transition marks a painful end for multigenerational ranching families, conservationists see it as a vital opportunity for ecological healing.</p>

          <h2>Salvadoran Man in Immigration Dispute Faces Potential Deportation to Eswatini</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration has informed Kilmar Ábrego García, a Salvadoran man at the center of a high-profile immigration case, that he may be deported to the southern African nation of Eswatini. This is the latest development in a protracted legal battle, which included his mistaken deportation to El Salvador in March. U.S. officials previously considered sending him to Uganda but changed the destination after he raised fears of persecution. Ábrego García, who has no known ties to Eswatini, denies the administration's claims that he is a member of the MS-13 gang.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, Arwa Mahdawi critiques Melania Trump's recent focus on artificial intelligence, particularly her call to treat AI "as we would our own children" with watchful guidance. The article argues that while the first lady positions herself as a champion of responsible innovation, her past legislative advocacy has been criticized by civil rights groups for potentially harming free speech. The author suggests that instead of promoting AI taskforces, a more effective way to help children would be to oppose the Trump administration's cuts to public education programs like Head Start and address the rise of censorship.</p>

          <p>In her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court, Justice Amy Coney Barrett defended the court's decision-making process, stating that its rulings are not an "opinion poll" of the justices' personal beliefs. Promoting her new book, Barrett argued that the court's role is to interpret what the American people have decided through the democratic process, not to impose its own values. Her comments come as the court faces criticism over recent landmark decisions, including the overturning of Roe v. Wade, and considers a request to revisit the legality of same-sex marriage.</p>

          <p>Thousands of viewers tuned in for a rare live-streamed exploration of the bottom of Lake Tahoe, one of the deepest lakes in the United States. A remotely operated vehicle (ROV) descended over 1,500 feet, providing a unique look at the lakebed's ecosystem and geography, which is estimated to be two to three million years old. The event, sponsored by environmental non-profits, aimed to raise awareness about the lake's unique environment and the importance of conservation efforts. While dispelling myths of mobsters' bodies, the dive highlighted the ongoing challenge of removing trash from the pristine waters.</p>

          <p>Elliott Investment Management, an activist investor with a new $4 billion stake in PepsiCo, has outlined a plan to boost the company's underperforming stock. The proposal urges PepsiCo to refranchise its bottling operations, streamline its product portfolio by divesting weaker brands like Quaker, and reinvest in core products such as Pepsi and Mountain Dew. Elliott argues these changes could unlock over 50% in shareholder value by improving operational focus and reversing strategic missteps that have caused the company to lag behind competitors and its benchmark index.

Joy argues that renting offers greater financial flexibility, avoids the significant hidden costs of homeownership, and has allowed her to grow her net worth faster by investing the proceeds from her home sales and focusing on her business.

          <p>A new book showcases the largely unseen jazz photography of Lisette Model, an Austrian Jewish émigré best known for her street photography. In the early 1950s, Model embarked on a project to document the American jazz scene, capturing the inward emotions of musicians like Duke Ellington and Miles Davis, as well as the rapture of their audiences. The project was ultimately abandoned due to FBI suspicion of her leftist politics, leaving behind 1,800 negatives. The photos reveal a deep connection between Model, who fled the Nazis, and her subjects, who faced racism and persecution in the U.S.</p>

Using machine learning, a study found that 98% of the region will face a higher risk due to more frequent lightning, drier conditions, or both. These fires tend to burn in remote areas, often growing larger and producing more smoke, which worsens public health and strains firefighting resources. This trend is already visible globally, with severe, lightning-caused fires recently impacting Europe and Canada.</p>
