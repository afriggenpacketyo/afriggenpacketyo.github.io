          <p>Homeowner's insurance premiums are projected to increase in every U.S. state, with an average rise of 8% this year. States like Louisiana and California are seeing even steeper hikes, driven by recent natural disasters such as wildfires and floods, which increase insurer payouts and risk. This trend is not confined to coastal areas, with Midwestern states also experiencing double-digit increases.

The city has suspended services like residential trash collection and closed some pools, though Mayor Cherelle Parker insists Fourth of July celebrations will proceed.

          <p>The British punk group Bob Vylan has been dropped from lineups at music festivals in Manchester and France following their controversial Glastonbury set. During the performance, the lead singer led chants of "death to the IDF," which drew widespread criticism, including from the UK prime minister. The band defended their actions as speaking up against a "violent military machine," not as an expression of hate towards any race. The BBC, which broadcast the set, has apologized for not cutting the stream and is facing scrutiny from the broadcast regulator Ofcom.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are struggling to unite behind President Trump's signature tax and spending bill after it narrowly passed the Senate. Key factions are creating obstacles, with fiscal conservatives in the Freedom Caucus opposing the bill's projected $3.3 trillion addition to the national deficit over ten years. Simultaneously, moderate Republicans from poorer districts are concerned about the Senate's deeper cuts to Medicaid, which could strip health insurance from approximately 12 million Americans. These internal divisions put the bill's passage before the July 4th deadline in serious jeopardy.</p>

          <p>The nearly 140-year-old canned goods company, Del Monte Foods, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and announced it will seek a buyer for all or most of its assets. The company cited declining consumer demand and a shift in preferences away from preservative-laden canned foods toward healthier alternatives as key factors in its financial struggles. Del Monte has secured over $900 billion in financing from lenders to maintain operations during the court-supervised sale process. The company stated this was the most effective path to accelerate its turnaround and create a stronger future.</p>

          <p>The Wisconsin Supreme Court, with its liberal majority, has struck down a 176-year-old abortion ban, providing greater legal certainty for abortion access in the state. In a 4-3 decision, the court ruled that the 1849 law was superseded by a 1985 statute that permits abortions until fetal viability. The ruling affirms a lower court's decision and resolves the legal ambiguity that arose after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. This decision solidifies the legality of abortions that had resumed in the state following the initial 2023 circuit court ruling.</p>

          <p>Microsoft is laying off around 9,000 employees, affecting less than 4% of its global workforce, as part of an organizational restructuring at the start of its new fiscal year.

The company stated the changes are necessary to position itself for success in a dynamic marketplace and aim to reduce layers of management.

The power failure caused thousands of flight cancellations and cost airlines an estimated Â£80-Â£100 million.

          <p>A report from market research firm Yole Group forecasts that mainland China will overtake Taiwan in semiconductor foundry capacity by 2030. China's share of global capacity is projected to grow from 21% in 2024 to 30% by the end of the decade, while Taiwan currently leads with a 23% share. This progress highlights the success of Beijing's strategic push for chip self-sufficiency, even amidst ongoing technological restrictions from the United States. The report notes that domestic Chinese chipmakers will play an increasingly significant role in this expansion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to a report from payroll firm ADP, the U.S. private sector lost 33,000 jobs in June, a stark contrast to economists' expectations of a 100,000-job increase. This marks the first monthly decrease since March 2023 and suggests potential weakness in the labor market. The decline was driven by job losses in service sectors like professional services and health, while goods-producing roles saw a modest expansion. This surprising contraction has raised questions about the economy's strength, though the ADP report has historically been an inconsistent predictor of the official government jobs data.

          <p>Virtual YouTubers, known as VTubers, are becoming a major force in online content creation, with AI-powered personalities earning millions of dollars. Characters like Bloo, a blue-haired gamer with 2.5 million subscribers, are often puppeteered by humans but use AI for tasks like video editing and language dubbing. This trend, which began in Japan, is now fueled by advances in generative AI, making it easier for creators to produce high volumes of content. As the technology evolves, concerns are growing about the spread of low-quality "AI slop" and the difficulty in distinguishing human-made from AI-generated content.</p>
