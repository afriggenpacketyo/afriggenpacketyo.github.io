          <p>An NYU professor and CEO suggests a powerful question for job interviews to uncover a company's authentic values. By asking, "What kind of person should not work at this company?", candidates can elicit unrehearsed and revealing answers that cut through corporate platitudes about culture. The article argues this method helps individuals, most of whom are unclear on their own core values, find a workplace that genuinely aligns with their principles. This approach is best used late in the interview process to ensure a good rapport has been established.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell confirmed that the central bank would likely have already implemented interest rate cuts if not for the Trump administration's tariff policies. Speaking at a European Central Bank forum, Powell explained that the tariffs significantly raised inflation forecasts, forcing the Fed to maintain its current rates. While the Fed's projections indicate potential cuts later in the year, Powell emphasized that future decisions will be data-dependent and made on a meeting-by-meeting basis, amidst ongoing pressure from the White House.

          <p>Despite initial fears, President Trump's tariffs have not led to a significant spike in U.S. inflation, with key price indexes remaining relatively stable. Economists suggest several reasons for this, including companies pre-ordering goods to avoid duties, absorbing some costs to protect consumers, and using logistical loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay payments. However, experts caution that these are likely short-term buffers and that price increases could still materialize in the latter half of the year as these strategies become unsustainable and higher import costs work through the supply chain.</p>

          <p>The jury in the federal trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs resumed deliberations for a second day after posing a question to the judge regarding the racketeering charge. The jury is tasked with weighing seven weeks of testimony in the complex case, where Combs is accused of sex trafficking, racketeering, and prostitution-related offenses. Deliberations began with some internal friction, as a note from the jury on the first day raised concerns about one juror's ability to follow instructions. Combs has pleaded not guilty to all charges against him.</p>

          <p>A new report from the data analytics firm Govini warns that the Pentagon remains significantly reliant on Chinese suppliers for critical defense programs and is not adequately prepared for a potential conflict. The analysis found that in 2024, Chinese firms constituted 9.3% of the top-tier contractors in nine key sectors, including aviation, maritime, and space. The report highlighted the missile defense sector as having the most substantial dependence on Chinese suppliers, at 11.1%. The firm's CEO stated that these findings indicate that U.S. supply chains are "incredibly brittle."</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has announced charges in a widespread scheme where North Korea placed thousands of its IT workers in remote jobs at American companies to fund its weapons program. The workers allegedly used stolen or fake identities to get hired, with their wages being funneled back to the North Korean government. Law enforcement officials have seized financial accounts and websites connected to the fraud, which generated millions of dollars. The operation highlights a persistent national security threat and a method by which North Korea evades international sanctions.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from the Yale Budget Lab concludes that the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" being advanced by Senate Republicans would financially harm the lowest-earning Americans while benefiting the wealthiest. The report projects that the bottom 20% of households would see an average annual income reduction of 2.9%, primarily due to sharp cuts in Medicaid and SNAP. Conversely, the top 20% of households would experience an average income increase of 2.2%, driven by the bill's tax cut extensions. The findings suggest the legislation would shift resources from the poor to the rich.</p>

          <p>This article reviews Brittany Newell's novel "Soft Core" while examining the broader trend of kink and BDSM becoming a mainstream literary genre. It notes a shift from a taboo subject to an established category with its own nonfiction aisle dedicated to demystifying the practices. The review praises Newell's novel for its ambitious and psychologically perceptive exploration of a San Francisco stripper's life, arguing that such fiction effectively captures the complex emotions and intellect behind kink. The piece contrasts this with nonfiction's tendency to focus on a "respectability kink" by normalizing transgressive behaviors.</p>

Analysts suggest the arrangement is mutually beneficial, providing Russia with much-needed manpower while allowing Moscow to avoid a broader domestic mobilization. In return, North Korea has received over 10 million artillery shells, along with economic aid and military technology, which helps prop up the sanctioned regime. The deployments also serve as a propaganda tool for Pyongyang and enhance its status as a key ally of a global power.</p>

In contrast, the defense argued that while his relationships and sex life were unconventional and abusive, the encounters were consensual and did not meet the legal definition of the crimes charged.

          <p>This opinion article argues that Planned Parenthood is facing an existential threat from the Trump administration and the judiciary. A recent Supreme Court ruling in Medina v. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic allows states to exclude the organization from their Medicaid programs, which will severely restrict its funding and could force the closure of hundreds of clinics. This decision, combined with administrative actions and potential nationwide legislation, effectively creates a de facto ban on care from pro-choice providers for many low-income women. The author contends this is part of a broader, aggressive agenda to enforce regressive gender roles.</p>

This shift towards Airbus and the domestic Comac C919 reflects Beijing's changing priorities.

          <p>This article reviews a new biography of Claire McCardell, an American fashion designer who revolutionized women's wear in the mid-20th century by prioritizing comfort and practicality. McCardell is credited with popularizing innovations like pockets in women's clothing, ballet flats, side fasteners, and mix-and-match separates, all designed to give women more freedom of movement. Despite being a household name and a dominant force in fashion, her legacy is now largely forgotten by the public. The piece explores her pragmatic vision and her role in creating the "American Look" during a time when fashion was dominated by Paris.</p>

          <h2>Marks & Spencer Expects Full Online Operations to Resume Within Four Weeks After Cyber Attack</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 08:59:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The CEO of Marks & Spencer, Stuart Machin, announced that the retailer's online shopping services should be fully operational within four weeks following a major cyber-attack. The attack in April disrupted M&S systems, halting online orders and impacting in-store stock levels, with an estimated profit hit of Â£300 million. While online ordering has partially resumed, key services like "click and collect" remain offline. The company's next focus will be restoring its main Castle Donington distribution center, with hopes of putting the majority of the disruption behind them by August.</p>
