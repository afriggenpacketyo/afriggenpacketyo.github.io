          <p>Belfast-based rap group Kneecap issued an apology to the families of Sir David Amess and Jo Cox after footage emerged of a band member seemingly calling for violence against Tory MPs. The statement, posted on X, follows criticism from Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch and an assessment by counter-terrorism police. Kneecap rejected inciting violence and expressed regret for the hurt caused, while maintaining they do not support Hamas or Hezbollah. The group has faced calls to be denied entry into the USA and Canada ahead of their North America tour and have previously been given arts funding from the government.</p>

          <p>President Trump's second term marks 100 days, revealing a rapid pace of executive actions and policy reversals. He has signed 142 executive orders, surpassing Roosevelt's record, while reversing over 100 of Biden's orders. Trump has signed only five bills into law, a record low, and faces over 200 lawsuits challenging his administration's actions. His approval rating stands at 42%, with significant federal layoffs due to the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Immigration enforcement has intensified, with record-low border crossings, while tariffs have led to an average effective rate of 28% for U.S. consumers.</p>

Head Start, serving 800,000 low-income families, has faced multiple disruptions, including funding delays and staff layoffs, since the start of Trump's term.

          <p>California has filed 15 lawsuits against the Trump administration in its first 100 days, challenging policies on immigration, the economy, and LGBTQ+ rights. The state has won temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions blocking some Trump policies, including a freeze on federal funding to states. However, the state has also faced losses in court, with some orders being reversed by higher courts. The litigation reflects California's role as a leading resister against the Trump administration's agenda.</p>

Approximately 6,000 drug tests are believed to have been inaccurate, and attorneys worry that these results were included in inmates' parole hearing records. The tests, intended for drug treatment programs, are not supposed to be used for punitive purposes, but their inclusion in parole files could unfairly influence decisions.

This initiative is framed as a means to increase birth rates, raising concerns about the politicization of women's health and reproductive rights.

Experts warn that this could lead to significant cuts in Medicaid programs, affecting low-income families and vulnerable populations.
