          <p>Following the demolition of the White House's East Wing for a new ballroom, a reporter embarked on a quest to locate the historic rubble. The investigation led to East Potomac Golf Links, where trucks were depositing White House dirt, potentially to create a new golf hole. Despite confirmations from some workers, official sources remained tight-lipped about the final destination of the debris. The journalist's search for more substantial remnants like concrete and wood at an industrial park in Maryland proved fruitless, highlighting the secrecy surrounding the disposal of the historic structure's remains.</p>

          <p>President Trump has abruptly ended trade negotiations with Canada, a move that experts suggest could affect prices for consumer goods like home appliances and automobiles. The decision was reportedly a response to a Canadian ad critical of U.S. tariffs that featured former President Ronald Reagan. This halt could prolong existing 50% tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, which are key materials in many products sold in the U.S. While the broader USMCA trade agreement remains, the breakdown in talks raises concerns about future negotiations and the stability of trade relations between the two neighboring countries.</p>

The incident occurred early Saturday morning, with law enforcement reporting that a total of 13 people were shot. Authorities believe it was an isolated event and that there is no ongoing threat to the community. With over 150 attendees fleeing the scene before officers arrived, the sheriff's office is appealing to the public for any information that could aid the investigation into the tragic event.</p>

          <p>Left-wing independent candidate Catherine Connolly is poised to become the next president of Ireland following the concession of her opponent, Heather Humphreys of Fine Gael. Although vote counting is still in progress, polls consistently showed strong support for Connolly for the largely ceremonial role. Connolly, an independent lawmaker known for her criticism of Israel's actions in Gaza, secured backing from several left-leaning parties, including Sinn Féin. She will succeed Michael D.

          <p>The popular passive investment strategy of buying S&P 500 index funds, like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), may be losing favor among some investors seeking better diversification. Financial experts note that the S&P 500 has become heavily concentrated, with the technology sector now comprising over 35% of the index, a record high. In contrast, defensive sectors such as consumer staples and utilities are at an all-time low weighting. This imbalance is prompting some traders to explore other areas, such as small-cap stocks, which have recently shown strong performance and are attracting renewed interest.

          <p>Billionaire Jimmy John Liautaud, founder of the Jimmy John's sandwich chain, has stated that the concept of work-life balance for entrepreneurs is unrealistic and nonsensical. In a recent interview, he argued that creating a successful business from nothing requires an intense, all-consuming work ethic without compromise. Liautaud, who grew his company from a single shop with a $25,000 loan into a brand valued at over $3 billion, emphasized that entrepreneurs must be prepared to be a "grinder" and work relentlessly. His perspective reflects a mindset shared by other successful figures like Bill Gates and Elon Musk during their companies' formative years.</p>

          <p>A vibrant 1943 portrait by Pablo Picasso of his muse and partner, Dora Maar, has sold for €32 million (about $37 million) at an auction in Paris. The painting, titled "Bust of a Woman with a Flowered Hat," had been in a private family collection since 1944 and was hidden from public view for over 80 years. The work captures Maar at a painful time when her tumultuous relationship with Picasso was ending, and experts noted its remarkably preserved, vivid colors. The final price surpassed expectations and marked the highest amount paid for an artwork at a French auction this year.</p>

Speaking aboard Air Force One, Trump mentioned his upcoming meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, suggesting he would raise the issue. The statement comes after Trump's efforts to broker a ceasefire have stalled and his administration recently imposed new sanctions on major Russian oil companies. Despite China being Russia's most significant ally, Trump expressed that he has a very good relationship with President Xi and believes the Chinese leader could have a major influence on Vladimir Putin.</p>

          <p>With an early flu season underway in England, the NHS is urging parents to get their children vaccinated as data shows a rise in cases and hospitalizations, particularly among the young.

Most children are offered a nasal spray vaccine, which is available at GP surgeries and pharmacies. Officials warn that flu can spread rapidly in schools and make children very ill, emphasizing that vaccination is the most effective way to protect them from serious illness.</p>

          <p>Two-time Olympic gold medalist Abby Wambach advises parents against attending their children's sports practices to help foster resilience and internal motivation. The former soccer star argues that children play more freely and take more risks when not looking over their shoulders for parental approval or critique. This distance allows them to develop self-starting behaviors, which are crucial for becoming successful adults. Wambach also suggests that when parents do attend games, they should de-emphasize winning and instead focus on praising acts of leadership and good sportsmanship, asking their children about positive team interactions rather than the final score.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that President Trump's sudden decision to demolish the 123-year-old East Wing of the White House is an act of personal will, unconstrained by historical preservation norms or public input. The historic structure is being replaced by a $300 million ballroom, reportedly funded by Trump and corporate donors, a move that raises ethical questions. The author suggests this massive construction project reflects Trump's desire to leave a physical legacy and questions whether it signals an intention to remain in power beyond the constitutional two-term limit. The demolition is presented as another example of the president acting without institutional checks and balances.</p>

          <p>Despite a significant drop in the number of active serial killers since the 1970s, public fascination with them remains high, fueled by social media speculation and popular entertainment. Authorities in Austin, Texas, recently debunked rumors of a "Rainey Street Ripper," attributing numerous drownings to other factors, yet the narrative persists. Criminologists attribute the real-world decline of serial killers to factors like reduced hitchhiking, the advent of DNA technology, and better law enforcement communication. However, the cultural obsession continues through documentaries and series, suggesting society has a need for such "monsters" to define its own boundaries of humanity.</p>
