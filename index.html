          <p>Tommy's Mexican Restaurant in San Francisco has become a global epicenter for tequila education and appreciation, contributing to the spirit's surging popularity in the United States. Owner Julio Bermejo, a global ambassador for the tequila industry, has cultivated a following by championing 100% agave tequila and creating the world-famous Tommy's Margarita. The restaurant's influence comes as tequila sales are rising, second only to vodka in the U.S., with Bermejo expressing both pride and concern that its growth could make it unaffordable for many. Tommy's also fosters a community through its tequila club, which has grown to over 10,000 members worldwide.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump stated that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu apologized to Qatar's leader for an airstrike that unintentionally killed a Qatari serviceman. The strike, which targeted senior Hamas leadership in Qatar, had previously drawn a rare rebuke from Trump. In a trilateral call, Netanyahu reportedly expressed deep regret for violating Qatari sovereignty and assured it would not happen again, a move aimed at mending relations with the key mediator. This development occurred as Trump unveiled a 20-point peace plan for Gaza, which includes the release of hostages and amnesty for Hamas members who disarm.</p>

          <p>For 45 years, Denver's Grupo Tlaloc has been dedicated to preserving and teaching the traditions of Mexican Aztec dance, which they consider a sacred form of prayer and cultural heritage. Led by elder Carlos Castañeda, the group performs at community blessings and celebrations, sharing stories of resilience through their spiritual presentations. The group actively recruits younger members to ensure these customs, which gained protected expression in the U.S. only after 1978, are carried forward. For many young dancers, participating in the group provides a sense of peace, confidence, and connection to their heritage.</p>

          <p>One year after devastating floods from Hurricane Helene ravaged the Nolichucky River in Tennessee, whitewater rafting guides have pivoted to lead a massive cleanup mission. With rafting companies closed for the season due to extensive damage and debris, state-funded grants are enabling these guides to clear riverbanks of wreckage, including car parts and housing materials. This community effort not only provides work for the unemployed guides but also helps restore the vital outdoor tourism economy of the region. Organizers are hopeful that their work will allow the popular rafting destination, now informally called the 'New-lichucky,' to reopen for the 2026 season.</p>

          <p>An art exhibit at Denver International Airport is showcasing the traditions of Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) through a display of decorated skulls, known as calaveras. The traveling exhibit, titled "Calaveras en Mi Ciudad," features works by Latino artists created to honor the memory of deceased loved ones, a central theme of the holiday. The project aims to uplift Latino artists and educate the public about the cultural significance of the celebration, which views death as a natural part of life.

          <p>With a government shutdown deadline imminent, President Donald Trump is meeting with top congressional leaders in a final attempt to secure a funding deal. The White House is pushing for a 'clean' short-term funding bill, stating there is 'nothing to negotiate,' while Democrats are refusing to vote without concessions, including the restoration of Medicaid cuts and an extension of Obamacare subsidies. The stalemate persists as both sides remain entrenched, making a shutdown seem nearly inevitable. This meeting marks the first major bipartisan, bicameral leadership discussion of Trump's second term, highlighting the political tensions surrounding the federal budget.</p>

          <p>Democrats are engaging in a risky political strategy by allowing the government to approach a shutdown, betting that President Trump is bluffing about his threats to permanently fire federal workers. The White House has suggested it would use a shutdown to gut agencies not aligned with its priorities, a long-held conservative goal. However, legal and political obstacles make such mass firings difficult, suggesting the administration may be exaggerating its plans for leverage. Democrats are demanding healthcare concessions in the funding bill, creating a high-stakes standoff where they risk either being blamed for a shutdown or enabling a significant downsizing of the federal government.</p>

Paul Osadebe and Palmer Heenan had reported to Senator Elizabeth Warren that the Trump administration was systemically dismantling fair housing enforcement, alleging that their office was targeted for downsizing because it presented an 'optics problem.' The attorneys stated they were explicitly told their termination was due to speaking with the media, an act they argue is protected under whistleblower laws.

          <p>The decline of Hollywood as the primary hub for film production is attributed to studios seeking tax benefits and lower labor costs in other countries and U.S. states. International locations like Canada and the U.K., as well as domestic hubs like Georgia, offer significant financial incentives that have lured thousands of jobs away from California. This trend provides context for President Trump's proposal to impose a 100% tariff on foreign-made films, a move industry experts believe is logistically complex and could provoke international retaliation. The article suggests that a more effective solution might be a competitive federal film incentive to bring production back.</p>

The shutdown could also delay the release of crucial economic data, such as the monthly jobs report and inflation figures, which would complicate decision-making for the Federal Reserve.

Her research indicates that typical self-care advice often fails because stress is inherently a social experience, and the hormone oxytocin released during stress motivates connection. Instead of internalizing stress, she recommends 'stress springboarding'—using the energy to perform acts of service, such as assisting a colleague or volunteering. This approach not only aligns with our biological response to stress but has also been shown to activate reward centers in the brain, improving well-being and job satisfaction.</p>

          <p>Following Europe's victory at the Ryder Cup, golfer Rory McIlroy strongly condemned the verbal abuse and inappropriate conduct from some American fans at Bethpage Black. He stated that golf should be held to a higher standard and that the behavior, which included insults and a cup being thrown near his wife, was unacceptable. McIlroy acknowledged that it was a minority of the crowd but emphasized the need for respect in the sport. He hopes the incident serves as a lesson for fans ahead of the 2027 Ryder Cup in his home country of Ireland.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man in Pasco County, Florida, has been arrested on a felony charge of aggravated animal cruelty after he allegedly killed, cooked, and ate two of his pet peacocks. According to the sheriff's office, the man admitted to the act, stating he did it 'to prove a point' to a neighbor who he claimed kept feeding the birds against his wishes. He reportedly sent the neighbor a letter threatening to continue killing the peacocks if she did not stop. While being arrested, the man also told deputies he would kill his remaining peacocks upon his release.</p>

          <p>American golf icon Tom Watson has issued a public apology for the 'rude and mean-spirited behavior' of some U.S. fans during the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black. In a statement, the eight-time major winner and former Ryder Cup captain expressed that he was 'ashamed' of the conduct, which included verbal abuse directed at European players and their families. Watson's apology stands in contrast to the less critical stance of the current U.S. team leadership and adds a powerful voice to the condemnation of the hostile atmosphere. The incident has overshadowed Europe's dramatic 15-13 victory on American soil.</p>

          <p>Famo, a traditional accordion-based music genre from the mountain kingdom of Lesotho, has become dangerously intertwined with gang warfare, leading to numerous killings. Originating from shepherd songs, the music's lyrics have evolved into diss tracks between rival groups, with these musical feuds escalating into real-world violence. The situation has become so severe that the Lesotho government has labeled some Famo gangs as terrorist groups and launched a crackdown. Despite its violent turn, Famo remains a powerful form of cultural expression for the Basotho people, reflecting their history, struggles, and daily life in one of the world's poorest nations.</p>

          <p>Scientists are using a suite of advanced technologies, including autonomous drones, rapid DNA sequencing, and artificial intelligence, to catalog Earth's biodiversity at an unprecedented scale. These tools allow researchers to identify millions of species, many previously unknown to science, by collecting environmental DNA (eDNA) from the air or analyzing vast numbers of images and sounds. This technological revolution is crucial for understanding ecosystems and addressing the biodiversity crisis, as many species are disappearing before they can be formally described. Despite these advances, the work still relies on human taxonomists, a dwindling resource, to interpret data and preserve a planetary archive of life.</p>

          <p>Charlie Javice, the 33-year-old founder of the college financial aid startup Frank, has been sentenced to more than seven years in prison for defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Javice was convicted of fabricating customer data to induce the bank into purchasing her company for $175 million in 2021. She falsely claimed Frank had over 4 million users when the actual number was fewer than 300,000. In court, Javice expressed regret for her actions, which the judge condemned while also criticizing JPMorgan for its lack of adequate due diligence during the acquisition process.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has unveiled a plan to invest $625 million in coal-fired power plants and open 13.1 million acres of public land to coal mining. This initiative, a joint effort by the Departments of the Interior, Energy, and the EPA, aims to revive the declining coal sector, which has seen its role in U.S. electricity generation fall sharply in favor of natural gas and renewables. The investment includes funds to 'modernize' existing plants and support projects in rural communities. The move has drawn criticism from environmental groups, who call it a wasteful subsidy for the most polluting fossil fuel.</p>

          <p>In response to President Donald Trump's threat to impose a 100% tariff on movies made outside the U.S., Senator Adam Schiff stated that he strongly supports bringing filmmaking back to California and the nation. However, instead of a tariff, which he warned could have 'damaging consequences,' Schiff advocated for a bipartisan, globally competitive federal film incentive program. He expressed his readiness to work with the administration to pass a major federal film tax credit to create jobs and bolster the domestic industry. This represents a rare point of partial alignment between Trump and Schiff, one of his most frequent political targets.</p>
