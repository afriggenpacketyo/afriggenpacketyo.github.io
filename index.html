          <p>A primary school in east London has restricted pupils from playing outside after a buzzard nested in the playground, leading to concerns about potential attacks as the bird guards its nest. Havering Council has offered advice and deterrents, including hiring a falconry expert, but options are limited since buzzards are a protected species. The school is using the situation as a learning opportunity, with children creating art and stories about the buzzard, nicknamed "Brenda," and regularly visiting a nearby outdoor learning facility. The school has had to think about how to risk assess the situation, as this is an unusual situation.</p>

          <p>German peace researchers are urging Europe and Germany to prepare for a future without NATO, citing the potential for the Trump administration to dismantle liberal institutions and court authoritarian regimes. The 2025 Peace Report expresses pessimism about the current state of international conflicts, pointing to wars in Ukraine, Gaza, and Sudan, as well as the increasing uncertainty surrounding the US's role in global security. The report recommends that Germany pursue a plan to expand and integrate European defense structures, while also emphasizing the importance of arms control, diplomacy, and effective development policy. The researchers also call for an immediate halt to arms deliveries to Israel and urge Germany to work towards recognition of a Palestinian state.</p>

          <p>Erin Patterson, on trial for the murder of three relatives and the attempted murder of another, testified that she has long enjoyed mushrooms, particularly wild varieties, stating they have "more flavour." Patterson's in-laws and Gail's sister died after eating a beef wellington containing death cap mushrooms, while Gail's sister's husband survived. She claimed that the mushrooms came from a supermarket and an Asian grocery store, with some potentially mixed with foraged and dehydrated mushrooms from her property. Patterson also described her strained relationship with her estranged husband and his parents amid financial disputes, and her mistrust of the health system.</p>

          <p>South Koreans are voting in a snap presidential election following the ouster of former President Yoon Suk Yeol, who faces trial on rebellion charges after declaring martial law. Pre-election surveys suggest Lee Jae-myung, Yoonâ€™s liberal rival, is poised to win due to public frustration over Yoonâ€™s actions. Lee has urged voters to deliver a stern judgment against conservatives, while Kim Moon Soo, the main conservative candidate, warned that a Lee victory would lead to a dictatorship. The winner will immediately be sworn in and face challenges including a slowing economy and North Korea's nuclear threats.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) predicts that U.S. economic growth will slow to 1.6% this year, down from 2.8% last year, due to President Donald Trump's trade wars disrupting global commerce. The OECD forecasts further deceleration to 1.5% in 2026, with Trump's policies having raised average U.S. tariff rates to the highest level since 1938. The report notes that increased trade barriers and economic policy uncertainty have negatively impacted business and consumer confidence. A federal court initially blocked most of Trump's tariffs, but an appeals court allowed the administration to continue collecting them while appeals are processed.</p>

          <p>An independent review of England and Wales' water sector has found it is failing and requires stronger regulation to protect billpayers and the environment. The Water Commission, led by Sir Jon Cunliffe, cited pollution, financial difficulties, and infrastructure failures as reasons for the public's shaken trust. The review calls for clearer government direction, better long-term investment, and a stronger voice for local communities, while ruling out nationalizing the sector. The commission's findings highlight systemic failures in government strategy, regulation, and water company practices, with a need for new legislation and a streamlined regulatory approach.</p>

          <p>Many popular holiday destinations are struggling with the environmental impact of huge visitor numbers, leading to the phenomenon of overtourism. This excessive influx of tourists strains infrastructure, depletes local resources, and disrupts local flora and fauna. Overtourism also magnifies existing problems like noise, littering, and traffic jams, while emissions from tourism contribute significantly to the climate crisis. Some cities and regions are implementing measures such as limiting visitor numbers, imposing taxes, and promoting attractions outside city centers to manage visitor flows and mitigate the negative impacts of overtourism.</p>

          <p>Thames Water's future is in doubt after US private equity giant KKR withdrew from plans to invest in the company, increasing the possibility of a government-supervised administration. The company, serving a quarter of the UK's population, faces significant debt and is working on an alternative plan to secure its future. Sources indicate that the politicization of the water industry was a major disincentive for investors, while an independent review highlighted the need for regulatory reform. The government has stated it is ready to take over Thames Water if necessary, though the company had previously secured a rescue loan to allow for restructuring.</p>

          <p>Red Bull made two key errors during the Spanish Grand Prix, first by instructing Max Verstappen to return a position to George Russell after an incident in Turn One, despite stewards later determining no penalty was warranted. The team's decision was based on perceived historical precedents and a belief that a penalty was imminent, but the stewards ultimately ruled that Russell had lost control, justifying Verstappen's actions. Secondly, Red Bull's decision to pit Verstappen for fresh hard tires under the safety car was questioned, as Verstappen vocally disagreed with the call, with Horner admitting they should have left him on his soft tires.</p>

          <p>Portuguese and German police have initiated a new search in Portugal as part of ongoing investigations into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, who vanished nearly two decades ago. The search will focus on the municipality of Lagos, near Praia da Luz, where Madeleine disappeared, with German investigators taking the lead and Portuguese police providing support. The main suspect, Christian BrÃ¼ckner, is currently imprisoned in Germany for another crime and has been named as a formal suspect in Madeleine's disappearance, though he denies any involvement.</p>

          <p>Laila Soueif, the mother of jailed British-Egyptian activist Alaa Abdel Fattah, is continuing her hunger strike despite doctors warning of the risk of sudden death. Soueif is demanding the release of her son, who has been imprisoned in Cairo almost continuously since 2014, after he shared a Facebook post about a prisoner dying after torture. Despite appeals from family, MPs, and the former British ambassador to Egypt, the UK government has not been able to secure Abdel Fattah's release, prompting Soueif to resume her full hunger strike after a period of consuming liquid calories.</p>

          <p>Beijing has amplified its warnings about cutthroat price wars among carmakers, citing concerns that they threaten product quality and long-term industry development. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) and state media have expressed concerns over recent discounts offered by manufacturers, deeming price wars a classic example of "involutionary" competition. The ministry vowed to step up governance over such competition, with a commentary in Peopleâ€™s Daily describing the domestic carmaking sector as being in a "sub-healthy" state due to shrinking profit margins and industrial overcapacity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The OECD has sharply reduced its economic growth forecasts for the U.S. due to the impact of President Donald Trump's tariff policies, projecting growth of just 1.6% this year and 1.5% in 2026. The downgrade is attributed to fallout from Trump's tariff policy, elevated economic policy uncertainty, a slowdown of net immigration, and a smaller federal workforce. The OECD also lowered its global growth forecast, citing substantial increases in trade barriers, tighter financial conditions, and weaker business and consumer confidence. The report notes that higher trade costs, especially in countries raising tariffs, will push up inflation.</p>
