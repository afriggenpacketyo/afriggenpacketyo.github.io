          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has implemented new rules requiring journalists to have official escorts for access to most of the Pentagon, a move criticized by the Pentagon Press Association as an attack on press freedom. The new regulations also involve issuing new credentials to press members for easier identification. Hegseth stated the restrictions are necessary to protect classified intelligence and sensitive information, following several leaks from the Department of Defense that embarrassed the administration. Previously, the press had relatively easy access to non-secured areas of the building, but now official approval and a government escort are required for most areas.</p>

          <p>Many women with pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) are apprehensive about conceiving due to the condition's debilitating symptoms and the limitations of available treatments. Contraception, the primary treatment, poses a dilemma for those wanting to become pregnant. PMDD, affecting up to 8% of women, can cause severe anxiety and suicidal thoughts, with diagnosis often taking around 12 years. Women are seeking more research into PMDD to provide alternative treatment options beyond contraception, and the Welsh government has outlined a plan to improve the diagnosis, treatment, and awareness of conditions affecting women.</p>

          <p>Many young people in China are postponing retirement plans due to rising job uncertainty, stagnant wages, and pressures related to housing and marriage, focusing instead on immediate concerns. The Chinese government has been urging young people to plan early for retirement, citing the long-term risks of an aging population and a strained pension system. However, most young employees feel that retirement is too distant to prioritize in a rapidly changing world, preferring to concentrate on their current well-being. A recent study highlighted the importance of the newly expanded personal pension system, a voluntary program aimed at encouraging individuals to build up retirement savings.</p>

          <p>Businesses are increasingly using artificial intelligence to manage the complexities of global trade, particularly in response to tariff fluctuations. AI tools are being deployed to visualize supply chains, understand the impact of tariffs, and make faster decisions on adjustments. Salesforce has developed an AI agent that can process changes to the 20,000 product categories in the U.S. customs system, enabling businesses to adapt quickly. While AI is a powerful tool, experts caution that its success depends on the quality of the data it accesses, and it should be seen as an enabler rather than a complete solution. </p>

          <p>Despite Israel allowing limited humanitarian aid into Gaza after weeks of blockade, aid agencies warn that it is insufficient to prevent famine. While nearly 200 trucks carrying supplies have crossed the Kerem Shalom crossing, this is a fraction of the 600 trucks that entered daily during a previous ceasefire. The United Nations reports delays in dispatching supplies due to security clearance issues and logistical problems, including damaged roads and fuel shortages. Although substantial aid is ready behind the border, movement to distribution points is slow, and the situation is exacerbated by ongoing conflict and looting, leaving much of Gaza's population at risk of famine.</p>

          <p>The government has delayed the publication of its child poverty strategy, initially expected in the spring, with a spokesperson stating the strategy will be released later this year. The Child Poverty Taskforce is considering various measures, including potentially scrapping the two-child benefit cap, a policy affecting an estimated 1.5 million families. While some condemn the delay, others suggest it could allow for a more substantial and effective strategy to protect children from hunger and hardship. The government maintains its commitment to tackling the root causes of child poverty and has already expanded free breakfast clubs and introduced a cap on school uniform costs.</p>

The desire for more 'me time' is a primary motivation, as young people seek to balance work with personal interests and experiences.

          <p>President Donald Trump has endorsed a 'planned partnership' between Nippon Steel Corp. and United States Steel Corp., projecting it will generate at least 70,000 jobs and inject $14 billion into the U.S. economy. This endorsement signals Trump's approval of Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel, despite earlier concerns about potential national security risks. Both companies have expressed their appreciation for the decision, emphasizing their shared commitment to protecting American workers, the steel industry, and national security. The acquisition, initially reviewed under former President Joe Biden, faced opposition due to national security concerns, but Trump's support has paved the way for the deal to proceed.</p>

          <p>Germany prides itself on confronting its Nazi past, but this vigilance is often selective, failing to address societal entanglement with state violence and genocide. The Herbert Quandt Media prize, named after an early SS supporter involved in Nazi war crimes, continues to be awarded to journalists, highlighting this contradiction. Some of Germany's wealthiest families, who built their empires on Nazi collaboration, are seamlessly integrated into society. This amnesia extends to street names honoring colonial administrators involved in genocide, and the government's refusal to pay reparations to victims of its colonial past.</p>

While authorities credit the technology with aiding in the recapture of one fugitive, critics, including the ACLU, express concerns about mass surveillance and potential biases. The New Orleans Police Department recently paused automated alerts from Project N.O.L.A., the private organization operating the cameras, pending a review of legal and policy compliance.

The Army said the aircraft's location was continuously broadcast throughout its flight through its Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast (ADS-B) Out system.
