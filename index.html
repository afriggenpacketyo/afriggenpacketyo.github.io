          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated assisted departure flights for American citizens and lawful permanent residents in Israel and the West Bank, as announced by U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee. This action follows earlier confusion regarding U.S. government assistance for evacuations, with the State Department initially denying plans to assist private citizens. The State Department has also issued a Level 4 travel advisory for Israel, urging Americans not to travel there due to armed conflict, terrorism, and civil unrest. Amidst escalating tensions with Iran, missile strikes have resulted in numerous casualties in both countries, and President Trump is considering potential military action against Iran within two weeks. Optimism surrounding the situation remains low, given the ongoing conflict and potential for further escalation.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has reiterated his demand for a special prosecutor to investigate the 2020 presidential election, claiming it was rigged against him in favor of Joe Biden. Trump cited his administration's success in reducing border crossings compared to the Biden administration, arguing that the election was fraudulent. He has long maintained that alleged misdeeds led to Biden's victory, echoing claims made before the January 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. Trump's claims have been widely disputed, with his own attorney general stating there was no evidence of fraud that could have affected the outcome, and the Department of Homeland Security declaring the election the most secure in American history.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist recently released from immigration detention, asserts that the Trump administration has failed in its attempts to suppress pro-Palestinian voices. Following his release after more than three months in detention, Khalil vowed to continue advocating for Palestinian rights and the rights of immigrants. He accused the White House of attempting to dehumanize anyone who disagrees with the administration. New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez supported Khalil, stating his release demonstrates the administration's losing legal battle to deport migrants advocating for Palestinians.

          <p>Tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters marched in London and Berlin, calling for an end to Israel's war in Gaza. Demonstrators criticized German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's comment that Israel was doing the West's "dirty work" by bombing Iran, expressing concerns that the Iran-Israel conflict could escalate into a wider regional conflict. The protests highlight the ongoing tensions and humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where famine-like conditions persist and the death toll continues to rise.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from making significant cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The ruling struck down a policy change that could have stripped universities of millions of dollars in research funding, which the universities argued threatened critical work in various technology fields. The judge deemed the change arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. The issue revolved around "indirect" costs, such as building maintenance and computer systems, which the Trump administration sought to cap at 15% of direct research costs.</p>

          <p>Mexican authorities have seized 110,000 fentanyl pills and arrested three individuals, including an American citizen and a dual national with a U.S. warrant for drug dealing. The arrests were conducted by the Secretariat of Security and Citizen Protection and the Attorney General's Office, in coordination with U.S. federal agencies. The operation, which involved intelligence work and surveillance, led to the discovery of the pills inside a vehicle in Ciudad JuÃ¡rez. The arrests are intended to help curb drug trafficking and prevent drugs from reaching young people.</p>

Vance Boelter, 57, is described as a "prepper" who instructed his family to "prepare for war." His wife told investigators that he gave her a "bailout plan" and that they were going to visit friends after he posted in a family group text that they needed to get out of the house. Law enforcement found empty rifle cases, gun-cleaning supplies, and a bike in a storage locker rented by Boelter.</p>
