          <p>This article explores the grueling reality for professional tennis players ranked outside the elite, a stark contrast to the sport's glamorous image. Former player Noah Rubin recounts the emotional and financial toll, highlighting the constant pressure, loneliness, and struggle to break even. The Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA), co-founded by Novak Djokovic, is suing tennis's governing bodies, arguing that most players earn less than their expenses and receive a disproportionately small share of tournament revenue compared to athletes in other major sports. The piece underscores the immense personal and financial sacrifices required for a career in professional tennis.</p>

          <p>Police investigating the murder of Sarah Montgomery, a 27-year-old pregnant mother of two in Donaghadee, County Down, have made a second arrest. A 42-year-old woman was detained on suspicion of assisting an offender, while a 28-year-old man remains in custody on suspicion of murder. Detectives, who believe the suspects were known to the victim, have appealed for public information regarding a yellow Jeep seen in Belfast. The tragedy has prompted tributes to Ms. Montgomery and renewed calls from officials and organizations like Women's Aid to address the "epidemic" of violence against women in Northern Ireland.</p>

          <p>Long-time CBS News producer Seyed Rahim Bathaei provides an on-the-ground perspective from Tehran regarding the recent conflict with Israel. He explains that the direct confrontation felt inevitable after years of proxy wars and that the conflict has fostered a sense of national unity among Iranians determined to protect their country's history and pride. Bathaei expresses concern that a U.S.-backed effort to topple the Iranian government could destabilize the entire region, creating a failed state. Despite a fragile ceasefire, he feels a sense of pessimism about the future but believes direct communication between the U.S. and Iran could resolve significant misunderstandings.</p>

          <p>A 92-year-old man, Ryland Headley, has been found guilty of the 1967 sexual assault and murder of 75-year-old Louisa Dunne in Bristol, a case considered the UK's oldest solved cold case. Mrs. Dunne was found strangled in her home, and despite a massive initial investigation, the case went unsolved for nearly 60 years. The breakthrough came when modern DNA testing linked semen from a swab taken at the scene to Headley, who had prior convictions for sexually assaulting elderly women. The conviction was secured by combining new forensic technology with original evidence, bringing a long-awaited resolution to the decades-old crime.</p>

          <p>On July 1, minimum wage rates are set to increase in two states, Alaska and Oregon, as well as in Washington, D.C., and a dozen other cities and counties. According to the Economic Policy Institute, these hikes will benefit over 800,000 workers, with a significant portion being women and a disproportionate number of Black and Hispanic workers. The increases, driven by ballot measures and inflation adjustments, will provide average annual pay boosts ranging from $420 in Oregon to $925 in Alaska. This state and local action contrasts with the federal minimum wage, which has remained unchanged at $7.25 per hour since 2009.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has thrown out several appellate court rulings that had favored transgender individuals in Idaho, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and West Virginia. This action follows the Court's recent decision upholding a Tennessee law that bans certain medical treatments for transgender youth. The justices instructed the lower courts to reconsider their decisions, which had found state restrictions on healthcare access and birth certificate changes to be unconstitutional. While these specific cases are being sent back for review, the Court has not yet decided whether to take up separate cases concerning the participation of transgender students in school sports.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has announced it will rescind its digital services tax on large technology firms, a move made to restart trade talks with the United States. The decision came just before the first tax payments were due and followed President Donald Trump's threat to halt all trade negotiations over the policy, which he called a "blatant attack." The 3% tax would have affected revenues of tech giants like Amazon and Google and was expected to generate significant income for Canada. The reversal aims to de-escalate trade tensions and focus on strengthening the economic partnership between the two neighboring countries.</p>

          <p>Homeowners currently benefit from relatively low interest rates on home equity loans and HELOCs compared to other financing options like credit cards. While both products have rates in the 8% range, they function differently. HELOCs typically have variable rates tied to the Federal Reserve's decisions, making them unpredictable but likely to fall if the Fed cuts rates later this year. In contrast, home equity loans usually have fixed rates influenced by the mortgage bond market, which may not move in sync with Fed adjustments. Experts suggest that while a rate drop is anticipated, its timing and magnitude remain uncertain for both loan types. (not investment advice)</p>

The administration warned Harvard that it must implement immediate changes to avoid losing its federal financial resources. This finding is the latest development in an ongoing conflict between the Trump administration and the university, which has included freezing grants and threatening its tax-exempt status.</p>

          <p>A seven-year-old girl has died and a six-year-old girl was seriously injured after a large tree collapsed in Chalkwell Park, Southend-on-Sea. An investigation has been launched into the incident, with a local councillor noting that the centuries-old tree had been supported by props for decades. Witnesses reported that up to 50 people, including players from a nearby cricket club, rushed to lift the heavy branches off five children who were trapped underneath. The community has been left devastated by the tragedy, leaving hundreds of floral tributes at the scene while the injured girl receives around-the-clock care in the hospital.</p>

          <p>The recent military conflict between Iran and Israel has raised significant concerns for the safety of invaluable cultural heritage in the region. Museum professionals and archaeologists report that both countries activated emergency plans, evacuating museums like the National Museum in Tehran and securing artifacts in underground storage or with sandbags. Despite these efforts, non-movable artifacts and open-air archaeological sites, such as Iran's Taq-e Bostan rock reliefs, remain highly vulnerable to damage from strikes and shock waves. International bodies like ICOM and UNESCO have issued warnings, but the true extent of any damage remains unclear due to restricted access and information flow.</p>

The acquisition will be carried out by Home Depot's subsidiary, SRS Distribution, and is part of the retailer's strategy to increase its market share with professional contractors like electricians and roofers. This move also effectively ends a potential bidding war for GMS, which had received a competing offer from billionaire Brad Jacobs's company, QXO.

          <p>The UK is experiencing its second heatwave with temperatures over 30Â°C before the end of June, an event that climate scientists say is becoming more common due to climate change. While the immediate cause is a "heat dome" of high pressure, experts are clear that the 1.36Â°C of global warming to date has inevitably boosted the heat's intensity. Data shows that days exceeding 35Â°C are now five times more frequent than in the latter half of the 20th century. Scientists warn that such heatwaves will continue to worsen until greenhouse gas emissions are curtailed, posing risks to UK infrastructure and public health.</p>

          <p>German companies are increasingly looking to Taiwan as an alternative source for drones and their components to reduce reliance on the Chinese market, which currently dominates global production. A recent report shows Germany became the second-largest importer of Taiwanese drones in early 2025, a shift driven by cybersecurity concerns and Western pressure on China over its ties to Russia. Taiwan is actively developing a "non-red" supply chain free of Chinese influence, aiming to provide critical parts like chips and software. While a complete decoupling is unrealistic, Germany seeks to diversify its sourcing for key, high-risk components from democratic partners like Taiwan.</p>

          <p>A Reuters poll of economists and analysts shows a slight increase in oil price forecasts for 2025, largely due to heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. The survey projects Brent crude will average $67.86 per barrel, though many believe price spikes will be temporary unless the conflict escalates significantly. This cautious optimism is tempered by persistent concerns over global demand and rising oil supply from OPEC+ nations. Analysts expect OPEC+ to be cautious about further production increases, while the impact of the U.S.-China trade deal on demand is viewed as modest. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CafÃ© Diana, a London establishment famous for being a favorite of the late Princess Diana, is at risk of losing its license and being forced to close. The Home Office has initiated a review following allegations that the cafÃ© employed illegal migrant workers, with some staff claiming they were paid only in food, raising concerns of labor exploitation. Additionally, inspectors reportedly found illegal shisha smoking in the basement and seized unlabeled tobacco. The cafÃ©'s owners have stated they took swift action against the tenant responsible and have proposed a temporary suspension to implement stricter compliance measures.</p>

          <p>The UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, has proposed new online safety measures aimed at forcing tech platforms to better protect users, especially children. The proposals include compelling platforms to prevent illegal content from going viral and to limit features like virtual gifting on children's livestreams. Ofcom is also considering requiring larger platforms to proactively detect terrorist material. These measures are part of an ongoing effort to enforce the UK's Online Safety Act and adapt to evolving online harms. The consultation is open for feedback from the public, tech companies, and civil society groups until October 2025.</p>

          <p>Moderna announced that its experimental mRNA-based flu vaccine demonstrated a stronger immune response than an existing standard vaccine in a late-stage trial. The positive results pave the way for the company to seek regulatory approval for the shot later this year. This success is also a critical step for Moderna's combination Covid-19 and flu vaccine, as the company plans to resubmit its application for that product with the new supporting efficacy data. If approved, the vaccines could simplify immunization, reduce healthcare system burdens, and allow Moderna to compete in the multibillion-dollar flu vaccine market.</p>

          <h2>Trump Denies Reports of Offering Iran a Nuclear Deal Similar to Obama's</h2>

          <p>President Donald Trump has angrily denied reports that his administration is considering a nuclear deal with Iran that resembles the Obama-era agreement he previously abandoned. The denial came after Democratic Senator Chris Coons cited CNN reports that the administration discussed offering Iran up to $30 billion for a civilian nuclear program and sanctions relief. In a late-night social media post, Trump insisted he is not offering Iran anything and is not in talks with them. This follows Trump's 2018 withdrawal from the original deal, which prompted Iran to accelerate its nuclear program, creating the current diplomatic situation.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Stock Market Reaches Record Highs Despite Persistent Economic Uncertainty</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. stocks have rebounded to all-time highs, yet the overall outlook for the American economy remains unclear. Factors such as ongoing trade negotiations, the potential impact of tariffs, and President Trump's domestic spending bill contribute to this uncertainty. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic noted the difficulty of economic modeling in the current, constantly changing environment. Despite the Fed holding interest rates steady, markets are pricing in the possibility of multiple rate cuts by the end of the year, partly influenced by political pressure on the central bank, creating a complex and volatile financial landscape.
