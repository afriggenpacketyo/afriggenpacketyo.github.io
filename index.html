          <p>The Trump Organization has announced the debut of a cellular phone service called T1 Phone by Trump Mobile, priced at $47.45 per month for unlimited calls, text, and data, coinciding with the 10-year anniversary of Donald Trump's first presidential run announcement. The company plans to release a $499 phone manufactured in the U.S., aiming to challenge competitors like Apple and align with Trump's policies to boost American manufacturing and employment. Ethics concerns have been raised regarding potential conflicts of interest and economic distortions around the Trump brand, particularly if foreign-made parts are used. The plan includes free calls to over 100 countries and access to roadside assistance and telehealth services, with the phone featuring a fingerprint sensor, face recognition, 256GB of storage, and 12GB of RAM.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has extended a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration's attempt to block the entry of Harvard University's international students into the U.S. until June 23. Judge Allison Burroughs issued the extension while she considers a longer-term injunction, following Trump's proclamation on June 4 that cited the university's engagement with China and national security concerns. Harvard has amended its lawsuit, arguing that the proclamation circumvents Burroughs' previous decision and violates the First Amendment. The Department of Homeland Security had previously sought to limit Harvard's ability to enroll students, but Burroughs blocked that action last month.</p>

          <p>President Trump attended the G7 summit in Canada amidst trade tensions, commenting on the Israel-Iran conflict and Putin's absence. Trump stated Iran would "like to talk" but needs to make a deal and confirmed messages through intermediaries indicating a wish to de-escalate. He emphasized his stance as a "tariff person" and suggested considering China's inclusion in the G7, also mentioning Putin's ouster in 2014. Trump's approach to allies and tariffs have created unease, and his past musings about acquiring Canada and Greenland have strained relations, as Canadian Prime Minister Carney clarified that Canada is not for sale during a meeting at the White House.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is expected to hold interest rates steady, impacting various aspects of personal finance. Credit card rates remain high, with consumers encouraged to consider balance transfers or personal loans. Mortgage rates have shown little movement, keeping housing affordability a challenge, while auto loan rates are fixed but rising car prices are increasing payments, and shopping around for financing is advised. Federal student loan rates are fixed annually, shielding borrowers from immediate Fed moves, though many face headwinds and fewer forgiveness options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A review into abuse carried out by grooming gangs in England and Wales highlights flaws in data collection, making it impossible to assess the true scale of the issue. The report points out that ethnicity of perpetrators is "shied away from" and not recorded in two-thirds of cases, but local data suggests a disproportionate number of men from Asian ethnic backgrounds are suspects in group-based child sexual exploitation. Prime Minister Starmer accepted the report's recommendation for a full national inquiry into child sexual exploitation, overseen by an Independent Commission. The report also recommends adults who engage in penetrative sex with a child under 16 should always be charged with sexual assault, and calls for tightening taxi licensing standards to prevent exploitation.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told ABC News that targeting Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei would end the conflict between Israel and Iran. He stated that Israel is preventing Iran from bringing the world to the brink of nuclear war and is "doing what we need to do," including targeting top nuclear scientists. Netanyahu dismissed reports that Iran is seeking to end hostilities and resume negotiations, asserting they are insincere. He also responded to Republicans opposed to America's military support for Israel, arguing that Iran is a threat to the entire world, and the State Department appears to have classified all of Israel and the West Bank as "Level 4: Do Not Travel."</p>

Israel's defense minister claimed responsibility for the attack on the television studio, while Iran announced it had launched approximately 100 missiles in retaliation for Israel's attacks.

The agreement includes a golden share for the U.S. government, granting the president veto power over decisions to relocate U.S. Steel's headquarters, move the company outside the U.S., rename the company, transfer production or jobs abroad, and close or idle plants prematurely. Trump described the transaction as a "partnership," but U.S. Steel confirmed it will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America, with the transaction expected to be completed promptly following customary closing conditions.</p>

          <p>The oil and petrochemical lobby is attempting to fend off a New York state proposal to slash plastic waste by arguing that it will disproportionately burden people of color, advocates and assembly sources say. The packaging reduction and recycling infrastructure bill would place a fee on large businesses that distribute plastic packaging, with revenue benefiting taxpayers â€“ a scheme called extended producer responsibility. Critics argue this is a manipulative tactic to exploit under-resourced communities and undermine environmental protections. Advocates emphasize that plastic production and waste disposal disproportionately harm the health of Black and brown Americans, making the bill beneficial for these communities.</p>

Ads will appear within the status section, and businesses can pay to promote their channels. Users can also subscribe to receive exclusive updates from their favorite channels. This move aims to tap into WhatsApp's massive user base, with 1.5 billion daily users, while minimally interfering with personal chats. Meta emphasizes the encrypted nature of the app, ensuring daily chats won't be used for targeted advertising, and will use limited information like country, language, and channel interactions to show relevant ads.

          <p>Conservative activist group Catholic Vote has released a report titled the "Gavin Newsom files," highlighting what the group calls the California governorâ€™s "extreme" and "viciously anti-Christian agenda." The report criticizes Newsom's stance on issues such as abortion and transgender treatments for children, arguing that he has advanced a liberal agenda not just in California but across the entire country. The report points to Newsom's advocacy for abortion, including commissioning billboards with biblical quotes to promote abortion services in California. A spokesperson for Newsom responded by dismissing the report, citing the organization's ties to President Trump and its lack of representation of the Catholic Church.</p>

It draws parallels between Trump's actions and the rhetoric used by past American presidents to condemn dictators who used military force against their own people. The author cites Trump's policies on immigration, the deployment of Marines and the National Guard to Los Angeles, and the rhetoric used by Trump and his supporters as evidence of authoritarian tendencies. The author claims the administration is targeting multicultural communities and using the term "Third World" to justify the use of military force against those they deem not truly American.</p>

          <p>Borrowing $1,000 from a payday lender can lead to significant financial strain due to high fees and interest rates. Payday loans often charge a flat fee per $100 borrowed, which can quickly add up to a nearly 400% APR. If the loan is rolled over due to inability to repay, the costs can escalate rapidly, trapping borrowers in a cycle of debt. Unlike other forms of credit, payday loans typically do not allow partial payments and can lead to overdraft fees, collection efforts, and potential lawsuits. (not investment advice)</p>
