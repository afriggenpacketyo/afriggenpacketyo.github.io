          <p>London's Heathrow Airport has fully reopened after a partial evacuation of Terminal 4 due to a "hazardous materials" scare. Emergency services, including specialist police officers and the London Fire Brigade, conducted a thorough search but found no trace of any adverse substance. Twenty-one people were assessed by paramedics, with one taken to the hospital as a precaution, though none were in life-threatening condition. The airport apologized for the disruption and stated it was working to ensure flights departed as scheduled.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury has warned that the government could be liable for refunds ranging from $750 billion to $1 trillion if the Supreme Court upholds lower court rulings that President Trump's tariffs are illegal. The administration has collected over $72 billion from these levies and has asked the high court for an expedited ruling to mitigate potential financial disruption. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed confidence in the administration's legal position but acknowledged the "ruinous" economic consequences if forced to issue the massive refunds.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite anticipated interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, high-yield savings accounts may still be a worthwhile option for savers. While returns are no longer at their peak, they remain significantly higher than those offered by traditional savings accounts, providing substantial earning potential. Experts suggest that rate cuts will likely be gradual, minimizing the immediate impact on account yields, and the liquidity of these accounts offers flexibility in an unpredictable economy.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has lifted a lower court's injunction, permitting federal immigration agents in Los Angeles to resume raids and stops that critics argue rely on racial profiling. The 6-3 decision allows agents to consider factors like ethnicity and language when conducting enforcement actions while a broader legal challenge proceeds. Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented strongly, arguing the ruling subjects numerous people to "indignities" based on their appearance and occupation. The White House praised the decision, while California officials condemned it as a threat to civil liberties.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has received documents from the Jeffrey Epstein estate, including a "birthday book" containing a note allegedly signed by President Donald Trump for Epstein's 50th birthday. Democratic committee members released an image of the page, which Trump has previously denied writing, calling it a "fake" and suing The Wall Street Journal over its initial report. The White House reiterated its denial, claiming the signature is not authentic, while Democrats argue it shows the president is attempting to hide something. The investigation into Epstein's records continues with bipartisan involvement.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has initiated new immigration enforcement surges in Chicago and Boston, escalating federal actions in Democrat-led cities. The Chicago operation, named "Midway Blitz," is said to target "criminal illegal aliens" who the DHS claims were drawn to Illinois' sanctuary policies. This move follows a summer of increased federal presence in cities like Washington, D.C., and a Supreme Court ruling allowing controversial raids in Los Angeles. The actions have been met with criticism from local Democratic leaders who accuse the administration of stoking fear rather than promoting public safety.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle maker Rivian has laid off approximately 200 employees, representing about 1.5% of its workforce, as it prepares for changing economic conditions.

These cuts come as Rivian plans to launch its more affordable R2 SUV next year to compete in a tougher market.

          <p>Members of the UK Parliament are pressuring the government to reconsider its decision to proscribe the group Palestine Action as a terrorist organization. The debate follows a weekend protest against the ban that resulted in 890 arrests, a scale not seen in decades. Critics, including Labour MP Stella Creasy, argue the proscription dilutes the meaning of terrorism and infringes on free speech and the right to protest. However, Security Minister Dan Jarvis defended the ban, stating the group has connections to terrorism and is distinct from peaceful pro-Palestinian advocacy.</p>

Financial experts advise that improving one's credit score is the most effective way to qualify for a lower rate, as lenders offer the best terms to borrowers with higher FICO scores. Other key strategies include making a larger down payment of 20% to reduce risk for lenders and considering alternatives to a 30-year fixed loan, such as an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), which offers a lower initial rate.

Seniors who continue to work past age 65 and have creditable health insurance through their employer can typically delay Part B enrollment without penalty. For those with limited income, state-run Medicare Savings Programs or Medicaid can help cover or eliminate the monthly premiums.

          <p>With mortgage rates falling to an 11-month low, many homeowners are considering refinancing their loans. Financial experts advise evaluating several key questions before proceeding, such as whether the current rate drop is significant enough to justify the action, typically at least a one-percentage-point reduction. Homeowners should also calculate the closing costs, which range from 2% to 6% of the loan amount, to ensure the savings outweigh the expense within a reasonable timeframe. Finally, one's long-term plans for the home are crucial, as selling before breaking even on costs would negate the financial benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump continues to suggest deploying National Guard troops to Chicago to address crime, a move staunchly opposed by Illinois Governor JB Pritzker. Despite clarifying he does not intend to "go to war" with the city, the president has maintained that federal intervention is an option, creating a tense political standoff. In response to the rhetoric, the Department of Homeland Security announced a new immigration enforcement operation in the city. The push to militarize local law enforcement in Democrat-run cities has been a recurring theme for the administration, drawing criticism over constitutional concerns.</p>

          <p>Following a weak August jobs report, financial market traders are pricing in a small but notable possibility of the Federal Reserve enacting a half-percentage-point interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting. While a standard quarter-point cut remains the most likely scenario with an 88% probability, the chances for a more aggressive 50-basis-point reduction have risen to 12%. The faltering labor market data has solidified expectations for a rate cut, but economists believe the bar for a larger move remains high, especially with inflation still above the Fed's target.

          <p>France has been thrown into a new political crisis after Prime Minister François Bayrou's government was defeated in a no-confidence vote in the National Assembly. The vote was triggered after Bayrou proposed an austere 2026 budget aimed at tackling the nation's rising debt, a plan that united opposition parties from the left and far-right against him. President Emmanuel Macron must now appoint France's fifth prime minister in under two years, with options including naming a new leader or dissolving parliament.

          <p>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans has increased its settlement offer to victims of clergy sexual assault to a minimum of $230 million. This revised proposal, announced amid the archdiocese's ongoing bankruptcy proceedings, comes after attorneys for a large group of the 660 claimants advised rejecting a previous $180 million offer. The new deal aims to secure the necessary two-thirds approval from survivors to resolve the claims collectively. Survivors may also have the opportunity to pursue additional funds from the archdiocese's primary insurer, which has not yet settled.</p>
