          <p>Hamas has transferred the remains of another deceased hostage to the Israel Defense Forces, which are now undergoing identification at Israel's National Institute for Forensic Medicine. The IDF urged public sensitivity, emphasizing that official identification will first be communicated to the families. This transfer is part of the Gaza peace plan, which required Hamas to return all remaining hostages, both living and deceased. However, with at least 18 deceased hostages still unaccounted for, Hamas has faced accusations of delays, though US advisers acknowledge the immense difficulty in retrieving bodies from the extensive rubble across Gaza, even sharing Israeli intelligence to assist the search.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has formally asked the Supreme Court to permit the deployment of National Guard troops to the Chicago area, escalating a significant showdown with Democratic-led cities. This emergency application follows a federal appeals court upholding a lower court's ruling that blocked the deployment to Illinois. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued the court order improperly impinges on the president's authority and needlessly endangers federal personnel and property. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, however, vowed to defend his state's sovereignty, accusing Trump of overstepping his authority to intimidate political rivals and militarize communities against their will, calling such actions un-American and dangerous for democracy.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County has tentatively agreed to pay an additional $828 million to settle over 400 new claims of sexual abuse against county employees, pending approval by the board of supervisors. This substantial sum follows a historic $4 billion settlement in April for about 11,000 claimants, primarily involving allegations of sexual abuse in LA juvenile facilities that dated back decades. County officials noted ongoing investigations into allegations that some individuals were paid to file fraudulent claims, which adds complexity to the process. These massive settlements have significantly exacerbated the county’s unprecedented financial problems, requiring cuts to critical programs and services.</p>

          <h2>President Trump Commutes George Santos' Fraud Sentence, Citing Mistreatment</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 19:04:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has commuted the seven-year prison sentence of former Republican Congressman George Santos, ordering his immediate release. Trump justified this controversial decision by claiming Santos was "horribly mistreated" in prison, enduring solitary confinement, and also criticized a Democratic lawmaker. Santos, who pleaded guilty to wire fraud and identity theft charges, made history as only the sixth member expelled from Congress. This act of clemency, following Santos's personal plea for a chance to rebuild, is the latest in a series of similar pardons for other former Republican politicians since Trump re-took office, drawing both support and criticism.</p>

          <p>Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff, key US negotiators in the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, reportedly felt "betrayed" by an Israeli airstrike on Qatar that occurred during sensitive peace talks last month. Israel stated the strike targeted senior Hamas leadership in Doha, but Witkoff noted it severely impeded negotiations by causing Hamas to go underground and eroding the confidence of critical Qatari intermediaries. President Trump also expressed concern that the Israelis were acting "out of control" and against their long-term interests, distancing himself from the decision. This incident underscores the profound diplomatic complexities and delicate balance required in brokering peace agreements amidst ongoing conflict, impacting the crucial efforts to secure all remaining hostage releases.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council publicly rebuked its City Attorney, Hydee Feldstein Soto, for attempting to overturn a federal judge's order that prohibits LAPD officers from targeting journalists with crowd control weapons. The council voted 12-0 to direct her to withdraw the request, which her legal team promptly did, informing the court hours later. This action stems from dozens of legal claims by protesters and journalists alleging excessive force during demonstrations against the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. Council members emphasized the critical importance of protecting First Amendment rights and expressed growing frustration over the city attorney's independent legal actions and rising legal payouts, asserting the need for greater legislative consultation and oversight.</p>

          <p>Former National Security Adviser John Bolton has been indicted on 18 counts for allegedly systematically sharing classified information with unauthorized individuals, including family members, to facilitate writing a tell-all book. Prosecutors allege Bolton used a group chat to transmit over 1,000 pages of classified material during his White House tenure, discussing sensitive foreign policy matters. The indictment details instances where Bolton acknowledged the secrecy of the shared information. While Bolton's defense will likely argue political retribution, the case details suggest a serious breach, especially concerning a potential hack by Iran that compromised his email account containing these classified diary entries.</p>

          <p>Prince Andrew has announced he is giving up his royal titles, including the Duke of York, following sustained public and internal pressure over his links with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. In a personal statement, Andrew maintained his denial of the accusations against him but acknowledged that the continued controversies distract from the important work of King Charles III and the wider Royal Family. This significant decision, made in consultation with both the King and the Prince of Wales, means he will no longer use his titles or the honors conferred upon him. The announcement notably precedes the posthumous publication of a memoir by Virginia Giuffre, an Epstein accuser who made serious allegations against Andrew.</p>

Prosecutors stated Djerf sexually assaulted one victim and brutally killed others, leading to a case where "justice demands the ultimate punishment."

The Palace, exasperated by the damage to the Royal Family's reputation, pushed for this resolution to avoid further overshadowing important royal events, like an upcoming state visit. This strategic withdrawal allows him to retain some dignity while Parliament avoids legislative intervention, though questions about his conduct may persist.</p>

          <p>Shares of Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk fell after President Trump announced his administration's goal to cut the cost of brand-name GLP-1 weight loss drugs to $150 per month, a significant reduction from current list prices. Trump cited the vast price disparity between the US and other developed nations for similar medications, referring to Ozempic or "the fat loss drug." While Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz clarified that price negotiations are ongoing, the announcement signals strong governmental intent to lower drug costs. This could significantly impact the pharmaceutical market and consumer access to these popular drugs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Concerns over credit quality are shaking regional bank investors after Zions and Western Alliance disclosed significant losses from alleged fraud in loans to non-depository financial institutions (NDFIs). JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned of more hidden risks, comparing the situation to the churn of the 2023 banking crisis. The episode highlights the rapid growth of NDFI lending, reaching $1.14 trillion, as banks fund riskier activities outside regulated perimeters. Investors are scrutinizing NDFI exposures, as these loans can lead to swift, near-total wipeouts, despite an otherwise improving interest rate environment. (not investment advice)</p>

Newcastle remains winless in the league since November last year, unable to capitalize on their numerical advantage to secure a further score.

          <p>Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy has requested President Trump declare a major disaster after Typhoon Halong devastated villages in the state's southwest, displacing 1,500 people. The storm caused extensive damage, sending water into homes and prompting large-scale air evacuations to shelters in Anchorage, 500 miles away. State senators and a congressman urged federal assistance, stating the disaster's scale exceeds state capacity to repair housing and utilities before winter. This event brings renewed attention to previous Trump administration cuts to grants for disaster preparedness in Indigenous communities, highlighting the vulnerability of remote areas to severe weather impacts.</p>

          <p>Boeing has received FAA approval to increase its 737 Max jetliner production rate to 42 aircraft per month, a significant milestone nearly two years after a midair near-catastrophe led to production caps.

This increase is crucial for Boeing's financial turnaround, as the company has not posted an annual profit since 2018, having faced grounding after two fatal crashes and subsequent supply chain problems.

This departure marks the end of a long-standing tradition of in-person reporting, which CBS journalists credit for building trust and breaking significant stories over decades, covering every military conflict.
