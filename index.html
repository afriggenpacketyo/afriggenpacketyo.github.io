          <p>House Republicans have introduced reconciliation legislation, dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, aimed at boosting families' finances through measures like investment "Trump accounts" for newborns and an enhanced child tax credit. However, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that low-income households could see a decrease in income due to work requirements and cuts to programs like Medicaid and SNAP. The proposed changes may exclude millions of children from fully benefiting from the child tax credit, as it is not fully refundable, disproportionately affecting low-income families. Additionally, changes to the earned income tax credit and cuts to SNAP could further reduce aid for vulnerable families, impacting their access to food assistance and healthcare.

Israel's Defense Forces (IDF) reported intercepting most of the incoming missiles but acknowledged some hits on structures, resulting in injuries. The United States assisted Israel in intercepting Iranian missiles, and U.S. troops in the Middle East were ordered into bunkers during the strikes.

          <p>Ford CEO Jim Farley stated that a shortage of rare earth minerals, essential for automobile production, caused the company to temporarily shut down a factory last month. China, which accounts for approximately 90% of the U.S.'s rare earth mineral supply, has implemented export controls, creating challenges for U.S. automakers. Recent trade discussions between the U.S. and China have resulted in an agreement for Beijing to resume regular exports of rare earths to the U.S., which has brought optimism to Ford.

The conflict's trajectory hinges on Iran's response and whether the U.S. will maintain its sideline position or become more actively involved.

          <p>Kim Sajet, the director of the National Portrait Gallery, has resigned after President Trump attempted to fire her, accusing her of being partisan and supporting DEI. The Smithsonian Institution initially rebuffed Trump's attempt, asserting its independence, but Sajet ultimately decided to step down. Her tenure as the first female director of the gallery was marked by efforts to reimagine the impact and storytelling of portraiture.
