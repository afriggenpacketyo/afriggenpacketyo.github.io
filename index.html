          <p>The FBI conducted a court-authorized search of former National Security Adviser John Bolton's Bethesda, Maryland home. This action is linked to a prior criminal inquiry by the Justice Department during the Trump administration, investigating whether Bolton published classified information in his book, "The Room Where It Happened." The Biden administration had previously closed this investigation and dropped a related lawsuit. The article notes this is a developing story.</p>

Both brothers were convicted in 1996 for the murders of their parents and recently became eligible for parole under California's youth offender law. They claim self-defense due to alleged parental abuse, a stance opposed by the District Attorney who believes they haven't taken full responsibility. The parole board's decision for Erik cited his prison behavior and policy violations.</p>

          <p>The UK government's Home Office is seeking to appeal a High Court decision that blocked housing asylum seekers in an Essex hotel. Epping Forest District Council secured a temporary injunction, citing escalating community tensions following an alleged sexual assault by an asylum seeker. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the appeal aims to ensure a "properly managed way" to close all asylum hotels nationwide, rather than piecemeal court decisions. This legal battle highlights the ongoing challenge of asylum accommodation and local opposition.</p>

          <p>Major retailers like Walmart and Home Depot are mitigating the impact of President Trump's tariffs, preventing widespread price hikes for consumers so far. Companies are diversifying sourcing and pushing costs back to vendors, though some price adjustments have occurred, particularly affecting lower-income households. While consumer spending remains steady in many categories, some sectors and brands, like Crocs, report cautious consumer behavior and weaker sales. This article highlights strategic responses by businesses to ongoing trade uncertainties and their effect on the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated continuous vetting for over 55 million U.S. visa holders to determine eligibility to remain in the country, with potential deportation for violations. The State Department is reviewing law enforcement records and other information for indicators like overstays, criminal activity, or threats to public safety. This crackdown also includes a pause on worker visas for commercial truck drivers, following a fatal crash allegedly involving an illegal immigrant. The policy reflects a broader intensification of immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Florida's state government controversially painted over a rainbow crosswalk in Orlando that honored the 49 victims of the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer condemned the action as a "cruel political act," devoid of safety data or discussion. Democratic State Senator Carlos Guillermo Smith described it as a "hostile act" by the DeSantis administration, which has a history of passing anti-LGBTQ+ laws. Survivors and advocates view the removal as an attempt to erase solidarity and desecrate memory.</p>

          <p>Myanmar's military rulers have officially ended the state of emergency and scheduled national elections for December 28, transferring power to an interim civilian government. However, analysts view these moves as largely symbolic, a "disguise" for continued military rule, aimed at dividing opposition groups. With the regime controlling less than half the country and widespread displacement, international monitors condemn the polls as a charade. China and Russia are expected to endorse the results, while Western countries likely will not.</p>
