        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A cross-party committee of MPs has found that the UK Home Office is unaware if foreign workers are leaving the country or staying illegally after their skilled worker visas expire. The Public Accounts Committee criticized the department for failing to analyze exit check data since the visa route was introduced in 2020, showing little interest in its operational effectiveness. The report also highlighted widespread evidence of worker exploitation, including debt bondage and excessive hours, accusing the Home Office of being slow to address these issues. This scrutiny comes as net migration has reached record levels, partly driven by this visa category.</p>

          <p>The surging electricity demand from artificial intelligence data centers is prompting major technology companies like Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Google to form partnerships with nuclear energy producers. With data center power needs expected to double in five years, these firms are investing in restarting and extending the life of nuclear plants, such as Three Mile Island and Clinton Clean Energy Center. This move aims to secure a stable, 24/7 power source for their energy-intensive AI operations. The trend aligns with a broader push to expand domestic nuclear power to support the AI race and ensure grid stability.</p>

          <p>An explosion and subsequent fire at the Devastating Pyrotechnics warehouse in Yolo County, California, has left seven people unaccounted for. The incident, which occurred Tuesday evening, prompted mandatory evacuations and sparked multiple grass fires covering approximately 80 acres. Officials have confirmed two injuries but no fatalities, though family members are anxiously awaiting news of loved ones believed to be inside. The ATF is assisting in the investigation, which has also revealed the facility lacked the proper local licenses to store or conduct business with commercial fireworks on the agricultural property.</p>

          <p>Edward Kelley, a Tennessee man who was pardoned for his involvement in the January 6 Capitol riot, has been sentenced to life in prison for a separate conviction. The case involved charges of conspiring to attack FBI agents and attempting to incite a civil war. Prosecutors stated that Kelley created a "kill list" of 36 law enforcement personnel who were involved in investigating his role in the Capitol attack. Although his Jan. 6 offenses were pardoned, the pardon did not cover the subsequent conspiracy charges, for which a jury found him guilty.</p>

The legislation imposes stricter work requirements and cuts funding for Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which nonpartisan analyses predict will cause millions to lose their benefits. While proponents claim the bill will reduce fraud and stimulate the economy, critics warn of a massive impact on low-income families and a significant increase in the national deficit.

They recommend exercising dogs earlier in the day and providing mental stimulation, such as puzzle toys, to tire them out before evening festivities begin. For noise-sensitive dogs, it is advised to create a safe, comfortable space away from the noise, use white noise or calming music, and consider anxiety-reducing products like a Thundershirt. The primary advice is to avoid taking dogs to fireworks shows altogether due to their sensitive hearing and the potential for fear and stress.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has put 139 employees on administrative leave after they signed a public letter criticizing the Trump administration's environmental policies. The letter, titled a "Declaration of Dissent," accused the administration of promoting harmful deregulation and disregarding scientific expertise, particularly in cuts to environmental justice programs. An EPA spokesperson stated the agency has a "zero-tolerance policy for career bureaucrats unlawfully undermining" the administration's agenda. The employees were notified they are in a temporary, paid, non-duty status pending an investigation, which the agency insists is not a disciplinary action.</p>

          <p>NASA has identified a new interstellar comet, named 3I/ATLAS, making it the third known object from another star system to visit our solar system. The comet was discovered using a telescope in Chile and is currently located near Jupiter's orbit, traveling at 37 miles per second. It poses no threat to Earth and will make its closest approach to the sun in late October, passing between the orbits of Mars and Earth. Astronomers are now monitoring the object to determine its size, shape, and composition, providing a rare opportunity to study material from outside our solar system.</p>

          <p>U.S. immigration officials have arrested Mexican boxer Julio César Chávez Jr. in Los Angeles with plans to deport him. According to the Department of Homeland Security, the 39-year-old former world champion is a "criminal illegal alien" with an active arrest warrant in Mexico for alleged involvement in organized crime. Officials also stated they believe he has affiliations with the Sinaloa drug cartel. Chávez Jr.'s lawyer has denied the allegations, calling the arrest an effort to terrorize the Latin community. The arrest comes just days after his high-profile match against Jake Paul.</p>

          <p>The Georgia chapter of the Sons of Confederate Veterans has filed a lawsuit against the board overseeing Stone Mountain Park, home to the nation's largest Confederate monument. The suit alleges that plans to create an exhibit detailing the site's ties to slavery, segregation, and the Ku Klux Klan violate state law, which protects the monument. The park's board approved the "truth-telling" exhibit in 2021 as part of a broader effort to provide historical context. The Confederate group argues these changes would radically revise the park's purpose as defined by Georgia law.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to deport eight men who have been detained for weeks at a U.S. military base in Djibouti. The order allows for their removal to South Sudan, a war-torn nation where nearly all of the men have no personal ties. This decision follows a recent ruling by the court's conservative majority that paused a lower court's order requiring due process for immigrants facing deportation to third countries. Dissenting justices argued the ruling gives the administration special treatment, allowing it to send the men to a place where they could face torture or death.</p>

          <p>This opinion article proposes a method to make popular anti-obesity drugs like GLP-1s more affordable for Americans with employer-sponsored health insurance. The author suggests eliminating the complex system of rebates and coupons, which inflates list prices, and instead having manufacturers charge health plans a direct, lower price. Employers could then contribute a portion of this cost, significantly reducing the out-of-pocket expense for employees to levels seen in other countries. This approach would simplify the pricing structure, increase access to clinically important medication, and empower doctors to make prescribing decisions based on patient needs rather than financial barriers.</p>

          <p>As part of the newly passed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," tipped workers in the U.S. will receive a temporary tax exemption on their income. The provision allows workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually from their taxable income, a move that would cover the majority of individuals in tipped occupations. The law includes a phase-out for high earners and restricts the exemption to jobs that customarily receive tips, with the IRS and Treasury to provide further definition. This policy, a key campaign promise for President Trump, is set to expire at the end of 2028 unless extended by Congress. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An investigation has uncovered a thriving black market for illegal cigarettes across the UK, with high street mini-marts and other small businesses serving as fronts for organized crime. These shops sell counterfeit and smuggled tobacco at a fraction of the legal price, costing the UK billions in lost tax revenue. Criminology experts link these networks to more serious crimes, including human trafficking and illegal immigration, with some workers allegedly being exploited asylum seekers. Authorities and Trading Standards officers report being under-resourced and struggling to combat the pervasive and profitable illicit trade.</p>

Concessions, such as benefits for Alaska's whaling industry and protections for rural hospitals, were added to win over key senators. In the final hours, direct calls from Trump and a seven-hour-long procedural vote in the House were employed to overcome remaining resistance and pass the legislation by his July Fourth deadline.</p>

          <p>President Trump's newly passed domestic policy bill includes a historic federal investment of approximately $170 billion to significantly expand immigration enforcement. The legislation allocates $45 billion for detention centers, $30 billion for more ICE personnel, and $46.5 billion to complete the border wall. The funding aims to support the administration's goals of ending "catch and release" and increasing deportations. Critics are concerned that the massive increase in detention capacity will make it harder for individuals to access legal counsel and win relief, while also imposing new, higher fees for processes like asylum applications and appeals.</p>
