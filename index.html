          <h2>Nvidia Shares Surge Amid Anticipation of Trump Administration Easing Chip Export Limits</h2>

          <p>Nvidia's stock price experienced a 3% increase following reports that the Trump administration intends to revise the "AI diffusion" rule, a set of chip trade restrictions proposed during the Biden administration. This rule categorizes countries into tiers with varying limitations on exporting advanced AI chips. The anticipated rescission of the rule, initially scheduled to take effect on May 15, has sparked optimism among investors. Nvidia has declined to comment on the matter, while the potential policy shift signals a significant development in the landscape of international chip trade and technological competition.</p>

          <p>Three former Memphis police officers were found not guilty on all charges, including second-degree murder, in the 2023 beating death of Tyre Nichols, an event that triggered nationwide protests against police brutality. The state jury's verdict contrasts with the officers' prior federal convictions for witness tampering and civil rights violations. Civil rights attorney Ben Crump called the verdicts "a devastating miscarriage of justice." The officers involved were members of the since-disbanded Scorpion Task Force, and video footage of the incident showed Nichols being assaulted during a traffic stop after attempting to flee from officers.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to terminate funding for over 1,000 AmeriCorps programs has drawn criticism and legal action, with some organizations arguing that the cuts disproportionately affect impoverished and rural areas that voted for Trump. The impacted programs include child abuse prevention initiatives, tutoring services in rural Alaska, and flood relief efforts in West Virginia. Some organizations have filed a lawsuit, arguing that the cuts threaten the future of community assistance projects and put AmeriCorps staff at risk of layoffs. A White House spokeswoman defended the cuts, citing AmeriCorps' repeated audit failures and alleged waste and abuse.</p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) released a preliminary report on the Hudson River helicopter crash that resulted in six fatalities, including a family of five from Spain and the pilot.

The tail boom separated from the main body of the helicopter while flying at an altitude of approximately 675 feet. The absence of video or data recording devices complicates the investigation, though the pilot's sunglasses, potentially equipped with recording capabilities, remain unrecovered.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve decided to maintain interest rates, citing significant uncertainties stemming from President Trump's tariffs and their potential impact on inflation and economic growth.

Powell stated that the Fed is prepared to respond to economic developments but remains unsure about the appropriate course of action, dampening expectations of a rate cut in June. The central bank is grappling with assessing the economic fallout from the administration's policies while striving to maintain a healthy labor market and stable inflation.</p>

          <p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has indicted several individuals, including a county judge and city council members, for "vote harvesting" and tampering with evidence, escalating his allegations of voter fraud in Latino communities. The charges involve accusations of illegal vote harvesting, which typically involves collecting and delivering absentee or mail-in ballots for third parties. The investigation stemmed from a referral from a Republican district attorney and follows previous law enforcement raids on political operatives and voting organizers. Critics have accused Paxton of attempting to suppress Latino voters.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Cites Tariff Uncertainty as Reason for Holding Rates Steady</h2>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has opted to keep interest rates unchanged, citing the significant uncertainty created by President Trump's tariffs. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell stated that the economic fallout from these tariffs makes it unclear what the bank should do next, acknowledging the risk of both economic slowdown and faster price rises. This decision marks the third consecutive meeting without action, leaving the bank's key lending rate around 4.3%. The central bank is set up to make policy independently of the White House and is now facing a complex situation due to the potential impact of trade policies.</p>

While the White House has walked back Trump's initial announcement, Voight maintains that the proposal aims to level the playing field and ensure the U.S. film industry remains competitive.
