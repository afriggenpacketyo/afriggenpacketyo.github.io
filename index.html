          <p>A recent report indicates that China is shifting its energy investments in Africa towards renewable energy projects, with solar and wind power comprising 59% of its energy initiatives on the continent. Between 2010 and 2024, China invested approximately $66 billion in Africa's energy sector, with a significant portion dedicated to renewable energy. This shift aligns with China's global commitment to halting funding for new coal-fired power plants overseas and reflects Africa's growing energy demands and China's dominance in solar panel production. The article emphasizes the competitiveness of Chinese wind and solar technology in meeting Africa's energy needs.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China are engaging in high-stakes negotiations in Geneva to ease trade tensions stemming from President Trump's trade war. The talks aim to address the economic disruption caused by tariffs imposed by both countries, which have affected global supply chains and fueled inflation. Despite some positive remarks from Trump, economists remain skeptical about the likelihood of a quick deal, emphasizing that even with reduced tariffs, the overall effective rate would still be significantly higher than before the trade dispute.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a guest essay, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, argues that the pressure on mothers to be perfect is harmful to both themselves and their children. She suggests that being flawed is an essential part of motherhood, as it teaches children to accept their own imperfections and understand that relationships are reciprocal. Dr. Ross encourages mothers to stop striving for an unattainable ideal and to recognize that they are already good enough. The article also touches on how the field of psychiatry has historically blamed mothers for their children's problems.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has voiced concerns about cutting the consumption tax to combat inflation, citing potential strain on state finances. This comes as opposition parties support a consumption tax cut ahead of the House of Councillors election. Ishiba emphasized the need for thorough discussions on alternative support measures for those in need. He also stated that Japan will continue to seek the complete abolition of additional duties on Japanese exports during tariff negotiations with the United States.</p>
