          <p>Entertainer Michael Feinstein reflects on his 50-year career dedicated to performing and preserving the Great American Songbook. He describes his early life, his formative six years working with lyricist Ira Gershwin, and his belief that the canon of great American music is constantly evolving to include artists like Carole King and Billy Joel. To ensure this musical legacy endures, Feinstein established the Great American Songbook Foundation and a corresponding youth academy in Indiana. The foundation aims to educate the next generation, planting a seed of appreciation for these timeless songs.</p>

          <p>A 42-year-old man allegedly stabbed eleven people with a folding knife at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan, before being apprehended by law enforcement. The attack, which authorities believe was random, left six victims in critical condition and five in serious condition. A deputy arrived within three minutes of the 911 call, and officials credited citizen involvement with helping to detain the suspect. Governor Gretchen Whitmer described the event as a "brutal act of violence," and the FBI is providing support to the local sheriff's office in the ongoing investigation.</p>

          <p>In an interview, White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought outlined the administration's economic priorities, including a desire for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. Vought criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell for being too slow to react to economic developments and defended the administration's review of federal funding for education and health programs, which he claimed were previously mismanaged. He also discussed the potential for a future rescissions package to claw back appropriated funds, asserting the executive branch's authority to spend less than Congress allocates to curb wasteful spending.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has announced a daily 10-hour "tactical pause" in military operations in three populated areas of Gaza to allow for the secure delivery of humanitarian aid. This move comes amid mounting international concern over a deepening hunger crisis, with aid agencies and food experts warning of famine. The United Nations welcomed the step but reiterated that a broader ceasefire is necessary to address the widespread suffering. In conjunction with the pause, aid trucks from Egypt and Jordan have begun moving toward Gaza, and the IDF conducted food airdrops into the territory.</p>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch announced that her party, if elected, would introduce legislation to ban all National Health Service (NHS) doctors from going on strike. The proposal would place doctors under the same restrictions as police and military personnel by enforcing minimum service levels during industrial action. The announcement comes as thousands of resident doctors began a five-day strike over pay disputes with the British Medical Association (BMA), which argues that wages have declined significantly in real terms. Badenoch accused the BMA of becoming increasingly militant and stated the policy is necessary to protect patients.</p>

          <p>The art world is celebrating the legacy of sculptor Louise Nevelson, known for her massive, monochromatic sculptures often created from found wooden objects. Though she declared her artistic intentions at age nine, it took decades for her to gain recognition, with her first retrospective held at the Whitney Museum in 1967. Her granddaughter, Maria Nevelson, recalls the artist's unconventional nature and her habit of 'dumpster diving' for materials on the streets of New York. Nevelson's work, which transformed humble materials into monumental art, is currently on display at both the Whitney in New York and the Columbus Museum of Art.</p>

          <p>France's long-standing political and economic influence in its former African colonies, particularly in the Sahel region, is rapidly declining amid growing anti-French sentiment. This shift is forcing French companies, which once enjoyed preferential treatment, to adapt to a more competitive global market where nations like China, Turkey, and Russia are gaining ground. In response, some French corporations are suspending operations, while others are pursuing new strategies, such as forming local partnerships or shifting focus to non-French-speaking African countries. Experts suggest that to remain credible, these companies must now prioritize co-construction and shared benefits with local communities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analytical article posits that the key to understanding Donald Trump's political and economic decision-making is his deep-seated avarice, or an insatiable greed for money itself. The author argues that Trump's focus on dealmaking, whether successful or not, serves to enhance his brand and personal wealth, subverting traditional market mechanisms. This "egonomics" connects his narcissistic needs directly to financial gain, with policies like tariffs being tools to dominate a global prestige economy, which in turn facilitates more profitable deals. The piece concludes that Trump's ventures, especially in cryptocurrency, exemplify how he has attached this core impulse to the machinery of the markets.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In Bogotá, Colombia, a persistent scam known as the "pinchallantas" (tire-puncturers) is plaguing motorists. Saboteurs on motorcycles deliberately spread sharp objects on roads to damage car tires. They then approach the stranded drivers and guide them to nearby mechanics who are allegedly complicit in the scheme. These mechanics are accused of creating additional holes in the tires and then overcharging for the repairs. Despite a recent surge in complaints and a police crackdown on suspicious repair shops, the fast-moving nature of the con makes it difficult for authorities to catch the perpetrators in the act.</p>

          <p>In his column, former rugby player Matt Dawson asserts that for the current British and Irish Lions team to achieve legendary status, they must secure a 3-0 series whitewash against Australia. While celebrating the series win, Dawson contends that a clean sweep, a feat not accomplished on a major tour in nearly a century, would cement their legacy for decades. He contrasts the current squad's mindset with his own 1997 series-winning team, noting that today's players are openly discussing the 3-0 goal. Dawson suggests that a few strategic team changes could freshen up the squad for the final Test in Sydney.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer plans to discuss the humanitarian situation in Gaza during his upcoming meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland. Starmer is expected to support U.S. efforts for a ceasefire and explore further actions to get aid into the territory, where agencies warn of mass starvation. The discussion comes as Israel faces growing international pressure over the crisis, and Starmer faces domestic pressure to formally recognize a Palestinian state. The UK government has stated that starvation must never be used as a weapon of war and has called on Israel to lift aid restrictions.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee is using billboards in rural, Republican-leaning states to blame President Trump for the financial strain on local hospitals. The signs, placed near four struggling facilities, claim that cuts to Medicaid under Trump's major healthcare act are forcing hospitals to close. Since 2010, over 150 rural hospitals have closed, and analyses suggest that the recent $1 trillion cut from Medicaid could lead to hundreds more closures over the next decade. While Republicans included a $50 billion rural health fund in the bill, Democrats argue it is insufficient and functions as a political "slush fund."</p>

          <p>Merchants in Oakland's Chinatown, one of the oldest in the U.S., report that escalating tariffs on Chinese goods are posing a new economic threat to their businesses. After surviving the pandemic and anti-Asian violence, shop owners say that while customer traffic remains steady, spending on imported items like furniture, tea, and traditional foods has dropped significantly. One supermarket owner noted that costs have risen by an average of 50 percent due to the tariffs, forcing customers to buy less. The financial strain is a significant challenge for the nearly 300 businesses in the historic district.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Donald Trump's presidency is inadvertently making socialist ideas more appealing, particularly to a younger generation disillusioned with the current economic system. The author contends that Trump's protectionist trade policies, cronyism, and rhetoric vilifying free markets echo the socialist critique that capitalism is inherently exploitative. As faith in market economics wanes due to growing inequality and perceived corruption, self-described socialists are gaining political traction. The piece suggests that to counter this trend, proponents of market economics must address these legitimate grievances and cleanse the system of its excesses.</p>

          <p>This essay mourns the disappearance of comprehensive event listings from publications like The New York Times and The Village Voice, arguing their absence harms artists, audiences, and the cultural ecosystem. The author reflects on how these listings once served as a vital guide to discovering new music and performance art, helping to launch careers and build communities around niche subcultures. The shift in media towards covering only what is already popular, driven by internet economics and "poptimism," has created a feedback loop that starves emerging artists of visibility. The writer calls for a return to robust local arts coverage as a public good.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains that the American practice of tipping has its roots in the post-Civil War era, where it was promoted as a way for employers, particularly in the restaurant and service industries, to avoid paying wages to formerly enslaved Black workers. This system was later codified with the creation of the "tipped minimum wage," currently just $2.13 per hour at the federal level, with the expectation that customer tips make up the difference. An analyst from the Economic Policy Institute notes that this places the burden of paying workers' wages on consumers and makes employees vulnerable to wage theft.</p>
