          <p>The FDA announced plans to phase out eight artificial food dyes in the US food supply by the end of next year, responding to pressure from health advocates and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the US health secretary. The move comes amid growing concerns about the potential adverse effects of these dyes, particularly on children's behavior and health. While not a complete ban, the FDA's action signals a significant shift towards healthier food standards and aligns with consumer demand for more natural ingredients. The FDA will work with food companies to transition to natural alternatives such as beet, carrot, and watermelon juice.</p>
