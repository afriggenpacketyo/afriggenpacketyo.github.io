          <p>Tens of thousands of LGBTQ+ individuals and supporters participated in the Budapest Pride march, defying a government ban under a controversial "child protection" law. Prime Minister Viktor Orb치n's government had threatened participants with fines and organizers with jail time, but the event proceeded with significant turnout and international support. The march has become a symbol of resistance against what critics describe as the erosion of civil liberties and democratic rights in Hungary under Orb치n's leadership. The event highlighted the deep divisions within the country over LGBTQ+ rights and government authority.</p>

          <p>Former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, now Red Bull's head of global soccer, has strongly criticized the newly expanded 32-team FIFA Club World Cup, calling it one of football's "worst ideas." He expressed serious fears about the increased workload and fixture congestion, warning that players are not getting adequate physical or mental recovery. Klopp's comments echo concerns from players and the global union Fifpro, which has highlighted the risk of unprecedented injuries due to the packed calendar. He argued that the relentless schedule devalues the sport by preventing players from delivering top performances.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are urgently working to pass a massive tax and spending bill, a key component of President Donald Trump's second-term agenda, before a July 4th deadline. The 940-page legislation aims to extend Trump-era tax cuts by making cuts to welfare programs, a point of contention among some party members. The latest version includes concessions, such as raising the cap on state and local tax deductions, to win over holdouts. Democrats have heavily criticized the bill, particularly its proposed restrictions on Medicaid, which the CBO estimates could leave nearly 8 million people uninsured. (not investment advice)</p>

City officials, however, have welcomed the event as "high-quality tourism," and Bezos reportedly donated several million euros to conservation groups.

          <p>Thousands of protesters gathered in Bangkok, calling for the resignation of Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra over her handling of a border dispute with Cambodia. The demonstration, organized by a nationalist group, follows a recent border skirmish and the leak of a phone call in which the prime minister was accused of being overly deferential to Cambodia's former leader, Hun Sen. The dispute centers on the historic Preah Vihear temple, an area the International Court of Justice has ruled belongs to Cambodia.

          <p>Lockheed Martin, in partnership with the U.S. Missile Defense Agency, has successfully completed a critical flight test known as Flight Test Other-26a. The test demonstrated the advanced capabilities of the Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR), which effectively detected, tracked, and discriminated a live ballistic missile target amid countermeasures over the Pacific Ocean. This exercise marked a significant milestone, proving the radar's ability to distinguish genuine threats from decoys. The data was also used to simulate a successful missile defense engagement, showcasing the system's integration and readiness.</p>

          <p>An observant employee at a car dealership in St. George, Utah, foiled a major auto theft scheme by identifying a suspicious vehicle identification number (VIN) on a pickup truck. The employee's discovery that the VIN was altered led to the realization that the truck was stolen, prompting the dealership to contact law enforcement. Police then set up a sting operation, arresting three men who were attempting to sell two stolen vehicles worth a combined $95,000. The incident highlights the importance of VIN verification in preventing sophisticated auto theft and fraud.</p>

          <h2>Centrist Republican Congressman Don Bacon Announces He Will Not Seek Re-election</h2>

          <p>Republican Representative Don Bacon of Nebraska, a retired air force brigadier general known for his centrist positions and occasional criticism of Donald Trump, will not seek re-election in 2026. His retirement opens up a significant opportunity for Democrats, as he represents a competitive swing district that includes Omaha and voted for Kamala Harris in the last presidential election. Bacon's decision is seen by Democrats as a sign of weakness for the House GOP's electoral prospects. His tenure was marked by efforts to find bipartisan ground and push back against his party's more extreme elements.</p>

          <h2>Israel's Ambassador to Attend Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Anniversary Ceremony After 2024 Snub</h2>

          <p>Israel's ambassador to Japan, Gilad Cohen, has confirmed he will attend the upcoming peace ceremony in Nagasaki, marking the 80th anniversary of the U.S. atomic bombing. This comes after Nagasaki's city government did not invite Israel to the 2024 ceremony due to the conflict in Gaza, a decision that prompted other G7 ambassadors to withdraw in solidarity. For this year's event, the city has adopted a more inclusive approach, inviting all diplomatic missions. The attendance of Israel's envoy is seen as a step toward mending diplomatic ties around the sensitive annual commemoration.</p>
