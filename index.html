          <h2>US Military Maintains Sexual Assault Investigation Standards Amid Discrimination Review</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 12:31:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. military will keep its current standards for investigating sexual assault claims, according to a senior official, despite a department-wide review of how discrimination claims are handled. This announcement comes as the Defense Department faces potential staff losses in sexual assault case processing due to Trump administration efforts to streamline government operations. While Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has called for reviews of equal opportunity programs to prevent the weaponization of discrimination complaints, officials emphasize that the standard of proof for sexual assault victims will not be raised. The military reports that unfounded sexual assault claims are rare, with only 1% of cases showing evidence of exoneration or non-occurrence.</p>

          <p>In response to the Trump administration's decision to freeze billions in federal funding, dozens of Harvard University professors have pledged to take temporary pay cuts. Eighty-four senior faculty members have committed to donating 10% of their salaries this year, totaling an estimated $2.5 million, to support the school's legal battles. This move signals the faculty's commitment to protecting the university, particularly staff and students, during what they perceive as a crisis. Harvard filed a lawsuit after the Trump administration froze $2.2 billion in federal funding and threatened to suspend another $1 billion in grants, citing concerns over alleged antisemitic incidents and diversity policies on campus.</p>

          <p>The crypto industry is celebrating President Trump's first 100 days in office, citing a "180 pivot" from the Biden years due to a series of executive actions and appointments. These include the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the rollback of SEC enforcement tactics, leading to a more welcoming environment in Washington, D.C. Key appointments, such as Jonathan Gould at the OCC and Paul Atkins at the SEC, signal support for new bank charters for crypto firms and clearer guidance on token issuance. While some criticize Trump's family involvement in crypto projects, the industry largely focuses on these positive developments, including bipartisan momentum in Congress for stablecoin and market structure bills.</p>

          <h2>Automakers Report Sales Surge Amid Tariff Concerns, Future Outlook Uncertain</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 12:24:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Automakers like Ford, Hyundai, and Kia reported significant sales increases in April, driven by consumers rushing to buy vehicles ahead of potential price hikes due to tariffs. This "tariff fear-buying" was further fueled by automakers offering discounts or promising to hold prices steady. However, analysts warn that this surge may be short-lived, as demand slowed in late April due to tightening inventories and rising prices. While automakers benefited from the initial rush, the long-term impact of tariffs and reduced inventories could lead to lower sales in the coming months. Ford is extending its "employee pricing" program through July 4th to mitigate the tariff impact.</p>

          <p>National Security Advisor Mike Waltz and his deputy, Alex Wong, are departing from their positions in the Trump White House. The move comes after scrutiny of Waltz for a Signal chat incident where he mistakenly included a journalist in discussions about a potential military strike. The White House suggests the departures are part of a reorganization, aiming to frame it as a routine transition rather than a response to external pressure. Wong previously served as deputy special representative for North Korea, playing a role in negotiating summits with Kim Jong Un. Their exits follow earlier firings of NSC staffers after right-wing personality Laura Loomer presented opposition research on perceived disloyal individuals.</p>

          <p>Tempers flared during a Yankees-Orioles game after an awkward collision at second base led to benches clearing.

Kjerstad expressed his annoyance toward Reyes, leading to Yankees pitcher Carlos Carrasco rushing towards Kjerstad. While no punches were thrown, words were exchanged, and the situation was quickly de-escalated. The Orioles ultimately won the game and the series, securing only their second series win of the season.</p>

This decision has drawn criticism, with American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten calling it a "direct attack" on children's well-being, while conservative activists like Christopher Rufo praised the move as ending a "slush fund for activists."

This decision is a setback for the president's efforts to crack down on illegal immigration. Judge Fernando Rodriguez stated that invoking the AEA exceeds the scope of the statute. The order clarifies that it does not prevent the administration from pursuing removal proceedings under the Immigration and Nationality Act, but it does prevent the use of the AEA to detain or remove Venezuelan migrants in the Southern District.</p>

A global study reveals this distress is widespread, particularly in wealthy nations, but finds a more traditional happiness curve among young people with strong social connections. The article suggests secularization, with increasing numbers professing no religious affiliation, contributes to this issue. Wealthier countries also report a weaker sense of meaning, inversely correlated with GDP per capita. The article advises prioritizing close relationships, developing one's inner life, and recognizing that material comforts are no substitute for genuine needs.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the shift in cultural perception regarding Harvey Weinstein, with some figures now questioning his guilt amid an anti-Me Too backlash. Right-wing commentator Candace Owens and Joe Rogan have expressed doubts about Weinstein's conviction, fueled by jailhouse interviews and changing attitudes towards sexual violence. This shift reflects a broader trend of questioning accusations against famous men and undermining the Me Too movement's impact. The article argues that these defenses perpetuate harmful myths about sexual assault and undermine the progress made in holding perpetrators accountable.</p>

The Fed began the project in 2021 with an initial cost of $1.9 billion, citing the need for upgrades, code compliance, and energy efficiency. Musk believes the cost overruns should be examined as part of a broader effort to address government waste, despite the Fed not being directly funded by taxpayers.</p>

          <p>The New York Times examines how the Trump administration utilizes style and image as strategic tools. The article suggests that the administration's consistent aesthetic, from the president's appearance to the attire of cabinet members, reinforces its values and messages. Clothes serve as coded signs of fealty, crucial in an administration where visual communication is paramount. The author argues that this focus on appearance is a deliberate strategy to shape public perception and convey a specific value system, regardless of the actual actions taken.</p>

          <p>Kinney County, Texas, has collected approximately $1.7 million in bail from migrants who were subsequently deported before their court appearances, and the money was never returned. Since Governor Greg Abbott increased immigration enforcement in 2021, the county has forfeited bail from hundreds of migrants arrested for trespassing. These forfeitures, along with additional state funding, have provided a new revenue source for the county, leading to increased resources for the sheriff's department and raises for county officials. The county attorney defends the practice, stating that migrants who are deported are responsible for not appearing in court, while others argue that it is unjust to penalize individuals who are unable to attend due to deportation.</p>
