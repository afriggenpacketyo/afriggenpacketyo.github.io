          <p>A New York man faces charges for cyberstalking a UnitedHealthcare CEO's family member, allegedly leaving threatening voicemails expressing satisfaction over the executive's recent killing. Shane Daley, 40, was arrested after making calls between December 4 and 7, 2024, to a work number of the family member, with messages wishing similar fates upon them and the CEO's children. Thompson was fatally shot on December 4, and the suspect, Luigi Mangione, has pleaded not guilty to related charges. If convicted, Daley could face up to five years in prison.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to relax regulations for commercial rocket launches, aiming to boost the US lead in global space markets. The order directs the Transportation Secretary to expedite environmental reviews for FAA launch licenses, potentially benefiting companies like SpaceX. Environmental groups, however, criticize the move, warning it risks people and wildlife due to the disruptive nature of rocket launches and the potential for explosions. This deregulation is seen as prioritizing industry growth over environmental protection.</p>

          <p>Nicholas Rossi, a US man who faked his death and fled to Scotland, has been found guilty of one sexual assault charge in a Utah court. The 38-year-old was accused of sexually assaulting two women in 2008, with prosecutors trying the cases separately. The victim testified that Rossi held her down and forced sexual acts after their relationship soured. Rossi's lawyers attempted to attribute the accusation to resentment. Rossi had previously faked his death in 2020 to avoid criminal charges.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Gallup poll indicates that the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol has fallen to a record low of 54%, a figure not seen since 1958. This decline is linked to increasing public awareness and concern about the health risks associated with alcohol, even in moderation. Young people, aged 18-34, show a particular inclination towards sobriety, with 66% believing moderate drinking is harmful. The shift also highlights gender differences in drinking habits and preferences, with women's alcohol use dropping significantly compared to men's.</p>

          <p>The NBA Board of Governors has unanimously approved the sale of the Boston Celtics to a group led by Bill Chisholm, valuing the franchise at a reported $6.1 billion. This marks the second-largest sale price for a US sports franchise. Chisholm's group will initially acquire at least 51% ownership, with plans to buy out remaining minority shareholders by 2028 at a $7.3 billion valuation. Chisholm, a Massachusetts native and private equity firm co-founder, will assume the role of the Celtics' governor.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Virginia Tech study shows that trained pet dogs can effectively detect the egg masses of the invasive spotted lanternfly, a destructive pest. These insects harm plants and promote mold growth, making their hard-to-find egg masses a critical target for eradication. Dogs, with their superior sense of smell, achieved over 80% accuracy in indoor tests and over 60% in outdoor settings, outperforming human searches. Researchers hope this method can be expanded to combat other invasive species, offering a fun and fulfilling activity for dog owners.</p>

          <p>Low-income Americans, like Dallas resident Angela Harmon, face increasing challenges staying cool due to soaring energy costs, with electricity prices up 5.5% year-over-year. The federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which helps over six million Americans, is slated for elimination in President Trump's 2026 budget proposal. The White House criticizes LIHEAP as a "failed program" marred by fraud, suggesting states should manage utility assistance. Experts warn that climate change is escalating electricity costs, and policies favoring fossil fuels over renewables could exacerbate the issue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK cities are increasingly vulnerable to "firewaves"—multiple urban wildfires triggered by prolonged hot, dry weather, scientists warn. Researchers at Imperial College London, working with the London Fire Brigade, coined the term, noting that ten consecutive days of dry weather significantly heighten the risk. Recent heath and gorse fires in London and Edinburgh highlight this emerging threat, as climate change creates conditions conducive to blazes in areas not historically prone to them. Emergency services are adapting with new technologies like drones and off-road vehicles.</p>

          <p>Juneau, Alaska's capital, faced record-setting floodwaters from a glacial outburst flood stemming from the Mendenhall Glacier's Suicide Basin. The Mendenhall River peaked at an unprecedented 16.65 feet, surpassing last year's record, before waters began to recede. City officials reported minimal flooding and avoided a catastrophic event, crediting temporary Hesko barriers. This annual phenomenon, caused by a retreating glacier, has repeatedly damaged homes, prompting long-term solution studies.

While generally accepted, many employees prefer not to broadcast these plans to avoid appearing unprofessional.
