        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a report from the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog agency indicating Iran's increasing stockpile of near weapons-grade uranium, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi spoke with IAEA Director Rafael Mariano Grossi, stressing Iran's "continuous cooperation." Araghchi asserted that all nuclear activities are within existing agreements and monitored by the IAEA, while also urging Grossi to prevent the agency's exploitation for political agendas. The IAEA has reported that Iran's cooperation regarding uranium traces at undeclared nuclear sites has been "less than satisfactory." Iran's deputy foreign minister rejected many of the report's findings, noting the high number of IAEA inspections conducted in Iran, while reaffirming that Iran is not pursuing nuclear weapons. Optimism for de-escalation is tempered by the potential for further actions from European nations based on the IAEA report.</p>

Meanwhile, Malaysia's Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim is advocating for a unified Asean response to ensure trade fairness amid rising tensions. Asean has the opportunity to assert itself as a key player in global trade by fostering a neutral, inclusive ecosystem that prioritizes regional resilience and strategic autonomy.</p>

          <p>Dana Chandler was convicted of the 2002 murders of her ex-husband, Mike Sisco, and his girlfriend, Karen Harkness, after a series of trials and appeals. The case involved circumstantial evidence, including Chandler's history of stalking Sisco and a lack of alibi, with her own daughter secretly recording conversations that were used in court. Chandler's first conviction was overturned due to prosecutorial misconduct, but she was retried and ultimately found guilty after representing herself in the third trial.

Players fear that careers will be shortened due to mental and physical strain caused by excessive tennis. The ATP and WTA Tours acknowledge these concerns, but finding a solution to alleviate the strain remains a challenge.</p>

          <p>Public debate has emerged in China regarding the reinstatement and promotion of officials disciplined for misconduct, exemplified by a case of a young Communist Party cadre involved in a drinking spree. State media promotes these cases as rehabilitation examples, but the public expresses frustration over officials being rewarded for their past actions. This practice reflects Beijing's effort to incentivize officials amid an anti-corruption campaign and economic challenges.

High food price inflation reduces citizens' purchasing power, leading to increased consumption of processed foods with low nutritional value. The Health Ministry has launched a national campaign to combat obesity, but faces criticism for overlooking broader economic struggles and failing to restrict the marketing of unhealthy foods. Addressing the crisis requires comprehensive strategies including nationwide free school meal programs and better food oversight policies.</p>

          <p>Simon Tisdall argues that Donald Trump's blend of aggression and weakness towards China increases the risk of war with Taiwan. Trump's trade policies and tariffs, aimed at pressuring China, could provoke Xi Jinping to test Trump's resolve, especially given the divided opinion in Washington on defending Taiwan militarily. The author suggests that Trump's self-interest and fear, rather than principles, drive his policies, making him an unreliable ally for Taiwan and emboldening China.</p>

          <p>In this guest essay, a palliative care physician reflects on how mortality forces clarity about how we truly wish to live. Rather than focusing on outlandish bucket lists, people often reconcile differences between the life they have and the one they longed for. Reflection on mortality nudges people toward a more complicated version of the ordinary, such as attending a small wedding ceremony or calling an estranged sibling. The author suggests that living with an awareness of uncertainty allows for the possibility of living freely.</p>
