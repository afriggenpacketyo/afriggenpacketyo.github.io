          <p>Artificial intelligence startup Cognition has secured $400 million in a new funding round, elevating its valuation to $10.2 billion just two months after its strategic acquisition of Windsurf. The company, known for developing the AI software engineer "Devin," has seen its annual recurring revenue more than double since the purchase. This new valuation places Cognition among elite AI firms like OpenAI and Anthropic, signaling strong investor confidence in its growth trajectory. The funding was led by Peter Thiel's Founders Fund and will be used to further develop both the Devin and Windsurf platforms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Graham Linehan, co-creator of the comedy series 'Father Ted', stated he does not regret the social media posts that led to his arrest at Heathrow Airport. He was arrested over posts challenging the presence of a "trans-identified male" in a female-only space, which some have described as inciting violence. Linehan defended his actions as standing up for women's rights and expressed frustration over what he perceives as a lack of attention to the issue, stating he intends to sue the police for wrongful arrest. The incident has ignited a broader debate in the UK concerning free speech, policing, and transgender rights.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has stated that his office received no prior notification regarding the Department of Homeland Security's "Operation Midway Blitz," an enhanced immigration enforcement action in the city. DHS announced the operation would target "criminal illegal aliens," linking the action to a fatal drunk driving incident involving an undocumented immigrant. Governor JB Pritzker and Mayor Johnson criticized the move as a political tactic focused on creating fear rather than a coordinated public safety effort. The mayor's office reaffirmed its opposition to militarized immigration enforcement, citing concerns over potential human rights violations and constitutional overreach.</p>

The deal ensures the conservative direction of outlets like Fox News and The Wall Street Journal will continue. Under the terms, Lachlan's siblings—Prue MacLeod, Elizabeth Murdoch, and James Murdoch—will cease to be beneficiaries of trusts holding company shares and are expected to sell their holdings. This resolution ends all litigation over the family trust and formalizes the leadership transition for the influential media conglomerate.</p>

          <h2>American Confidence in Finding New Employment Drops to a Record Low</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-08 17:44:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reveals that Americans' confidence in their ability to find a new job has fallen to its lowest point since data collection began in 2013. The perceived probability of securing new employment after a job loss dropped significantly to 44.9%, while concerns about current job security have increased. This decline in optimism reflects a broader negative sentiment about the U.S. economy and a labor market described by experts as a "low-fire, low-hire" environment.

          <p>Jason Matheny, a former senior Biden administration official and current CEO of the RAND Corporation, is highlighted as a central figure in the "effective altruism" movement, which advocates for stringent regulation of artificial intelligence to mitigate potential existential risks. The article details Matheny's philosophy of influencing government policy from both inside and outside official roles to promote AI safety, a view that contrasts with the Trump administration's push for "America's global AI dominance." While proponents see this as a necessary precaution, critics argue this "doomsayer" perspective could stifle innovation and U.S. competitiveness in the rapidly advancing field of AI.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has lifted a lower court's order that had restricted immigration raids in Los Angeles, allowing federal agents to resume stops based on factors like race, language, or occupation. The 6-3 decision is a victory for the Trump administration's aggressive deportation agenda. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, writing for the majority, argued that while ethnicity alone is not sufficient for suspicion, it can be a "relevant factor." In a sharp dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor warned that the ruling subjects countless individuals to indignities based on their appearance and occupation, undermining constitutional protections.</p>

          <p>Two Republican senators, Rick Scott and Ron Johnson, have initiated a new congressional investigation into the response to the deadly Palisades fire that occurred in January. The probe will examine the adequacy of emergency preparations, with a specific focus on why a major local reservoir was empty during the blaze, which may have hampered firefighting efforts. This federal inquiry adds to several ongoing investigations at the state and local levels aimed at determining accountability for the fire that killed 12 people and destroyed the neighborhood. The investigation follows reports that critical water infrastructure was offline for repairs when the fire broke out.</p>

This shift is the culmination of years of strategic efforts by Kim to elevate his country's international standing, which began with brokered talks with the U.S. in 2018.

          <p>Staff at Angel Island State Park recently filmed a coyote paddling across the Raccoon Strait, the deep waterway separating the island from mainland Marin County in the San Francisco Bay. This sighting provides a rare glimpse into how the island's "budding population" of coyotes, first established in 2017, likely arrived. Researchers believe the original breeding pair swam over a mile through strong currents to colonize the island, filling a new predator niche. The park confirmed that coyotes are strong swimmers and is using the incident to educate the public on coexisting with the growing local wildlife population.</p>

The three-judge panel concluded that the plaintiffs, including the state NAACP, failed to prove that the amendments were passed with discriminatory intent.

The Trump administration is urging the Supreme Court to expedite its review of the case, arguing that the president acted within his authority and that a forced refund would be economically "ruinous."

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the latest updated COVID-19 vaccines, specifically targeting adults aged 65 and older and younger individuals with certain medical conditions that increase their risk of severe illness. While officials state that anyone can receive a vaccine after consulting with a doctor, the narrower formal approval may limit access for some. The list of high-risk conditions is extensive, including common ailments like asthma, diabetes, and obesity, making an estimated 100 to 200 million Americans eligible under the new framework. Pharmacies are expected to begin administering the new shots in the coming days.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics is expected to release a preliminary benchmark revision that could significantly lower the number of jobs created in the U.S. through March 2025. Economists predict the revision may show that hiring was about 800,000 jobs lower than initially reported, which would adjust the average monthly job growth in 2024 down from 165,000 to around 100,000. This annual revision uses more comprehensive data from nearly all U.S. employers and provides a more accurate picture of the labor market. The potential downward adjustment aligns with other recent data suggesting a significant slowdown in the U.S. economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The family of a four-year-old boy who was bitten by a venomous copperhead snake at a North Carolina daycare claims the facility's staff did not call 911. The daycare, New Beginnings Child Enrichment Center, stated that staff initially believed the child had a splinter from rubber mulch and only realized it was a snake bite later. They then called the child's guardian to pick him up immediately, asserting that because the guardian was nearby, the child received timely hospital treatment and is now recovering. The incident has sparked a debate online about the daycare's emergency response protocol.</p>

          <p>House Democrats have publicly released an image of a note allegedly signed by Donald Trump and sent to Jeffrey Epstein for his 50th birthday in 2003. The document, obtained from Epstein's estate via subpoena, features a hand-drawn female torso and a cryptic message, which Trump has vehemently denied writing. The White House maintains the note and signature are fake and is pursuing a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal for first reporting on its existence. The release intensifies scrutiny of the former president's past association with the disgraced financier and has led to accusations of a cover-up.</p>

          <p>Members of the UK Parliament are pressuring the government to reconsider its decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist organization, following the arrest of nearly 900 people at a protest in London. MPs, including Labour's Stella Creasy, argued that banning the group and arresting demonstrators for holding signs dilutes the meaning of terrorism and infringes on free speech. However, Security Minister Dan Jarvis defended the ban, insisting the decision was based on an independent expert assessment of the group's connections to terrorism and willingness to use violence. The debate highlights the deep divisions over the balance between national security and the right to protest.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage approaches a one-year low, experts advise that prospective homebuyers can take several steps to secure even better terms. Improving one's credit score is paramount, as higher FICO scores directly translate to lower interest rates offered by lenders. Making a larger down payment, ideally 20% or more, also reduces risk for lenders and can result in a more favorable rate. Additionally, borrowers should consider alternatives to the traditional 30-year fixed loan, such as an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), which can offer a significantly lower initial rate.

          <p>The article explores whether seniors can avoid paying the monthly premium for Medicare Part B, which is $185 in 2025. While completely avoiding the premium is not possible for most, there are specific scenarios for delaying enrollment or receiving financial assistance. Seniors still working with creditable employer health coverage can delay Part B without penalty, and low-income individuals may qualify for Medicare Savings Programs that help cover the cost. However, forgoing Part B enrollment can make one ineligible for crucial supplemental coverage like Medigap and Medicare Advantage plans, potentially leading to higher out-of-pocket costs later.</p>

          <p>This article provides guidance for savers considering where to deposit a significant sum like $40,000, comparing the merits of a certificate of deposit (CD) versus a high-yield savings account. A key consideration is the long-term interest potential; a CD locks in a fixed rate, protecting against future rate cuts, while a high-yield savings account rate is variable. Savers must also assess their need for liquidity, as CDs penalize early withdrawals, whereas savings accounts offer flexibility. Despite declining rates, both options remain far more profitable than traditional savings accounts, which offer minimal returns. (not investment advice)</p>
