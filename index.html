        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese achieved a significant victory by winning a second consecutive term, defying the historical "incumbency curse." Albanese's center-left Labor government is set to increase its majority following a substantial defeat of the conservative Liberal-National coalition. Cost-of-living concerns, healthcare affordability, housing, climate change, and energy were central issues in the campaign. Albanese has pledged to address these issues while also advancing reconciliation with First Nations people, referencing the failed Voice referendum of 2023. The election results signify a tempering of the trend of voters abandoning the two major parties.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, enabling taxpayer funds to support private school tuition for qualifying students. The legislation allows most students attending accredited private schools to receive $10,000 per year, while students with disabilities can receive up to $30,000, and home-schooled students will get $2,000 annually. Democrats argue that the bill will divert funds from already underfunded public schools, primarily benefiting wealthier families already enrolled in private institutions. Abbott maintains that the bill empowers parents to choose the best educational option for their children.</p>

          <p>Florida lawmakers have approved a measure aimed at alleviating the financial burden on condominium owners facing rising costs in aging buildings, following strict new requirements enacted after the Surfside collapse in 2021. The bill extends the deadline for completing structural integrity inspections and grants condo associations a two-year grace period to fully fund reserves. It also permits associations to secure loans for repairs with member approval. The legislation seeks to balance resident safety with the financial impact on condo owners, particularly in older buildings where special assessments have threatened displacement.</p>

Supporters claim it empowers parents, while opponents argue it drains money from public schools and disproportionately benefits wealthier families.

Many of the displaced individuals moved to a different forest nearby, facing a lack of resources and uncertainty about their future. The sweep, described as the largest eviction of a homeless camp in recent history, has raised concerns about the widening gap between rich and poor in Bend, Oregon, where housing costs have become unaffordable for many.

          <p>The Trump administration has filed a lawsuit against Colorado and Denver, challenging state and city laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The lawsuit targets policies that prohibit officers from holding individuals solely based on civil immigration detainers and restrict information sharing with federal authorities. The White House argues that these policies create safe havens for criminals and endanger residents. Colorado officials maintain that the state is not a sanctuary and cooperates regularly with law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Several federal prosecutors in Los Angeles have resigned following a plea deal offered to a sheriff’s deputy who was convicted of using excessive force. The U.S. attorney offered a misdemeanor plea to Trevor Kirk, who had been found guilty of a felony for assaulting and pepper-spraying a woman. The move was considered unorthodox, as the plea deal would reduce Kirk's potential prison sentence and allow him to retain his right to own a firearm. The resignations come amid other controversies in the federal prosecutor’s office.</p>
