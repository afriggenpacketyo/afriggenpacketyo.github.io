          <p>Japan's health ministry plans to eliminate out-of-pocket payments for childbirth, potentially starting in April 2026, to combat the country's declining birthrate. The proposed policy would fully cover normal delivery expenses under the public medical insurance system, which currently excludes childbirth as it is not considered a medical condition. Medical institutions currently set their own prices for deliveries, leading to significant cost variations across prefectures. Obstetricians have raised concerns about potential financial strain on medical institutions due to reduced revenue under the unified pricing system.</p>

Recent changes have made 529 plans more worthwhile, including the ability to roll over unused funds to a Roth IRA and use funds for continuing education or student loans. For those needing to withdraw for tuition, using income or savings outside the 529 and reimbursing later could allow the market time to recover (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>An investigation reveals that Kroger stores in multiple states are overcharging customers by displaying expired sale prices on shelves. Customers report that advertised discounts vanish at checkout, leading to higher costs. Union officials attribute the problem to chronic understaffing, preventing employees from updating price tags. Kroger denies widespread concerns, but shoppers and union members express frustration over the inaccurate pricing. Some customers are filing complaints with state attorneys general, alleging they are being duped (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Social Security recipients in default on student loans can have up to 15% of their monthly benefits reduced, though they must be left with at least $750. Borrowers are receiving less notice of these offsets, potentially limiting their ability to challenge the collection. Borrowers should receive at least a 30-day warning, which includes information on how to contest the offset. Preventing the offset may be possible by proving financial hardship or having a pending student loan discharge.</p>

While the practice originated in Italy in the 1980s, it has recently gained popularity in Korea and the United States.

However, some dermatologists remain unconvinced, citing a lack of scientific evidence and potential risks for individuals with rosacea.
