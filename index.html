The investment includes a $2.5 billion expansion with glass manufacturer Corning in Kentucky and aims to create an "end-to-end" American supply chain for key components like chips. This move builds on previous multi-billion dollar commitments Apple has made to bolster its U.S. manufacturing presence under political pressure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced his intention to impose a 100% tariff on all imported semiconductors and computer chips. However, the president specified that this steep tariff would not apply to companies that are actively "building in the United States." This policy is designed to incentivize domestic manufacturing and strengthen the U.S. technology supply chain by penalizing reliance on foreign-made chips. The announcement aligns with the administration's broader strategy of using tariffs to encourage the reshoring of critical industries and manufacturing jobs back to American soil.

          <p>A new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. suggests the true death toll from the January Eaton and Palisades fires in Los Angeles County could be significantly higher than official figures. Researchers estimate there were 440 more deaths than expected during the period, compared to the 31 officially attributed to the fires. These "excess deaths" are likely linked to indirect consequences such as poor air quality and disruptions to healthcare services. The findings highlight the hidden, long-term public health impacts of climate-driven disasters beyond immediate destruction.</p>

Recreation officials noted that she was fortunate to have been discovered by park visitors who heard her cries for help, as the park was close to emptying for the night.</p>

          <p>On the 80th anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, historical photos are contrasted with images of the rebuilt, modern cities. The article recounts the devastation in August 1945, which led to an estimated 210,000 deaths by the end of that year and Japan's subsequent surrender in World War II. Today, both cities are thriving metropolises, with landmarks like the Hiroshima Peace Memorial serving as a reminder of the past. The anniversary comes amid renewed global fears of nuclear conflict, with Hiroshima's mayor urging world leaders to learn from the tragedy.</p>

          <p>In the current economic climate, savers are weighing the benefits of different financial products for a $10,000 deposit. This article compares a 6-month Certificate of Deposit (CD) with a money market account, noting that while starting interest rates are similar, the CD offers a fixed, guaranteed return. Given the potential for future interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, a CD could ultimately yield a higher, more predictable earning. The analysis suggests that for those prioritizing maximum guaranteed interest over immediate liquidity, a CD is the preferable option. (not investment advice)</p>

Tactics such as ordering supporters to stop discussing the topic, creating distractions, and selectively releasing information have often generated more questions and scrutiny. For instance, the release of spliced jail footage and a controversial interview with Ghislaine Maxwell have fueled further speculation. The author argues that these strategies, intended to quash the story, have instead intensified media interest and public suspicion about what the president might be hiding.</p>

          <p>The family of Fiongal Greenlaw-Meek, who died in the Air India crash in June, has spoken out about the additional trauma of receiving the wrong body from Indian authorities. His sister, Arwen Greenlaw, stated that DNA testing in London confirmed the remains were not her brother's, and the family is now seeking accountability and closure. The incident has raised questions about the forensic and identification protocols used at the crash site. The UK Foreign Office has acknowledged the distressing situation and stated it is liaising with Indian authorities on behalf of the coroner.</p>

          <p>A filmed performance of the hit Broadway musical "Hamilton" is set for a theatrical release on September 5th. Creator Lin-Manuel Miranda announced that the movie, which was shot with the original cast in 2016, will be available in theaters nationwide. The film was originally intended for theaters but was released on the Disney+ streaming service in 2020 due to the pandemic. The release is part of a broader celebration of the show's nearly 10-year anniversary, which also includes special performances and the unveiling of a wax figure of Miranda as Alexander Hamilton.</p>

          <p>The runway at Birmingham Airport was shut down for over six hours after a light aircraft experienced landing gear problems and made an emergency landing, causing its undercarriage to collapse. The two crew members and one passenger on board were not seriously injured. The closure resulted in significant disruptions, with at least 10 departing flights canceled and over 20 inbound flights diverted to other airports. The runway has since reopened, but thousands of passengers faced long delays and frustration, with some holiday plans being canceled entirely by airlines.</p>

          <p>Rapper Soulja Boy, whose real name is DeAndre Cortez Way, has been released from custody after the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office dropped a felony weapons charge against him due to insufficient evidence.

Kennedy framed the move as a step away from mRNA technology, which he claimed poses "more risk than benefits for these respiratory viruses." The decision to defund research into vaccines for COVID-19, bird flu, and other viruses has drawn sharp criticism from leading infectious disease experts, who argue it is unscientific and will leave the country vulnerable to future pandemics by abandoning a proven, life-saving platform.

          <p>Tennis legend Venus Williams, now 45, is competing in the Cincinnati Open, continuing her comeback after a 16-month absence. Williams attributes her longevity to her deep love for the sport and a desire to compete in good health after a long struggle with fibroids. She recently revealed she underwent major surgery a year ago after being misdiagnosed for years, and is using her return to raise awareness for women's health issues. Despite her age, the seven-time Grand Slam champion says she is living life on her own terms and that she should never be ruled out.</p>

While the zoo excludes dogs and cats, the practice has been common in Denmark for years but drew both outrage and support online.
