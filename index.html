          <p>Payments from Facebook's $725 million privacy settlement are being distributed to eligible users who filed a claim. The settlement resolves lawsuits alleging the company improperly shared user data with third parties, a controversy highlighted by the Cambridge Analytica scandal. While parent company Meta denies wrongdoing, approved claimants will receive an email notification and can expect an average payment of around $29, with amounts varying based on the duration of their Facebook usage between 2007 and 2022. The distribution process is expected to continue over several weeks.</p>

          <p>With the Social Security trust fund projected for depletion around 2033, discussions on reform are intensifying to avoid a major benefits cut. A common proposal involves raising the retirement age, but analysis shows this disproportionately affects lower-income individuals who have shorter life expectancies. A more progressive approach suggests raising the retirement age only for the top 40 percent of earners, which would help address the solvency issue without being regressive. Such a bipartisan solution would likely require concessions from both political parties. (not investment advice)</p>

The FBI is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to an arrest, and investigators have released images of a "person of interest" described as a college-aged male. A high-powered rifle believed to be the weapon used was recovered in a wooded area near the campus. Officials believe it was a targeted attack, as only a single shot was fired, striking Kirk.</p>

He has secured a multi-billion dollar deal for UFC streaming rights, acquired the rights for a "Call of Duty" film, and signed the creators of "Stranger Things" to an exclusive deal. These moves align with his strategy to invest heavily in high-quality content and franchises to revitalize the media giant.

          <p>The popularity of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is soaring due to their low-cost and tax-efficient nature, but financial experts warn that investors are making several key mistakes. Many fail to research the underlying assets of an ETF, mistakenly assuming all funds offer broad diversification when some are narrow and high-risk. Another common pitfall is "chasing performance" by investing in trendy, buzzworthy ETFs based on past returns, which can lead to significant losses. Experts also caution against frequent trading, which can erode the long-term benefits of these investment vehicles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A problematic cycle exists in higher education where student teacher evaluations are contributing to grade inflation and declining academic rigor. Because these evaluations can significantly impact professors' careers, including hiring and tenure decisions, faculty are incentivized to lighten workloads and award higher grades to receive better scores. Research indicates that these evaluations are poor measures of teaching effectiveness and are susceptible to biases, often rewarding instructors who challenge students the least. This dynamic creates a "doom loop" where both grades and evaluation scores inflate while the quality of instruction may suffer.</p>

          <p>Tech giants Nvidia and OpenAI are reportedly in discussions to support a multi-billion dollar investment aimed at boosting the United Kingdom's artificial intelligence infrastructure. The deal would focus on data center development and is expected to be unveiled during U.S. President Donald Trump's upcoming state visit. This move reflects a global trend of nations seeking to develop "sovereign AI" capabilities to reduce dependency on foreign technology. Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, has previously praised the UK as an excellent place for investment, signaling the company's interest in expanding its presence there.</p>

          <p>A growing backlash is targeting social media influencers who post videos of themselves tormenting and provoking wildlife in Australia for online engagement. Recent videos show individuals wrestling with crocodiles and mishandling a baby wombat, sparking outrage from animal rights groups like PETA and government officials. Critics argue that this behavior is not only cruel and illegal but also sets a dangerous example, potentially encouraging "copycat tourism" where wild animals are treated as props. Authorities are investigating the incidents, and there are calls for social media platforms to better regulate content that exploits animals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The intense online criticism directed at public figures like Princess Kate, German politician Annalena Baerbock, and singer Nelly Furtado highlights a persistent trend of sexist trolling. Media experts note that women in the public eye are disproportionately judged on their appearance, with comments often centering on their bodies, hair, or clothing rather than their accomplishments. This phenomenon is rooted in historical power structures and amplified by media algorithms that prioritize certain body images. While some public figures are pushing back against the shaming, the constant scrutiny contributes to a culture of self-optimization and unrealistic beauty standards.</p>

The proposal demands that Hamas release all hostages, relinquish its weapons to the Palestinian Authority, and end its rule in Gaza. This move, which has been endorsed by the Arab League, is part of a broader diplomatic effort to end the war and establish a sovereign Palestinian state.

          <p>In this opinion piece, author Naomi Klein reflects on the corporate-financed backlash that has stalled progress on climate action. She argues that despite earlier momentum for initiatives like the Green New Deal, a surge in climate misinformation, amplified by right-wing politicians and fossil fuel interests, threatens to turn the crisis into a catastrophe. Klein praises independent, reader-funded journalism for its crucial role in exposing these powerful forces and holding them accountable. She asserts that in the face of this emergency, facts are the most important tool for defense, followed by the hope that journalism can inspire action.</p>

          <p>An investigation into the Alexandria Staging Facility, an ICE deportation hub in rural Louisiana run by the private company Geo Group, has uncovered a pattern of alleged abuses. Former detainees describe the center as a "black hole" with deplorable living conditions, minimal legal access, and routine due process violations. Despite being designated as a short-term, 72-hour facility, records show that many individuals are held for much longer periods without the services required for long-term detention. The report raises serious questions about the lack of oversight and the inhumane conditions within the administration's accelerated deportation system.</p>

          <p>This article expresses concern that the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, while morally repugnant, is being leveraged by some on the right to call for a broad government crackdown. Prominent conservative figures and former President Trump have quickly blamed "the left" without evidence and suggested a campaign to infiltrate, disrupt, and incarcerate opposing groups. The author argues that this rhetoric sets the stage for a dangerous expansion of federal repression against anyone who voices opposition to the right-wing agenda. Such a move would threaten free speech and democratic principles in the name of avenging the killing.</p>

According to the survey, 25% of family offices have already invested in sports teams or related assets, with another quarter expressing interest. While major men's leagues attract the most interest, high-profile investments are also being made in women's leagues like the WNBA. These long-term investors are often motivated by a combination of passion for the sport and the potential for significant long-term value creation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recent deployment of U.S. Navy ships to the Venezuelan coastline for an anti-drug mission is being viewed in the context of the Venezuelan opposition's strategy. Opposition leader María Corina Machado had previously suggested that the U.S. should treat Nicolás Maduro's regime as a law enforcement issue, specifically proposing a major anti-narcotics operation. While the Trump administration frames the mission as a fight against a "narco-terror cartel," some analysts question the scale of Venezuela's role in drug trafficking. This approach risks being interpreted as an invitation for U.S. military intervention, a gamble that could further destabilize the region.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can temporarily block Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood while legal battles over the policy continue. A provision in a recent tax bill aims to end Medicaid payments for one year to abortion providers, which Planned Parenthood argues illegally restricts access to its non-abortion healthcare services for low-income patients. While federal funds cannot be used for most abortions, nearly half of the organization's patients rely on Medicaid for services like contraception and STD testing. The ruling puts over a million patients at risk of losing access to care at its clinics.</p>
