        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new survey indicates a significant drop in Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te's approval rating, with over 60% of voters disapproving of his handling of cross-strait relations. This decline, a 20-point increase in dissatisfaction from last year, reflects mounting public unease and a desire for dialogue with Beijing rather than confrontation, despite intensifying military pressure. Lai's positive ratings have plummeted to 26%, marking a dramatic shift in public opinion just over 16 months into his term. The article highlights how voters are increasingly doubtful about his ability to manage the island's most sensitive relationship.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump attends the UN General Assembly where the future of a Palestinian state and the Gaza war are expected to be central issues. Several key allies, including the UK, France, Canada, and Australia, formally recognized Palestinian statehood, a move Israel and the U.S. oppose, calling it counterproductive. Trump, who has cut U.S. foreign aid, is expected to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and Syrian President al-Sharaa.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest that adequate protein intake is crucial for maintaining healthy hair, as strands are primarily composed of keratin, a protein. Dr. Ross Kopelman, a hair transplant surgeon, notes that protein deficiency can lead to diffuse shedding and brittle hair, as the body prioritizes essential organs. The article explains that correcting protein intake can improve hair density within months, with amino acids like lysine and cysteine being particularly important for keratin production. While supplements can help, a balanced diet rich in protein sources like eggs, fish, and legumes is recommended for overall hair health.</p>

          <p>This article presents a photographic series documenting the final inhabitants of coastal villages in Indonesia's Central Java Province. These communities are facing forced abandonment due to the combined effects of rising sea levels, land subsidence, and severe erosion. The images capture the poignant reality of a way of life disappearing as homes and farms are progressively submerged underwater. The article highlights the devastating impact of environmental changes on these vulnerable populations, emphasizing the urgency of global climate action.</p>

          <h2>Self-Help Culture May Exacerbate Feelings of Isolation, Author Suggests</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 08:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Author Jessica Lamb-Shapiro argues that the pervasive self-help industry, despite its appeal, might contribute to isolation rather than genuine improvement. Her book, 'Promise Land: My Journey Through America’s Self-Help Culture,' explores how the focus on individual optimization can detract from community and interpersonal relationships. The article discusses the industry's historical roots and its current multi-billion-dollar valuation, noting that while some self-help can be beneficial, an overemphasis on self-reliance can lead to a loss of community support. Lamb-Shapiro suggests that seeking help from others strengthens relationships more effectively than solitary self-improvement efforts.</p>

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is set to consider a proposal from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) to globally raise the limit, a move supported by several countries.

          <p>Reform UK has announced plans to abolish Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) for migrants, a policy it would implement if it wins the next election. Under these proposals, migrants would no longer automatically qualify for permanent settlement after five years, instead needing to reapply for new visas with stricter criteria like higher salary thresholds and English language proficiency. The party claims these changes, which would also bar non-British citizens from accessing welfare, could save £234 billion over several decades.

The article highlights stark disparities in school suspensions, college enrollment, and employment outcomes.

          <p>This article outlines the crucial distinctions between Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and mutual funds, both popular investment vehicles for diversification. A primary difference lies in trading: ETFs trade like stocks throughout the day, while mutual fund transactions are priced at day's end. More significantly for long-term investors, ETFs offer greater tax efficiency due to their 'in-kind' transaction mechanism, which typically avoids capital gains distributions common in mutual funds. Additionally, ETFs generally have lower expense ratios, making them a cheaper option, though mutual funds still offer a broader universe of funds and are more commonly found in 401(k) plans.

          <p>Despite acknowledging that their leftward shift on cultural issues may have cost them the 2024 election, many Democrats are reluctant to adopt more moderate positions. This article highlights a 'strange dynamic' where pundits and some officials stress the need to broaden appeal, yet few are willing to take controversial stances that might alienate their base. Representative Seth Moulton's experience, facing backlash after moderate comments on trans athletes, illustrates the disincentive for public shifts. The piece suggests that while rhetorical adjustments are common, substantive policy changes are rare, potentially hindering the party's ability to win back working-class voters and control the Senate.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump could gain extraordinary power if the Supreme Court allows his effort to remove a Federal Reserve governor, paving the way for him to appoint loyalists. This article warns that beyond setting interest rates, the Fed's unchecked authority to lend unlimited funds to 'any individual, partnership, or corporation' during 'unusual or exigent circumstances' could be weaponized. Experts suggest Trump could use this as a 'bottomless slush fund' to reward allies or 'debank' perceived enemies by cutting off their access to the financial system. Such control would bypass Congress's spending authority, posing an unprecedented threat to democratic checks and balances.</p>

          <p>UCLA football is facing a significant perception problem as it seeks a new head coach, following the dismissal of DeShaun Foster after a 5-10 record. Critics, including former players and national pundits, lament the athletic department's massive deficit, meager NIL resources, and leadership issues under Athletic Director Martin Jarmond. The article highlights concerns about the university's financial commitment to football and the sustainability of recent investments. Despite a chancellor's vote of confidence for Jarmond, the program's ability to attract a top-tier coach is questioned, with some suggesting a lower-level coach who can bring their roster might be a more viable option.</p>

Countries like the UK, Europe, and Dubai are now actively seeking to attract highly skilled workers considering leaving the U.S. Some U.S. firms, however, view the fee as a 'rounding error' compared to the value top talent creates.</p>
