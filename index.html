          <p>Hefin David, a prominent Welsh Labour politician and Member of the Senedd for Caerphilly since 2016, has died suddenly at the age of 47. Gwent Police confirmed his death is not being treated as suspicious after he was found unresponsive at a property in Nelson. First Minister Eluned Morgan paid tribute, calling him an "outstanding politician" known for his passion and willingness to challenge the party line. He was a much-loved member of the Labour family and will be greatly missed by his colleagues and constituents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average rate for a two-year fixed mortgage in the UK has dropped to 4.99%, marking the first time it has fallen below 5% since the market turmoil caused by the Truss government's mini-budget in September 2022. Financial data firm Moneyfacts described this as a "symbolic turning point" for homebuyers, indicating increased competition among lenders. Despite this positive development, rates are not expected to fall substantially, and with 1.6 million fixed-rate deals expiring this year, many homeowners still face higher refinancing costs compared to their previous terms.

In the sixth inning, Angels shortstop Zach Neto caught a line drive from Shohei Ohtani, stepped on second base for the second out, and threw to first to complete the play. This was only the eighth triple play in the Angels' franchise history and the first since August 2023. Despite Ohtani later hitting a go-ahead home run, the Angels rallied to win the game 7-6 in the 10th inning.</p>

The article notes a significant rise in the cost of living and a sharp decline in fundraising from IPOs, contributing to high business uncertainty. However, it also highlights potential for recovery through recent interest rate cuts, new trade deals, and policy reforms aimed at boosting investment and growth in key sectors like technology and financial services.

Zelenskyy has emphasized that "talks about us, without us, will not work," while Trump has described his meeting with Putin as a "feel-out" session to assess the Russian leader's intentions.</p>

          <p>The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) has issued interim guidance encouraging police forces in England to consider disclosing the ethnicity and nationality of suspects in high-profile cases. This policy change aims to combat misinformation and reduce public safety risks fueled by social media speculation, following recent controversies. While the Home Secretary welcomed the move for "greater transparency," some, including a former Met Police Chief Superintendent, warn of unintended consequences, such as creating an expectation for disclosure in every case, which could potentially provoke further trouble.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office is rolling out ten new vans equipped with live facial recognition (LFR) technology to seven police forces across England, significantly expanding its use to locate suspects in serious crimes. The government cites the technology's success in London, where it led to 580 arrests in a year, but the move has drawn alarm from privacy advocates. Campaign group Big Brother Watch described it as a "significant expansion of the surveillance state," raising concerns about privacy and the potential for false matches, while a government consultation on a new legal framework is underway.</p>

          <p>Following a powerful magnitude 7.7 earthquake that struck central Myanmar in March, causing thousands of deaths, scientists are analyzing the data to better forecast future seismic events. The quake, the strongest in the region since 1912, ruptured along the Sagaing Fault with extreme speed and force. A new study models the fault's "memory effect," suggesting that while precise predictions remain impossible, analyzing past events helps refine probabilistic forecasts for the timing and magnitude of future ruptures.

          <p>This article explores a perceived decline in the creativity and distinctiveness of modern soccer design, contrasting contemporary logos with iconic works like Lance Wyman's designs for the 1968 Mexico Olympics. It suggests that many new crests, such as those for NWSL's Denver Summit FC, feel generic and corporate, driven by marketing committees rather than individual artistic vision. While designers like Matthew Wolff have created acclaimed crests for clubs like LAFC and NYCFC, the broader trend appears to favor a safe, ubiquitous aesthetic that lacks the character and cultural depth of past designs.</p>

          <p>This essay reflects on the virtue of integrity, contrasting the historical respect for character in leaders like George Washington with the current political climate where corruption is often openly displayed and celebrated. The author argues that this erosion of integrity at the highest levels ramifies through society, normalizing cruelty and rule-breaking. To counteract this, the piece calls for a cultural return to admiring moral excellence, suggesting that we can find inspiration not only in real-life examples but also in fictional characters, like the honorable detective from the series "Foyle's War," who embody quiet, uncompromised decency.</p>

          <p>Actress Rashida Jones reflects on her Emmy nomination for the "Black Mirror" episode "Common People," where she plays a woman saved from a coma by a predatory brain subscription service. She discusses how the episode serves as a bleak parable for the intractable nature of capitalism and the American healthcare system. Jones also shares her own complex relationship with technology, admitting her fallibility with apps like TikTok, and emphasizes the importance of disconnecting and "touching grass" to escape the slow erosion of privacy and agency in our increasingly tech-dominated world.</p>

          <p>This column reflects on the 90th anniversary of Social Security, arguing that the greatest threat to its existence is not fiscal insolvency but a long-term political project by conservatives to dismantle it. The author critiques recent actions as "sabotage" designed to weaken public trust and pave the way for privatization, citing comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent as evidence of this strategy. The piece concludes that securing the program's future is economically feasible by lifting the payroll tax cap, and that its survival depends on public vigilance against political attacks on the popular program.

          <p>For the first time, researchers have mapped the approximately 8,700 cattle feeding operations in the U.S., revealing that California has more feedlots and acreage dedicated to them than any other state. The study, which also mapped hog farms, provides a crucial public database where none previously existed, linking these facilities to environmental and health concerns. The data indicates that areas with a higher concentration of these operations are associated with degraded air quality and lower socioeconomic well-being for nearby residents, a finding disputed by a major dairy trade group.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that President Trump's demand for a $1 billion payment from UCLA is fundamentally different from his actions against private universities like Columbia, as it targets a public institution funded by California taxpayers. The author, a UC professor, asserts that such a payment would severely harm the state's economy and the university's mission, which generates significant economic activity and educational opportunities. The piece frames the demand not as a genuine concern for student rights, but as a political move to punish opponents and an attempted seizure of state resources that Californians should resist.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent deployment of the National Guard to Washington D.C. has put California officials on alert, sparking worries about similar federal interventions in cities like Los Angeles and Oakland, particularly for the 2028 Olympics. While the White House cites crime, legal experts and local leaders call the move an unusual and "performative" use of military forces for domestic endeavors. The action raises questions about the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits military involvement in civilian law enforcement, and sets up potential legal clashes if the administration attempts to deploy troops without a governor's support.</p>

Experts point out flaws in the analysis, such as focusing on the visibility of asteroids, which require a telescope. However, they do concur that California's numerous Dark Sky Places, like Joshua Tree and Death Valley National Parks, offer exceptional opportunities for viewing celestial events. For the best experience, astronomers recommend getting away from city lights and joining local astronomical societies for public events.</p>
