          <p>Robert Morris, founding pastor of Gateway Church, pleaded guilty to indecent conduct with a child, stemming from allegations of sexual assault over 40 years ago in Oklahoma. He received a 10-year sentence with six months suspended, requiring sex offender registration. The victim, Cindy Clemishire, expressed hope that her case inspires other survivors, while the Oklahoma Attorney General condemned Morris's exploitation of trust. The article also notes civil lawsuits against Morris and Gateway Church, along with a dispute over his retirement package.</p>

          <p>Prince William engaged in a remarkably open interview with Eugene Levy for an Apple TV show, revealing his vision for a modernized monarchy and his personal struggles. He expressed a desire for 'change for good' and not being 'suffocated by history,' while also sharing details about his children and the strain of his wife's and father's illnesses. The conversation, held in informal settings like Windsor Castle and a pub, provided a rare glimpse into his future reign and family dynamics, including a brief mention of Prince Harry.</p>

          <p>Todd Arrington, director of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, resigned after refusing the Trump administration's request to gift an original Eisenhower sword to King Charles III. Arrington insisted on preserving the artifact, offering a replica instead, which was ultimately presented. He stated he was told to 'resign or be fired,' citing a belief that he could no longer be trusted with confidential information. This incident highlights tensions between the administration and the National Archives over historical artifacts and political influence.</p>

          <p>CBS Miami entertainment reporter Lisa Petrillo publicly revealed her 10-month battle with early-stage breast cancer during Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Her diagnosis, caught at Stage One thanks to her persistence in getting a self-discovered lump examined, led to a lumpectomy and radiation. Petrillo, who kept her diagnosis private for nine months, now hopes her story will inspire others to perform self-checks and seek early detection.

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates persistent negative sentiment regarding the U.S. economy and job market, with most Americans believing prices are still rising and good jobs are scarcer than five years ago. Over half view the job market as bad, and a majority anticipate a net-negative effect of AI on job availability in their fields over the next decade. This pessimism spans various income and education levels, though it is slightly less pronounced among younger Americans. The findings highlight ongoing public concerns about economic stability and technological disruption.</p>

          <p>President Trump's suggestion to split the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine into individual shots has revived a long-settled debate, drawing strong criticism from medical experts. Specialists warn that this move, reminiscent of a discredited 1988 study, would increase vaccine appointments, lower coverage, and heighten risks of outbreaks. They emphasize that combination vaccines are crucial for public health, and separating them would dismantle modern prevention strategies, potentially leading to a resurgence of preventable diseases.</p>

          <p>South African Olympian Caster Semenya has ended a seven-year legal battle against World Athletics' sex eligibility rules, which regulate testosterone levels in women's track and field. Semenya, born with a difference in sex development, argued the rules infringed on her rights, losing appeals at sports tribunals but gaining a favorable ruling from the European Court of Human Rights. World Athletics revised its policy in March 2023, prioritizing fairness for biological females, a stance supported by the new IOC president.</p>

The FAA and NTSB are investigating potential miscommunication. Despite the incident, airport operations were unaffected, and passengers were rebooked, with flight recorders sent for analysis.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump declared the ongoing government shutdown an 'unprecedented opportunity' to slash federal agencies and 'cut more Democratic priorities,' explicitly targeting political opponents. This statement follows his administration's freezing of $18 billion for New York City infrastructure and cancellation of $8 billion for climate projects in Democratic-leaning states. Trump plans to meet with OMB Director Russell Vought, a Project 2025 co-author, to determine temporary or permanent cuts, with the White House warning of potentially thousands of federal layoffs.</p>

          <p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested that Jeffrey Epstein may have used blackmail, possibly through incriminating videos of high-profile associates, to secure a lighter sentence in his 2008 sexual assault case. Lutnick's speculation contrasts with FBI Director Kash Patel's testimony, who stated no credible information indicated Epstein trafficked young women to others besides himself. Victims' rights lawyer Brad Edwards also noted that while Epstein associated with powerful figures, the overlap with his sexual assault was limited, and no evidence suggested Epstein routinely blackmailed these men.</p>

Tracking data places the vessel near Copenhagen during an airport shutdown and off Germany during spying incidents. The tanker, part of Russia's shadow fleet used to circumvent sanctions, was later seized by French authorities. This tactic represents a new front in Russia’s hybrid war, raising concerns about disruption, environmental risks from aging vessels, and President Putin's condemnation of the seizure as piracy.</p>

          <p>Homeowners can now secure a $90,000 home equity loan with lower monthly payments due to recent Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, making it a more attractive option than personal loans or credit cards. For example, a 10-year loan at 8.34% costs $1,108.18 monthly, a decrease from earlier in the year. The article advises careful consideration, as the home serves as collateral, and suggests comparing with home equity lines of credit (HELOCs).
