        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is engaged in last-minute negotiations with the White House to avoid a 25% tariff on car imports and potential broader tariffs.  The UK argues for an exemption due to its relatively balanced trade relationship with the US. If tariffs are imposed, the UK may retaliate with duties on sectors important to the US, but a trade war is undesirable.  The potential bias lies in the framing of the situation as a negotiation rather than a trade war, potentially downplaying the severity of the situation.</p>
