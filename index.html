          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has accused India of "arbitrage," profiting by buying discounted Russian oil and reselling refined products to sanctioned regions. Bessent condemned the practice as unacceptable, stating India has made $16 billion in excess profits. President Trump has responded by ordering a 25% tariff on Indian exports to the U.S., effective next week, aiming to pressure New Delhi to comply. This punitive measure is being implemented despite previous reports that the Biden administration had initially encouraged India to accept Russian oil to prevent a major global price spike after the Ukraine invasion.</p>

This development follows a Trump administration halt on advanced chip sales to China and a recent agreement for Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of their China sales.

          <p>A happiness expert, after 15 years of study, reveals that long-term happiness is significantly influenced by one's approach to aging and the quality of their friendships. Five "counterintuitive yet empowering" habits include embracing one's felt age, being a reliable friend, increasing social frequency, not fearing new beginnings, and creating irreplaceable traditions. These practices foster agency and well-being, moving beyond reliance on external circumstances for contentment. The study found that the happiest participants felt that way due to their own intentional actions.</p>

This initiative follows a series of White House meetings involving Trump, Zelenskyy, and European leaders, where security guarantees for Ukraine were a key discussion point. Trump expressed hope for flexibility from both sides, suggesting a trilateral meeting with him would follow if initial talks progress positively. The urgency stems from a desire to prevent further loss of life in the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Shares of Viking Therapeutics plummeted over 30% after the company released mid-stage trial data for its obesity pill, VK2735, which disappointed investors. The drug helped patients lose up to 12.2% of weight in three months, but high discontinuation rates (28% over 13 weeks) due to gastrointestinal side effects were noted. Analysts suggest the results appear inferior to competitors like Eli Lilly's oral drug, reinforcing the dominance of established players in the booming obesity and diabetes market. This outcome may diminish Viking's prospects as a major player in the oral obesity market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cholera, a potentially deadly intestinal infection, is experiencing a global resurgence, with over 65,000 cases and 1,700 deaths recorded in Sudan alone during an ongoing outbreak. The conflict in Sudan has severely disrupted access to safe water, sanitation, and healthcare, exacerbating the spread. Children are particularly vulnerable due to rapid dehydration. While a vaccine exists, global stockpiles have fallen below emergency levels, and conflict prevents access to both vaccination and effective treatment, leading to high mortality rates in severe cases.</p>

          <p>As President Trump seeks to mediate an end to the Ukraine war, questions arise regarding the fate of Ukrainian territories claimed and held by Russian forces. Approximately 20% of Ukraine's land is under Russian control or contested, including parts of the eastern Donbas region. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has constitutionally rejected ceding any territory, including Crimea, to Russia. Analysts suggest a potential ceasefire could involve freezing the front line without official land cessions, as Ukraine fears any surrender could invite future aggression.</p>

          <p>Rudi Gernreich, an Austrian-born designer, invented the thong bathing suit in 1974 as a political act of rebellion against a nudity ban in Los Angeles. Gernreich, a pioneer of body positivity and LGBTQ+ rights, sought to liberate the body and challenge societal "sexual hang-ups," not sexualize. His designs often explored unisex fashion and body movement, including the groundbreaking topless monokini in 1964. Gernreich's legacy highlights his foresight in fashion and his enduring critique of prudery and societal norms, making him a significant cultural figure.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump’s spy chief, Tulsi Gabbard, claims the UK government has withdrawn its demand for Apple to provide "backdoor" access to encrypted U.S. customer data. This follows a months-long transatlantic dispute, where the U.S. administration and civil liberties groups opposed the UK's request under the Investigatory Powers Act. The previous UK demand led Apple to restrict advanced data protection options for new British customers. While neither the Home Office nor Apple have confirmed, Gabbard states the move protects American citizens' privacy and civil liberties.</p>

          <p>Following a Washington summit, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz expressed satisfaction with discussions on Ukraine peace, though noting differences between U.S. and European approaches. While President Trump seeks a comprehensive peace agreement without a prior ceasefire, European leaders, including Merz, vehemently call for a ceasefire as a prerequisite for negotiations. Discussions also included potential security guarantees for Ukraine, possibly resembling NATO's Article 5. The question of German peacekeeping troops remains open, highlighting Germany's evolving role and responsibility in regional security. Merz views himself as aligned with European colleagues.</p>

This trend reflects a broader cultural shift towards individualized self-improvement rituals and a need for "consensus reality" in an increasingly isolated, hyper-consumerist society.
