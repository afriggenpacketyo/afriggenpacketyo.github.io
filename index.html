          <p>Reflecting on 30 years of CNBC's "Squawk Box," Jim Cramer noted a return to market optimism similar to the 1990s, with investors showing renewed excitement for individual stocks. He recalled how the show helped democratize market information before the dot-com bubble burst, which led many to favor safer index funds. Cramer suggests that today's investors are once again recognizing the potential for significant gains in single stocks, driven by lucrative themes like data centers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The FBI has confirmed that a suspect is in custody following the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. Kirk, 31, was shot in the neck while speaking at a Turning Point USA event and later died from his injuries. The incident, which Utah's governor labeled a "political assassination," prompted the university to cancel classes and secure the campus as the investigation began. The suspect was reportedly apprehended after a search.</p>

          <p>England cricket captain Harry Brook described the rain-disrupted T20 match against South Africa as a "shambles of a night." Persistent rain in Cardiff led to a heavily reduced game, with South Africa batting for 7.5 overs and England facing a revised target in just five overs, ultimately resulting in a loss for the hosts. Brook expressed frustration with the inconsistent playing conditions and stated that little could be learned from such a disjointed contest.</p>

          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has warned that the government's reforms to Lifetime ISAs (LISAs) are insufficient and too slow, urging more decisive action in the upcoming November Budget. The Treasury Committee raised concerns that the product, intended for first-home buyers or retirement savings, is often mis-sold and may not be a cost-effective use of taxpayer money. MPs highlighted that many users could have purchased a home without the LISA, questioning the program's overall impact. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An incursion of at least 19 Russian drones into Polish airspace has been labeled a major provocation, prompting a military response from NATO jets and an emergency alliance meeting under Article 4. This article argues that the incident, whether intentional or accidental, represents a reckless escalation by Russia and a direct test of NATO's resolve. The author criticizes the Trump administration for a perceived weak response, suggesting that American absence on the world stage is emboldening Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>This article provides a profile of Charlie Kirk, the 31-year-old conservative activist who was fatally shot in Utah. As the founder of Turning Point USA, Kirk became a highly influential figure by promoting conservative, Trump-aligned causes on college campuses and through his widely downloaded podcast. He built a massive social media following and was considered a key spokesman for the MAGA movement to young people, though he was also a controversial figure criticized for spreading conspiracy theories.</p>

          <p>Nearly two decades after its release, former Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour has given her review of the 2006 film "The Devil Wears Prada," which famously satirized her leadership style. Wintour called the movie a "fair shot," praising its humor, wit, and Meryl Streep's iconic performance as the demanding editor Miranda Priestly. She recalled attending the premiere wearing Prada, admitting that while the fashion industry was concerned about her portrayal, she ultimately found the film to be well-executed.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is under pressure to dismiss Lord Mandelson, the British ambassador to the U.S., following new revelations about his close friendship with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Recently released documents included a letter in which Mandelson referred to Epstein as his "best pal." Despite Mandelson expressing deep regret and claiming he was misled, opposition parties and some members of his own Labour Party argue his position has become untenable.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike targeting Hamas leaders in Doha, Qatar, has killed six people and severely jeopardized ongoing ceasefire negotiations for the war in Gaza. Qatar, a key mediator and U.S. ally, condemned the attack on its soil as an act of "state terrorism" and suggested Israel was deliberately sabotaging peace efforts. The strike, which Israel defended as necessary to eliminate terrorist leaders, stunned the Gulf nation and has made the future of hostage-release talks more uncertain than ever.</p>

The historic gains briefly propelled co-founder Larry Ellison to the position of the world's richest person, overshadowing a slight miss on quarterly revenue and earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

His petition calls for an end to dynamic pricing, a cap on ticket resale values, and an allocation of 15% of tickets for local residents.</p>
