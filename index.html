          <p>The White House has detailed a preliminary deal to prevent a U.S. ban on TikTok, placing its American operations under a new joint venture with a majority of U.S. investors and board members. Tech giant Oracle will audit and operate the app's recommendation algorithm, which will be retrained using only U.S. user data to address national security concerns. President Trump is expected to approve the framework, which extends the ban-or-sale deadline by 120 days to allow for finalization. This structure aims to secure the app's source code and data for its 170 million American users.</p>

          <p>Waze is ending support for devices running Android versions older than Android 10, meaning users with these systems will no longer receive new features, bug fixes, or navigational improvements. While the app will continue to function for now, its reliability may decrease over time as server protocols evolve. This change primarily affects users of older smartphones, tablets, and some aftermarket car infotainment units. Google Maps remains an alternative, as it continues to support older Android versions, offering a fallback for affected drivers.</p>

This collaboration underscores the deep interdependence between the two companies in driving the AI boom and signals the immense infrastructure required for future AI models.

          <p>Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has pardoned Alaa Abdel Fattah, a prominent British-Egyptian pro-democracy activist and blogger who had been imprisoned for six years. Abdel Fattah, a key figure in the 2011 uprising, was convicted of "spreading false news" in a trial widely criticized by human rights organizations. The pardon follows significant international pressure and a recent hunger strike by his mother, which drew global attention to his case. Human rights groups have expressed hope that this decision may signal a broader shift in the government's approach to political prisoners.</p>

          <p>The health and beauty chain Bodycare is set to close all its remaining 56 stores after administrators failed to secure a buyer for the business. This move will result in the loss of 444 jobs, adding to the more than 1,000 redundancies since the company collapsed earlier in the month. Administrators cited stock shortages and significant operating costs as reasons for the closures, stating the business was no longer viable. The company faced intense competition from larger retailers, supermarkets, and online sellers in a challenging market.</p>

          <p>Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, has been removed as a patron by five charities after a 2011 email surfaced in which she referred to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as her "supreme friend." The charities, including Julia's House children's hospice and the Teenage Cancer Trust, stated it was inappropriate for her to continue in the role. This email appeared to contradict her previous public statements denouncing Epstein, though a spokesperson claimed it was sent to de-escalate a legal threat from him. The incident has renewed scrutiny of the royal family's connections to Epstein.</p>

          <p>Moldova is heading into a crucial general election that presents a stark choice between the pro-European ruling party and several pro-Russian opposition parties. The campaign is dominated by the question of whether the nation should pursue European Union integration or maintain closer ties with Russia. This decision is set against the backdrop of the war in neighboring Ukraine, which has heightened security concerns and economic pressures, including high inflation. President Maia Sandu has called it the "most important election in the history of the country," as the outcome will determine Moldova's geopolitical direction.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran is advocating for substantial cuts to the central bank's benchmark interest rate, arguing that current monetary policy is overly restrictive. In a speech, Miran contended that policy changes under the Trump administration related to immigration, taxes, and deregulation are pushing down the "neutral" rate of interest. He believes this justifies lowering the federal funds rate by nearly two percentage points from its current level to avoid unnecessary layoffs. This stance places him at odds with the consensus on the Federal Open Market Committee, where he recently dissented by voting for a larger rate cut.</p>

          <p>Violent clashes between rival gangs at a prison in Machala, Ecuador, have resulted in the deaths of 13 inmates and one prison guard. The incident also led to the injury of 14 other individuals and allowed some inmates to escape, though police have since recaptured thirteen of them. Ecuador's prison system has been plagued by extreme violence as drug gangs vie for control, prompting the government to place penitentiaries under military control earlier this year. The violence is part of a broader crime wave that has made Ecuador one of the most dangerous nations in the region.</p>

          <p>Germany's state-owned railway, Deutsche Bahn, has appointed Evelyn Palla as its new CEO to address a long-standing crisis of delays, cancellations, and deteriorating infrastructure. Transport Minister Patrick Schnieder acknowledged that previous punctuality targets were unachievable and set a new, more realistic goal of 70% on-time performance for long-distance trains by 2029. In July, over 40% of these trains were delayed. The government plans to invest billions from a special infrastructure fund to renovate dilapidated tracks and signal boxes, some of which date back to the 19th century.</p>

          <p>Organizers of the World Conker Championships in Northamptonshire faced a potential cancellation due to a shortage of usable conkers caused by the UK's hottest summer on record. The hot, dry weather caused horse chestnuts to fall from trees prematurely and undersized. However, a nationwide appeal for help has been successful, with people from across the country offering to supply suitable nuts for the competition. Organizers are now confident the event will proceed, though they noted the conkers used this year will likely be smaller than average.</p>

          <p>Following reports that the Trump administration may announce a link between Tylenol (acetaminophen) use during pregnancy and autism, numerous medical experts and organizations are refuting the claim. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists stated there is no clear evidence of a direct relationship, emphasizing that untreated high fevers can pose risks to fetal development. Researchers point to large-scale studies, including one involving 2.5 million children, that found no association. Tylenol's manufacturer, Kenvue, also asserts that rigorous scientific research does not support a causal link between the medication and autism.</p>

          <p>According to a government-affiliated analyst, China may consider land reclamation to build an artificial island at the disputed Scarborough Shoal to strengthen its sovereignty and administrative control over the area. Wu Shicun of the National Institute for South China Sea Studies stated that such a move would be weighed against its cost and the potential for confrontation. This strategy would also serve to limit the presence of Philippine vessels in the contested waters.

          <p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has recently employed a surprisingly defensive approach, culminating in a draw against Arsenal where his team held only 34% possession—a record low for any of his sides. This tactical shift, which involves sitting deep and relying on counter-attacks, marks a radical departure from the possession-based football that has defined his career. Analysts are questioning whether this change is a response to the strength of opponents or an admission that his current squad is less suited to his traditional style. The move signals a broader trend toward caution at the highest level of European football.</p>
