          <p>The Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to proceed with the removal of Federal Trade Commission member Rebecca Slaughter, at least for the time being. This decision puts a hold on lower court rulings that had blocked her termination, which was based on the 1935 precedent known as Humphrey's Executor. The court will now hear arguments on whether to overturn this long-standing precedent, which protects members of independent agencies from being fired by the president without cause. The case raises significant questions about presidential power over federal agencies and the independence of their commissioners.</p>

          <p>NASA has officially introduced its newest class of ten astronaut candidates, a group selected from a pool of over 8,000 applicants. The class, which notably includes more women than men for the first time, features individuals from diverse professional backgrounds such as pilots, engineers, a geologist, and a former SpaceX launch director. These candidates will now undergo a rigorous two-year training program to prepare for future missions to the International Space Station, the Moon, and potentially Mars. The selection highlights NASA's ongoing commitment to expanding its human spaceflight capabilities for the next generation of exploration.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of lawmakers, including Senate Majority Whip Richard Durbin and Senator Rand Paul, has introduced the America’s CHILDREN Act. This legislation is designed to offer a pathway to citizenship for more than 250,000 young adults known as 'Documented Dreamers'. These individuals were brought to the U.S. legally as dependents of visa-holding parents but risk 'aging out' of their legal status at age 21 due to extensive backlogs in the immigration system. Proponents argue the bill addresses a critical flaw that penalizes individuals who have grown up and been educated in the United States.</p>

          <p>Lindsey Halligan, a former defense lawyer for President Trump, has been sworn in as the interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. Her appointment follows the resignation of the previous U.S. attorney, Erik Siebert, amid pressure from the White House. Halligan, who has no prior experience as a prosecutor, was part of Trump's legal team during the classified documents case and later worked in the White House. The appointment is temporary, lasting 120 days unless extended by federal judges or confirmed by the Senate, which is considered unlikely given the political context.</p>

          <p>Amazon is set to face a trial this week following a lawsuit from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which alleges the company misled customers into signing up for its Prime membership. The FTC claims that Amazon utilized manipulative user-interface designs, often referred to as 'dark patterns,' to trick consumers into enrolling and made the cancellation process overly complicated. The lawsuit, originally filed in 2023, asserts these practices were part of a long-term effort to boost subscription numbers without clear consent. Amazon has denied the allegations, stating its practices have always prioritized customer needs.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, homeowners considering borrowing $50,000 have two primary options: a home equity loan or a home equity line of credit (HELOC). Currently, a HELOC is slightly cheaper on a monthly basis due to its variable interest rate, which has adjusted downward. However, a home equity loan offers the stability of a fixed interest rate, protecting borrowers from future rate hikes. The article advises homeowners to carefully weigh the immediate savings of a HELOC against the long-term predictability of a home equity loan before making a decision. (not investment advice)</p>

The complaint alleges that 42West poached key employees, who then took major clients and confidential trade secrets with them in an effort to dismantle MPRM. This alleged hostile takeover has reportedly caused MPRM to lose six major clients and has derailed potential sales talks for the company. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for claims including breach of fiduciary duty and misappropriation of trade secrets.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic front-runner for New York City mayor, has canceled his appearance at a scheduled town hall with WABC-TV. He cited his withdrawal as a protest against the network's parent company, ABC, for its decision to suspend 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!'. Mamdani stated that corporate leaders had put their financial interests ahead of their duty to uphold freedom of the press in the face of pressure from the Trump administration. The move injects the national debate over free speech and media censorship directly into the city's mayoral race.</p>

Finally, buyers should begin comparing rates and terms from various lenders now to be well-prepared to act quickly when favorable conditions arise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly preparing to announce a link between the use of acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, during pregnancy and an increased risk of autism. This expected announcement is already facing significant pushback from medical experts and the drug's manufacturer, Kenvue. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and other scientific bodies maintain there is no clear evidence of a direct link, citing large-scale studies that found no increased risk. They also warn that discouraging the use of acetaminophen could lead pregnant women to use riskier alternatives for treating conditions like high fever.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive analysis of 25 different studies has found that efforts to reduce partisan hostility have only a small and temporary impact. Researchers discovered that while various interventions—such as correcting misperceptions about political opponents—can slightly increase warmth towards the other side, these effects typically fade within two weeks. The study also found that combining multiple interventions or repeating them over time did not produce a more significant or lasting reduction in animosity. The findings suggest that addressing deep-seated political polarization may require systemic changes rather than individual-level approaches.</p>

The email appeared to contradict her previous public statements distancing herself from Epstein after his initial conviction. A spokesperson for the duchess claimed the email was sent under duress to fend off legal threats from Epstein, but the charities deemed her continued association inappropriate.</p>

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's presence at the United Nations General Assembly suggests a significant shift in how world leaders interact with him during his second term. While his first-term speeches were met with some derision, many leaders now appear more deferential, with some even nominating him for the Nobel Peace Prize. This outward appeasement reportedly masks deep concerns about his unpredictable foreign policy and use of economic leverage like tariffs. The article suggests that despite Trump's isolationist rhetoric, traditional U.S. allies feel more dependent on American leadership, leading to a cautious and often flattering diplomatic approach.</p>

He argued that rates should be below 3% by the end of the year and dismissed concerns that the administration's tariffs are significantly fueling inflation. His stance positions him as a key economic advocate for the White House within the Fed, challenging the more cautious approach favored by Chairman Jerome Powell. (not investment advice)</p>
