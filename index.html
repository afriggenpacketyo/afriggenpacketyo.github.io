          <p>The United Kingdom is enduring its third heatwave of 2025, with Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland recording their warmest days of the year. Temperatures are expected to cool on Monday, bringing rain, but amber heat health alerts remain active for several regions in England, warning of risks to the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions. The extreme weather has led to hosepipe bans for millions and an "extreme" wildfire warning in Scotland, highlighting the ongoing impacts of climate change on weather patterns. The heatwave is expected to break for most of the country by Monday, bringing needed rainfall.</p>

          <p>The largest piece of Mars ever discovered on Earth, a 54-pound meteorite, is set for auction at Sotheby's in New York with an estimated value of $2 million to $4 million. Found in Niger in November 2023, the rock represents nearly 7% of all known Martian material on our planet. Scientific analysis confirmed its origin by comparing its chemical composition to data from the Viking space probe. The auction also features a juvenile Ceratosaurus dinosaur skeleton, highlighting a growing market for significant natural history artifacts.</p>

          <p>Following her acquittal in the death of John O'Keefe, Karen Read has secured a book deal, while witnesses in the case report ongoing harassment from her supporters. O'Keefe's family is now dealing with a second loss, and key witnesses like Jennifer McCabe and Kerry Roberts face public vilification and threats. Despite an FBI investigation finding no alternate suspects or police corruption, the case's prosecutors and investigators are facing professional consequences. The situation highlights the severe personal and professional fallout for those involved in high-profile, contentious legal battles.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that China's mega-dam project in Tibet might not cause the water crisis in India that many feared. By analyzing data from two existing large dams, Zangmu and Jiacha, researchers found that water flows downstream during the dry season have actually increased. Specifically, low flows in February were up by over 50 percent, suggesting the dams help regulate water levels. This evidence counters concerns about potential droughts and indicates a more complex environmental impact from the massive infrastructure projects.</p>

Democratic representatives, who had sued for entry, described the conditions as "appalling," citing extreme heat in the medical area and claims that detainees' drinking water comes from toilets. In contrast, Republican lawmakers stated they were satisfied, with one senator calling the beds comfortable.

          <p>The Trump administration has threatened to impose 30% tariffs on imports from the European Union and Mexico starting August 1, escalating trade tensions. In letters to both trading partners, President Trump cited persistent trade deficits and, in Mexico's case, insufficient efforts to curb drug trafficking. The EU has vowed to take "proportionate countermeasures" if necessary, while Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum emphasized that her country's sovereignty is non-negotiable. This move is part of a broader strategy that has seen the US propose new tariff conditions on numerous countries, creating global economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After learning of a brother given up for adoption decades ago, a 53-year-old nurse from Norfolk, England, successfully tracked him down in Australia. The siblings connected in 2021 and discovered remarkable parallels in their lives, including their adoptive parents sharing the same professions as their biological ones. A month after their first conversation, her brother, Alistair, was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer. This prompted an immediate visit, allowing them to forge a relationship and make memories while he undergoes chemotherapy, turning a lifelong mystery into a poignant family reunion.</p>

          <p>A former lumberjack and a teenager who were initially arrested for the felling of the famous Sycamore Gap tree have described the intense public scrutiny and online abuse they faced. Within hours of the incident, amateur online sleuths incorrectly identified the two as the culprits, leading to police searches, media attention, and personal harassment. Both were later cleared of any involvement, and two other men were subsequently convicted of the crime. The experience highlights the damaging impact of trial by social media and the personal toll of being wrongly accused in a high-profile case.</p>

          <p>Russian conductor Valery Gergiev, a known ally of Vladimir Putin, is set to perform in southern Italy, marking a significant break from the unofficial ban he has faced across Europe since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The invitation from the Un'Estate da RE festival has sparked outrage from a European Parliament vice-president and Ukrainian activists, who label Gergiev a "cultural mouthpiece for Putin." The regional leader defended the decision, insisting culture must not be influenced by politics. This controversial return highlights deep divisions in Europe over how to treat artists who have not condemned the war.</p>

          <p>Britain's struggling steel towns, such as Port Talbot and Scunthorpe, are facing increased anxiety due to the ongoing threat of U.S. tariffs and the long-term decline of the industry. The closure of blast furnaces at the Port Talbot steelworks has already cost thousands of jobs, and a 25% U.S. tariff on UK steel remains a point of contention. While some former steelworkers have found new careers, many worry about the economic future of their communities, whose identities are deeply tied to steel production. This article raises profound questions about whether these towns can revive their industrial past or must pivot to new industries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel has publicly denied rumors that he is considering resigning from his position. Speculation arose following reports of a rift between the FBI and the Department of Justice over the decision not to release further files related to Jeffrey Epstein. In a social media post, Patel stated that the "conspiracy theories just aren’t true" and affirmed his commitment to serving the President. The controversy stems from a joint memo which concluded no "client list" existed and confirmed Epstein's death as a suicide, a finding that has been rejected by some of the administration's supporters.</p>

          <p>The BBC was granted rare access to the massive Rubaya mining site in eastern DR Congo, which is a vital source of the world's coltan and is currently controlled by M23 rebels. Thousands of miners work daily under the supervision of the rebel group, which claims to have brought security to the area. A recent UN report detailed how the M23 profits heavily from taxing the mineral, much of which is allegedly sent to Rwanda. The visit comes after a US-brokered ceasefire deal, with speculation that American interest in DR Congo's mineral rights was a key factor in the diplomatic push.</p>

          <p>After several years of declining viewership, the UK reality show "Love Island" is experiencing a resurgence, with its growth on social media, particularly TikTok, outpacing its television audience. Analysis shows the show's official accounts have gained millions of new followers, with many viewers preferring to consume the drama through short clips, recaps, and creator commentary on the platform. While this engagement model brings in new audiences, some worry that it fundamentally changes the viewing experience. It compresses character arcs into bite-sized, potentially out-of-context clips, taking "the reality out of the reality TV."</p>

          <p>Severe flash floods along the Guadalupe River in Texas during the July Fourth weekend have resulted in at least 129 deaths, with dozens of people still unaccounted for. The deluge, described as a "100-year flood," was fueled by moisture from a tropical system, causing the river to rise 26 feet in 45 minutes. Among the victims were children and counselors from Camp Mystic, a summer camp located on the riverbank. Officials are now facing scrutiny over the timeliness of their emergency warnings and evacuation orders as a massive search and recovery effort continues.</p>

          <p>An excavation is set to begin at the former site of the St Mary's children's home in Tuam, Ireland, where the remains of hundreds of babies and toddlers are believed to be buried in an unmarked mass grave. The home, run by nuns from 1925 to 1961, housed unmarried mothers and their children. An amateur historian's research in 2014 uncovered death records for 796 children who died at the home but had no burial records, leading to the discovery of human remains in a structure believed to be a former sewage tank. The two-year excavation aims to recover and identify the remains, bringing a measure of truth to a dark chapter in Irish history.</p>

Midfielder Johanna Rytting Kaneryd expressed confidence that there is "something different" about the squad this year and that they can go all the way.
