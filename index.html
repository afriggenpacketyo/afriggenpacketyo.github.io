          <p>The Shuangjiangkou hydropower project in southwest China, set to be the worldâ€™s tallest dam at 315 meters, commenced water storage on May 1. This $4.9 billion project, under construction for nearly a decade in Sichuan province, will be used for power generation and flood control on the Dadu River. The water level reached 2,344 meters after the first phase, about 80 meters above the original river level, marking a significant step towards operation and addressing both energy needs and regional water management.</p>

          <p>The 19th Venice Architecture Biennale explores strategies for cities to adapt to rising temperatures caused by climate change. Curator Carlo Ratti emphasizes the need for architects and urban planners to rethink building practices by integrating natural and artificial intelligence. The biennale highlights the urgent need to address urban overheating and promotes solutions like green spaces and permeable surfaces to combat heat islands and improve water management. The exhibition aims to spark a global "construction revolution" to ensure cities remain habitable in the face of climate change.</p>

          <p>China's exports experienced an 8.1% surge in April, driven by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, which offset a significant drop in exports to the U.S. due to tariffs. While shipments to the U.S. fell by over 21%, exports to ASEAN countries jumped by 20.8%, with notable growth in Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand. This shift indicates China's adaptability in navigating trade tensions by diversifying its export markets and leveraging regional partnerships to sustain economic growth.</p>

          <p>Sweeping tariffs on imported aluminum imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump are failing to revive domestic aluminum production, primarily due to high electricity costs. While tariffs have reshaped global trade flows and increased costs for American consumers, rising electricity prices in the U.S. are leading to smelter closures rather than restarts. The aluminum tariffs at 25% are starkly visible in the physical aluminum market. This situation underscores the challenge of using tariffs to revitalize domestic industries without addressing underlying cost disadvantages.</p>

With the Arctic warming rapidly and Russia expanding its presence in the region, Greenland's location across key routes between Russia and the U.S. East Coast makes it strategically important. The Trump administration's focus on unilateral action, however, is causing tensions with Denmark and other NATO allies. Kent E.

          <p>The Pentagon is set to remove up to 1,000 members of the military who openly identify as transgender, following a Supreme Court decision allowing the Trump administration to enforce a ban. Those who have yet to openly identify as transgender have 30 days to remove themselves. The move comes as the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has been cracking down on healthcare for LGBTQ+ veterans.</p>
