          <p>Microsoft is laying off approximately 6,000 employees, representing 3% of its workforce, across various levels, teams, and locations. According to a company spokesperson, these layoffs are part of ongoing organizational changes aimed at positioning the company for success in a dynamic marketplace. This decision comes after Microsoft reported better-than-expected financial results in late April, but it marks the largest round of layoffs since the elimination of 10,000 roles in 2023. The layoffs are not related to performance issues, and the headcount reduction tied to the company's Redmond headquarters involves nearly 2,000 employees.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are advancing legislation to fund President Trump's agenda, including significant Medicaid cuts and tax reforms, despite internal disagreements. Democrats plan to challenge the proposed changes to Medicaid, which include work requirements and restrictions on funding for certain organizations. The bill also seeks to extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts, increase the child tax credit, and raise the debt ceiling. Some Republicans are opposed to the proposals, citing concerns over the impact on their constituents and the size of the state and local tax deduction cap. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the health portions of the bill would save $715 billion but leave 8.6 million more Americans uninsured.</p>

          <p>Peter Coker Jr. and his father, Peter Coker Sr., were sentenced for their involvement in a $100 million New Jersey deli fraud scheme. The scheme artificially inflated the stock prices of Hometown International, a small deli, and E-Waste, a company with no operations, to attract mergers. Peter Coker Jr. received a 40-month prison sentence, while his father was sentenced to six months in jail followed by six months of home confinement. Both Cokers expressed remorse for their actions, which led to significant financial harm and personal consequences, including Coker Jr.'s brutal attack in a Thai prison while awaiting extradition.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced $600 billion in deals with Saudi Arabia, but the details provided by the White House totaled less than half that amount. The largest agreement, valued at $142 billion, involves the sale of warfighting equipment and services from American defense companies. Other touted projects, such as investments in AI data centers and infrastructure, were already underway before Trump took office. Trump also lifted sanctions on Syria and encouraged Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords, while reiterating his stance against Iran. He claimed that the Biden administration had done little for the region and hailed the kingdom’s rapid development, urging increased investment in the United States.</p>

          <p>Audra McDonald's performance of "Rose's Turn" in the Broadway revival of "Gypsy" has garnered critical acclaim for its raw and devastating portrayal of the character Rose's emotional breakdown. The article explores how McDonald, along with director George C. Wolfe and musical director Andy Einhorn, delved into the depths of Rose's rage, sorrow, and abandonment. This rendition sheds new light on the well-known character by revealing a woman grappling with rejection and a fear of abandonment, making it a profound and visceral experience for audiences.

          <p>The annual inflation rate in the United States reached 2.3% in April, slightly below expectations and the lowest since February 2021, according to a Labor Department report. The consumer price index rose 0.2% for the month, while the core CPI, excluding food and energy, also increased by 0.2%. Shelter prices were the primary factor driving up the inflation gauge. This news comes as President Trump's tariffs begin to impact the U.S. economy, with economists noting that non-tariffed goods are still in the pipeline, and some importers may have absorbed tariff costs for now.</p>

          <p>The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, continues to publish misleading or inaccurate claims on its "Wall of Receipts," touting purported savings that are often inflated or erroneous. A CBS News investigation revealed that DOGE is claiming savings for contracts that are still active or have been modified, not canceled. Experts like Nat Malkus have expressed skepticism about the accuracy of DOGE's figures, estimating that the actual savings are likely much lower. Despite these inconsistencies, DOGE maintains that the "Wall of Receipts" is a model of transparency.</p>

The State Department later terminated the grant, citing the government's convenience. Stiglitz argues that this incident reveals the Trump administration's determination to extend its control to even the smallest ventures and suppress discussions on diversity, equity, and inclusion, viewing them as discriminatory. Despite the funding cutoff, the lecture series proceeded with alternative funding, and Stiglitz delivered his talk on the importance of freedom and the dangers of authoritarianism.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee's Credentials subcommittee recommended a redo of the vice-chair elections due to concerns about how the original balloting was conducted, placing current vice chairs David Hogg and Malcolm Kenyatta at risk of losing their positions. The recommendation stems from a challenge filed by vice chair candidate Kalyn Free, alleging irregularities in the voting process. Hogg, who aims to reform the Democratic Party, believes the vote is linked to his efforts to support primary challengers, while Kenyatta expressed frustration that the focus has been on Hogg rather than his own work.</p>
