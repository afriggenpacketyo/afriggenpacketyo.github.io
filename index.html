          <h2>President Trump Announces 100% Tariffs on Foreign-Produced Movies</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump declared that he will impose 100% tariffs on movies produced outside the U.S., citing the need to revitalize the American movie industry and protect it from what he considers a national security threat due to other countries offering incentives to filmmakers. He argues that these incentives are drawing filmmakers and studios away from the United States, devastating Hollywood and other areas. The announcement has sparked confusion among movie executives regarding the practical implementation of such tariffs, especially concerning films with components made in various countries and post-production occurring in the U.S. The Motion Picture Association has not yet issued a statement regarding this proposal.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans to reopen and significantly expand Alcatraz, the former prison island near San Francisco, to house America's most violent offenders, aiming to symbolize law, order, and justice. He cited frustrations with radicalized judges and the need to lock up dangerous criminals away from society. The Bureau of Prisons stated it would comply with presidential orders, though the feasibility of reopening Alcatraz, now a popular national park, is questioned. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi dismissed the proposal as unserious, highlighting the island's current status as a major tourist attraction.</p>

          <p>President Trump clarified that he intends to leave office after his current term, acknowledging the constitutional limit preventing him from seeking a third term, despite some individuals wanting him to do so. He expressed his desire to have four great years and then pass the presidency to a great Republican. In other news, Trump stated uncertainty about upholding constitutional due process, did not rule out using military force to control Greenland, and faced pushback from NPR and PBS regarding funding cuts. Additionally, he announced 100% tariffs on movies produced in foreign lands and saw the termination of arts grants following his proposal to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts.</p>

          <p>An exhibit at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) headquarters, dedicated to victims of gun violence, has been removed, according to the Department of Justice. The exhibit featured portraits of 120 individuals, including victims of mass shootings, domestic violence, and law enforcement officers killed by guns. A DOJ spokesperson indicated that the ATF will continue to honor victims of violent crime, but not exclusively those affected by gun violence. Advocates like Kris Brown from Brady: United Against Gun Violence, view the removal as a political decision reflecting the Trump administration's efforts to roll back firearms regulations.</p>

          <p>The Royal Family hopes that nothing will detract from the upcoming VE Day commemorations, which mark the 80th anniversary of Victory in Europe. This comes shortly after Prince Harry's candid interview with the BBC, where he discussed his estrangement from his father and desire for reconciliation. King Charles and Queen Camilla will lead the nation in celebrating and commemorating the wartime generation, with events including a military procession, a Buckingham Palace balcony appearance, and a tea party for war veterans.</p>

          <h2>Experts Caution Women About Over-Reliance on Egg Freezing</h2>

          <p>As more women turn to egg freezing to extend their fertility options, some experts caution against viewing it as a guaranteed solution. Vardit Ravitsky from the Hastings Center highlights the costs, medical risks, and emotional gamble involved, citing stories like Evelyn Gosnell's, whose frozen eggs did not result in a viable embryo. Critics also argue that the commercialization of fertility services may prioritize profits over patient care. They suggest that societal changes, such as better parental leave policies, could support women in having children at younger ages.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Egg freezing is increasingly popular among women who want to preserve their fertility and increase their chances of having children later in life. This allows them to delay starting a family without the pressure of a ticking biological clock. Experts like Dr. Tomer Singer foresee egg freezing becoming a routine practice, while others caution it's not a guarantee. The process involves hormone injections, egg retrieval, and freezing, with costs ranging from $12,000 to $15,000 per cycle, plus storage fees and additional expenses for thawing and fertilization.</p>

          <p>More than half of first-time home buyers in the past year received financial assistance from their families, according to Savills. An average of Â£55,572 was given in loans and gifts, reflecting the challenges young buyers face with high mortgage rates and increasing rental costs. This level of family support is slightly lower than the previous year but higher than most years since 2013, peaking in 2009 during the financial crisis.

          <p>President Trump's executive orders targeting law firms connected to investigations involving him or his allies have sparked controversy, with critics arguing that these actions threaten the rule of law. The orders, which could bar attorneys from courthouses and federal agencies, prompted some firms to make deals with the White House. Attorney Donald Ayer argues that these actions violate constitutional rights, while others see them as an attempt to intimidate the legal profession. Four firms are challenging the orders in court, arguing they are unconstitutional.</p>
