          <p>Two Chinese satellites, Shijian-21 and Shijian-25, appeared to dock in geostationary orbit, a maneuver observed by US-based space monitoring firm COMSPOC. This prolonged rendezvous suggests a potential historic achievement in autonomous satellite servicing, specifically an in-orbit refueling mission. This advanced capability, which the United States has not yet demonstrated, highlights China's growing prowess in complex space operations and its strategic ambitions for maintaining and extending the life of its orbital assets. The event was closely monitored by US surveillance satellites.</p>

          <p>Severe flash flooding in Central Texas has led to a death toll of 129, with search and recovery operations ongoing for missing individuals. The National Weather Service has issued warnings for a continued moderate risk of flash flooding, particularly in hard-hit areas like Kerrville and Burnet. Heavy rainfall has caused rivers to rise dramatically, and volunteer groups, including former Navy SEALs, are assisting in the difficult search through devastated terrain, highlighting the extreme violence and destructive power of the event.</p>

          <p>Forty years after the monumental Live Aid concerts in London and Philadelphia, this article reflects on the careers of its biggest performers. The 1985 event, aimed at famine relief in Ethiopia, featured icons like Queen, Madonna, Elton John, and Tina Turner. While some stars like Madonna and Mick Jagger continue to perform, many others, including Freddie Mercury, David Bowie, and George Michael, have since passed away. The article chronicles the subsequent paths of these musicians, marking the legacy of a global broadcast event that defined a generation.</p>

          <p>This article examines the growing influence of right-leaning sports media personalities like Pat McAfee and Dave Portnoy, who have cultivated a powerful "sports bro" culture. This sphere, characterized by brash commentary, anti-"woke" sentiment, and a celebration of traditional masculinity, has become a significant cultural force, particularly among young men. The piece argues that this movement serves as an important emissary for Trump-aligned politics, normalizing its values and attitudes within the ostensibly apolitical world of sports, and shifting the landscape of public discourse.</p>

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary, Heidi Alexander, has announced the government will introduce measures to make electric vehicles (EVs) cheaper to purchase, aiming to accelerate the transition from petrol cars. While details of potential grants were not confirmed, the commitment addresses the high upfront cost of EVs, which is a major barrier for many consumers. The announcement coincides with a £63 million investment in charging infrastructure, including solutions for homes without driveways, though critics argue the government is prematurely forcing families into expensive vehicles.</p>

          <p>Police in the eastern German state of Saxony-Anhalt have conducted one of the country's largest-ever amphetamine seizures, discovering 1.7 million Captagon pills. The drugs, with an estimated street value of over €20 million, were found hidden in delivery pallets at a grocery store in the city of Landsberg. Captagon, a brand name for the amphetamine fenethylline, is a popular stimulant, and authorities stated that the investigation into the massive drug trafficking operation is ongoing. This bust represents a significant blow to organized crime networks.</p>

Japan's defense ministry accused a Chinese fighter-bomber of making "unusual approaches" toward one of its electronic-intelligence planes, warning such actions could lead to an accidental collision. In response, China's defense ministry accused Japanese aircraft of repeatedly entering its air defense zone, stating its own actions were lawful and that Japan's close-in reconnaissance is the root cause of security risks.</p>

The cost of the table was approximately $1,980, but the delivery company, acting as the importer of record, passed the customs duties directly to the consumer. This experience is becoming more common under President Trump's aggressive trade policies, which experts say could cost the average household thousands per year. (not investment advice)</p>

Multiple investigations highlighted lapses in intelligence and resources, leading to 37 reform recommendations. The article traces some of the agency's challenges back to its post-9/11 absorption into the Department of Homeland Security, which expanded its mission without a proportional increase in budget or staffing. While reforms are underway, many require congressional action, leaving the agency in a precarious position.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the year since the assassination attempt on Donald Trump, arguing the event fundamentally altered the 2024 election and the nation's political trajectory. Trump's survival and defiant response galvanized his supporters, who saw it as divine intervention, and contributed to his eventual victory. The event created a stark contrast with then-President Biden, whose subsequent withdrawal from the race left the Democratic party in disarray. The shooting is presented as a pivotal moment that amplified political violence and set the stage for Trump's second term.</p>

Beijing lodged a formal protest, insisting that the succession must follow Chinese law and tradition, and warned India to stop interfering in its domestic affairs, viewing Tibet as a non-negotiable "red line."</p>

          <p>Researchers at Caltech are creating "biohybrid" robots by embedding microelectric controllers into moon jellyfish, allowing them to remotely control the animals' movements. The goal is to dispatch swarms of these cyborg jellyfish to collect ocean data on temperature and pressure at a fraction of the cost of traditional underwater vehicles. Jellyfish are ideal candidates as they lack a central nervous system and pain receptors, and can heal quickly. This innovative approach could democratize ocean research by providing a low-cost, scalable method for monitoring the marine environment.</p>

However, critics note that major funding programs controlled by the state treasurer remain separate, which may limit the new agency's effectiveness in reducing costs and delays for developers.</p>
