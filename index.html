          <p>Mohamed Soliman, the suspect in the Boulder attack during a pro-Israel demonstration, has been charged with a federal hate crime and multiple state charges, including attempted first-degree murder. Court documents reveal Soliman researched how to make Molotov cocktails on YouTube and constructed them for the attack, he also disguised himself as a gardener during the attack. Soliman allegedly told police he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were dead, stating his actions were related to the killings of people on his land, Palestine. He had allegedly been planning the attack for a year, waiting until his daughter's graduation, and sixteen unused Molotov cocktails were found near him at the time of his arrest.</p>

          <p>A suspect is in custody following what the FBI is calling a targeted act of violence during a peaceful march in support of Israeli hostages at the outdoor Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Colorado. Witnesses said the suspect used a makeshift flamethrower and threw Molotov cocktails, injuring twelve people. The suspect, identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, allegedly yelled "Free Palestine" during the attack, leading to the investigation being treated as an act of terrorism. Soliman faces multiple felony counts and a federal hate crimes charge, and authorities confirmed he is an Egyptian national whose visa expired in 2023 after arriving in 2022 and applying for asylum.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from gun rights advocates, allowing Maryland's ban on assault-style rifles and high-capacity magazines to remain in place. This decision leaves in place a ruling by the Fourth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, which stated that the state can constitutionally prohibit the sale and possession of these weapons. Justices Alito, Gorsuch, and Thomas dissented, while Justice Kavanaugh expressed that he expects the high court to weigh in formally on the legality of the AR-15 in the coming years. Maryland has seen a decline in gun violence since enacting laws aimed at curbing access to dangerous weapons, particularly targeting gun kits.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Six Nobel laureate economists have warned that a budget bill passed by the House, backed by President Trump, would significantly increase the U.S. debt and exacerbate inequality. The economists, writing on behalf of the Economic Policy Institute, said the bill would weaken safety-net programs like Medicaid and food stamps while disproportionately benefiting higher-income households. They estimate the bill would add over $3 trillion to the public debt, putting upward pressure on inflation and interest rates. Senator Rand Paul has also expressed concerns, noting the bill includes substantial new spending despite proposed cuts, while the Trump administration defends the package as a driver of economic growth.</p>

Crunchy Data provides access to a cloud-hosted version of the PostgreSQL open-source database, enhancing it with security and performance improvements. This acquisition follows Databricks' intent to acquire Neon, another PostgreSQL-based software provider, and is expected to help Snowflake benefit from corporate spending on AI agents.

          <p>The article discusses the unlikelihood of credit card interest rates declining in June due to the Federal Reserve's decision to hold steady on interest rate cuts. It notes that credit card rates are influenced by factors beyond the Federal Reserve, such as the prime rate and economic uncertainty. The average credit card interest rate is currently just under 22%, and the average credit card debt is close to $8,000. The article suggests exploring debt relief options like credit card debt forgiveness, debt consolidation loans, and balance transfer credit cards to mitigate the impact of high interest rates.

          <p>The Trump administration's proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 calls for a 15% funding cut to the Education Department, signaling a renewed commitment to winding down the agency. The budget would leave Title I funding levels unchanged but consolidate and dramatically cut funding for various K-12 programs, including teacher training and support for at-risk students. While appearing to increase funding for special education, the proposal also folds in previously separate programs, resulting in essentially flat funding for districts. On the higher education side, the budget proposes cutting the maximum amount of annual Pell Grants and reducing funding for the Federal Work-Study program.</p>

          <p>The Philadelphia Inquirer's editorial board has issued a critical assessment of Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman, urging him to take his job "seriously" or consider stepping down. The editorial highlights Fetterman's frequent absences from Senate proceedings, citing missed votes and committee hearings, as well as reports of his isolation from colleagues. Fetterman responded by dismissing the criticism as a smear, asserting his commitment to his duties and attributing missed votes to travel days and procedural matters. Data indicates that Fetterman has missed a higher percentage of votes compared to other senators like Bernie Sanders and Patty Murray.</p>

The attacks demonstrated Ukraine's ingenuity and effectiveness when not constrained by Western leaders, revealing vulnerabilities in expensive Russian military hardware. The operation highlights the rapid evolution of drone technology, with some vehicles potentially operating outside human authority using AI to target vulnerable areas of Russian aircraft. The Ukrainian attacks should lead to a period of quiet reflection about military security and strategy, and could still win the war if properly armed by its remaining allies.</p>

Analysts noted that the duties were a surprise and will place Illinois among the highest-taxed states for sports betting.
