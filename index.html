          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-28 05:01:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Periodical cicadas, specifically Brood XIV, are expected to emerge across the eastern United States in the spring of 2025. These cicadas, known for their synchronized emergence every 17 years, will primarily swarm Kentucky and Tennessee, with smaller pockets appearing along the East Coast. The emergence is triggered when the soil temperature reaches 64 degrees Fahrenheit, prompting the larvae to surface, mate, and lay eggs before dying off within 4 to 6 weeks. Their presence is marked by loud buzzing choruses used by males to attract females, and their life cycle involves spending years underground feeding on plant roots as larvae. </p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that President Trump should prioritize meetings with small business owners to understand the impact of economic policies, especially tariffs, on Main Street. While Trump has met with executives from large retailers, the author contends that small businesses, which comprise a significant portion of the U.S. economy, often get overlooked. Small businesses have faced challenges from COVID-19 mandates, supply chain disruptions, and inflation, and the author suggests that direct engagement with these businesses would provide valuable insights for policy decisions.</p>

          <p>Canada's upcoming election is poised to shape its relationship with the United States, particularly in light of Donald Trump's return to the White House. Trump's rhetoric about annexing Canada and imposing tariffs has stirred Canadian nationalism and influenced the election dynamics. The Liberal Party, led by Prime Minister Mark Carney, has gained momentum by opposing Trump's policies, while the Conservative Party, led by Pierre Poilievre, initially surged by emulating Trump's confrontational style. The election outcome will determine Canada's approach to navigating tensions with its southern neighbor.</p>

          <p>Senator Marco Rubio stated that the upcoming week is "very critical" for Russia-Ukraine war talks, as the U.S. decides whether to continue its involvement in diplomatic efforts. Donald Trump reportedly believes Ukrainian President Zelensky is willing to cede Crimea to Russia for a peace deal, a claim Ukraine has previously denied. Germany's Defence Minister warned Ukraine against agreeing to territorial concessions for a ceasefire, viewing it as capitulation, while Trump questioned Putin's sincerity in wanting to end the war.</p>

Sanders, who was eventually drafted by the Cleveland Browns, dismissed the incident as a "childish act," while Jax Ulbrich apologized for his "inexcusable, embarrassing, and shameful" behavior.</p>

          <p>The Jacksonville Jaguars made a historic move by trading up to draft Travis Hunter, a two-way player, while the Atlanta Falcons' draft strategy raised eyebrows due to their high price for pass-rushers.

The Philadelphia Eagles focused on bolstering their defense with impactful additions, and the 2025 quarterback class was deemed weaker compared to previous years.

To address this trend, China is streamlining marriage registration rules, but demographers believe the effect may be limited given broader economic and social pressures.</p>
