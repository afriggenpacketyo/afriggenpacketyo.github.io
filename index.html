          <p>Prince Harry has returned to the United Kingdom for a series of charity engagements, sparking widespread speculation about a potential reunion with his estranged father, King Charles III, or brother, Prince William. The visit coincides with the third anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II's death, yet no meetings with senior royals have been confirmed. Royal experts note that Harry has not seen his brother in person since 2022 and had only a brief meeting with his father in February following the King's cancer diagnosis. The continued distance highlights the deep rift within the royal family.</p>

          <p>Former NFL reporter Michele Tafoya has strongly criticized LeBron James for writing a glowing essay about China in a state-run newspaper. Tafoya described the act as "American malpractice," suggesting James is ill-informed or willfully ignorant of China's human rights issues, such as the treatment of Uyghur Muslims. She speculated that his defense of China is tied to his significant business interests there, including the manufacturing of his sneakers. James's essay, which praised the enthusiasm of his Chinese fans, was published at the conclusion of his "Forever King Tour" in the country.</p>

          <p>A judge in Michigan has dismissed all criminal charges against 15 individuals who were accused of acting as "fake electors" for Donald Trump in the 2020 election. The group had signed certificates falsely claiming that Trump had won Michigan's electoral votes. This ruling represents a significant setback for prosecutors who have been pursuing legal action against those involved in efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. The decision marks a key development in the ongoing legal battles related to the aftermath of the election.</p>

The Israel Defense Forces stated the operation was aimed at individuals directly responsible for the October 7th attacks and the ongoing war. The strike drew immediate and strong condemnation from Qatar's government, which called the action a "cowardly Israeli strike" and a violation of international law. The White House acknowledged that Israel had provided notification just before the operation was carried out.</p>

The woman was airlifted to a hospital but was pronounced dead. This incident underscores the extreme dangers faced by migrants attempting the crossing, with a government spokesperson expressing shock and sadness over the tragedy.</p>

          <p>Businesses in China are contending with deflation as falling prices impact the economy, a stark contrast to the inflation seen in the U.S. and other Western nations. With consumer confidence low, people are cutting back on spending and seeking value, forcing businesses like high-end hotels to sell discounted food on sidewalks to generate revenue. This "race-to-the-bottom" competition is exacerbated by excess capacity in many sectors, from electric vehicles to food delivery. The trend is changing consumer habits, with a growing demand for second-hand luxury goods as even affluent shoppers become more frugal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nepal's Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli has resigned amid violent anti-government protests, creating a new wave of political instability in the country. The unrest was initially sparked by a government ban on major social media platforms, but it grew to reflect widespread public anger over corruption and misgovernance. Demonstrations, largely led by young people, turned deadly when security forces opened fire, killing at least 19 people. With the prime minister's departure, constitutional experts warn of potential chaos unless a national unity government can be formed.</p>

          <p>An Israeli strike targeting Hamas leadership in Doha highlights an increasingly aggressive regional strategy, following recent military actions in Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen. The attack, which Qatari officials condemned, targeted a residential area where Hamas members have lived for years. While Israel stated it took measures to mitigate civilian harm, the operation raises concerns about escalating conflict in the Middle East. The strike occurred as Israel prepares for a full invasion of Gaza City, complicating ongoing ceasefire negotiations.</p>

          <p>In recent remarks, Donald Trump complained that domestic violence incidents were being included in crime statistics, which he claimed prevented him from declaring a 100% reduction in crime in Washington D.C. He referred to such incidents as "a little fight with the wife," suggesting they shouldn't be classified as crimes. This comment has drawn significant criticism for appearing to downplay the seriousness of domestic violence. The article contextualizes his statement within his administration's policies, which have included cuts to funding for domestic violence support services and non-profits.</p>

          <p>China is launching its "Air Silk Road" initiative to help develop civil aviation capabilities in dozens of partner countries, a strategy that could also promote its domestically produced aircraft like the C919. A recent government report outlines plans to enhance air route connectivity and create express traffic corridors with nations involved in the Belt and Road Initiative. This move aims to strengthen trade and diplomatic ties, particularly with countries in Central Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. The initiative represents a significant push to expand China's influence in the global aviation sector.</p>

          <h2>Consumers Increasingly Favor Debit Cards Amid Growing Fear of Credit Card Debt</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-09 11:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American consumers, particularly younger generations like Gen Z, are increasingly opting for debit cards over credit cards due to a growing aversion to debt. This trend reverses a long-standing preference for credit, driven by concerns over high interest rates and the financial instability witnessed after the Great Recession. In response, financial companies like Venmo and Cash App are launching debit cards with rewards programs to attract these debt-averse customers. The shift reflects a broader cultural and economic desire for greater control over personal spending and finances.</p>
