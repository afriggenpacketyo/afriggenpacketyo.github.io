        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump declared that Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire following a week of aerial attacks that began after Israel targeted Iran's nuclear program. Prior to the ceasefire, Iran carried out a missile attack on the United States’ Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which followed the U.S. bombing of three nuclear sites in Iran. The President stated that there were no casualties reported at the base. Iran's attack was a response to the U.S. sending B-2 bombers to drop Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs over Iran, with Trump claiming that monumental damage was done to all nuclear sites. </p>

          <p>Veterinary surgeons and animal charities report that increasing vet bills are causing more pet owners to euthanize their animals or delay treatment. Some owners are surrendering pets to rehoming centers, while others are forgoing future pet ownership due to the high costs. Many veterinary professionals attribute the rising prices to the acquisition of practices by large corporations. The British Veterinary Association acknowledges the increased cost of care and maintains that fees reflect the prices businesses need to charge to remain financially viable and open. </p>

          <p>Authorities in Inner Mongolia investigated actress Nashi for alleged fraud in the 2008 gaokao, China's national college entrance exam, after she hinted online that she hadn't "played fair." The investigation revealed that Nashi used faked documents to take the exam and enroll in the Shanghai Theatre Academy, violating an agreement to serve in Inner Mongolia after graduation. This incident has sparked public outrage, highlighting concerns about social justice and fairness amid China's widening wealth gap and increasing social stratification. The gaokao is considered a crucial tool for social mobility, offering a meritocratic path to higher education for children from less-privileged backgrounds.</p>

          <p>Sanseito, a new right-wing populist party in Japan, is gaining traction among younger citizens with its anti-immigrant stance and calls for constitutional revision. The party, established in 2020, exploits fears and frustrations related to economic stagnation and increasing tourism. Supporters express concerns that foreigners receive preferential treatment and that Japanese culture is rapidly changing. The party's early support is attributed to pandemic fatigue, particularly mask-wearing obligations, and the charismatic leadership of Sohei Kamiya, who has been likened to a Japanese idol. </p>

          <p>The Supreme Court lifted a lower court order preventing the Trump administration from deporting migrants to countries other than their origin without allowing them to raise fears of torture or death. Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson dissented, with Sotomayor accusing the government of "flagrantly unlawful conduct." The Department of Homeland Security called the ruling a victory and stated it can now remove illegal aliens to willing countries. The administration has approached nations like Costa Rica, Panama, and Rwanda about accepting migrants who are not their citizens.</p>
