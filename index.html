          <p>Golfer Hunter Mahan offered a lighthearted critique of the Quail Hollow Club, the venue for this year's PGA Championship, comparing it to a Kardashian for being modern, beautiful, and well-kept, but lacking soul or character. Other golfers, like Dean Burmester, have described the course as a "monster," adding to the anticipation for the tournament. The PGA Championship changes courses each year, but Quail Hollow has hosted the Wells Fargo Championship and the 2022 Presidents Cup, making it familiar to many golfers. The article mentions that Xander Schauffele won last year's PGA Championship.</p>

Her research has contributed to Brazil becoming a major agricultural power, reducing the need for chemical fertilizers.

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration, under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is considering removing prescription fluoride supplements for children from the market, citing concerns about the impact of ingested fluoride on the human microbiome. This move contradicts recommendations from the CDC, U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, and professional medical associations, which support low-dose fluoride supplements for children in areas without fluoridated water. Critics argue that the ban would remove a valuable tool for dentists in preventing cavities, while the FDA claims the action is based on safety concerns, despite inconclusive research on the effects of low doses of fluoride.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has repeatedly vowed not to cut Medicaid, but a House Republican bill aims to slash hundreds of billions of dollars from the program. The bill proposes imposing work requirements for recipients, making more frequent eligibility checks, and penalizing states that offer Medicaid to illegal immigrants. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the proposal would save $715 billion over the next decade but leave 8.6 million more Americans uninsured. Despite his promises, Trump has argued the administration is looking for "fraud" and "abuse" in the benefits program.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.3% in April on an annual basis, slightly below economists' expectations, but still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target.

Economists are closely monitoring the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs on consumer prices, but the effects may not be immediately visible in economic data. The CPI data may influence the Federal Reserve's decisions regarding interest rate cuts, potentially delaying relief on borrowing costs for consumers and businesses.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing criticism for prioritizing the resettlement of white Afrikaner refugees from South Africa, while simultaneously denying or revoking protections for refugees from Afghanistan, Haiti, and other nations. This has led to allegations of hypocrisy and a double standard in immigration policies. Questions have also been raised about how the travel of these refugees is being funded, as the State Department has been vague about whether they are receiving interest-free loans typically provided to refugees who cannot afford travel costs. Critics also point to Trump's mention of violent attacks against Afrikaners, while South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has denied any persecution.</p>
