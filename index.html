          <p>ASML has developed High NA, a $400 million chipmaking machine that's transforming microchip manufacturing. This advanced machine, bigger than a double-decker bus, uses extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography to project smaller chip designs with higher resolution and improved yield. Intel, TSMC, and Samsung are among the first to use High NA, which reduces cycle time by 60% and improves performance. Despite the high cost, ASML aims to drive down chip prices by increasing speed and performance, and the company nearly failed before proving the viability of EUV technology, a risky investment that took over 20 years to develop.</p>

          <p>Lenovo Group reported strong annual results driven by demand for AI PCs, with revenue up 21% and net income increasing 37%. However, the company's CEO, Yang Yuanqing, expressed concern over unexpected tariffs imposed by the US, which heavily impacted their most recent quarter and prevented even stronger profit growth. The sudden implementation of these tariffs in March caught Lenovo off guard, leaving them with little time to prepare, and investors reacted negatively, causing Lenovo's Hong Kong-listed shares to fall. This development highlights the ongoing challenges faced by tech companies amid US-China trade tensions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives passed President Trump's tax bill, with Republicans narrowly securing the victory.

          <p>Global bonds are experiencing a sell-off due to fiscal concerns ignited by Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating and President Trump's tax bill. Investors are reassessing the term premium required to hold longer-dated bonds, leading to rising yields in major markets like Japan and Germany. Japan's bond sell-off could make Japanese assets attractive, further encouraging divestment from the U.S. The removal of Germany's debt brake and re-armament plans have also contributed to the bond sell-off, signaling a shift in Europe's fiscal policies.</p>

          <p>President Trump's approval ratings are slightly underwater four months into his second term, despite successes in border security and immigration.

          <p>An increasing number of voices on the Christian right, spearheaded by figures like Joe Rigney, are arguing that empathy is a sin, claiming progressives use it to manipulate Christians. This view, detailed in Rigney's book, has spread beyond far-right evangelicals and into mainstream conservative circles, influenced by figures like Elon Musk. The argument often targets empathy for marginalized communities or liberal perspectives, and critics like Karen Swallow Prior argue it's a backlash against those questioning authority. Despite pushback, the concept has gained traction, highlighting a growing trend of demonizing empathy within certain segments of society.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives passed a tax bill that includes changes to the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), raising the cap to $40,000. This increase, up from the current $10,000 limit, would primarily benefit filers in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey, and California. The SALT cap and income phaseout would increase annually by 1% from 2026 through 2033. The revised text would also reduce itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket, which could reduce the benefit of the higher SALT cap.</p>

According to the complaint, the hotel asked her to show her passport or an identification card for foreign residents in Japan during check-in, despite the fact that she was not legally obligated to do so.</p>

          <p>The U.S. debt-and-deficit situation is worsening, triggering a credit rating downgrade from Moody's and a sell-off in stocks and bonds, and analysts attribute this to President Trump's spending bill.

Experts warn that without a commitment to reducing deficits, investor concerns about U.S. fiscal dynamics are likely to persist.</p>

However, Ramaphosa, major political parties in South Africa, and a South African court have denied the existence of a white genocide in the country. Trump's claims have been supported by Elon Musk, a South African native and top adviser to Trump, who has alleged that white South Africans are fleeing the country due to "violence and racist laws." Amid Trump's claims, dozens of Afrikaner refugees arrived in the U.S. after having their applications fast-tracked.</p>

          <p>Net migration to the UK nearly halved in 2024, dropping to 431,000, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The decrease was driven by fewer people coming to work and study, changes introduced by the previous Conservative government, and departures of those who arrived on study visas after the pandemic. There was also a significant drop in dependents accompanying work and study visa holders. Home Office data indicates a decrease in asylum seekers housed in hotels, though numbers remain higher than when Labour came to power.</p>
