          <p>A former EU trade negotiator suggests that current tensions between China and the European Union over electric vehicles are not "existential." John Clarke, former head of the EU Delegation to the World Trade Organization, believes both sides are motivated to cooperate more closely on trade and green initiatives to counter potential disruptions from a second Trump presidency. Clarke emphasizes the need for Chinese environmental technology and goods, such as electric vehicles and solar panels, to achieve the EU‚Äôs net-zero emissions target by 2050, viewing China as a key partner in an affordable green transition. This comes as China-EU relations seek a reset amidst global uncertainties.</p>

          <p>The UK government's plan to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius has been temporarily blocked by a High Court injunction, following legal action by two Chagossian women. The agreement would allow the UK and US to continue using a military base on the archipelago for 99 years, while transferring sovereignty to Mauritius. The women, Bernadette Dugasse and Bertrice Pompe, seek to return to the islands, a right currently denied under both the existing and proposed arrangements. The court's decision underscores the ongoing controversy surrounding the islands' status and the rights of the Chagossian people, who were displaced in the late 1960s to allow the US to build a military base.</p>

The victims, Sarah Lynn Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky, were killed after leaving an event organized by the American Jewish Committee. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the shooting a ‚Äúhorrifying antisemitic murder,‚Äù while Foreign Minister Gideon Saar blamed ‚Äútoxic antisemitic incitement‚Äù since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.

          <p>A sell-off in global bonds is accelerating due to Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating and concerns over President Trump's tax bill, which could significantly increase the U.S. debt. Investors are increasingly worried about fiscal stability, causing them to reprice long-term risk. The U.S. 30-year Treasury yield has surpassed 5%, a level not seen since November 2023, while the 10-year Treasury yield has also climbed sharply. This sell-off is occurring across major markets, indicating a broad decline in investor confidence in U.S. assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>David French reflects on the legacy of Justice David Souter, highlighting his decision to retire from the Supreme Court at a relatively young age as an example of knowing when to step aside. French contrasts Souter's choice with the trend of politicians and judges clinging to power well into old age, noting the potential consequences for the nation. He argues that the desire to remain powerful, combined with the support of enablers and an apathetic public, contributes to this problem. French also emphasizes the importance of defining oneself beyond one's career, advocating for a life centered on family and virtue. He touches on Pope Leo's focus on love and compassion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's approach to tariffs involves initially proposing high numbers, then later reducing them or offering exemptions, creating a sense of relief even when the final tariffs are still substantial. This tactic, known as the anchor effect, is used to reframe perceptions of tariffs. While the average effective tariff rate in the U.S. is currently the highest since 1934, Trump's swings have made 30% tariffs seem relatively moderate. However, this uncertainty creates problems for businesses, making long-term planning difficult. The article provides context by mentioning the historical tariff rates and the potential impact on U.S. manufacturing.</p>

          <p>An air traffic controller at Philadelphia TRACON Area C, which manages the airspace around Newark Liberty International Airport, shares their perspective on recent system failures. The controller describes the environment as "overstretched, understaffed, and stressed out," citing unreliable equipment and insufficient support from the FAA. They allege that the FAA's decision to move control of the Newark airspace from Long Island to Philadelphia has exacerbated the problems. The FAA capped the number of flights in and out of Newark at 56 per hour, a cut of about 15%.</p>

These curbs, intended to limit China's military advancement and protect U.S. dominance in AI, have instead incentivized China to develop its own semiconductor industry. Experts suggest the restrictions have created competitors for leading U.S. companies while cutting them off from the Chinese market.

          <p>Higher-than-expected borrowing figures for April have increased pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves, with experts predicting likely tax increases in the autumn. Borrowing reached ¬£20.2bn, up ¬£1bn from last year, marking the fourth-highest April figure since 1993. This makes it difficult for the government to meet its economic rules without future tax rises. Tax receipts increased, but government expenditure also rose due to pay rises, inflation, and increases in pensions and benefits. The ONS estimates borrowing for the financial year ending in March at ¬£148.3bn, ¬£3.7bn less than initially thought, but still ¬£11bn more than expected by the OBR.</p>
