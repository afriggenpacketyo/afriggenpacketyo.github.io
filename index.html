          <p>A new company named Jams, backed by prominent athletes like Alex Morgan and C.J. Stroud, has launched a line of frozen peanut butter and jelly sandwiches to compete with the market-dominant Uncrustables. Differentiating itself with a health-conscious approach, Jams sandwiches contain no seed oils, artificial ingredients, or high-fructose corn syrup, and boast 10 grams of protein. The product will be sold exclusively at 3,000 Walmart stores at a slightly higher price point than its main competitor. The company aims to capture the athlete and health-focused consumer market.</p>

          <p>The People's Bank of China has stated it will maintain a "moderately loose" monetary policy, carefully calibrating its measures to help the nation achieve its 5% GDP growth target for the year. A deputy governor noted that the full impact of previous policies, such as cuts to reserve ratios and interest rates, is still unfolding due to inherent time lags. The central bank will continue to monitor economic conditions and market performance to effectively stimulate domestic demand and stabilize public expectations without being overly aggressive.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 08:30:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An Air China flight from Shanghai to Milan was involved in a near-miss incident over Siberia, coming within 300-400 feet of another aircraft. The close call occurred after the Air China plane made an unexplained altitude change, climbing nearly 2,000 feet without being instructed to do so by air traffic control. The minimum safe vertical separation standard is 1,000 feet. Investigators are considering the possibility that the pilot may have misunderstood an instruction intended for a different plane in the same airspace, highlighting a serious potential breakdown in communication.</p>

          <p>Emergency crews in Central Texas have suspended search operations for more than 160 people still missing from the catastrophic July 4th floods. A new flood threat emerged over the weekend, with heavy rains causing the Guadalupe River to rise again, prompting further evacuations in several counties. The initial disaster has claimed at least 132 lives statewide after the river swelled more than 20 feet in under an hour. Authorities have issued new warnings, describing the situation as dangerous and life-threatening, particularly around low water crossings.</p>

          <p>An independent inquiry has substantiated 45 out of 83 allegations made against 'MasterChef' presenter Gregg Wallace, including claims of inappropriate sexual language, culturally insensitive comments, and one instance of unwelcome physical contact. The report, commissioned by the show's production company, covers a 19-year period and notes that Wallace has since been diagnosed with autism, which he states may help explain but not excuse his actions. In response, the BBC has apologized for missed opportunities to address the behavior sooner and confirmed it has no future plans to work with Wallace.</p>

After the Office of Management and Budget director attacked the project as an "ostentatious overhaul," the Fed launched a new webpage to answer questions and defend the modernization. The site clarifies that the project preserves historic buildings, is not constructing new VIP dining rooms, and explains that cost increases are due to unforeseen conditions like asbestos.

The consultation will also seek public input on the services the Post Office should offer and whether the current requirement for 11,500 branches should be maintained.

          <p>The European Union's trade chief, Maros Sefcovic, stated that the 30% tariffs threatened by the U.S. would make continued trade "almost impossible," highlighting the severe economic risk. While affirming that a negotiated deal is the preferred outcome, the article notes growing divisions within the EU, with nations like France advocating for a tougher stance and the preparation of strong countermeasures. The EU remains prepared for all scenarios, acknowledging that the uncertainty caused by the tariff threat cannot continue indefinitely and that a balanced response is necessary if talks fail.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from the Justice Department's Inspector General has found systemic abuse in the use of restraints within the federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). The investigation uncovered thousands of instances where prisoners were shackled for prolonged periods, sometimes for days or weeks, in violation of BOP rules that prohibit using restraints as punishment. The report details disturbing cases, including one death following prolonged restraint and another instance leading to an amputation. In response, the BOP has agreed to revise its policies and improve practices to ensure humane treatment.</p>

          <p>A two-year excavation has commenced at the site of a former home for unwed mothers in Tuam, Ireland, where a mass grave is believed to contain the remains of hundreds of babies and children. The institution, run by Catholic nuns from 1925 to 1961, housed women pregnant outside of marriage. Previous test excavations found significant quantities of remains in a disused septic tank. This formal forensic investigation, involving international experts, aims to exhume, analyze, and if possible, identify the remains to provide dignity and closure for a dark chapter in Irish history.</p>

This article explores the region's history as "flash flood alley" and highlights how plans for a crucial early-warning siren system in Kerr County stalled due to political infighting and cost concerns. While a neighboring town with a new siren system successfully evacuated its residents, the lack of such infrastructure in the hardest-hit areas left many with no warning of the disaster.</p>

          <p>Despite modern marvels like comfortable beds and climate control that should enable a golden age of sleep, many people still suffer from restless nights. This article examines the paradox, attributing poor sleep to a mix of behavioral, systemic, and environmental factors. Modern lifestyles, including 'revenge bedtime procrastination' and constant screen use, sabotage sleep, while systemic issues like housing insecurity, shift work, and racial discrimination create significant barriers. Experts suggest that while personal habits matter, addressing these larger societal and environmental obstacles is crucial for improving sleep health.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, an Israeli theater director and pacifist describes a feeling of profound alienation since the start of the current conflict. He recounts being ostracized by relatives in Israel for his anti-war stance and being condemned abroad simply for his Israeli identity, where his activism is dismissed. The author reflects on the difficulty of maintaining a nuanced position in a world that demands absolute allegiance, where he is seen as a traitor at home and a killer overseas. The piece is a lament for the loss of complexity and a call for space to imagine a future beyond perpetual war.</p>

The article highlights the broader risks of AI chatbots for children as they become more integrated into daily life, questioning whether tech companies can adequately protect young users.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's consumer inflation rate cooled to 2.10% in June, extending a decline to its lowest point in over six years and coming in below economists' forecasts. The drop was driven by a continued fall in food prices, which registered at -1.06% for the month. This sustained easing of inflation provides the Reserve Bank of India with more room to continue its accommodative monetary policy, potentially through further interest rate cuts. A strong harvest and good monsoon season are expected to keep food inflation low, which could boost consumer purchasing power. (not investment advice)</p>
