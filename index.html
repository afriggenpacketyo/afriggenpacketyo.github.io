          <p>Elon Musk has stated he does not support a merger between his electric vehicle company, Tesla, and his artificial intelligence firm, xAI. This clarification comes amid growing integration between his various businesses, including a recent merger of xAI and social media platform X. Musk suggested that Tesla shareholders might vote on whether the automaker should invest in xAI, which develops the Grok AI chatbot. This potential investment follows reports of SpaceX also investing in the AI company, highlighting xAI's push to fund its development and compete in the crowded AI market.</p>

          <p>An independent inquiry into the BBC show MasterChef has substantiated 45 out of 83 allegations against presenter Gregg Wallace, who was recently fired. The upheld claims include one of unwelcome physical contact and multiple instances of inappropriate language, sexual humor, and culturally insensitive comments. The report, commissioned by production company Banijay, also found that some earlier complaints were not adequately addressed by either the production company or the BBC. Both organizations have apologized and stated the BBC has no plans to work with Wallace in the future.</p>

          <p>The mother of six-year-old Bebe King, one of three children killed in a knife attack in Southport last July, has launched a charity in her daughter's honor. The initiative, named Bebe's Hive, will offer creative sessions using art, music, and storytelling to help bereaved children in the community cope with their grief. Bebe's mother, Lauren King, explained that she turned to creativity in her own grief and wants to provide that same outlet for other children. The charity aims to carry on her daughter's "light and big heart" and create a nurturing community for those who have lost loved ones.</p>

          <p>Russia launched a significant drone and missile attack on Ukraine, with the Ukrainian air force reporting it neutralized 108 of the 136 drones. The assault occurred as U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to send more Patriot air defense systems to Kyiv, stating the European Union would cover the cost. This development comes as Trump's special envoy, Keith Kellogg, arrived in Kyiv for policy discussions. The Patriot systems are crucial for Ukraine's defense against Russia's ongoing aerial bombardments of its cities and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Prosecutions for fare evasion on the London Underground have reached their highest level in six years, with Transport for London (TfL) taking legal action against 3,691 people in the 2024-25 period. Additionally, a record number of penalty fare notices were issued on the London Overground. TfL, which spent over £21 million on enforcement across the Tube and bus network last year, states that fare evasion deprives the system of vital investment. The transport body aims to reduce the current fare evasion rate of 3.4% to 1.5% by 2030 through expanded enforcement teams.</p>

The piece calls for breaking "vendor lock-in" to allow for more agile and effective solutions in areas like AI and cybersecurity. It warns that China is actively integrating commercial tech to advance its capabilities, and the U.S. must do the same to maintain its national security edge.</p>

Proponents highlight that social connection, exercise, and engagement with nature can have significant health benefits, reducing the need for long-term medication. This practice is being adopted in about 30 countries, with studies showing it can improve health outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.</p>

          <p>Following deadly wildfires, Los Angeles County is exploring the creation of a voluntary disaster registry to help emergency responders locate and assist disabled and senior residents during crises. The proposal aims to protect over a million vulnerable residents, but many disability advocates are critical of the approach. They warn that such registries can provide a false sense of security, as they do not guarantee evacuation assistance, citing failures in other jurisdictions during past disasters. Advocates argue that the focus should instead be on improving overall emergency planning and transportation for people with disabilities.</p>

          <p>The definition of a "moderate" Republican is shifting, now often applied to conservatives who diverge from Donald Trump's positions, as seen with Senator Thom Tillis. Tillis, a historically conservative lawmaker, announced his retirement after facing backlash for opposing a major GOP bill, leading Trump to label him a "Republican In Name Only" (RINO). Political analysts note that loyalty to Trump has become a primary litmus test for conservatism, overriding traditional ideological stances on issues like free markets or spending. This trend highlights increasing party polarization, where even slight deviations can be a political liability.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin surged past $120,000 to a new all-time high, driven by significant inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and growing investor confidence. The rally is also being fueled by anticipation of clearer U.S. regulatory frameworks for the digital asset industry, with Congress set to deliberate on several crypto-related bills. This legislative push is supported by President Donald Trump, who has positioned himself as a pro-crypto leader. Analysts suggest that increased institutional buying is a key factor, with some setting year-end price targets as high as $160,000. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese leaders have signaled a new policy priority to tackle "excessive competition," or 'neijuan,' marked by disorderly, low-price competition that yields diminishing returns. This rhetoric is reminiscent of the 2015 "supply-side structural reform" which targeted excess capacity in state-dominated industries like steel and coal. However, analysts note that today's economic landscape is different, with a larger role for private firms, weaker overall growth, and limited government fiscal space. These factors will make it more challenging for Beijing to rein in the current wave of intense domestic competition across various sectors.</p>

          <p>The catastrophic floods in Texas, which have killed over 129 people, are being analyzed as the result of a "toxic cocktail" of climate change and weakened public services. The climate crisis is causing more intense rainfall events, while the Trump administration's cuts have reportedly left agencies like the National Weather Service understaffed and less able to provide timely warnings. Critics are questioning the role of Senator Ted Cruz, who pushed for cuts to a weather forecasting fund just days before the disaster.

Restoration workers are placing the books in oxygen-free environments for six weeks to kill the pests. Experts believe that rising temperatures due to climate change may have contributed to the severity of the infestation by allowing the beetles more life cycles per year.</p>
