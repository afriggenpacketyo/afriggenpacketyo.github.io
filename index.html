            <p>Chinese museums are now directed to promote ethnic unity and counter "wrong historical views" by avoiding confrontational portrayals of Han ethnicity with minorities, according to Pan Yue, director of the National Ethnic Affairs Commission. Museums are instructed to integrate cultural relics and narratives into a unified system of Chinese national development, emphasizing diversity within unity. This initiative aims to cultivate a sense of community and ensure that historical narratives support the government's vision of national identity. The Sanxingdui Museum, for example, has already created a course entitled “Viewing Chinese Civilisation from Sanxingdui”.</p>

            <p>US air strikes on the Ras Isa oil terminal in Yemen, controlled by Houthi forces, have reportedly killed at least 74 people and injured 171, according to the Houthi-run health ministry. The US military claims the strikes targeted a key economic source for the Iran-backed Houthis, aiming to disrupt their revenue streams. The Houthi-led government denounced the attack as a war crime, asserting that the terminal was a civilian facility. The US military stated the attacks were meant to degrade the economic power of the Houthis, who they accuse of exploiting and harming their fellow countrymen. Iran condemned the strikes as "barbaric".</p>

            <p>After Harvard University publicly rejected a series of demands from Trump administration officials, one official reportedly tried to claim the letter was sent by mistake. The original letter, sent on April 11, ordered Harvard to discontinue diversity efforts, limit student protests, install right-wing faculty, and spy on international students. Harvard President Alan Garber condemned these demands as an infringement on the university's independence and constitutional rights. Despite the attempted retraction, the Trump administration has since frozen Harvard’s public funding and ordered the IRS to revoke the school’s tax-exempt status, escalating the conflict.</p>

            <p>A recent poll by the NASUWT teaching union reveals that social media influencers are contributing to a rise in misogyny and sexism within UK schools. Nearly three in five teachers believe social media negatively impacts student behavior, with influencer Andrew Tate specifically named by several educators. The Department for Education has stated its support for teachers in addressing the harmful effects of dangerous influencers, highlighting the urgent need for schools and other agencies to protect young people from extremist ideologies. This issue will be debated at the union's annual conference, emphasizing the growing concern among educators about the influence of online content on students' attitudes and behavior.</p>

The ACLU argues that the Trump administration is rapidly deporting these individuals without providing them the due process required to challenge their cases. Detainees have been transferred to a facility in Texas and informed of their imminent removal, prompting concerns about their rights and safety. The Supreme Court previously ruled that the wartime authority could resume, but only if immigrants are given proper notice and a chance to make their case.</p>

            <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom granted clemency to 25 felons, including Sithy Bin, a Cambodian immigrant facing deportation. Bin, a former gang member convicted in 2008, became a minister in prison and demonstrated significant rehabilitation. Newsom's pardon aims to prevent Bin's deportation, aligning with his criticism of the Trump administration's immigration policies. Newsom also offered a posthumous pardon to Sgt. Richard Allen Penry, a Medal of Honor recipient who faced legal troubles after returning from the Vietnam War.</p>

            <p>Recent volatility in the US bond market, with rising interest rates and falling bond prices, signals investor unease about the economy. Investors are demanding higher returns due to uncertainty surrounding the impact of trade tariffs. This volatility could affect public spending, household finances, and business lending rates. The situation draws comparisons to the UK's 2022 mini-Budget crisis, with potential risks to the US dollar and economy. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that the term "woman" legally refers to a biological woman, providing clarity that had been missing from equality law conversations. The ruling states that the Equality Act must consistently interpret "woman" to mean a biological female, excluding biological males, even those with gender recognition certificates. This decision impacts single-sex spaces like changing rooms and women's refuges. While some celebrate the ruling as a victory for common sense, others express devastation, fearing exclusion and harassment for trans people.</p>

The strike, now in its sixth week, has led to sanitation concerns and accusations of a two-tiered waste collection system. While council officials commit to improving fairness post-strike, striking workers express concerns that planned changes will worsen the situation. Residents report increased rat infestations and a decline in civic pride due to the uncollected waste.</p>

The group also unsuccessfully asked a federal judge to halt any new deportations. The government says 137 migrants accused of being members of the Venezuelan gang Tren De Aragua, including a group of men sent to a prison in El Salvador, have already been deported under the Alien Enemies Act.</p>
