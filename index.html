          <p>Shares of online brokerage Robinhood surged after S&P Global announced its inclusion in the prestigious S&P 500 index, effective September 22. This long-anticipated move typically triggers significant buying from passive investment funds that track the index, boosting a company's stock value. The inclusion follows a period of strong performance for Robinhood, with its stock price having more than tripled in 2025. The news represents a major milestone for the company, which has experienced considerable volatility since its 2021 IPO. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chief Justice John Roberts has granted an interim request from the Trump administration, allowing it to proceed with the removal of a Federal Trade Commission member for the time being. This decision puts a temporary hold on a lower court's order that had reinstated commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter. The case is part of a broader legal conflict over the president's authority to fire appointees at independent federal agencies. The Supreme Court will now take more time to consider the administration's full request to lift the lower court's injunction.</p>

          <p>A shooting attack by Palestinian gunmen at a busy bus stop in northern Jerusalem on Monday resulted in the deaths of six people and left several others wounded. Israeli police reported that two attackers were also killed at the scene by a security officer and a civilian. The incident is one of the deadliest of its kind since the start of the war in Gaza nearly two years ago. Hamas praised the attack, calling it a response to Israeli military actions, while Israeli leaders condemned it as an act of terror.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's new home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has indicated that the government may suspend visas for countries that do not cooperate with deals to return their own citizens. This potential policy aims to pressure nations into accepting failed asylum seekers and other migrants who have no legal right to be in the UK. The statement comes as the government faces ongoing pressure to reduce the number of people crossing the English Channel in small boats, which has reached over 30,000 this year. The measure is being discussed among the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing nations.</p>

          <p>A new mural by the anonymous street artist Banksy has been discovered on an external wall of the Royal Courts of Justice in London. The artwork depicts a judge in a wig and robe striking a protester who is lying on the ground. Shortly after its appearance, the piece was covered with plastic sheeting and placed under security guard. Banksy confirmed the work as his own on Instagram, and its appearance has sparked public discussion about the right to protest and the role of the judiciary in the UK.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld the $83.3 million jury verdict against Donald Trump for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll. The court rejected Trump's arguments that the damages were excessive and that he should be protected by presidential immunity. The panel of judges ruled that the lower court made no errors and that the damages awarded were fair and reasonable given the facts of the case. This decision marks another significant legal defeat for the former president in the lawsuits brought by Carroll concerning her sexual assault allegations.</p>

          <p>Italian rescue officials have reported a disturbing trend, with more than 100 people having died in the country's mountains since June. This surge in fatalities is being linked to a combination of overcrowded trails and increasingly hazardous conditions caused by climate change. Experts warn that melting glaciers and thawing permafrost are leading to more frequent rockfalls and collapses, making alpine environments more unpredictable and dangerous. Authorities are urging hikers to exercise extreme caution and be prepared for the heightened risks.</p>

          <p>This article provides the current price of gold and explains the key factors that influence its market value. As a traditional safe-haven asset, gold prices are highly sensitive to global economic conditions, inflation rates, geopolitical instability, and supply and demand dynamics. The strength of the U.S. dollar and central bank policies also play a crucial role in its valuation. Investors often turn to gold as a store of value during periods of market uncertainty, which can drive its price higher. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Violent clashes in Nepal have led to the deaths of at least 19 people after youth-led demonstrations against government corruption and a new social media ban. Thousands of protesters, identifying as Generation Z, gathered near parliament in Kathmandu before the situation escalated.
