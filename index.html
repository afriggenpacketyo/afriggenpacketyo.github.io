          <p>Argentine President Javier Milei and U.S. President Donald Trump praised each other during a meeting at the White House, reinforcing their strong alliance. Milei commended Trump for his commitment to global peace, particularly citing the U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The visit also focused on Argentina's pressing financial issues, with discussions centered on securing tariff exemptions and understanding the implementation of a $20 billion U.S. currency swap line. Trump reaffirmed his endorsement of Milei, calling him a "very great leader" and suggesting a free trade agreement is a possibility to help both nations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering a halt to the trade of cooking oil with China as a retaliatory measure against Beijing's refusal to purchase U.S. soybeans. President Trump described China's actions as an "Economically Hostile Act" that harms American farmers and suggested that the U.S. could easily produce its own cooking oil. This threat marks another escalation in the ongoing trade tensions between the two economic powers, which has already caused significant volatility in the stock market. The announcement follows recent threats of massively increased tariffs on other Chinese goods.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the central bank is approaching the end of its program to reduce its bond holdings, a process known as "quantitative tightening." In a speech, Powell noted that rising risks to the labor market are becoming a more significant concern, suggesting that interest rate cuts are being considered to balance employment and inflation goals. He stated that the job market has softened considerably, shifting the balance of risks and increasing the likelihood of policy easing. Financial markets are now anticipating multiple rate cuts before the end of the year.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite flight delays caused by air traffic controller shortages during the U.S. government shutdown, aviation experts assert that air travel remains safe. They explain that delays and ground stops are precautionary measures implemented by the FAA to maintain safety standards, not a sign of compromised safety. While acknowledging traveler inconvenience and the long-term stress on unpaid federal workers, experts emphasize that pilots have the final authority to ground a flight if they perceive any risk. The consensus is that while the risk of delays is higher, safety protocols are not being relaxed.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military has conducted another lethal strike on a vessel off the coast of Venezuela, killing six people alleged to be "narcoterrorists." This marks the fifth such operation since September, bringing the total reported death toll from these strikes to 27. The Trump administration has justified these unprecedented actions as part of an "armed conflict" with drug cartels, viewing traffickers as unlawful combatants. However, the administration has not provided specific details about the individuals killed or the organizations involved, prompting questions from lawmakers and experts about the legality of using military force against criminal groups.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have initiated new, retaliatory port fees on each other's shipping vessels, marking a significant escalation in their ongoing trade war. The move follows China's expansion of rare earths export controls and a threat from President Trump to impose triple-digit tariffs. Both nations are imposing special charges on vessels linked to the other, though China has exempted Chinese-built ships and those entering for repairs. This tit-for-tat measure is expected to disrupt global freight flows and primarily affect major carriers, who are now scrambling to find workarounds to mitigate the financial impact.</p>

Experts advise that borrowers should first fully understand how the specific program, such as debt settlement or consolidation, actually works and what its potential impact on their credit score will be. Secondly, individuals must realistically assess if they can commit to the full program timeline, which often lasts for several years. Finally, it is essential to compare all available options, including negotiating with creditors directly or creating a tighter personal budget. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the outlook is tempered by a warning that the UK will also face the highest rate of inflation in the G7 for both this year and the next. This persistent price pressure is largely attributed to rising energy and utility costs. Despite the positive growth forecast, the UK's economic output per capita is expected to grow only modestly, placing it at the bottom of the G7 in that metric. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>On-location television production in the Los Angeles area experienced a significant downturn in the third quarter, with total shoot days falling by nearly 21% compared to the previous year. According to a report from FilmLA, the decline was primarily driven by a 31.4% drop in reality TV production, a key sector for the region. While TV dramas and pilots also saw decreases, TV comedies were a bright spot with a 41.1% increase in shoot days. The data does not yet reflect the potential impact of California's recently enhanced film and TV tax credit program, which is expected to boost future production.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear a critical case concerning Louisiana's congressional map, which could significantly weaken the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The dispute centers on whether the state's intentional creation of a second majority-Black district to comply with the Act is itself an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. A ruling against the map could undermine Section 2 of the Act, a key provision used for decades to prevent the dilution of minority voting power. The case places the future of race-conscious redistricting in jeopardy and could impact political representation across the nation.</p>

          <p>The Taliban's response to recent devastating earthquakes in Afghanistan has revealed deep internal contradictions regarding the role of women, complicating relief efforts. While some Taliban officials requested that aid agencies send more female health workers to treat female survivors, others simultaneously barred female U.N. staff from accessing the disaster-stricken areas. This inconsistency highlights the ongoing struggle between pragmatic factions trying to govern and hardliners imposing severe restrictions. These conflicting policies, combined with cultural norms, meant many injured women and girls were left without medical care because male rescuers were not permitted to treat them.</p>

He insists the House-passed funding bill contains no partisan items and has kept the House in recess to pressure the Senate into accepting it without changes.

This move represents a significant setback for humanitarian efforts aimed at alleviating famine conditions in the enclave, where hundreds of thousands are in desperate need of food and supplies.
