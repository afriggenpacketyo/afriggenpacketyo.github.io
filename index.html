          <p>Members of the European Parliament denied a request to hold a minute of silence for assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk, citing procedural rules. The request, made by Swedish MEP Charlie Weimers, was supported by right-wing groups but was ultimately rejected by Parliament President Roberta Metsola, who stated such tributes must be formally submitted at the start of a session. The decision sparked protests from some lawmakers, who accused the parliament of hypocrisy by pointing to its past tribute for George Floyd.</p>

          <p>The killing of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk has drawn widespread condemnation from across the U.S. political spectrum, including from President Trump and former presidents Biden, Obama, and Bush. While leaders united in denouncing political violence, the event also highlighted deep partisan tensions, leading to a contentious scene on the House floor during a proposed moment of silence. Many officials used the tragedy to call for a reduction in heated rhetoric and a return to civil discourse to prevent future violence.</p>

          <p>The father of Vadim Kruglov, a Russian man killed at the Burning Man festival, has publicly appealed to President Trump for the FBI to take over the investigation into his son's death. The appeal comes ten days after the killing, with the father expressing frustration over the pace of the local Pershing County Sheriff's investigation. Kruglov, 37, was found dead from an apparent professional knife wound in a crowded area of the festival, and authorities have yet to announce any significant leads.</p>

          <p>Jair Bolsonaro, the former president of Brazil, has been convicted and sentenced to over 27 years in prison for orchestrating a military coup plot intended to keep him in power after his 2022 election loss. The Supreme Court panel also barred him from holding public office until 2033. The verdict has drawn criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump, who called it a "witch hunt," while Brazil's foreign ministry has defended its democracy against what it perceives as external pressure.</p>

          <p>Teaching unions in the UK are raising alarms about an increasing number of children starting primary school without essential skills, such as being toilet-trained or speaking in full sentences. A recent survey of over 1,000 teachers revealed that a significant majority have observed a decline in speech and language abilities among new students over the past two years. Schools are now dedicating more resources to address these developmental gaps, which some experts attribute to social isolation and increased screen time during formative years.</p>

          <p>Child nutritionist Charlotte Stirling-Reed has provided five key tips for parents dealing with fussy eating, a common developmental phase for many children. She advises letting children have autonomy over their food choices, avoiding the practice of labeling foods as "good" or "bad," and focusing on making mealtimes an enjoyable social experience. Additional strategies include being mindful of a child's naturally fluctuating appetite and involving them in food preparation to build familiarity and encourage acceptance of new foods.</p>

          <p>A new large-scale immigration holding facility near Fort Bliss, Texas, is drawing scrutiny for its conditions. Democratic Rep.

The $1.24 billion facility is operated by Acquisition Logistics, a contractor with no public record of running similar detention centers, raising further questions about oversight.</p>

          <p>Ed Sheeran's eighth album, "Play," is presented as a joyful response to a difficult personal period, incorporating Asian and Middle Eastern musical elements into his sound. The article notes collaborations with Indian artists and the use of instruments like the sitar and tabla, reflecting Sheeran's recent tour experiences in India. However, the review suggests that while these influences add new textures, many tracks ultimately retreat to his familiar, commercially successful pop formula, missing an opportunity for a more adventurous artistic direction.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have successfully voted to alter chamber rules in order to accelerate the confirmation process for President Trump's executive branch nominees. This procedural change, often referred to as the "nuclear option," permits non-cabinet level nominees to be considered and confirmed in large batches rather than through individual votes. Senate Majority Leader John Thune stated the change was necessary to overcome Democratic delays, whereas Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized the move as a surrender of legislative power to the executive branch.</p>

          <p>The Original Pantry, a century-old and iconic diner in downtown Los Angeles, is poised to reopen after being acquired by real estate developer Leo Pustilnikov. The purchase was made in collaboration with the hospitality union Unite Here Local 11, which secured an agreement to rehire all 25 union employees who were laid off when the diner closed. The restaurant, famous for its 24-hour service, was abruptly shuttered by its previous owner, the Richard J. Riordan Trust, following a labor dispute earlier in the year.</p>

          <p>In a heartfelt personal tribute, the author mourns the loss of his friend Charlie Kirk, whom he describes as a courageous "public square warrior" and a martyr for the First Amendment. The article posits that Kirk's assassination is a grim symptom of a dangerous decline in civil debate, where violence is increasingly viewed as an acceptable response to speech. The author passionately calls on Americans to honor Kirk's legacy by recommitting to the principles of free speech and engaging in civil discourse to save the republic.</p>

          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby has publicly predicted that Spirit Airlines will go out of business, asserting that the ultra-low-cost carrier model is fundamentally broken and no longer viable. Speaking at an industry conference, Kirby argued that the business model, which relies on low base fares supplemented by numerous fees, is disliked by customers and cannot be sustained. His remarks come after Spirit's recent Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing and as discount carriers face mounting competition from the basic economy offerings of major airlines.</p>

          <p>Wildlife officials in Maine have issued a public warning about the invasive hammerhead worm, a species originally from Asia that preys on vital earthworm populations and can disrupt local ecosystems. This destructive pest, which contains a toxin that can irritate skin, is reportedly spreading north along the East Coast. Authorities are advising the public not to squish or cut the worms, as this causes them to multiply, but to instead capture and either freeze or drown them in soapy water.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike on a Hamas office in Doha, Qatar, has severely strained the long-standing security arrangements between the United States and Persian Gulf nations. The attack, which killed several people, targeted a Hamas delegation during ceasefire negotiations and occurred despite Qatar hosting the group at Washington's request. Gulf leaders, who host major U.S. military bases, expressed outrage, interpreting the strike as evidence that their alliance with the U.S. does not guarantee protection from actions taken by other key U.S. allies.</p>
