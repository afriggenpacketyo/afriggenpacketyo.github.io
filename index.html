          <p>HUD Secretary Scott Turner announced that faith is integral to government operations at the agency's first faith-based disaster recovery event on the National Mall. This event, featuring worship leader Sean Feucht, signals a significant shift in how the federal government engages with Christian organizations, acknowledging their critical role in post-disaster recovery efforts. Turner highlighted that these groups are often the first responders, breathing new life into devastated communities by building homes, converting places of worship into emergency centers, and supporting small businesses. For Feucht, whose "Let Us Worship" movement previously clashed with left-leaning governments over restrictions, this federally recognized gathering marked a dramatic transformation, symbolizing a new era of collaboration between faith-based initiatives and national leadership.</p>

          <p>Aryna Sabalenka clinched her second consecutive US Open title by defeating Amanda Anisimova 6-3, 7-6 (3) in a hard-fought final at Arthur Ashe Stadium. The world No. 1 showcased remarkable composure, overcoming moments of self-doubt and the pressure of previous Grand Slam final losses earlier in 2025. This victory marks her fourth major trophy, all achieved on hard courts, making her the first woman since Serena Williams (2012-14) to secure back-to-back Flushing Meadows titles. Despite a strong challenge from the American eighth seed, Anisimova, and an enthusiastic home crowd, Sabalenka maintained a steadier level, dominating the tie-break to seal her triumph and cement her status as a dominant force in women's tennis.</p>

          <p>Yoshinobu Yamamoto was on the brink of pitching a no-hitter, just one out away from baseball history, when Jackson Holliday hit a home run, shattering the achievement. This pivotal moment led to a devastating 4-3 walk-off loss for the Los Angeles Dodgers against the Baltimore Orioles at Camden Yards. After Yamamoto's departure, the Dodgers' bullpen faltered, with Blake Treinen allowing a run and loading the bases before Emmanuel Rivera delivered a two-run single off Tanner Scott to end the game. The stunning defeat, occurring on the 30th anniversary of Cal Ripken Jr.'s Ironman moment, left the already slumping Dodgers in disbelief, highlighting their recent struggles to close out games.</p>

          <h2>China's Homestay Industry Faces Significant Downturn and Operator Regret</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's private holiday accommodation sector, encompassing homestays and guesthouses, is facing a significant downturn, leaving many operators with regret. A short-lived "revenge travel" boom after the pandemic's easing quickly faded as a surge in new businesses, declining guest spending, and reduced bookings intensified price wars. This rapid boom-and-bust cycle has severely impacted operators like Chen Mei, who is now scaling back her coastal homestay operations. A recent report by Fastdata revealed that nearly 60% of China's over 400,000 homestay businesses, many established within the last three years, regret their investment, despite the sector generating 42.27 billion yuan in revenue, reflecting a deeply pessimistic market outlook.

          <p>Hurricane Kiko, a powerful Category 4 storm with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph, is currently swirling in the Central Pacific and heading west-northwest towards Hawaii. Forecasters warn that significant swells from the hurricane are expected to reach the Hawaiian Islands by Sunday, posing a risk of life-threatening surf and rip currents, especially for Maui and the Big Island. Acting Hawaii Governor Sylvia Luke has already declared a state of emergency, urging residents and visitors to prepare for potential direct impacts, including heavy rainfall and flooding, which are anticipated to begin Monday and intensify by Tuesday.

          <p>Schools across the United States are increasingly adopting Yondr locked magnetic pouches to enforce cellphone bans, aiming to reduce classroom distractions and enhance student engagement. This system, now used by millions of students in 35 states, requires students to secure their phones in a pouch that can only be unlocked at designated school exits. While some students initially resisted or tried to circumvent the pouches, many educators, like Yonkers Middle High School principal Dr. Sandy Hattar, report positive outcomes, including more active student participation and face-to-face conversations. The initiative seeks to create a culture change, allowing students to experience life outside a constant digital realm, despite debates over the cost and implementation challenges.</p>

This colossal sum, with an estimated cash value of $826.4 million before taxes, now ranks as the second-largest in U.S. lottery history, trailing only the world-record $2.04 billion jackpot won in November 2022. This drawing marks the 42nd consecutive one without a jackpot winner, tying the game's record for the longest streak. With odds of 1 in 292.2 million, a single winner could choose between the annuity option or a substantial lump sum payment, fueling widespread excitement across the 45 participating states.

The China-led SCO, a Eurasian institution comprising 10 members including Russia, India, Iran, and Belarus, prioritizes counter-terrorism and economic integration, notably China’s Belt and Road Initiative.

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves' upcoming November Budget will be significantly shaped by recent global market volatility and domestic cabinet reshuffles. Despite a bruising week for the government, Reeves' position appears secure, and initial concerns about surging long-term gilt rates were assuaged as markets stabilized, primarily due to weaker-than-expected US jobs data, indicating global rather than UK-specific issues. However, the fragile bond market still serves as a warning against increased debt. Reeves is expected to advocate for fiscal prudence, suggesting any budget gap will likely be filled by higher taxes or reduced spending, with the Office for Budget Responsibility's assessment of UK productivity being a key factor in determining the extent of these adjustments.

          <p>Postal traffic into the United States has plummeted by over 80% following the Trump administration's decision to end the "de minimis exemption" for low-cost imports. This exemption previously allowed parcels valued at $800 or less to enter the US without customs charges. The Universal Postal Union (UPU) reported an 81% drop in traffic from its 192 member countries since the new rules took effect on August 29, 2025. The disruption stems from airlines and carriers being unwilling or unable to collect the new duties, and foreign postal operators lacking established links to US Customs and Border Protection-approved companies.

          <p>The EU's new digital Entry/Exit System (EES) is set for a gradual introduction this autumn, beginning October 12, aiming to enhance security and streamline travel for non-EU citizens entering and leaving the Schengen Area. This system will replace manual passport stamping, requiring travelers to register biometric information, including fingerprints and photos, at kiosks or with border officers. While intended to make travel smoother, concerns persist about potential long queues, especially at busy hubs like Dover and Eurostar terminals, during the initial registration phase. The EES registration will be valid for three years, with details verified on subsequent trips.</p>

          <p>American AI firm Anthropic's decision to restrict its Claude AI service to entities over 50% owned by companies headquartered in "unsupported regions" like China has created uncertainty for Chinese-backed overseas tech tools.

For example, Singapore-based Trae, an AI-powered code editor by ByteDance for overseas users, which relies on Claude, is now facing user concerns about access and refunds. Other Chinese tech giants, including Alibaba and Tencent, also offer Claude on their international coding agents, putting their operations in limbo amid the escalating tech war.

          <p>Singapore is confronting an existential threat from rapidly rising sea levels, projected to increase by up to 1.15 meters by 2100, potentially reaching 5 meters with extreme weather events. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong emphasized that these are "life and death matters" for the island nation, where 30% of the land is less than 5 meters above sea level. Unlike larger countries, Singapore cannot retreat to higher ground, with critical infrastructure vulnerable along its coasts. In response, the nation is investing billions in coastal defenses, including land reclamation, seawalls, and barriers, alongside global efforts in clean energy and infrastructure modernization to combat human-caused climate change.</p>

This tragic event highlights the danger posed by hippos, which a 2022 study identified as the species most frequently involved in fatal or injurious human interactions in the country. Boat accidents are also common in Ivory Coast due to often overloaded vessels navigating between riverside communities, underscoring the risks of local transport.</p>

San Diego is the prime suspect for a series of bombings in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2003, linked to animal rights extremist groups. Former FBI agents recall "missed opportunities" to arrest him, including a high-speed chase and the discovery of a suspected "bomb-making factory" in his abandoned car.
