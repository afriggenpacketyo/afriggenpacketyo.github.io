          <p>In an article for a prominent Communist Party journal, Chinese President Xi Jinping reiterated his country's commitment to economic globalization and free trade. He criticized the rise of unilateralism, protectionism, and the use of sanctions, framing China as a champion of open markets in contrast to more protectionist international policies. Xi pledged that China would continue to promote trade liberalization and an inclusive global economic system, opposing the creation of trade barriers. This statement was published on the opening day of a major supply chain exposition in the country.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article in the People's Daily, a key state newspaper, has urged China's local governments to utilize their legislative powers as a "propeller" for economic and social development. The piece argues that tailored local laws create a stable and predictable environment, allowing market entities to operate effectively under the rule of law. Since legislative powers were expanded to more cities in 2015, this approach has reportedly shifted governance from relying on top-down orders to using legal frameworks. The article emphasizes that successful local legislation must adapt to the evolving needs of the economy.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Crossbreed Honduran and Floridian Coral to Restore Reefs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 20:58:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Marine scientists are undertaking a novel conservation effort by crossbreeding tough Elkhorn coral from Honduras with Florida's struggling native populations to restore the state's damaged reefs. This initiative, which created a hybrid nicknamed the "Flonduran," is the first time an international cross of corals has been permitted for planting on wild reefs. Over 95% of Florida's Elkhorn coral has been lost due to warming oceans and disease, threatening coastal protection from storm surges. The hope is that the hardier hybrid corals will survive future marine heatwaves and help rebuild the vital reef ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Police in San Bernardino County, California, are investigating the "suspicious disappearance" of 74-year-old Naiping Hou, who was reported missing in May. Investigators suspect he may have been abducted, citing extensive fraudulent activity in his bank accounts and his cell phone being used to impersonate him. Hou's family, who amassed wealth in the cryptocurrency industry, believes the disappearance is linked to their finances and is offering a $250,000 reward for his safe return. Over $1 million was reportedly drained from his accounts and used to purchase gold and cryptocurrency.</p>

          <p>The National Park Service is being questioned for its decision-making regarding a wildfire that destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and over 70 other structures on the North Rim. The fire, ignited by lightning on July 4, was initially allowed to burn for several days under a "confine and contain" strategy for ecological benefit. However, the fire grew explosively due to hot, windy conditions, prompting a late evacuation order and a shift to aggressive suppression. Arizona's governor has called for a federal investigation into why the fire was managed as a controlled burn during peak summer conditions.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicated a rise in U.S. inflation, increasing 2.7% year-over-year in June, the highest level recorded since February. On a monthly basis, the index rose 0.3%, driven by increases in energy, food, and other categories like apparel and medical care. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 2.9% annually. Analysts suggest the data reflects early impacts from tariffs and makes a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in July highly unlikely. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Senate is proceeding with a White House request to cancel $9.4 billion in previously approved funding, primarily targeting foreign aid and public broadcasting. The rescissions package, which must be approved by a Friday deadline, seeks to cut $8.3 billion from USAID and other international programs, and $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The move has faced resistance from some Senate Republicans over cuts to specific programs like PEPFAR, an AIDS relief initiative. The White House later agreed to an amendment sparing the PEPFAR funds to secure enough votes for the measure to advance.</p>

The controversy stems from Bondi's earlier statement that there was no evidence of an Epstein "client list," which angered those in Trump's base who believe in a cover-up of influential figures. Despite recently urging followers to move on from the topic, Trump's new comment comes as key allies like House Speaker Mike Johnson call for more transparency.

This strategy allows them to bolster their reserves without depleting foreign exchange assets like the U.S. dollar, and is often cheaper than buying on the international market. According to the World Gold Council, this trend helps support local mining industries and formalize a sector often linked to illegal activity.

          <h2>Independent Review Recommends Renaming UK Physician Associates to 'Assistants'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 19:02:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that Physician Associates (PAs) and Anaesthesia Associates (AAs) should have their job titles changed to "assistants." The goal is to avoid confusing patients and to clarify that their roles are distinct from doctors, with more limited training. The review, authored by Professor Gillian Leng, also suggests standardized uniforms and badges and states they should not be diagnosing patients. The recommendations follow safety concerns and high-profile cases where patients died after being seen by PAs they believed were fully qualified doctors.</p>

          <p>The iconic Palm House at London's Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, is set for a major £50 million renovation that will require its closure for five years starting in 2027. The project will involve moving 1,300 tropical plants, replacing 16,000 panes of glass, and repairing the historic ironwork, which has been damaged by the hot, humid conditions inside. A key goal of the refurbishment is to make the 175-year-old Victorian glass house more sustainable by replacing its gas boilers with heat pumps to achieve net-zero emissions. Some of the priceless plants are already being carefully prepared for relocation.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned an advertisement for Trip drinks for making unauthorized health claims that its products can "help you feel calm" and reduce stress. The ad for the cucumber, mint, and magnesium drink also referenced "calming" ingredients like L-theanine and ashwagandha. The watchdog ruled that this language implied the drink could treat anxiety, a claim not permitted on the official register for food and supplement marketing. The ASA also found a claim about "0g added sugar" to be inaccurate and ordered the ad not to appear again.</p>

          <p>Julian Smith, a former Conservative government chief whip, has sharply criticized former Prime Minister David Cameron for his handling of the 2016 Brexit referendum. Speaking on a BBC podcast, Smith accused Cameron of treating the vote like "some sort of Eton game" and said it was "unforgivable" to put such a fundamental question to the public without a clear plan for either outcome. He argued that critical issues, such as the Northern Ireland border, should have been foreseen and addressed. Smith, who later served as Northern Ireland Secretary, described the subsequent years of political turmoil as a "pretty disastrous period."</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has ordered the withdrawal of 2,000 of the nearly 4,000 National Guard troops who were federalized and deployed to Los Angeles amid protests over mass immigration sweeps. The deployment was criticized by state and local leaders, including Governor Gavin Newsom and Mayor Karen Bass, as an unnecessary overreach that inflamed tensions. While the Trump administration cited unrest as justification, the troops largely ended up guarding federal buildings. Following the announcement, both Newsom and Bass called for the remaining 2,000 Guard members and 700 Marines to be sent home as well.</p>

Forty-six years later, the court will re-examine whether Kim's actions constituted treasonous insurrection or were, as he claimed, a patriotic act to prevent a bloodbath and restore democracy. Kim, a deeply polarizing figure, shot the authoritarian president he had long served, an act that ended Park's 18-year rule but ushered in another military dictatorship. His family fought for the retrial, arguing he was convicted based on a flawed military trial.</p>

          <p>President Trump has accused Democratic Senator Adam Schiff of committing mortgage fraud, claiming he misrepresented his primary residence to secure cheaper loans. Schiff vehemently denied the allegation, calling it a "baseless attempt at political retribution" and a "smear" intended to distract from the administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. Trump cited a Fannie Mae investigation, but a memo from the agency reviewed by the L.A. Times noted only a "possible occupancy misrepresentation" and did not use the word "fraud." A spokesperson for Schiff stated that all lenders were aware of his two homes.</p>

The White House clarified Trump was merely asking a question, not encouraging attacks, as part of his effort to end the war. This comes as Trump has taken a harder line on Russia, threatening steep tariffs if a truce isn't reached within 50 days.
