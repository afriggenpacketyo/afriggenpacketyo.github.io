          <p>Saudi Aramco's net profit for the first quarter of the year decreased by 5% compared to the same period last year, totaling $26 billion.

The company maintained its base dividend but reduced its performance-linked dividend payout, reflecting ongoing financial pressures amid slowing global demand and trade challenges.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's cuts to USAID funding have had devastating consequences for healthcare in Africa, leading to reduced access to medication, halted programs, and potential loss of life.

This shift aligns with global trends as China commits to halting funding for new coal-fired power plants overseas.

          <p>The art world is mourning the death of Koyo Kouoh, one of its most prominent figures, who was set to become the first African woman to curate the Venice Biennale. Kouoh, who was the curator and executive director of Zeitz MOCAA, was known for her work championing artists of color from Africa and elsewhere. Her death, just days before she was scheduled to announce the theme of the 2026 Biennale, leaves an immense void in the contemporary art world, and the Biennale's organizers have not yet commented on how the event will proceed.</p>

          <p>Wayne Dopson, an Australian business owner, replaced his gas-powered truck with a BYD Shark hybrid pickup, praising its technology, power, and smooth ride. Dopson highlights the low running costs due to his solar panels and the vehicle's ability to power tools on-site. While he appreciates the Shark's features and performance, he is concerned about its resale value due to rapid advancements in EV technology. Dopson believes that more Chinese EV brands in Australia will lead to longer warranty periods and better quality cars, despite some limitations in off-roading capabilities.</p>

          <p>President Trump's suggestion to rename the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Gulf has sparked widespread condemnation from Iranians across the political spectrum. The proposed name change is viewed as an insult to Iranian national identity and history. The move has seemingly united Iranians, who are often divided on many issues, in opposition to Trump's idea. Despite the potential for diplomatic fallout, Trump's administration has not yet clarified its stance, leaving the issue unresolved.</p>

          <p>A trade dispute between the United States and the European Union is focusing on differing food safety standards, particularly concerning hormone-treated beef and acid-washed chicken. While the Trump administration argues that American meat is superior, European officials insist that their stricter regulations on food, health, and safety are non-negotiable. European consumers prioritize hormone-free and grass-fed products, while farmers are concerned about competing with cheaper, less regulated imports. The disagreement highlights a fundamental difference in values and priorities between the two regions.</p>

          <p>Jorgen Boassen, a former bricklayer from Greenland, has become an unlikely political influencer due to his fervent support for President Trump. Despite facing hostility at home for his pro-Trump stance, Boassen's advocacy has gained him contacts in Washington and a role in promoting closer U.S.-Greenland ties. He is now advocating for a security alliance between an independent Greenland and the United States, believing that Denmark has failed to adequately defend the territory.

The owners, facing 145% tariffs on their Chinese-made ducks, found it unsustainable to continue operating in the U.S. and decided to move their business across the border.</p>
