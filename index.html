          <p>India stated it conducted strikes on Pakistan targeting what it called "terror camps" in response to a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that killed two dozen civilians. Pakistan reported casualties and condemned the strikes as an act of war, promising retaliation. The strikes mark an escalation in the long-standing conflict between the two nuclear-armed countries, prompting international concern and calls for de-escalation. The New York Times article highlights the potential for further conflict and the complexities of the Kashmir dispute. </p>

          <p>President Trump plans to announce that the U.S. will officially refer to the Persian Gulf as the Arabian Gulf, aligning with the preference of Arab nations. This decision reverses the long-standing U.S. policy of using the name Persian Gulf, which has been in use since the 16th century, and could strain relations with Iran. The move is expected to be announced during Trump's trip to Saudi Arabia, reflecting his administration's efforts to strengthen ties with Gulf countries. The name of the body of water has become an emotive issue for Iranians who embrace their country’s long history as the Persian Empire.</p>

          <p>China is a top aluminium producer and consumer but lacks the high-quality bauxite needed to make it, relying on imports from Guinea and Australia. A plant in Shanxi province is being upgraded with French technology that will enable it to produce aluminium from China's low-grade ore. The process neutralizes silica and sulphur, meaning high-silica bauxite can be refined using the Bayer method. The French company IB2 signed a 22-year agreement with Chinese firm Liulin Senze Coal & Aluminum to switch over to the technology.</p>
