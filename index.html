          <p>Arsenal has reinforced its defense by signing Piero Hincapie from Bayer Leverkusen on a season-long loan, which includes an option for a permanent transfer for £45 million. The 23-year-old Ecuador international, who was part of Leverkusen's successful Bundesliga and German Cup-winning squad, is manager Mikel Arteta's eighth summer signing. Hincapie's arrival is intended to provide physical presence and tactical flexibility to the Gunners' backline. The move coincides with the loan departures of defender Jakub Kiwior and midfielder Fabio Vieira from the club.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Liverpool's transfer deadline day bid to sign Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi has collapsed despite the clubs agreeing on a fee of at least £35 million. The deal fell through because Palace was unable to secure a suitable replacement before sanctioning the 25-year-old's departure. Guehi had been a key target for Liverpool, who sought to strengthen their defense after conceding numerous goals early in the season. The failure of this transfer forces Liverpool to reassess their defensive options for the remainder of the campaign.</p>

The company stated that this conduct violated its code of conduct, leading to the necessary decision to terminate his employment after just one year in the top role. Philipp Navratil, a long-serving executive within the company and most recently the CEO of Nespresso, has been appointed as the new chief executive. The board emphasized its commitment to upholding Nestlé's strong values and governance.</p>

          <p>Oman has become the latest Gulf state to launch a "golden visa" program, aiming to attract wealthy foreigners, including Americans, by offering residency in exchange for significant investment. To qualify, individuals must invest at least $520,000 in property, bonds, or businesses that contribute to local employment. The program is part of Oman's strategic effort to boost private sector growth and offers perks like fast-track airport services and property ownership in previously restricted areas. Experts note this trend reflects a growing desire among the wealthy for global mobility and financial security.</p>

          <p>Benny Safdie's new film, "The Smashing Machine," features a transformative performance from Dwayne Johnson as pioneering MMA champion Mark Kerr. The drama explores Kerr's personal crisis following his first professional loss, delving into his struggles with substance abuse, relationship turmoil, and existential dread. Johnson, physically altered for the role, portrays the vulnerability beneath the fighter's colossal exterior, particularly in scenes with his girlfriend, played by Emily Blunt. While the film focuses heavily on the fighting world, it offers touching moments of human fragility and a compelling character study.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of nine former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has publicly condemned Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., stating his actions are actively endangering Americans' health. In an op-ed, they cite a series of alarming decisions, including the recent firing of CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez, the gutting of a key vaccine advisory committee, and the cancellation of mRNA vaccine research. The former leaders warn that these moves are dismantling the nation's public health system and leaving the U.S. vulnerable to future pandemics and health threats.</p>

          <p>According to an analysis of federal data, the number of immigrant workers in the United States has decreased by 1.2 million during the first seven months of the Trump administration. This decline is attributed to stricter immigration policies, increased deportations, and a slowdown in the flow of new immigrants. The reduction in the labor force could have significant consequences for sectors heavily reliant on foreign workers, such as agriculture, construction, and services. Economists warn this trend may exacerbate labor shortages and complicate the Federal Reserve's assessment of the job market's health. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European stock markets started the month on a positive note, with the defense sector showing significant gains following a major corporate announcement. The U.K. government confirmed a £10 billion deal for Norway to purchase British-made Type 26 frigates, marking the U.K.'s largest-ever warship export agreement by value. This news sent shares of defense contractor BAE Systems and other related companies higher. Meanwhile, the health-care sector also saw a lift, driven by positive trial data for Novo Nordisk's popular weight-loss drug Wegovy, which showed superior heart disease risk reduction.

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has voiced his support for his deputy, Angela Rayner, who is facing criticism over the purchase of a flat and her tax affairs. Conservative opponents have accused Rayner of hypocrisy for allegedly saving on stamp duty by declaring the property as her main home to tax authorities while telling the local council it was a second home. Starmer defended Rayner as a "great story of British success" from a humble background and dismissed the criticism as a briefing war. A spokesperson for Rayner maintains that she paid all relevant taxes entirely properly.</p>

          <p>A new study analyzing 8,000 years of animal bones has found that human influence began to drastically alter the evolution of animal body sizes during the Middle Ages. Researchers discovered that while wild and domestic species once followed similar size-change cycles, they diverged around 1000 AD. Wild species like deer and foxes began to shrink due to habitat loss and intensified hunting. In contrast, domesticated animals such as sheep, cattle, and chickens grew larger as humans implemented more systematic and specialized selective breeding practices to increase their utility.</p>

          <p>The passionate fan base for the hit romance series "The Summer I Turned Pretty" has become so intense that Prime Video has launched a social media campaign urging viewers to "Start Acting Normal Online." The show's central love triangle has split fans into dueling camps, but enthusiasm has increasingly turned into online hostility and bullying directed at the actors. A psychiatrist interviewed in the article attributes the toxic behavior to parasocial relationships, where fans form one-sided bonds with media figures, and notes that the anonymity of social media can embolden such negative interactions.</p>

This is one of the first instances of a major U.S. company openly citing the political climate under President Trump as a potential threat to its international business.

          <p>ScotRail, Scotland's nationalized rail operator, has permanently eliminated higher-priced peak-time tickets, a move that has significantly reduced fares for commuters on routes like Glasgow to Edinburgh. The decision was made possible by post-pandemic travel patterns, which have left more capacity on trains during traditional rush hours. This initiative has sparked a debate on whether the rest of the UK could adopt a similar model to make train travel more affordable. While passengers welcome cheaper tickets, experts are divided, with some warning of potential overcrowding on busy routes or the need for future price hikes to cover lost revenue.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump overstepped his legal authority by using emergency powers to impose widespread tariffs on most of the country's trading partners. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president unlimited authority to set tariffs, a power constitutionally given to Congress. However, the ruling's immediate effect was stayed to allow the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court. This decision represents a significant legal challenge to one of the cornerstones of Trump's economic and trade policy.</p>
