            <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) exceeded first-quarter profit estimates, reporting a 60% increase driven by high demand for AI chips. The company's net income rose to NT$361.56 billion, with revenue up 41.6% year-over-year. However, TSMC faces challenges due to U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies, including tariffs on Taiwan and export controls on key clients like Nvidia and AMD. TSMC is investing heavily in U.S. facilities, with AMD and Nvidia already planning chip production in Arizona, to mitigate these risks. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The White House is attempting to shift the narrative surrounding deportations, particularly the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador. The administration is facing criticism for its refusal to facilitate Garcia's return, despite a Supreme Court order. Democrats are seizing on the issue, arguing that the administration is creating a constitutional crisis. The White House is also emphasizing the importance of deporting violent criminals to protect American lives.</p>

            <p>Puerto Rico experienced another island-wide power outage, affecting as many as 1.4 million customers. The outage was caused by a system failure and vegetation on a transmission line. Officials estimate it will take two to three days to restore power to 90% of customers. The island's aging power infrastructure has been a persistent problem, leading to frequent outages and high electricity rates.</p>

            <p>Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem has canceled $2.7 million in DHS grants to Harvard University, citing concerns about "anti-American, pro-Hamas ideology" on campus. The university has been ordered to submit visa records by April 30, or risk losing its certification to enroll international students. The move follows President Donald Trump's decision to freeze federal funding to Harvard and request the IRS to revoke its tax-exempt status amid a broader crackdown on campus antisemitism.</p>

The bill includes provisions for guaranteed hours and restrictions on zero-hour contracts, but businesses argue it will discourage hiring and increase administrative costs. The government maintains that the bill will deliver the "biggest upgrade to workers' rights in a generation," but the Office for Budget Responsibility has expressed concerns about its potential negative economic impacts.</p>

Experts agree that environmental factors could play a role, but also acknowledge the impact of the expanding definition of autism. Kennedy's comments have drawn criticism from autism advocacy groups, who argue that they misrepresent the reality of autism.</p>

California will ask the court to immediately block the tariffs, making it the first U.S. state to sue the Trump administration over this issue.</p>
