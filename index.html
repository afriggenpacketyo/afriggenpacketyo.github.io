          <p>Israel has initiated military strikes across Iran, asserting that the operation targets the core of Iran's nuclear program, leading to a declared state of emergency in Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that the operation, named Operation Rising Lion, is a targeted effort to neutralize the Iranian threat to Israel's survival, emphasizing Iran's recent steps towards weaponizing enriched uranium. Iranian state media reported the death of Hossein Salami, chief of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards, and nuclear scientists, while Iran launched approximately 100 drones towards Israel in response. The US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, stated the US was not involved in the strikes and is prioritizing the protection of American forces in the region.</p>

          <p>With one year remaining until the FIFA World Cup 2026, organizers are grappling with numerous logistical challenges, including transportation, security, and visa issues, as the event is set to be hosted across the United States, Mexico, and Canada. The tournament is expected to draw over six million fans and generate a substantial economic impact, but uncertainties surrounding visa processing, especially in light of recent travel bans, are causing concern. Los Angeles, set to host the U.S. team's first match, is working to ensure a positive experience for attendees despite potential disruptions from immigration-related unrest. The FIFA is bearing the financial risks of the tournament, leaving host cities responsible for public services and stadium operations.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland experienced a fourth consecutive night of unrest, with incidents including masonry being thrown at police in Portadown, though at a lower intensity than previous nights. The disturbances initially began in Ballymena following a peaceful protest regarding an alleged sexual assault, resulting in injuries to 41 officers and 15 arrests. Police have described the disorder as "racist thuggery" directed at ethnic minorities and law enforcement, with reports of families hiding in attics during the violence. The Police Service of Northern Ireland has deployed additional officers and received support from Police Scotland to manage the situation.</p>

          <p>Following the imposition of reciprocal tariffs by the United States on imports from China, Beijing has taken measures to help Chinese exporters sell their products domestically, including encouraging the increased use of letters of credit (L/Cs). A letter of credit is a financial tool that serves as a guarantee to the seller that the agreed amount of money, services or goods will be paid by the buyer in time. The domestic version has similar functions, helping to ensure payment security and enhance credit, both major concerns for many Chinese firms. While international L/Cs can only be used in transactions involving physical goods, domestic ones can also be used in the trade in services. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German machinery makers are urging the European Union to implement trade barriers to protect them from Chinese competitors, citing unfair state subsidies and dwindling exports. The Mechanical Engineering Industry Association (VDMA) has published a position paper advocating for countervailing duties on imports from third countries that violate EU anti-dumping or anti-subsidy rules, with a particular focus on China's aggressive export policy. The industry group, representing medium-sized manufacturers, feels that the current conditions do not provide a level playing field and wants governments to intervene. VDMA's president, Bertram Kawlath, stated that Chinese companies are heavily subsidized by the government and sometimes disregard technical regulations.</p>

          <p>Japan is seeking special treatment from the United States regarding tariffs, particularly on automobiles, as U.S. President Donald Trump hinted at a potential increase in import levies on cars. Tokyo's top negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, expressed hope that Japan would receive separate treatment once bilateral negotiations are finalized, differentiating it from other countries. Trump's administration imposed 25 percent tariffs on cars and auto parts earlier this year, with another potential hike posing a significant threat to Japan's automotive industry. Akazawa is scheduled to visit Washington for further talks ahead of a possible meeting between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Trump at the Group of Seven summit in Canada.</p>

Director Kenji Nakamura states that "Mononoke the Movie" consciously incorporates colors with a global audience in mind, recognizing that color perception varies among different ethnicities, the team has made efforts to create colors that are visually appealing to non-Asian viewers as well, such as increasing color saturation.

U.S. benchmark crude oil rose by $5.6, or 8.2%, to $73.61 per barrel, and Brent crude increased by $5.52 to $74.88 per barrel. Market analysts suggest that Asian markets are expected to recover quickly due to their limited exposure to the conflict and growing ties to unaffected Saudi Arabia and the UAE.</p>

Israel claims that Iran was nearing the assembly of nuclear weapons, justifying the strikes as a necessary measure for self-defense. The article suggests that Israel's actions stem from a perceived loss of deterrence against Iran, which had previously been achieved through its network of proxies in the Middle East. The author notes that the attacks carry risks of retaliation but are considered less risky now that Iran's regional influence has diminished.</p>

          <p>India is taking steps to develop its domestic rare earth reserves in response to China's restrictions on rare earth exports, which have caused shortages worldwide. Experts suggest India could become an important alternative to China for partners like the U.S., but it will require significant public and private investment in the sector. The move comes after India's Union Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal called China's export pause a "wake-up call" and an opportunity for India to provide an alternative. China currently dominates the rare earth element market, producing roughly 60% of the world's supply and processing almost 90%.</p>

          <p>Japan's Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya stated that Japan "condemns" Israel's attack on Iran as "escalating the situation," while pledging diplomatic efforts to prevent a further deterioration. Iwaya told a press conference that it is "extremely regrettable" that Israel took military action despite continuing talks between Washington and Tehran toward a peaceful resolution. He demanded that the two countries exercise "utmost restraint." The Japanese government continues to monitor the situation and is urging all parties to prioritize de-escalation and diplomatic solutions.</p>

          <p>An expert with the World Gold Council stated that cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and stablecoins, do not pose a threat to gold's role as a safe-haven investment. John Reade, the senior market strategist and head of research at the association, emphasized that long-term demand for gold remains strong amid concerns over US dollar assets and geopolitical tensions. Reade pointed out that cryptocurrencies tend to move in tandem with equities, unlike gold, which typically acts as a hedge during market volatility. He expressed his wish that proponents of digital assets would stop marketing them as 'gold 2.0', when they clearly have different characteristics.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court granted an administrative stay, temporarily halting the return of the California National Guard to Governor Gavin Newsom's control, which had been ordered earlier by a federal judge. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals set a Zoom hearing for June 17 to further consider the matter, allowing Trump to maintain control of the Guard deployed in response to anti-ICE raids protests in Los Angeles. Newsom expressed disappointment, stating the military belongs on the battlefield, not on city streets, and accusing Trump of authoritarian tendencies.</p>

          <p>Israel has launched a broad attack on Iran, characterizing it as a "preemptive" strike, though the article argues it is more accurately a preventive war. The author distinguishes between preemptive attacks, which thwart imminent threats, and preventive wars, which remove the source of a threat on one's own timetable, carrying moral and practical risks. The article questions whether the Iranian nuclear program posed an imminent enough threat to justify the Israeli action, suggesting the scope of the offensive indicates a goal of regime change. The author concludes that such decisions are laden with immense danger, especially because there is no such thing as utter finality in war.</p>
