          <p>A federal judge dismissed all charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, citing concerns that the case was politically motivated and interfered with his ability to govern.  The Justice Department's request to drop the charges was granted "with prejudice," meaning the case cannot be re-tried.  The dismissal ends months of legal jeopardy for Adams, who maintained his innocence throughout the process.  Judge Ho's ruling acknowledged concerns about a potential bargain but emphasized that he could not compel the DOJ to continue the prosecution.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is planning to reduce the number of routine food and drug inspections due to recent layoffs of support staff.  The cuts, part of broader reductions within the Department of Health and Human Services, will impact administrative and management functions supporting inspectors.  This will likely lead to prioritization of urgent inspections over routine surveillance, potentially delaying some inspections.  The situation raises concerns about the potential impact on food and drug safety.</p>
