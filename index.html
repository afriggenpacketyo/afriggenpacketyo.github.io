          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal made landfall early Sunday near Litchfield Beach, South Carolina, bringing maximum sustained winds of 50 mph. The storm, which had briefly strengthened to 60 mph winds while offshore, began to weaken after moving inland but continued to generate heavy rainfall. The National Hurricane Center maintained tropical storm warnings for coastal areas from South Santee River, South Carolina, to Surf City, North Carolina. Forecasters anticipate Chantal will produce 2 to 4 inches of rain, with localized amounts up to 6 inches, creating a risk of flash flooding across the Carolinas before dissipating by Monday.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, has stated that the government's recent reversal on a £5 billion welfare reform package has made future spending decisions more challenging. This U-turn, prompted by a rebellion among Labour MPs, increases fiscal pressure ahead of the autumn budget and casts doubt on the potential removal of the two-child benefit cap. Phillipson acknowledged that while ministers are exploring all avenues to reduce child poverty, the loss of projected savings means that costly policy changes are now significantly harder to implement.

          <p>Germany's Green Party is undergoing a period of restructuring and self-reflection as it struggles to define its new role in the opposition. Following a sobering election result and the departure of key figures like Robert Habeck and Annalena Baerbock from frontline politics, the party is attempting to reconnect with voters. A new strategy paper aims to shed the perception that the Greens are an out-of-touch party focused on imposing restrictions, a reputation solidified by controversies like the unpopular heating law. The party now aims to listen more closely to public concerns, though it faces personnel shortages, particularly in eastern Germany.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has created a faster and more energy-efficient data sorting system that could help overcome major bottlenecks in artificial intelligence and scientific computing. The new method utilizes memristors, electronic components with memory-like capabilities, to perform 'sort-in-memory' operations, which reduces the data transfer limitations of traditional computer architecture. Published in Nature Electronics, the research details a hardware prototype that demonstrated significant speed and energy efficiency improvements in tasks like route finding. This innovation addresses the critical issue of sorting, a fundamental process that often limits performance in databases, web searches, and AI applications.</p>

          <p>A family in California that voted for Donald Trump, partly due to his stance on deporting criminals, is now expressing shock and regret after the Canadian-born mother was detained by immigration agents. Cynthia Olivera, who was brought to the U.S. without authorization as a child, was taken into custody during an interview for permanent residency and now faces deportation. Her husband, a U.S. citizen, stated they felt "totally blindsided" and now wants his vote back, as they never believed Trump's policies would affect them. Despite having no criminal record and a work permit, Olivera is being held due to a 1999 deportation order.</p>

          <p>Pop superstar Miley Cyrus has revealed that she overcame a long battle with severe stage fright through a powerful treatment called Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy. In recent interviews, Cyrus stated that the therapy "saved my life" and that she has not experienced stage fright since undergoing the treatment. EMDR is an alternative therapy designed to help individuals process unresolved trauma and emotional pain by using bilateral stimulation, such as eye movements, to shift distressing memories from the emotional part of the brain to the logical part. Experts note that the therapy addresses the root causes of performance anxiety, helping to replace negative beliefs with empowering ones.</p>

The tense game saw PSG finish with nine men after two late red cards, but they held on with goals from Desire Doue and a late breakaway by Ousmane Dembele. The quarterfinal, held in Atlanta, drew a large crowd, but the primary takeaway was the disturbing injury to one of football's bright young talents.</p>

This development comes as Germany ramps up border checks with Poland and other neighboring nations to address irregular migration.

          <p>A new report from the German Bundestag reveals that over 1.4 million pensioners in Germany are still working, with nearly 375,000 of them in jobs that constitute more than minor side employment. These figures, dated to the end of 2023, have sparked debate about the adequacy of the country's pension system. Dietmar Bartsch of the Left Party highlighted that Germany's pension level is significantly lower than the EU average, suggesting many older individuals continue to work out of financial necessity rather than choice. He called for a major pension reform, pointing to more generous systems in countries like Austria and the Netherlands.</p>

          <p>A new gene therapy, administered as a single injection, has successfully reversed a form of congenital deafness in a clinical trial, with some participants regaining nearly full hearing within weeks. The study, published in Nature Medicine, involved delivering a healthy copy of the OTOF gene to the inner ear of ten individuals with hearing loss caused by mutations in that gene. All participants showed considerable hearing improvement, with younger children responding best to the treatment. One seven-year-old girl was able to hold daily conversations just four months after the injection. The therapy was found to be safe and well-tolerated, opening new avenues for treating other genetic forms of deafness.</p>

The shoplifter was dealt with through a community resolution, which involved paying for the stolen goods and being banned from the store, but resulted in no criminal conviction. The store owner, Andrew Board, argued this sends the wrong signal and fails to deter future crime, reflecting a national issue where a majority of reported shoplifting offenses go unpunished. Home Office data shows that in 2023/24, police failed to identify a suspect in 56% of shoplifting cases, with only 18% leading to charges.</p>

          <p>Religious orders in Germany are experiencing a sharp decline, leading to the closure of dozens of monasteries and convents each year as membership plummets. The number of convents has fallen by over 40% in a decade, with the population of nuns dropping from over 26,000 in 2004 to under 9,500 in 2024. This trend is forcing orders to sell historic properties, such as the St. Erentraud's Abbey, and relinquish control of social institutions like schools and hospitals. Experts attribute the decline to secularization, smaller family sizes, and increased professional opportunities for women, noting that the closure of these institutions is often a painful process for both the remaining members and their local communities.</p>

          <p>Following a decisive 12-day war with Iran, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is poised to argue that his actions have created a new regional order, potentially heralding a golden age for Israel. This article explores the possibility, noting that the humbling of Iran and its proxies at a lower-than-expected cost has created an opportunity for new alliances with Arab states under the Abraham Accords. However, critics are skeptical whether Netanyahu can translate military victory into lasting peace, as it may require diplomatic engagement and addressing Palestinian aspirations. The analysis suggests Israel is at a crossroads, with the potential to reshape the Middle East or squander its current military dominance.</p>

          <p>A software engineer from India has become a cautionary tale about hustle culture after being publicly exposed for secretly working for several Silicon Valley startups at the same time. Founders from multiple companies, including Playground AI and Antimetal, came forward on social media to confirm they had hired and subsequently fired Soham Parekh upon discovering his multiple employments. In an interview, Parekh admitted to working up to 140 hours a week out of "dire financial circumstances," not greed. The incident has divided the tech community and highlights the growing "overemployed" trend, where remote workers take on multiple jobs to hedge against job market uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Robert Baker, who pleaded no contest to the 2017 murder of beauty executive Fabio Sementilli, has claimed that his former lover and co-defendant, Monica Sementilli, was not involved in the crime. In a jailhouse interview, Baker stated that Monica, Fabio's wife, "did not know" about the murder plot and that he acted alone out of a desire to be with her. This claim comes as Monica Sementilli prepares to stand trial for murder and conspiracy, with prosecutors alleging the two conspired to kill Fabio for financial gain. Baker's statement presents a potential bombshell for the trial, though legal experts are uncertain how a jury would perceive the testimony of a convicted murderer.</p>

          <p>After a dramatic trial, a Los Angeles jury has found Monica Sementilli guilty of murder and conspiracy in the 2017 killing of her husband, celebrity hairstylist Fabio Sementilli. Prosecutors successfully argued that she masterminded the plot with her lover, Robert Baker, to make the murder look like a robbery and collect on a large life insurance policy. Key evidence included surveillance footage of her actions on the day of the murder, her sharing of home security credentials with Baker, and secretly recorded conversations after their arrest. Despite Baker testifying that he acted alone, the jury convicted Monica, who now faces a sentence of life in prison without parole.</p>

          <p>The death toll from catastrophic flooding in central Texas has reached at least 50, including 15 children, as rescue teams continue to search for survivors and victims. The disaster was triggered by torrential rains that caused the Guadalupe River to rise 26 feet in just 45 minutes, devastating communities and a Christian summer camp. As of Sunday, 27 girls from Camp Mystic remained missing, and authorities were scouring the region by air, ground, and water. The extreme weather event has raised questions about the adequacy of flood warnings and the impact of climate change, which is making such intense downpours more common.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from China indicates that genetics play a significant role in shaping the brain's "criticality," the crucial balance between neural excitation and inhibition that enhances information processing capabilities. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, demonstrates that genetic factors influence this balance across various scales, from specific brain regions to large-scale networks. Researchers also established a link between brain criticality and cognitive functions, suggesting a shared genetic foundation for both. These findings position brain criticality as a key biological phenotype, opening new avenues for understanding brain function and dysfunction.</p>

          <p>Chilean tennis player Nicolas Jarry is preparing to face Britain's Cameron Norrie in the fourth round of Wimbledon after what he describes as a "year of battles" with his health. Just over a year ago, Jarry was diagnosed with vestibular neuritis, a condition causing severe vertigo and vision problems, which began when he was ranked in the world's top 20. The condition has led to a significant drop in his ranking and six consecutive first-round Grand Slam exits. His emotional victory to reach this stage at Wimbledon, his favorite tournament, marks a significant moment in his difficult recovery and matches the achievement of his grandfather, who reached the same round in 1974.</p>

          <p>Barry Morphew, who was once charged with the murder of his wife Suzanne Morphew before the case was dropped, has publicly denied any involvement in her 2020 disappearance. In a televised interview alongside his two daughters, Morphew accused Colorado authorities of having "tunnel vision" and wrongfully focusing on him as the sole suspect. Prosecutors dismissed the initial charges last year after a judge excluded key evidence due to discovery violations, though they stated Morphew remains a suspect. He has since filed a $15 million lawsuit against prosecutors and investigators for allegedly violating his constitutional rights, maintaining he has "done nothing wrong."</p>

          <p>A new grand jury indictment against Barry Morphew alleges that his wife Suzanne Morphew's body was moved at least twice after her murder and that her remains contained a potent animal tranquilizer.

The indictment states that analysis of the remains indicated she had decomposed elsewhere before being moved. Furthermore, tests on her bone marrow revealed a mix of chemicals used to tranquilize wildlife, a compound that records show only Barry Morphew had access to in the area at the time of her disappearance.</p>

          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, made his first public appearance on Saturday since the conclusion of the 12-day war with Israel. He attended a religious mourning ceremony in Tehran, ending speculation that he was in seclusion after the conflict. During the war, which saw Israel target Iran's nuclear facilities and military officials, Khamenei had been absent from public view. His appearance, broadcast on state TV, showed him at a mosque under heavy security, though he made no immediate public statement. The war resulted in significant damage to Iran's nuclear program and has led Tehran to suspend cooperation with the UN's atomic watchdog.</p>

The deal involves Abukuma-class destroyer escorts, which have been in service with Japan's navy for over three decades. This transfer of military hardware signifies deepening security cooperation between the two U.S. allies, who both face challenges from Beijing in the South and East China Seas. To comply with Japan's pacifist constitution, the export will be structured as a joint development project, allowing for the installation of equipment requested by the Philippine military, which currently lacks destroyers.</p>

Organizers like Dong Wenxin, an MBA graduate, have capitalized on this trend by arranging weeklong voyages for groups to destinations as far as Japan. The communal environment of a cruise ship, with its shared spaces and numerous activities, provides an appealing alternative to traditional group travel, allowing for social bonding without the logistical challenges of other types of trips.</p>
