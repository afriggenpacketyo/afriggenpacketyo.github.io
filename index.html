          <p>Maurene Comey, a former prosecutor for the Southern District of New York and daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, has filed a lawsuit claiming her termination was politically motivated and unconstitutional. The suit alleges she was fired without cause or due process, suggesting the decision stemmed from her father's contentious relationship with President Donald Trump. Comey, who handled high-profile cases like those involving Jeffrey Epstein and Sean Combs, is seeking reinstatement and back pay. The lawsuit argues that career civil servant prosecutors cannot be fired for perceived political disloyalty.</p>

In just five weeks, the station hired a staff of 50, attracting talent from across the country with its entrepreneurial "startup" energy backed by a major news organization. Anchors and reporters expressed excitement about the community-focused mission and the opportunity to build a new journalistic venture from the ground up. The station will begin with evening newscasts, with plans to expand to a morning show in the future.</p>

          <p>The American Federation of Teachers (AFT) is seeking class action status for its lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging the Department of Education is unlawfully denying borrowers access to loan forgiveness and affordable repayment plans. The complaint highlights a significant backlog, with over a million applications for income-driven repayment plans and tens of thousands for Public Service Loan Forgiveness remaining unprocessed. This delay has left many borrowers, some eligible for forgiveness for months or years, stuck with substantial debt. The lawsuit argues the department is failing to fulfill its statutory obligations to provide congressionally mandated relief. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paul Ovenden, Prime Minister Keir Starmer's director of political strategy, has resigned after sexually explicit and offensive text messages he sent eight years ago regarding MP Diane Abbott were made public. In the messages, Ovenden recounted a graphic conversation about Abbott, which a spokesperson for the prime minister called "appalling and unacceptable." Ovenden apologized for the hurt caused but also noted the "chilling" nature of a private conversation from nearly a decade ago causing such damage. The resignation adds to a series of recent high-profile departures and controversies within the UK government.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old man, Ryder Corral, has been arrested in Phoenix for allegedly vandalizing a memorial for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was recently assassinated. Witnesses reported seeing Corral damaging flowers and mementos outside the headquarters of Turning Point USA, the organization Kirk founded. The incident occurred as Secretary of State Marco Rubio reiterated his commitment to revoking visas for individuals who celebrate Kirk's killing.

          <p>Constance Marten and Mark Gordon have been jailed for 14 years for the gross negligence manslaughter of their infant daughter, Victoria. The couple went on the run to prevent the baby from being taken by social services, leading to a 53-day manhunt. Victoria's decomposed body was eventually found in a shopping bag in an allotment shed in Brighton, having died from hypothermia while the family lived in a tent. The judge noted the couple showed no genuine remorse and had given little thought to the baby's welfare during the trial.</p>

Starmer said the messages revealed a relationship "far different" from what was understood during the appointment process and that they "cut across" the government's stance on violence against women.

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt exceeding $1.21 trillion and average interest rates near 22%, small financial missteps can lead to rapidly growing balances. This article outlines three key mistakes consumers should avoid, including making late payments, which can trigger hefty fees and penalty APRs. Carrying a balance from month to month allows interest to compound daily, significantly increasing the total cost of debt over time. Finally, failing to explore options like 0% balance transfers or debt consolidation loans means missing opportunities to reduce interest rates and pay down principal more effectively.

          <p>President Donald Trump has revived his proposal for publicly traded companies to report their earnings on a semi-annual basis, rather than the current quarterly requirement. In a social media post, Trump argued the change would save money and allow corporate managers to focus on long-term strategy instead of short-term profits, a view shared by some business leaders like Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon. While the move would not require congressional approval, it would need to be passed by the SEC, where Republicans currently hold a majority. Supporters of the current system argue that quarterly reports provide essential transparency and timely information for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

The author points to the case of Andry Hernández Romero, a gay Venezuelan asylum-seeker who was wrongfully detained and deported based on his tattoos, as an example of the policy's dangerous consequences. The essay contends that the ruling allows for a "vibes-first" approach to deportation, where individuals can be targeted based on their appearance, accent, or type of employment.

          <p>A CBS News analysis, using the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) benchmark, has determined that renewable sources like onshore wind and utility-scale solar are the cheapest forms of energy to produce. Even without government subsidies, these renewables are more cost-competitive than fossil fuels like coal and natural gas, or nuclear power. While the initial capital investment for renewables is high, their operational costs are significantly lower because the "fuel" (wind and sun) is free.

The borrowing coincided with the deadline for quarterly corporate tax payments and a large settlement of Treasury securities, which increased the demand for cash. The SRF acts as a backstop to prevent disruptive funding squeezes by allowing banks to exchange eligible collateral, like Treasuries, for overnight cash.

          <p>The health and beauty chain Bodycare, which entered administration earlier this month, has announced the closure of an additional 30 stores, resulting in 235 more job losses. This follows the immediate closure of 32 shops upon the company's collapse, bringing the total number of affected staff to 685. Administrators stated that while there has been interest from potential buyers for some of the 85 remaining stores, it is no longer viable to operate the full portfolio due to rising costs and stock shortages. The company, founded in 1970, has been a familiar presence on UK high streets.</p>

          <p>Police in the Virgin Islands have released previously unseen CCTV footage showing the last known sighting of Sarm Heslop, a British woman who disappeared from her boyfriend's yacht over four years ago. The video shows Heslop and her boyfriend, Ryan Bane, walking on a dock before boarding a dinghy on the night she vanished in March 2021. The case, which police admit is at a "dead end," is the subject of a new BBC documentary. Bane, who has never been formally questioned and is considered the sole person of interest, claimed Heslop likely fell overboard, but inconsistencies in the timeline and his subsequent actions have raised suspicion.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Hamas leaders will not have immunity "wherever they are," refusing to rule out further strikes following a recent controversial attack in Qatar. Speaking alongside U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Netanyahu asserted Israel's right to self-defense beyond its borders and claimed the Qatar strike was carried out "on our own." The attack, which targeted Hamas leaders in a key U.S. ally's territory, drew international criticism. The comments come as Israel continues its military operations in Gaza and faces diplomatic pressure over its settlement expansion in the West Bank.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump commented on the recent beheading of a motel manager in Dallas, allegedly by an employee who was in the country unlawfully. In a social media post, Trump called the crime brutal and stated the suspect, who had a prior criminal history, "should have never been in our Country." He used the high-profile case to emphasize his hardline stance on illegal immigration and crime, vowing that the "time for being soft" is over. The incident is the latest violent crime Trump has seized upon to advocate for his policies of mass deportations and increased law enforcement.</p>

          <p>According to Congressional Budget Office (CBO) Director Phillip Swagel, President Donald Trump's tariffs appear to have contributed more to inflation than initially anticipated. This view contrasts with some Wall Street analyses that have not yet seen significant price hikes materialize from the levies. Swagel also noted that the CBO projects the tariffs will reduce the U.S. budget deficit by $4 trillion over the next decade through increased revenue. The future of the tariff policy remains uncertain, however, as it faces a legal challenge that is set to be heard by the Supreme Court. (not investment advice)</p>

The drill coincides with "Freedom Edge 25," a trilateral air and maritime exercise also involving Japan. These maneuvers are a direct response to North Korea's advancing military capabilities, including recent tests of a new solid-fuel engine for an intercontinental ballistic missile. North Korea has condemned the exercises, with Kim Yo Jong, sister of the nation's leader, warning of "unfavorable consequences."</p>

The exercises are viewed by some as a thinly veiled message to Europe, demonstrating military strength and warning against confrontation with Moscow. The show of force has prompted concern from neighboring countries like Poland, which has closed its border with Belarus.</p>
