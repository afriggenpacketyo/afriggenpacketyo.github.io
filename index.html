          <p>A Brazilian Supreme Court panel convicted former President Jair Bolsonaro of attempting to stage a coup to remain in power after his 2022 electoral defeat, sentencing him to 27 years and three months in prison. This landmark ruling makes Bolsonaro the first former Brazilian president to be convicted of such a crime, though he can still appeal the decision. The verdict has deepened political divisions within Brazil and drawn criticism from U.S. President Trump, who called the conviction a "witch hunt."</p>

          <p>South Africa's highest court has overturned an apartheid-era law, ruling that husbands are now legally permitted to take their wives' family names upon marriage. The Constitutional Court declared the previous law unconstitutional, stating it discriminated based on gender and was a remnant of colonial influence. The case was brought by two couples challenging the Department of Home Affairs, and the government has been given two years to amend the legislation to reflect this progressive change in marital naming conventions.</p>

          <p>Recent significant gains in Chinese stocks are presenting a challenge for regulators as Beijing aims to transform its $12 trillion equity market into a stable source of wealth for households, thereby boosting consumer spending. The government hopes to guide a sustainable bull market, avoiding the volatile boom-and-bust cycles of the past and shifting household assets away from the property market. While volatility may increase as the market transitions, analysts believe the upward trend is not over, testing the government's ability to manage market sentiment effectively.

          <p>Southern Water has banned tanker companies from supplying its water to the Wiltshire estate of American billionaire Stephen Schwarzman after it was revealed the water was used to fill a private lake. The deliveries were made from a neighboring county where a drought order is in effect, sparking outrage among local residents who are currently under a hosepipe ban. While the extraction was technically legal as it was for construction, the water company's managing director called the usage "appalling" and has initiated a review to prevent similar occurrences.</p>

The FBI has recovered the weapon and released images of a person of interest, as the assassination prompts widespread shock and condemnation across the U.S. political spectrum.</p>

          <p>A Scottish couple has finally identified a mystery man who appeared in their wedding photos from four years ago after an appeal on social media went viral. The man, Andrew Hillhouse, revealed he had accidentally attended the wrong wedding after being given the incorrect venue details by his partner. Realizing his mistake only as the bride walked down the aisle, he felt too embarrassed to leave and was even captured in a large group photograph before quietly slipping out to find the correct ceremony two miles away.</p>

          <p>This article argues that President Trump and other conservative figures are creating a misleading narrative by blaming the left for political violence following Charlie Kirk's assassination. While acknowledging that violence can originate from any ideology, the article cites data indicating that far-right extremists have been responsible for the majority of domestic terror attacks in recent decades. It contends that rhetoric from Trump and his allies has often encouraged or excused violence, creating a dangerous political environment that this one-sided framing conveniently ignores.</p>

          <p>Charlie Kirk, the 31-year-old activist who was assassinated, became a pivotal figure in modern conservatism by effectively branding the MAGA movement for a younger generation. Through his organization Turning Point USA, he cultivated a massive following by addressing culture war issues and positioning himself as a relatable, anti-establishment voice for young conservatives who felt silenced on college campuses. His strategic skill and charismatic communication style made him a key ally to President Trump and embedded his ideas and tactics deeply within the Republican Party.</p>

With inflation on an upward trend since April, a portion of a portfolio in gold can provide a buffer against these economic pressures. (not investment advice)</p>
