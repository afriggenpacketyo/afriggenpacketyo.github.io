          <p>Weeks after catastrophic flooding struck Texas Hill Country, the search for victims persists with about 100 people still unaccounted for. The disaster, which claimed at least 135 lives, including 27 at a summer camp, has prompted state lawmakers to review the initial response and consider improving inadequate warning systems. Amid criticism, Governor Greg Abbott and President Trump have defended the handling of the crisis, while legislative committees plan to hear from residents and discuss disaster preparedness. The event has highlighted the region's vulnerability to flash floods and the urgent need for better infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Activist firm Elliott Investment Management has acquired a stake in Global Payments, a payment processing company whose stock has significantly declined. The company's value fell sharply after it announced a poorly received, large-scale acquisition of Worldpay, a move that contradicted prior commitments to shareholders and raised concerns about management's integration capabilities. Elliott's involvement is seen as a potential catalyst for change, aiming to restore investor confidence by reconstituting the board and ensuring accountability. The goal is to improve execution on the Worldpay deal, which could unlock significant value if managed effectively. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At least 20 individuals were injured, seven of them critically, after a car was driven into a crowd in East Hollywood, Los Angeles. The incident occurred in the early morning near a nightclub, with the majority of victims being women waiting to enter the venue. The Los Angeles Fire Department responded with a large-scale operation, transporting all affected individuals to local hospitals. While the cause remains under investigation by the LAPD, authorities noted that one patient was discovered to have a bullet wound, adding complexity to the chaotic scene.</p>

          <p>The Department of Defense has approved the use of Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey and Camp Atterbury in Indiana as temporary facilities for housing illegal immigrants. The decision, part of the Trump administration's broader immigration enforcement strategy, has sparked strong condemnation from New Jersey's Democratic lawmakers. They argue the move militarizes immigration policy, jeopardizes military readiness, and represents an inappropriate use of national defense assets. This action follows the recent passage of legislation allocating substantial funding for expanding immigration detention capabilities across the country.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's leadership is being tested despite his large parliamentary majority, as he faces challenges from his own backbench MPs, economic constraints, and global instability. Recent moves to discipline several MPs for dissent have highlighted internal party tensions, particularly following a contentious welfare vote. Meanwhile, the government grapples with the immense pressure of high national debt, which forces difficult fiscal decisions to maintain market confidence. This analysis suggests that while Starmer is officially in charge, his ability to govern effectively is constrained by these powerful internal and external forces.</p>

          <p>Following a recent heatwave, much of the United Kingdom is under yellow weather warnings for heavy rain and thunderstorms, raising concerns about potential flash flooding. The dry, parched ground is less able to absorb intense rainfall, increasing the risk of surface water runoff and travel disruption across all four nations. While an earlier amber warning for London and the southeast did not result in the feared widespread flooding, authorities remain vigilant.

          <p>The Trump administration is examining potential reasons to dismiss Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, citing costly renovations at the central bank's headquarters as a possible justification. This move follows President Trump's persistent public attacks on Powell for not lowering interest rates, a policy the president believes would offset the economic impact of his tariffs. While a recent Supreme Court decision suggested the Fed chair has special protections from being fired, the administration's actions represent an unprecedented challenge to the central bank's historical independence.

          <p>A New York mayoral candidate's proposal to create city-owned grocery stores to lower food prices faces a significant political challenge from other progressive policies. The plan's goal of affordability would likely be undermined by championed labor policies, such as a near-doubled minimum wage, which would substantially increase operating costs. Furthermore, progressive priorities in food procurement, focusing on environmental sustainability and ethical sourcing over cost, would also drive up prices. The article argues that without clarifying how these conflicting values would be prioritized, the promise of cheaper groceries through a public option remains unconvincing.</p>

Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic, is facing widespread criticism from the scientific community for what they call a "war on science." Recent actions include ousting a panel of vaccine advisers and canceling a key preventive health task force meeting, moves empowered by a Supreme Court decision allowing for mass firings. Experts warn these policies are sowing public distrust in vaccines amid rising measles cases and politicizing science-based policymaking. The administration's actions have prompted protests, lawsuits, and accusations of censorship.</p>

          <p>The concept of a "Gen Z stare," described as a blank look from younger people in response to interaction, has sparked cross-generational debate. While some Zoomers deny its existence, psychologists speculate it may be a result of social development shaped by the internet and pandemic-era isolation, where interactions are more passive. Older generations may interpret this lack of responsive cues as social rejection, but experts suggest it's partly a familiar pattern of older adults complaining about the young. The phenomenon highlights differing social norms and the impact of technology on face-to-face communication.</p>

The city seeks a permanent halt to the practice and reimbursement for affected consumers.

          <p>The Trump administration has shuttered the specialized support service for LGBTQ+ youth within the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, citing a lack of congressionally directed funding. This "Press 3" option connected vulnerable young people, who face a higher risk of suicide, with specifically trained counselors. The move has been condemned by advocacy groups like The Trevor Project and Democratic lawmakers as a cruel, political decision that removes a vital resource. The administration stated the change was necessary to avoid service reductions across the entire 988 network.</p>

          <p>Researchers studying glaciers in the Swiss Alps have discovered a worrying new phenomenon: glaciers are not only melting from the top down but also from the bottom up. Glaciologists have found that air circulating through channels within the ice can excavate large cavities from underneath, accelerating their decline. This process contributed to a recent ice collapse that destroyed an 800-year-old village, highlighting a new and dangerous consequence of rising global temperatures. The finding underscores the urgent need to address climate change and prepare for more destructive extreme weather events.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced the expiration of the interest-free payment pause associated with the now-defunct SAVE student loan plan, effective August 1st. This change means interest will begin accruing again for millions of borrowers who were previously in forbearance. Those transitioning to other legally compliant plans, such as the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan, could see their monthly bills more than double. This is because IBR calculates payments based on a higher percentage of discretionary income, creating a significant financial shock for many households. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Over 100 days since their implementation, President Trump's sweeping tariffs are being evaluated for their economic effects. Analysts note the policy has generated higher-than-expected tax revenue and prompted some companies to pledge new investments in U.S. manufacturing. However, critics caution that these investment promises are long-term and uncertain, while the tariffs have begun to modestly increase consumer prices, risking inflation. With recent announcements of new tariffs on major trade partners, the long-term economic consequences and stability of the policy remain a subject of debate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists have successfully used artificial intelligence to confirm the breeding of the California red-legged frog, a species that had been absent from Southern California for decades. After reintroducing egg masses from Mexico, researchers deployed microphones and a custom AI model to analyze thousands of hours of audio for the frogs' mating calls. The AI successfully detected the male frogs' calls, leading to the discovery of a new egg mass. This success marks a major conservation milestone and showcases how technology can be a powerful tool in wildlife restoration.</p>
