          <p>Hong Kong's market for initial public offerings (IPOs) is experiencing a dramatic rebound, with fundraising volumes reaching their highest point since 2021. This surge is driven by Chinese companies seeking listings, spurred by regulatory support from Beijing, ample market liquidity, and concerns about potential delistings from U.S. exchanges. The city is now positioned to potentially become the world's top listing destination this year, a significant turnaround after several years of lackluster activity. The renewed interest is also fueled by a rally in Chinese tech stocks and mainland investors pouring capital into Hong Kong shares. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A report from the UK's police watchdog found that historical child grooming investigations in Manchester were significantly delayed due to heavily redacted evidence provided by the city council. The inspectorate noted that some pages contained only a few words, making it impossible for police to assess their value. Manchester City Council defended its actions, stating that complex data-sharing rules required the redactions to avoid jeopardizing potential prosecutions. A new, more efficient information-sharing protocol has since been established between the council, police, and prosecutors to prevent future delays.</p>

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Oncology suggests that using a combination of estrogen and progestin for hormone therapy may increase breast cancer risk for menopausal women under 55 who have a uterus. Conversely, the research found that using estrogen alone, which is typically prescribed for women who have had a hysterectomy, actually reduces the risk. This research refines previous understandings from older studies, highlighting how the specific type and timing of hormone therapy are crucial factors. Experts emphasize that this treatment remains highly effective for menopausal symptoms and advise personalized consultation with a doctor.</p>

          <p>A new Pew Research Center study reveals a significant shift in the Latino electorate, with Donald Trump securing 48% of the Latino vote in the 2024 presidential election. This marks a substantial increase from his 36% share in 2020. Political analysts suggest this change is not necessarily an ideological move to conservatism but rather a turn towards populism driven by economic concerns and disillusionment with the Democratic Party. Experts argue that Democrats failed to maintain a working-class agenda and that their progressive stance on border issues created a backlash among some naturalized citizens.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has struck down a Trump administration order that sought to ban people from applying for asylum if they crossed the southern border between official ports of entry. In the ruling, Judge Randolph D. Moss stated that the president does not have the authority to create an alternative immigration system that supplants laws enacted by Congress. The policy, issued on President Trump's first day in office, was challenged by several immigrant rights groups.

          <p>The endangered Southern Resident killer whale population in Washington's Puget Sound, now down to just 73 individuals, is facing a severe threat due to a decline in their primary food source, Chinook salmon. Conservationists are concerned that proposed changes by the Trump administration to the Endangered Species Act could worsen the situation. The proposal aims to change the definition of "harm" to exclude habitat destruction, which would open protected areas to industrial development. This could devastate salmon breeding grounds, further imperiling the orcas and other species like the bald eagle that depend on them.</p>

          <p>Erin Smith, the widow of D.C. police officer Jeffrey Smith, has won a $500,000 wrongful death lawsuit against a man who assaulted her husband during the January 6 Capitol riot. Officer Smith died by suicide nine days after the insurrection, an event his wife says left him deeply traumatized and changed. A jury found that David Walls-Kaufman, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor for his role in the riot, was liable for the assault. Erin Smith called the verdict a relief, validating her fight to prove her husband's injuries led to his death.</p>

          <p>In a jailhouse interview, Robert Baker, who pleaded no contest to the 2017 murder of Fabio Sementilli, claimed his former lover and co-defendant, Monica Sementilli, was not involved in the crime. Baker, who is serving a life sentence, insisted that Monica had no knowledge of the murder plot and that he would have been arrested much sooner if she had found out. This bombshell claim comes ahead of Monica's trial for murder and conspiracy, where her defense team plans to call Baker as a witness. Prosecutors, however, maintain that extensive circumstantial evidence points to a conspiracy between the two.</p>

          <p>A coalition of former federal health officials has warned that proposed budget cuts for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) could have severe negative health consequences for Americans. The proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would slash the CDC's funding by more than half, from $9.3 billion to $4.2 billion. The former officials noted that this would devastate state and local health departments, which receive the majority of their funding from the CDC. They predict that cuts to crucial programs for chronic disease, HIV prevention, and injury prevention will lead to more illness and unnecessary deaths.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has concluded that U.S. airstrikes last month on three of Iran's key nuclear facilities have set back its nuclear program by approximately one to two years. This assessment is more measured than President Trump's claims of complete "obliteration" but suggests significant damage was inflicted, particularly to the centrifuges at the Fordow enrichment site. The analysis comes as Iran has suspended cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), making future verification of its nuclear activities more difficult. The IAEA's head warned that Iran still retains the knowledge to resume enrichment within months.</p>

          <p>After concessions on welfare reform significantly reduced planned savings, UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is facing difficult choices to keep public finances on track. With her fiscal buffer nearly gone, her options include waiting for economic growth to improve, finding new departmental savings, or altering her self-imposed fiscal rules, which she has deemed "non-negotiable." Another possibility is to increase taxes, potentially by extending the current freeze on tax thresholds, which would effectively act as a tax hike for working people. These decisions come as the government prepares for the critical Autumn Budget statement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Deandre Ayton, the former No. 1 overall NBA draft pick, has agreed to sign with the Los Angeles Lakers after securing a contract buyout from the Portland Trail Blazers. Ayton will join LeBron James and Luka Dončić on a one-year deal with a player option for the following season. His arrival addresses a major need for the Lakers, providing a significant defensive presence and a lob threat in the paint that the team has been missing. Over his seven-year career, Ayton has averaged 16.4 points and 10.5 rebounds per game.</p>

          <h2>University of California Bans Student Governments from Enacting Boycotts Against Israel</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-02 18:37:47 EDT</div>

          <p>The University of California has formally banned its student governments and other official university entities from participating in boycotts against Israel. The directive from UC President Michael Drake is a response to a Trump administration policy tying federal research grants to an institution's stance on such boycotts. Drake's letter cites existing university policies on competitive bidding and sound business practices as the basis for the ban. The move has been criticized by some student leaders, who see it as an infringement on student government autonomy, but it does not apply to independent student clubs.</p>

          <h2>Sean 'Diddy' Combs Denied Bail After Conviction on Lesser Charges in Federal Trial</h2>

          <p>A judge has denied bail for Sean "Diddy" Combs after a jury acquitted him of the most serious charges of racketeering and sex trafficking but found him guilty of transporting people to engage in prostitution. Despite being cleared of the charges that carried a potential life sentence, the judge ruled Combs must remain in custody until his sentencing, citing his history of violence. The verdict concluded a nearly two-month federal trial where prosecutors accused the hip-hop mogul of running a criminal enterprise. Combs faces up to 20 years in prison on the conviction.</p>
