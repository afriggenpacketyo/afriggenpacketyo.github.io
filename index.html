          <p>A gunman drove his vehicle into a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan, during a Sunday service, killing at least two people and injuring eight others. The suspect, identified as a 40-year-old military veteran, used an assault rifle and deliberately set a fire within the church before being killed in an exchange of gunfire with responding police officers. Federal and local authorities are investigating the motive for the attack, which has been condemned by state and national officials as a heinous act of violence in a place of worship.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to announce a new Labour government initiative aimed at eliminating long-term youth unemployment. The plan would offer a guaranteed paid work placement to every young person who has been out of work or education for 18 months. Those who refuse the placement without a valid reason could face sanctions, including the loss of their benefits. The policy builds on a previous "youth guarantee" and aims to equip young people with the skills needed for full-time employment, addressing the recent 11-year high in youth unemployment figures.</p>

          <p>Team Europe has secured the Ryder Cup, defeating the United States with a final score of 15-13 at Bethpage Black in New York. The victory was assured when Ireland's Shane Lowry sank a crucial six-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole, marking Europe's 11th win in the last 15 matches. Despite a strong comeback attempt by the American team in the Sunday singles matches, Europe held on to win on U.S. soil for the first time since 2012. The event was marked by a hostile crowd, but European captain Luke Donald guided his team to a significant away victory.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has announced he is ending his campaign for re-election, citing fundraising difficulties and media speculation as undermining his ability to continue. His withdrawal reshapes the race, which now primarily features Democratic frontrunner Zohran Mamdani, independent candidate and former Governor Andrew Cuomo, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Adams' term has been marked by a federal corruption investigation and criticism over his administration's conduct. In his announcement, Adams defended his record and stated he would still fight for the city despite being wrongfully charged in the past.</p>

The article notes that despite changes in leadership over the years, the team has failed to build a winning roster around its star players. With Moreno not expected to sell the team soon, the focus is on whether the organization can develop its young talent and make effective changes to finally break its long-standing cycle of failure.</p>

The plan aims to ensure migrants are contributing to society and is being positioned as a clear alternative to the policies of the Reform UK party.

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to attend a meeting with generals and admirals that was convened on short notice by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The meeting, to be held at Quantico, is unusual in its size and the lack of advance warning given to senior military leaders from around the world. In an interview, President Trump described the gathering as a "nice meeting" intended to boost morale and discuss positive military developments. The purpose of the unprecedented meeting has not been officially detailed, but the president's personal attendance adds to its significance amid a turbulent political climate in Washington.</p>

          <p>Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has urged the Labour Party to have an honest debate about its strategy for defeating the rising challenge from Reform UK. Speaking at a conference fringe event, Burnham warned that the party is in "peril" ahead of the 2026 elections and that simplistic calls for loyalty are insufficient. He criticized the leadership's handling of internal dissent, arguing for a more open climate within the party to discuss its direction. His comments come as Labour leadership aims to draw clear dividing lines with Reform UK, which has been gaining in national opinion polls.</p>

The election is seen as a crucial decision on the country's geopolitical direction, choosing between closer ties with the EU or Russia. President Maia Sandu accused Russia of "massive interference" in the election, a claim countered by her pro-Russian rivals who alleged interference from the West.</p>

The suspect, Glenroy Miller, was arrested and now faces multiple charges, including armed kidnapping and willful injury, and is also being held on an immigration detainer.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has warned that a potential federal government shutdown this week could lead to permanent mass layoffs of government employees. In an interview, Trump stated his administration would "cut a lot of the people that... we're able to cut on a permanent basis," a departure from the typical practice of furloughing workers during a shutdown. The White House has instructed federal agencies to prepare for these potential firings if Congress fails to pass a funding deal by the Tuesday midnight deadline. The threat adds another layer of pressure to the high-stakes negotiations to avert a government shutdown.</p>

          <p>A potential 2028 presidential campaign for Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is generating a wide range of reactions online. Recent polling places her second among potential Democratic nominees, sparking debate about her viability as a national candidate. Supporters view her as a charismatic and intelligent leader who could energize the party, while critics argue she is too divisive for swing voters and that misogyny and racism would be significant obstacles. Some suggest a Senate run would be a more strategic next step, allowing her to build more experience before a future presidential bid.</p>

While experts consider this outcome unlikely in the current scenario due to the distance and strength difference between the two systems, it remains a possibility.
