          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr., 82, has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to the bone, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis came after Mr. Biden reported urinary symptoms, leading to the discovery of a nodule on his prostate. While the cancer is Stage 4, it appears to be hormone-sensitive, allowing for effective management. Mr. Biden and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians, with experts noting that survival rates for similar diagnoses have significantly improved in recent years, with some patients living five, seven, or even ten years or more. The article notes that both President Trump and Vice President Harris issued supportive statements regarding the former president's health. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom and the European Union have reportedly reached an agreement to reset relations after Britain's exit from the European bloc in 2020. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is hosting European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in London for a summit where the deal was finalized. The agreement includes reciprocal access to fishing waters until June 30, 2038, cooperation on energy, and a security and defense partnership. Additionally, both sides will work toward a youth mobility scheme allowing young people to live and work across the continent and will explore the use of e-gates for UK passport holders at European airports. The Trump administration's recent shift toward U.S. isolationism when it comes to global affairs, and particularly those more acutely affecting Europe, such as the war in Ukraine, make the case for an ambitious reset.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Moody's recent downgrade of the United States' credit rating, coupled with concerns about government debt and President Trump's policies, is causing disruption in financial markets. The downgrade was influenced by a bill in Congress that would make the 2017 tax cuts permanent, potentially adding trillions to the federal debt. The move by Moody's means that all three major rating agencies no longer consider the United States qualified for their top credit ratings. The U.S. credit rating downgrade and worries about debt stemming from the tax cut legislation could send further ripple effects through financial markets if they begin to shake the safe-haven status of Treasury bonds.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly seeking a comprehensive "one-stop shopping" deal with South Korea that bundles trade, tariffs, and defense cost-sharing. This approach involves linking defense payments to trade talks, which could potentially damage U.S. credibility with its allies. While South Korean officials have said that defense payments are off the table, the country's two leading presidential candidates have hinted that they are open to discussing a defense cost-sharing agreement. One way South Korea could "pay more" is by investing in its forces and buying more U.S. military equipment.</p>

          <p>Domestic energy prices in the UK are forecast to fall in July, marking the first drop in the regulator Ofgem's price cap for a year. Analysts at Cornwall Insight predict that the bill of a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will fall by Â£129 a year, a drop of nearly 7%. The price cap is based on the cost of each unit of energy, not the total bill, so actual savings will depend on individual consumption.</p>

The imagery shows new tents, warehouses for military vehicles, renovated fighter jet shelters, and ongoing construction at a helicopter base. While these moves don't resemble the buildup before the Ukraine invasion, they reflect Moscow's perception of a threat given that the 830-mile frontier is now NATO's longest line of contact with Russia. The Finns anticipate Russia will redeploy thousands of troops to the border once the high-intensity phase of the Ukraine war ends, potentially tripling the number of Russian troops facing them.</p>

The average rice price has roughly doubled from around the same time last year, partly because of a poor harvest. In a weekend Kyodo News survey, some 87 percent of respondents expressed dissatisfaction with how the government has been coping with soaring rice prices.</p>

While Washington focuses on trade skirmishes, China is investing heavily in cutting-edge technologies and infrastructure. China already leads in multiple industries and is projected to account for nearly half of global manufacturing by 2030. To avoid a future where America is diminished, the U.S. must invest in research, innovation, and global economic ties.</p>
