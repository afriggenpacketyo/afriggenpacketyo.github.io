          <p>Former President Donald Trump has declared a new 30% tariff on all imports from the European Union and Mexico, scheduled to take effect on August 1. The announcement was made in letters to the respective leaders, citing persistent trade deficits with the EU and insufficient border control efforts by Mexico. Trump also warned that any retaliatory tariffs from the trading partners would be met with further increases from the United States. European leaders expressed strong disapproval, with France suggesting the preparation of countermeasures if a deal is not reached.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has subtly countered attacks from the Trump administration by publishing a "Frequently Asked Questions" page about its ongoing $2.5 billion renovation. The move follows criticism from OMB Director Russell Vought, who accused Fed Chair Jerome Powell of mismanagement and called the project an "ostentatious overhaul." The Fed's webpage refutes claims of new VIP dining rooms and explains cost increases were due to unforeseen issues like asbestos. The central bank, which is self-funded, appears to be preparing to defend its independence against mounting political pressure.</p>

          <p>Poland's Iga Swiatek has won her first Wimbledon women's singles championship, defeating American Amanda Anisimova in a decisive 6-0, 6-0 victory. This marked the first "double bagel" in a Wimbledon women's final since 1911, showcasing Swiatek's mastery on a surface where she was not previously considered a specialist. The 24-year-old, who now holds six major titles, expressed that the win felt surreal and that she significantly improved her form on grass throughout the tournament. Anisimova, playing in her first Grand Slam final, acknowledged her opponent's superior performance.</p>

          <p>Despite former President Trump's recent announcements of significant tariffs on major U.S. trading partners, the stock market has shown notable stability, avoiding the panic seen in previous trade disputes. This article suggests that investors have become more accustomed to Trump's negotiating tactics, allowing them to maintain a level-headed approach. Key market drivers, such as the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and a deregulatory environment fostering mergers and acquisitions, are providing a bullish outlook that currently outweighs the concerns over trade rhetoric. This analysis highlights a shift in market sentiment towards focusing on underlying economic and policy drivers. (not investment advice)</p>

The structure, dating to around 4,000 B.C., was found by construction workers and measures 115 feet long, with a smaller companion hall nearby. This find is unique for its architectural sophistication and evidence of communal feasting, suggesting it was a major gathering point for one of Scotland's first farming communities.

The cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why they did it, with the other denying the action, leaving investigators to determine if it was intentional or a highly improbable accident.

          <p>Adolfo Macias, the infamous Ecuadorian drug lord known as "Fito," has consented to be extradited to the United States to face charges of cocaine and weapons smuggling. Macias, head of the powerful "Los Choneros" gang, was recaptured in June after a dramatic prison escape that triggered a wave of gang violence across Ecuador. His escape prompted President Daniel Noboa to declare a state of "internal armed conflict" against the country's powerful drug mafias. Macias's agreement in court marks a significant step, potentially making him the first Ecuadorian extradited under a new law designed to bolster the war on crime.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has fired at least 20 prosecutors and support staff who were involved in former Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigations into Donald Trump, according to sources. This move is part of a broader purge within the Justice Department, with most prosecutors associated with the probes having already been removed by senior leadership. The firings, which have reportedly targeted even junior support staff identified by a "weaponization working group," have caused significant alarm among the DOJ's career workforce. The action is seen as a continuation of the dramatic personnel changes that have marked the Trump presidency.</p>

          <p>A new analysis has ranked the economic strength of all 50 U.S. states, evaluating their preparedness for a potential economic downturn amid recession risks and federal budget cuts. The study considered factors like GDP and job growth, fiscal health, and exposure to a potential trade war. Florida, Texas, and North Carolina were ranked as the top three states with the most resilient economies, credited with strong growth, solid state finances, and diverse business environments. The report highlights how states are actively promoting their economic stability to attract investment during a period of national economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. companies are increasingly using customs-sanctioned Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs) and bonded warehouses to delay or reduce the financial impact of tariffs amid ongoing trade disputes. By importing materials into these zones, companies can store, assemble, or modify products without immediately paying duties, which are only collected when the goods enter U.S. commerce. This strategy, which dates back to the Great Depression, helps preserve cash flow and provides a buffer against tariff volatility. However, a recent executive order by former President Trump has eliminated the "inverted tariff" benefit, increasing costs for manufacturers who rely on this system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An investigation has found that dozens of buildings at Camp Mystic, a Texas summer camp where 27 people died in a recent flood, were removed from a high-risk flood map by FEMA in the years leading up to the tragedy. The camp, located in a region known as "flash flood alley," successfully appealed to have its buildings exempted from the "Special Flood Hazard Area" designation, which would have required flood insurance and stricter building regulations. Experts find it disturbing that a camp responsible for children would seek such exemptions, especially given the obvious risks, which were reportedly underestimated by the official FEMA maps.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Military experts suggest that Russia's recent intensification of missile and drone attacks on Ukraine is part of a broader strategy to break the country's defenses and demoralize its population. Russia has significantly ramped up its domestic drone production, reducing its reliance on foreign suppliers and enabling it to launch massive, swarming attacks. Analysts believe these strikes aim to destroy Ukraine's military-industrial complex and exhaust its air defense systems ahead of a potential summer offensive. To counter this, Ukraine urgently needs more Western investment and advanced weapons systems, such as Patriot missiles, to protect its cities and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Following devastating floods in central Texas, political analysts are examining the Trump administration's approach to federal disaster response. A discussion on "Washington Week With The Atlantic" noted that while former President Trump can be effective at mobilizing resources, his approach often lacks the personal empathy and connection with affected individuals that past presidents have demonstrated. The administration has also shown a preference for scaling back the federal role, relying more heavily on state and local officials to manage recovery efforts. This represents a shift from the traditional model of a highly visible and engaged federal presence during natural disasters.</p>

          <p>Author James Patterson, in a new book and docuseries about the Idaho college murders, claims that Bryan Kohberger believed he could have committed the perfect crime. According to Patterson, Kohberger's "tunnel vision" and panic during the act led him to make a critical error: leaving a knife sheath at the scene, which contained the DNA that ultimately led to his arrest. The book explores Kohberger's background as an awkward and arrogant criminal justice student who struggled socially, particularly with women. Kohberger recently pleaded guilty to the four murders, accepting life sentences to avoid the death penalty.</p>
