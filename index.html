          <p>A federal judge has condemned the Trump administration's termination of immigration records for thousands of foreign students, deeming the process "arbitrary and capricious." The judge, Ana Reyes, questioned the administration's methods after a computer science student from India, Akshar Patel, sued when his SEVIS record was terminated due to a speeding ticket. Reyes highlighted the lack of individualized determination in the mass terminations, expressing concern for the affected students and the financial burden placed on them to seek legal recourse. The judge also noted that the student had already disclosed the speeding ticket in his visa petition.</p>

Trump's remarks signal his administration's intent to defy a Supreme Court order to assist in the man's return.

          <p>Gilead Sciences will pay $202 million to settle claims that it used speaker programs to pay kickbacks to doctors, inducing them to prescribe Gilead's HIV drugs. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan stated that Gilead gave money to doctors in the form of honoraria payments, meals, and travel expenses in exchange for prescribing their drugs. This arrangement violated the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute, leading to false claims for Gilead's drugs to be paid for by federal health-care programs. The settlement resolves a civil lawsuit filed by a physician specializing in HIV/AIDS treatment.</p>

          <p>Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the Conservative Party in Canada, lost his seat in Parliament to a Liberal political neophyte. His embrace of the so-called Freedom Convoy of 2022, a protest against pandemic restrictions, appears to have played a significant role in the defeat. Some voters expressed distrust in Poilievre's ability to deal with President Trump's trade war and his threats to annex Canada. Others grew tired of his style of attack politics and felt he neglected his local constituency.</p>
