          <p>Hashem Abedi, brother of the 2017 Manchester Arena suicide bomber, has been charged with the attempted murder of three prison officers and assault on a fourth. The incident allegedly occurred at HMP Frankland, a high-security prison in County Durham, where Abedi was serving a minimum 55-year sentence for his role in planning the bombing. Abedi, who was reportedly housed in a separation unit, also faces a charge for unauthorized possession of a knife. The attack has prompted an independent review and criticism from victims' families of the original arena bombing.</p>

          <p>Fashion accessories chain Claire's has collapsed into administration in the UK and Ireland, placing 2,150 jobs at risk across its 306 stores in the region. The company, known for its ear-piercing services and a staple for teens in the 2000s, has been struggling with declining sales and intense competition from online retailers like Shein and Temu. While stores will continue trading for now, administrators are exploring options, including a potential sale of the business. This follows the company's bankruptcy filing in the US, where it cited a shift away from physical retail and significant debt.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, mandating improved conditions at an ICE detention facility in Manhattan. The ruling prohibits the use of the facility unless the number of detainees is reduced and essential items like sleeping mats, soap, and toothpaste are provided. This decision followed a lawsuit by the ACLU and other advocates, who presented video evidence of "inhumane" conditions, including detainees sleeping on the floor. The government has denied the allegations of substandard conditions and plans to appeal the order.</p>

The firm, led by former NYSE President Tom Farley, successfully raised $1.1 billion by selling 30 million shares, an increase from the originally planned offering. This move marks Bullish's second attempt to go public and reflects resurgent investor interest in the crypto sector, with major firms like BlackRock and Ark Investment Management showing interest.

          <p>Alaska's capital, Juneau, is experiencing record-breaking floods after an "outburst flood" from the Mendenhall Glacier's Suicide Basin. The Mendenhall River crested at an unprecedented 16.65 feet, surpassing last year's record and forcing some residents to evacuate their homes. This annual event, exacerbated by climate change, occurs when a basin created by a retreating glacier fills with meltwater and breaches an ice dam. Although temporary barriers were installed this year to protect properties, the recurring and intensifying floods highlight a significant and ongoing environmental challenge for the region.</p>

The victim was identified as 33-year-old Tymark Wells, and no arrests have been made. The move to federalize the police, which President Trump stated was to restore safety, has been called a "manufactured intrusion" by the D.C. City Council, who argue that violent crime is at a 30-year low. A reward is being offered for information leading to an arrest in the shooting.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has declared that the state will proceed with drawing new congressional maps, a move he claims will help Democrats regain control of the U.S. House of Representatives. This action is a direct response to Republican-led redistricting efforts in Texas, which could add several GOP seats and impact the balance of power in Congress. The California legislature is expected to release draft maps soon, escalating a partisan battle over redistricting with significant national implications. Newsom framed the announcement as a direct challenge to former President Trump and the Republican party.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a planned summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, many Ukrainians are wary of being excluded from negotiations concerning their country's fate. A recent poll indicates that 76% of Ukrainians reject Russia's "peace plan," and a significant portion also oppose a US-led plan that would involve territorial concessions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned that any decisions made without Ukraine's involvement will not lead to peace. Analysts believe Russia will maintain its maximalist demands, and that any deal struck without Ukrainian and European agreement would be difficult to implement.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department's 2024 human rights reports have been significantly altered under the Trump administration, sparking criticism from former officials and rights groups. The new reports remove entire categories, such as corruption, violence against women, and discrimination against sexual minorities, while also softening language on some dictatorships and adding harsh criticism of democratic allies like Germany. Critics argue the changes abandon internationally accepted definitions and objectivity, replacing them with politically manipulated language. This shift is seen as undermining the reports' credibility and aligning U.S. policy with countries like China and Russia that seek to redefine human rights.</p>

          <p>This article details the case of Bryan Patrick Miller, known locally as the "Zombie Hunter," who was convicted for the violent murders of two young women in Phoenix in the early 1990s. The victims, Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas, were both attacked and killed while on evening bike rides. The case went cold for over two decades until 2014, when investigators used genetic genealogy to link DNA from the crime scenes to the Miller surname. A subsequent undercover operation successfully obtained Miller's DNA, confirming he was the killer and leading to his arrest, trial, and eventual death sentence.</p>

With the Federal Reserve expected to cut rates in the near future, now may be an opportune time to lock in higher annuity payouts, which offer a reliable lifetime income stream. The ideal percentage of a portfolio to allocate to annuities varies based on individual factors like age, risk tolerance, and existing income sources, but experts often suggest a range of 20% to 50%. The decision requires balancing the need for guaranteed income against the desire for investment growth and flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

Wildlife officials have identified the cause as Shope papillomavirus, a virus specific to rabbits that causes wart-like tumors. While the growths can look alarming, leading to nicknames like "zombie rabbits," the virus is not harmful to humans, pets, or other wildlife. The virus is typically spread by biting insects, and in most cases, the tumors do not harm the rabbit unless they obstruct its vision or mouth, often disappearing on their own over time.</p>

          <p>FEWS NET, the U.S. government's Famine Early Warning System Network, is being brought back online after its operations were abruptly stopped by the Trump administration in January. Created in 1985 in response to the Ethiopian famine, the system uses data to predict hunger hot spots up to eight months in advance, allowing aid organizations to prevent food crises. The shutdown created a critical information gap for humanitarian groups worldwide. While the relaunch is seen as a positive step, food security experts remain cautious, questioning the future quality and scope of the system and whether its warnings will be acted upon.</p>

          <p>Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp stated he had a knife pulled on him and was pelted with bottles while visiting a migrant camp in northern France. Philp was in the region to observe the effects of the "illegal migration crisis" and the increasing number of people crossing the English Channel. The incident occurred as he was recounting his observations for a social media video with a journalist. The UK's approach to channel crossings remains a contentious political issue, with the current Labour government focusing on smashing smuggling gangs while the Conservatives criticize the scrapping of their Rwanda deportation plan.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. tariffs are causing significant price increases for imported goods like coffee and specialty teas, placing a heavy burden on small businesses. Coffee prices surged 14.5% year-over-year in July, and retailers are being forced to pass these costs onto consumers. Business owners who import products from countries targeted by tariffs, such as tea from India or packaging from China, have little ability to shift their sourcing and are facing squeezed profit margins. This economic pressure could lead to higher consumer prices and potentially drive smaller, quality-focused brands out of the market entirely. (not investment advice)</p>

A local state of emergency was declared in Hamilton County, and schools were closed as officials dealt with the extensive damage.

          <p>During a recent nationwide power outage in Iraq, residents once again relied on a massive network of private diesel generators for electricity. These generators are a critical part of daily life due to an outdated and insufficient national grid that cannot meet demand, especially during extreme summer heat. While hailed as "heroes" for keeping homes powered, the unregulated, multi-billion dollar generator industry is also a major source of air, noise, and water pollution. This creates a vicious cycle where the solution to power shortages contributes to the environmental degradation and climate change that exacerbate the country's problems.</p>

          <p>Alcohol consumption among American adults has fallen to its lowest point on record, according to a new Gallup survey. The poll found that 54% of Americans report drinking alcohol, down from 62% in 2023. For the first time, a majority of respondents (53%) now view even moderate drinking as harmful to one's health, a significant shift in public perception. This trend is also reflected in drinking frequency, with the average number of drinks per week dropping to 2.8, the lowest since 1996. The decline does not appear to be driven by a shift to other substances like recreational cannabis.</p>

This role is now under threat due to a provision in a recent Trump administration spending package that bans Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid reimbursements. Experts warn that if the ban, currently paused by a court, takes effect, other providers will lack the capacity to absorb these patients, likely leading to reduced access to contraception and other essential services. The move targets the organization over abortion, though federal funds are already prohibited from paying for most abortions.</p>

The federal government contends the deployment was legal under Title 10, claiming the protests constituted a "rebellion" that required military presence to protect federal personnel and property.
