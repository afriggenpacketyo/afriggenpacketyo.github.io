          <p>Japan and the United States are continuing negotiations on tariff issues, aiming to reach an agreement by mid-June, according to Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa. Despite ongoing disagreements, Akazawa expressed optimism about the progress made after talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in Washington. Japan is seeking the removal of additional tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, while proposing joint efforts to strengthen supply chains and expand imports of U.S. farm products. The two countries aim for a mutually beneficial deal during their leaders' meeting at the Group of Seven summit in Canada. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal law enforcement agencies have issued an intelligence bulletin warning of potential threats to Jewish and Israeli institutions and their supporters in the United States. The bulletin, issued by the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, and the National Counterterrorism Center, cites recent attacks in Boulder, Colorado, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania as potential motivators for further violence. The agencies advise security partners to remain vigilant for threats of targeted violence, noting that online messaging promoting violence by foreign terrorist organizations could also influence violent extremists. This alert comes amid ongoing concerns about the Israel-Hamas conflict and its impact on radicalization.</p>

          <p>Alaska Airlines is canceling flights due to tariffs hindering its ability to accept delivery of new aircraft. The airline is delaying the acceptance of two Embraer 175 regional jets to avoid incurring extra tariff-related costs. These tariffs, part of President Trump's trade policies, have disrupted supply chains and increased costs for many businesses. Alaska Airlines will cancel 14 flights a day through the end of July, impacting routes served by its regional subsidiary, Horizon Air, which operates flights in the Pacific Northwest, Alaska, California, and western Canada.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant mistakenly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, has been returned to the U.S. to face federal human smuggling charges. The indictment alleges that Garcia conspired to transport undocumented migrants, including MS-13 members, from Latin American countries to the U.S. between 2016 and 2025. Garcia's attorney argues that his client is not a leader of an international smuggling conspiracy and that the government violated his due process rights. The case sparked controversy after Garcia's initial deportation was acknowledged as an administrative error.</p>

          <p>The ongoing feud between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk presents an "unprecedented" dynamic compared to past Trump disputes, according to political strategist Jacques DeGraff. The conflict escalated after Musk criticized a Trump-backed Republican spending package, leading to threats against Musk's business revenue. DeGraff highlights the implications for both parties, including a significant drop in Tesla stock value. He suggests the split could allow other players to deviate from the party line on the budget package, while GOP strategist Dallas Woodhouse downplays the feud's importance to most Republicans.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Russian truck drivers unknowingly transported platforms used for Ukraine's drone attack on Russian warplanes. The drones were hidden in "mobile houses" with retractable roofs, which were loaded on the trucks and opened remotely. Zelenskyy emphasized that the drivers were unaware of the clandestine equipment and were simply doing their job. He also confirmed that Ukraine's secret services used only their own weapons in the operation.</p>
