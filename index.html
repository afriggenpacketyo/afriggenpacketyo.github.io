          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump did not make significant progress on tariff negotiations during their summit, raising concerns about protecting Japan's auto sector. Ishiba emphasized that any deal should benefit both countries and that ministerial talks would continue. The United States has granted Japan a 90-day reprieve from tariffs, but Ishiba did not confirm whether an extension was discussed. A key sticking point is the 25 percent tariff on autos, a crucial sector for Japan's economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Chinese satellite has achieved a data transfer speed of 1Gbps using a 2-watt laser from a geostationary orbit, five times faster than Starlink. The satellite is parked in stationary orbit more than 60 times higher than Starlink. The team proposed a "groundbreaking" solution: AO-MDR synergy. This achievement could potentially revolutionize satellite communication technology.</p>

          <p>The Environment Agency warns that England faces significant water shortages and requires sustained efforts to reduce demand, including more hosepipe bans and smart water meters. Without action, England will face a daily shortage of over six billion litres by 2055. The agency says customers need to cut their water use by 2.5 billion litres a day by 2055. Population growth, climate change, and the need to reduce water abstraction from rivers are key drivers of the deficit.</p>
