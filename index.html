        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's shipments to the U.S. experienced a 33% plunge in August, while overall exports growth hit a six-month low, influenced by President Trump's policies and reduced frontloading activity by businesses. Imports from the U.S. also saw a decrease of 16% compared to the previous year, according to customs data. Despite relying on alternative markets, the U.S. remains China's largest trading partner on a single-country basis, absorbing $283 billion of Chinese goods this year. Bilateral talks between Beijing and Washington appear to be struggling to reach a breakthrough, and Chinese exporters are facing increased scrutiny over transshipments, potentially impacting exports in the coming months.

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets traded mostly higher on Monday after Japan Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's resignation announcement over the weekend. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 1.5%, and the Topix climbed 1% to a record high, reflecting excitement surrounding potential successors like Koizumi Shinjiro and Takaichi Sanae. The Japanese yen weakened, while Japanese bonds continued to sell off, and government bond yields reached fresh highs. Analysts anticipate a period of uncertainty in Japan as investors consider persistent inflation, tighter monetary policy, and fiscal uncertainty, while potential successor Takaichi is keen on deregulation and not keen on interest rate hikes, is likely the candidate to drive growth.</p>

          <p>President Trump warned foreign companies to obey U.S. immigration laws following the arrest of hundreds of workers, including South Koreans, at a Hyundai-LG battery plant in Georgia. Trump emphasized the importance of hiring and training American workers while still welcoming foreign investment and talent. He acknowledged a potential skill deficiency in the domestic workforce, suggesting a need to bring in experts to train American workers. Seoul stated that negotiations to secure the release of the detained workers had concluded, with plans to fly them home soon, while Hyundai clarified that none of those arrested were its employees.</p>

Trump also signaled the potential for a second phase of sanctions on Moscow, a move supported by Ukrainian President Zelensky, who urged European nations to cease buying Russian energy. Russia launched a significant aerial bombardment on Ukraine, prompting Trump to express dissatisfaction with the situation. Zelensky emphasized the need to halt all energy purchases and deals with Russia to effectively counter Moscow's ability to fund the war.</p>

This finding could revive the idea that Earth was not the only planet to have developed plate tectonics, and it challenges previous assumptions about planetary cooling rates.

          <h2>France Faces Political Deadlock as Another Prime Minister Faces Ouster</h2>

          <p>France's parliament is poised to oust Prime Minister François Bayrou in a vote of confidence, deepening the country's political deadlock. Bayrou initiated the vote himself in an attempt to force politicians to address France's looming debt crisis, but he lacks the necessary support. The political turmoil stems from President Macron's decision to call a snap parliamentary election in 2024, which resulted in a weakened minority government. As political infighting continues, Marine Le Pen's National Rally party gains traction, and speculation rises about potential snap elections.</p>

          <p>Chicago churches are urging calm resistance in response to an expected federal intervention, including a possible National Guard deployment, with President Trump citing the need to fight crime and step up deportations. Churches are working to quell fears about detention and deportation, while also addressing the possibility of increased law enforcement presence. The threat of federal intervention has heightened tensions, particularly in Black and Latino communities where trust in police is already fragile. Clergy are reminding people of their rights when interacting with immigration agents and are preparing for a potential chilling effect on church attendance.</p>

The carousel, a "crown jewel" of the park, has been closed since 2022 and is slated for restoration ahead of the 2028 Olympic Games. The amusement ride features hand-carved horses and is one of the oldest wooden merry-go-rounds in California, designed by Spillman Engineering Corp. The city plans to make significant repairs before reopening the carousel, preserving its historical significance and connection to Walt Disney's legacy.</p>

          <p>Bank of America reports that global investors are diversifying away from US equities for the first time in a decade, driven by a weakening US dollar and expectations of easier Federal Reserve policy. Capital is flowing into Asia, attracted by the artificial intelligence boom and more appealing valuations compared to expensive US stocks. The global AI market is projected to grow significantly, with a substantial portion of the growth expected in the Asia-Pacific region. This shift reflects a strategic reallocation of investments towards Asia's potential for growth and innovation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stargazers across Asia, Europe, and Africa witnessed a “Blood Moon” during a total lunar eclipse, where the moon appears deep red due to the Earth's shadow. The phenomenon occurs when the sun, Earth, and moon align, causing sunlight to be reflected and scattered through the Earth's atmosphere. The red color is due to blue wavelengths of light being more easily dispersed, leaving the red wavelengths to reach the moon. While Asia was best placed to see the total eclipse, the Americas missed out on the event.</p>
