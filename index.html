        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, speaking at the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in Istanbul, denounced the recent American strikes in Iran as "outrageous," holding the U.S. solely responsible for any ensuing consequences. Araghchi accused the U.S. of betraying diplomacy and negotiations, criticizing both the U.S. and Israel for attacking Iran during diplomatic talks. He further stated that President Trump deceived his voters by engaging in "forever wars" and aligning with Israel in attacking Iran. He seemed to dismiss the possibility of further diplomatic engagement for the time being, saying the door to diplomacy should always be open but "this is not the case right now."</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the United States launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, calling it a "spectacular military success." The strikes targeted key nuclear sites in Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan with the objective of destroying Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity and stopping the nuclear threat. Trump warned Iran against retaliation, stating that any such action would be met with greater force. Defense Department officials confirmed that B-2 Spirit bombers were used, and the U.S. has reached out to Iran diplomatically to clarify that regime change is not planned. The United Nation's International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed no increase in off-site radiation levels following the strikes.</p>

          <p>Pentagon officials provided details on the U.S. operation to bomb three nuclear sites in Iran, dubbed "Operation Midnight Hammer," stating it was the "largest B-2 operational strike in U.S. history."

Over 75 precision-guided weapons were used, and initial assessments indicate severe damage to the sites. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the attack "an incredible and overwhelming success" and warned Iran against retaliation.

A Marine Corps veteran, Smith attributed his business acumen to his military experience and created a delivery system based on coordinated air cargo flights centered on a main hub. His company also played a major role in the shift by American business and industry to a greater use of time-sensitive deliveries and less dependence on large inventories and warehouses.</p>

          <p>This article argues that President Trump's policies are driven by a fear of Black culture and its potential to undermine white supremacy. The author contends that Trump's administration has targeted Black arts and cultural institutions, defunding and demoting them, and that these actions are not merely an assault on diversity, equity, and inclusion, but a strategic move to suppress Black cultural power. The Black Arts Movement is highlighted as a historical example of how Black culture can challenge white cultural dominance, and the article suggests that Trump's administration sees Black culture as an enemy because it threatens the mythology of white superiority.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is facing challenges in Sunday's Tokyo assembly election, which is considered a bellwether for the upcoming House of Councillors race. Exit polls indicate that Tomin First no Kai, a regional party established by Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike, is likely to lead among independent voters. The Tokyo assembly election's outcome often influences the national political landscape, reflecting voters' views on key issues such as leadership and economic policy. This year's race features a high number of candidates, and key issues include support for households grappling with inflation and political funding scandals.</p>

          <p>Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) issued a warning to US military bases in the Middle East following overnight US airstrikes on the country's nuclear sites. The IRGC stated that US forces had "de facto put themselves in direct danger" by attacking the peaceful nuclear facilities. They threatened to "use options beyond the understanding" of the aggressor and promised "regrettable responses." The United States has many bases around the Persian Gulf, some located relatively close to Iran, potentially making them targets of retaliation. Around 40,000 members of the US military are currently stationed in the region.</p>
