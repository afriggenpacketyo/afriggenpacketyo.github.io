          <p>OpenAI has announced its nonprofit parent organization will maintain oversight and own a significant equity stake exceeding $100 billion. This structure aims to make the nonprofit one of the world's most well-resourced philanthropic entities while allowing the for-profit arm to continue raising capital. The company also signed a non-binding memorandum with key partner Microsoft to outline the next phase of their collaboration, reaffirming a shared commitment to AI safety. The move comes amid ongoing legal battles with co-founder Elon Musk over the company's transition to a for-profit model.</p>

          <p>The search continues for the suspect who fatally shot conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a Utah Valley University event. Authorities have released images of a "person of interest" and are offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to an arrest. Investigators believe the shooter, described as a college-aged male, used a high-powered rifle from a nearby rooftop before fleeing the campus. The FBI, leading the investigation, has recovered the weapon and other forensic evidence, stating they believe it was a targeted attack.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article critiques the immediate response from former President Trump and other conservatives who blamed "radical left political violence" for Charlie Kirk's assassination. The author argues this narrative is factually inaccurate, pointing to data suggesting far-right extremists have perpetrated the majority of recent domestic terrorist attacks. The piece contends that by ignoring right-wing extremism, including events like the January 6 Capitol assault, Trump is creating a dangerously skewed perception of political violence for political gain. The author contrasts this with Democratic leaders' unequivocal condemnation of the shooting.</p>

          <p>Brazil's former President Jair Bolsonaro has been found guilty of plotting a military coup to remain in power after his 2022 election loss. A majority of Supreme Court justices convicted him on multiple charges, including leading an armed criminal organization and attempting to abolish democratic rule. The plot culminated in the January 8, 2023 storming of government buildings by his supporters, an event the court found he instigated. Bolsonaro, who maintains his innocence, faces a potential prison sentence of over 40 years, pending appeals.</p>

          <p>This article explores the significant political influence of Charlie Kirk, the 31-year-old conservative activist who was assassinated on Wednesday. It traces his rise from a suburban Chicago high school student to the founder of Turning Point USA, a powerful organization that reshaped the Republican Party's appeal to younger generations. The piece details how he became a key ally to Donald Trump, effectively branding the MAGA movement for young audiences and amassing a loyal, cult-like following. His legacy is described as one that has permanently embedded his strategies and socially conservative ideas within the modern GOP.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have successfully implemented a rule change to accelerate the confirmation process for President Trump's sub-cabinet level executive branch nominees. The move, which Democrats warned against as a "nuclear option," allows for groups of nominees to be considered "en bloc," or all at once. Majority Leader John Thune argued the change was necessary to overcome Democratic obstruction and allow the president to assemble his team. The change was finalized after a party-line vote to overrule the chair, lowering the threshold for such procedural changes to a simple majority.</p>

          <p>This article examines the limited earning potential of a traditional savings account, even with a substantial deposit like $10,000. With the national average interest rate at a low 0.39%, a $10,000 deposit would earn less than $40 in a year, failing to keep pace with the current 2.9% inflation rate. The piece suggests that savers are effectively losing purchasing power by using these accounts. It recommends exploring alternatives like high-yield savings accounts or certificates of deposit (CDs) to secure significantly higher returns in the current elevated interest rate environment.

The event occurred just before play was suspended due to weather, and upon resumption, Fitzpatrick was able to take a penalty drop instead of playing a less favorable provisional ball. He believes the strange occurrence ultimately saved him at least one stroke, contributing to his six-under-par score of 66. Fitzpatrick described the situation as a "good result," humorously noting he would have preferred if the thief had just thrown it back onto the fairway.</p>

          <p>The search for the next chair of the Federal Reserve is underway, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent leading the process by meeting with several potential candidates. Recent meetings included former Fed officials Kevin Warsh, Lawrence Lindsey, and James Bullard, who are on President Trump's short list. Bessent is also reportedly pushing for a reform agenda at the central bank, aiming to reduce the size of its massive bond portfolio and lessen its overall economic footprint. The process is occurring amid White House pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates, with a key policy meeting scheduled for next week.</p>

          <p>Average U.S. mortgage rates have fallen for the second consecutive week, reaching their lowest point in nearly a year at 6.35% for a 30-year fixed loan. This decline is attributed to expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut and a cooling 10-year Treasury yield. The article suggests this new, lower-rate environment may present a timely opportunity for prospective homebuyers and homeowners considering a refinance. It advises potential applicants to weigh the risks of waiting for even lower rates against the possibility of them rising again, as has happened in previous cycles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nadine Menendez, wife of former U.S. Senator Bob Menendez, has been sentenced to 54 months in federal prison for her conviction in a high-profile bribery case. She was found guilty of accepting bribes, including cash, gold bars, and a luxury car, in exchange for her husband's political influence. While prosecutors sought a seven-year sentence, the judge considered her ongoing cancer treatments and handed down a sentence "substantially below" federal guidelines. In court, a tearful Nadine Menendez took accountability for her actions, stating she was "wrong about my husband," who is already serving an 11-year sentence for his role.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has detailed the financial structure of a new trade and investment deal with Japan. Under the agreement, Japan will provide $550 billion to fund U.S.-based projects, and the two countries will initially split the profits equally until Japan's investment is fully recouped. After the initial investment is paid back, the profit-sharing model will shift heavily in favor of the U.S., which will receive 90% of future profits. Lutnick stated the deal is designed to boost domestic manufacturing in critical sectors like nuclear power and antibiotics without ultimately costing Japanese taxpayers.</p>

          <p>Oracle's stock fell by 6% on Thursday, pulling back from a record high achieved the previous day. The decline followed an analyst note and a Wall Street Journal report suggesting that the company's massive projected growth is overwhelmingly dependent on a single client: OpenAI. Earlier in the week, Oracle's stock had surged 36% after announcing multi-billion-dollar contracts and forecasting a 14-fold increase in cloud infrastructure revenue by 2030. However, reports that OpenAI accounts for a $300 billion, five-year portion of that growth have tempered investor enthusiasm about the company's client diversity.</p>

          <p>A debate is growing in Germany over whether classic literary works by authors like Goethe should remain central to the high school curriculum. Some students and educators argue that the required reading lists are dominated by "old white men" and lack relevance for a modern, diverse student body. With over 25% of Germany's population having an immigrant background, there are calls to include more contemporary and diverse voices in literature classes. Proponents of the classics, however, argue that these works are essential for understanding history and developing critical thinking, suggesting the focus should be on finding more engaging ways to teach them.</p>
