          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>An Israeli Defense Forces inquiry has concluded that 'professional failures,' including an operational misunderstanding and breach of orders, led to the deaths of 15 emergency workers in Gaza last month. The IDF stated that troops opened fire believing they were facing a threat, identifying six of the casualties as Hamas members, while dismissing claims of summary executions. Despite the findings, a Palestine Red Crescent Society spokeswoman dismissed the report, citing the incident as a justification shifting responsibility to personal error. The IDF will dismiss the deputy commander and reprimand another commanding officer involved in the incident. Optimism Score: 25</p>

            <p>A Boeing 737 MAX jet intended for China's Xiamen Airlines has been returned to Boeing's US production hub due to increased tariffs imposed by both the US and China. The escalating trade war has made the jet, valued at around $55 million, too expensive for the Chinese airline. Beijing is reportedly considering ways to support airlines leasing Boeing jets facing higher costs. Confusion over changing tariffs could leave many aircraft deliveries in limbo, with some airline CEOs saying they would defer delivery of planes rather than pay duties. Optimism Score: 40</p>

            <p>American-style restaurants in Beijing are removing U.S. beef from their menus due to the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China. Retaliatory tariffs have made American beef unaffordable, prompting restaurants to switch to Australian beef. The experience of Home Plate BBQ, a restaurant chain with three branches in China, is being repeated across Beijing. The pork ribs are also being sourced from Canada now. Optimism Score: 50</p>

            <p>Approximately 60,000 Americans are at risk of losing their rental assistance and facing eviction as the Emergency Housing Vouchers program runs out of funding. The program, launched in 2021 to help people fleeing homelessness and domestic violence, is expected to be depleted by the end of next year due to rising rent costs. Congress could decide to add more funding, but the prospect is uncertain. The loss of assistance could push many back onto the streets or into abusive situations. Optimism Score: 20</p>
