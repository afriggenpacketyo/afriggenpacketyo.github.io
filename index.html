          <h2>House Approves $9 Billion in Spending Cuts After Debate on Epstein Files Causes Delay</h2>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives passed a $9 billion spending reduction package, primarily targeting foreign aid and public broadcasting, sending it to the president's desk for signature. The vote, which occurred after a midnight deadline, was delayed for hours due to heated debates surrounding the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Democrats attempted to force a vote on releasing the documents, but Republicans advanced a non-binding resolution instead, allowing the spending cuts bill to proceed. The package represents a significant clawback of previously approved funding. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed the Attorney General to produce grand jury documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein case, a move that followed intense pressure from his supporters. The directive came shortly after Trump threatened to sue The Wall Street Journal for publishing a story about an allegedly "bawdy" birthday letter sent from him to Epstein in 2003. Trump vehemently denied writing the letter, calling it a "fake" and part of a defamatory campaign against him. The dual actions highlight the administration's struggle to control the narrative surrounding the controversial case.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As part of a larger $9 billion rescission, Congress has eliminated $1.1 billion in federal support for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS. Public media leaders warned the move will dismantle civic institutions and could force many local stations, especially in rural and underserved areas, to shut down. Proponents of the cut have criticized the networks for perceived political bias, while opponents argue public broadcasting provides vital services like emergency alerts and educational programming. The decision has sparked intense debate over the role of federally funded media. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has strongly condemned President Donald Trump's threat to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods. Trump has linked the tariffs to legal charges against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, demanding they be dropped. Lula described the move as "unacceptable blackmail" and a grave attack on Brazil's national sovereignty, asserting that no foreign leader would dictate terms to his country. The diplomatic dispute escalates as Trump also posted a letter of sympathy for Bolsonaro, criticizing Brazil's judicial system.</p>

          <p>In this personal essay, the author reflects on turning 35 and the realization that adulthood is a constant process of "winging it" rather than reaching a state of settled certainty. Using the French TV show "Bref" as a bookend to his own journey as an American immigrant in France, he contemplates themes of identity, regret, and connection. The author grapples with finding personal joy and meaning in a life more incredible than he imagined, while simultaneously witnessing a world beset by political turmoil and conflict, ultimately finding hope in the unwritten pages of his future.</p>

          <p>A farmer in China's Anhui province has fulfilled a lifelong dream of invention by constructing his own 7-meter-long submarine. Having managed a riverside dock for years, the man was inspired by a television program in 2014 featuring a submarine. Using 5,000 yuan (about $700), he secretly purchased steel plates, a battery, and an engine to begin construction. His creation has since been seen navigating a local river, drawing stares and admiration from fellow villagers for his ingenuity and determination to build a vessel that could travel underwater.</p>

          <p>Host Stephen Colbert announced that his top-rated late-night program, "The Late Show," will conclude its run next year, with CBS confirming the show will not be replaced.

However, the announcement has sparked skepticism, as it follows shortly after Paramount settled a lawsuit with Donald Trump, a frequent target of Colbert's comedy.

          <p>In response to growing political pressure, President Trump announced he has directed the Attorney General to request the unsealing of grand jury testimony from the Jeffrey Epstein case. The move follows controversy over the administration's previous statements that no "client list" existed and that the case was effectively closed. While some political allies praised the decision as a step toward transparency, critics argue that releasing only the transcripts is insufficient and demand access to FBI interviews, videos, and other evidence. The feasibility of unsealing traditionally secret grand jury records remains uncertain.</p>

The economic outlook is complicated by concerns over potential U.S. tariffs, with President Trump recently stating he does not expect a trade deal with Japan.

          <p>An Israeli shell struck the Holy Family Church, the only Catholic parish in the Gaza Strip, killing at least three people and wounding ten others, including the parish priest. The Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem condemned the targeting of a sacred place sheltering innocent civilians, including children with disabilities. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later issued a statement acknowledging the strike was a mistake caused by "stray ammunition" and expressing deep regret. The incident drew international condemnation, with Pope Leo XIV renewing his call for an immediate ceasefire.</p>

          <p>This article details the ongoing conflict between President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whom Trump has repeatedly criticized for keeping interest rates high. The president recently asked lawmakers about the possibility of firing Powell, a legally untested move that could roil financial markets. The Federal Reserve operates independently to manage inflation and employment, but Trump has been unusually vocal in demanding rate cuts to boost the economy. The dispute also extends to a renovation project at the Fed's headquarters, which the administration has labeled "ostentatious." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Border Patrol agents carried out raids at a Home Depot and other locations in Sacramento, an action seemingly designed to send a political message. A sector chief for the agency recorded a video in front of the state capitol, declaring there is "no such thing as a sanctuary state." The operation, which resulted in 11 arrests, was condemned by the governor's office as a "statewide tirade of illegal racial profiling." The enforcement action occurred despite a recent federal court order blocking agents from using racial profiling in similar raids.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has reversed a previous ban, now authorizing Juul to keep its tobacco- and menthol-flavored e-cigarettes on the U.S. market. The FDA stated that Juul's studies demonstrate its products are less harmful for adult smokers who can benefit from switching completely from traditional cigarettes. The decision, which follows years of controversy blaming Juul for sparking the teen vaping trend, was immediately condemned by anti-tobacco groups. Juul is now one of only two companies permitted to sell menthol-flavored vapes in the country.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna stated his department has "no choice" but to comply with federal judicial warrants seeking the transfer of inmates to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). He distinguished these court-ordered warrants, which he said are for significant crimes like attempted murder or sexual assault, from civil immigration detainers, which the department does not honor. The clarification came after reports of inmates being transferred to ICE, raising concerns in immigrant communities.

          <p>This analysis explores President Trump's announcement that Coca-Cola has agreed to switch from high-fructose corn syrup to "REAL Cane Sugar." The author argues the move is a political gesture aimed at scoring easy points, particularly with health-conscious voters, but offers negligible health benefits as both sweeteners have nearly identical metabolic effects. The article suggests that if the administration were serious about health, it would focus on reducing overall soda consumption rather than swapping one type of sugar for another. The move is framed as part of a pattern of prioritizing headlines over substantive policy.</p>

          <p>A university in Dalian, China, has expelled a female student for allegedly "damaging national dignity" through "improper interactions with foreigners," sparking a significant social media debate. The university's public announcement accused the student of misbehavior that caused a "terrible negative impact," without providing specific details. The incident, linked online to videos posted by a Ukrainian gamer, has led to widespread discussion about misogyny, nationalism, and whether the university overstepped its authority by policing a student's private life and framing it as a matter of national importance.</p>

The potential change follows the recent elimination of the rule requiring passengers to remove shoes during security checks.

          <p>This article reviews several new film releases, led by the horror sequel "I Know What You Did Last Summer." The review finds the new installment to be an improvement on the mediocre 1997 original, with self-aware humor and well-executed action, though it still falls short of being memorable. Also reviewed is Ari Aster's "Eddington," a neo-western set during the 2020 pandemic starring Joaquin Phoenix and Pedro Pascal, which explores political and social divides in a small New Mexico town. The article also covers the bullfighting documentary "Tardes de soledad" and two LGBTQ+ dramas.</p>

          <p>A 16-year-old from Colchester, Essex, has fully immersed himself in the culture and style of the 1940s, an era he fell in love with after learning about the World Wars. The teenager, named Lincoln, dresses exclusively in period clothing, listens to music from the time, and even rides a 1939 bicycle. He developed a passion for the era's sense of community and elegance, and he now works at a 1940s-themed tea room and antiques shop. His family supports his passion, which he sees as a way to honor the sacrifices made during that time.</p>

          <p>A sustained campaign of immigration enforcement raids under the Trump administration is profoundly altering life in Southern California, a region home to over a million undocumented immigrants. The crackdowns have led to widespread fear, causing many to avoid work, school, and public spaces, while some businesses have shuttered and community events have been canceled. The article highlights the chaos and backlash, including protests and the death of a farmworker during a raid.

          <p>An ice core believed to be the oldest ever recovered, potentially dating back 1.5 million years, has arrived at the British Antarctic Survey for analysis. Drilled from deep within the Antarctic ice sheet, the glassy cylinder contains trapped air bubbles, dust, and volcanic ash that hold vital clues about Earth's past climate. Scientists will carefully melt the ice to study these ancient materials, hoping to understand a mysterious shift in the planet's glacial cycles and gain insights into our current era of climate change. The research could revolutionize our understanding of Earth's environmental history.</p>
