          <h2>China Considers Fentanyl Cooperation with U.S. as Trade War Leverage</h2>

          <p>Chinese officials are reportedly considering offering deeper cooperation with the United States on combating fentanyl production and trafficking, potentially sending a high-ranking security official to Washington to initiate trade talks. This New York Times article details how China has historically used its willingness to cooperate on fentanyl as leverage in broader disputes with the U.S., particularly concerning tariffs. While China denies responsibility for the fentanyl crisis, attributing it to U.S. domestic issues, this move could signal a shift towards de-escalation amid growing economic pressures from the ongoing trade war. China hopes that a pledge to address fentanyl concerns will facilitate simultaneous tariff reductions from both governments, providing a face-saving resolution. </p>

The article also touches on various other issues, such as Logan Paul's realization that women are human too, breast cancer becoming less deadly for younger women, and the fact that more than 90% of pilots are still men. </p>

          <p>Anthony Albanese has secured a second consecutive three-year term as Australian prime minister, becoming the first to do so in 21 years, according to this Associated Press article. Opposition leader Peter Dutton conceded defeat in Saturday's election. The Australian Electoral Commission's projections gave Albaneseâ€™s ruling center-left Labor Party 70 seats. Energy policy and inflation have been major issues in the campaign, with both sides agreeing the country faces a cost of living crisis. </p>

          <p>A valuation metric favored by Warren Buffett, comparing the total value of U.S. publicly traded companies to the country's GDP, is signaling that U.S. equities may be attractively priced, according to this Yahoo Finance article (not investment advice). The indicator currently sits around 180%, a level similar to that seen after a sharp selloff last year, preceding a strong market rally. This dip suggests a potential buying opportunity, though critics caution that valuation metrics alone are unreliable for market timing. Investors are closely watching Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting for insights into Buffett's investment strategies. </p>

          <p>A new lawsuit seeks to force the New Jersey state police to allow mitochondrial DNA testing on envelopes used to send ransom notes in the 93-year-old Lindbergh baby kidnapping case, according to this article from The Guardian. Researchers hope that saliva on the stamps and glue could help determine if Bruno Hauptmann acted alone or with others. While the state police cite concerns about damaging the evidence, the plaintiffs argue that scientific access is crucial for historical justice. The article highlights the enduring mystery surrounding the case and the potential for DNA analysis to uncover new information. </p>

          <p>This Guardian article argues that tech billionaires' embrace of Trump and the far right is not a sudden shift, but a return to their right-wing libertarian roots. Their visions of the future, such as colonizing Mars or creating super-intelligent AI, are not just distractions but central to their worldview and linked to dreams of total autocratic control. The article argues that these fantasies allow for visions of total corporate control free of governments, with the tech oligarchs exercising autocratic control over the residents of these space habitats. The article also suggests that the tech billionaires' faith in technological salvation leads them to believe the end of this world, and the advent of a perfect one, is nigh. </p>

Some major bridal brands have started to add tariff surcharges, a percentage-based added cost that's typically shared by bridal boutiques and customers. David's Bridal has sped up moving its production out of China because of tariffs. </p>
