            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., traveled to El Salvador to investigate the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident allegedly affiliated with MS-13, despite a court order prohibiting his removal. Van Hollen emphasized that his trip was about defending the constitutional rights to due process for everyone, not defending Abrego Garcia himself. The senator criticized both the Trump administration and El Salvador's President Bukele for their handling of the case, alleging violations of international law and attempts to deceive the public. Van Hollen met with Abrego Garcia in El Salvador, who recounted his traumatic experience and concerns for his family.</p>

Dakota Kai, Sky's friend and former stablemate, believes that Sky thrives as the underdog and will use this to her advantage. Kai also suggested that Sky wants to prove herself after losing a women’s title match at WrestleMania 40, and she wants to walk out of Allegiant Stadium as champion.</p>

Graffiti reading "trans rights are human rights" was found on a statue of former South African prime minister Jan Smuts.

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen reports that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, mistakenly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, has been moved to a new prison. Abrego Garcia, initially held in the notorious CECOT mega-jail, was reportedly traumatized and fearful. Van Hollen met with Abrego Garcia, who expressed sadness about being imprisoned without having committed any crimes. While conditions are improved in the new facility, Abrego Garcia remains isolated from the outside world. The Supreme Court has ordered the government to facilitate his return, but the White House maintains he will not be allowed back into the U.S.</p>

            <p>Amidst trade tensions and tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan are considering investing in the Alaska LNG project. The project aims to build a pipeline to export Alaskan natural gas to Asia, potentially helping these countries meet trade demands and avoid tariffs. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent highlighted the project's role in trade negotiations, while Taiwan's CPC Corp. has already signed a letter of intent to purchase gas. However, analysts caution about the project's cost, complexity, and potential political risks, suggesting it may require public policy support to become commercially viable.</p>

The report states that six of the casualties were Hamas members, a claim made without providing evidence. The deputy commander involved has been dismissed for providing an incomplete report. The incident occurred in a "hostile combat zone," according to the IDF, and the commander perceived an immediate threat.</p>

            <p>Video of a Chinese army unit training with helicopter crews at sea suggested the kinds of cross-unit coordination and front line coastal support exercises that would be required during a conflict around Taiwan, according to experts. State broadcaster CCTV aired videos and interviews featuring pilots from the 81st Group Army’s aviation brigade, a division under the Central Theatre Command that is tasked with defending the capital Beijing and central regions. The reports on Monday and Wednesday were intended to spotlight the growing capabilities of the first armed helicopter unit of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). It was “surprising” that an infantry-based unit from Yanshan had been taking part in naval drills, a PLA Daily report published on Monday said.</p>

The deportation orders are linked to a protest at Berlin's Free University in October 2024. The individuals claim they have not been given information about charges.

This would strengthen the renminbi's exchange rate and challenge the dominance of the US dollar. It argues that China's manufacturing capabilities support a considerable trade volume with the US, and mandatory use of the renminbi would force the US to buy Chinese currency on a large scale. A rapid appreciation in the renminbi would also signal strong economic fundamentals to global investors.</p>
