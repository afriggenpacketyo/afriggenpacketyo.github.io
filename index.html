          <p>An explosion and subsequent fire at the Devastating Pyrotechnics warehouse in Yolo County, California, have left seven individuals unaccounted for. The blast, which occurred Tuesday evening, also injured two people and ignited grass fires spanning 80 acres. Investigations revealed the facility, linked to a sheriff's lieutenant and a volunteer firefighter, lacked local permits for storing fireworks on the agricultural property. Federal authorities, including the ATF, are now assisting Cal Fire in the investigation as families anxiously await news of their missing loved ones.</p>

          <p>In a campaign-style rally in Des Moines, Iowa, Donald Trump celebrated the passage of his major tax-and-spending bill, calling it a "birthday present for America." He used the event, officially kicking off the nation's 250th-anniversary celebration, to criticize opponents and repeat false claims about the previous election. Trump also announced plans for future anniversary events, including a UFC championship fight on the White House grounds. During the speech, he made a controversial remark using the term "shylocks," which he later claimed he did not know was an antisemitic stereotype.</p>

          <p>Following a significant victory over a former champion, British tennis player Emma Raducanu is preparing to face world number one Aryna Sabalenka at Wimbledon. While Raducanu has shown progress this season, she acknowledges the substantial gap between her and the sport's top players, citing a need for more "weapons" in her game. The article notes that Sabalenka's powerful, aggressive style makes her the favorite, especially on the fast grass courts. Raducanu hopes that playing at home will provide an advantage as she attempts to secure a place in the last 16.</p>

          <p>Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi has admitted to feeling nervous ahead of the band's final farewell performance at Villa Park in their hometown of Birmingham. The concert will feature the original lineup, including Ozzy Osbourne, for the first time in 20 years, though Osbourne's participation will be limited due to health issues. Iommi described the hometown show as a uniquely nerve-wracking experience, even more so than playing for much larger crowds. He confirmed this will be the band's definitive final performance, hoping it will end their legendary career on a high note.</p>

          <p>A strike by bin workers in Birmingham has entered its sixth month, leaving residents to contend with "apocalyptic" piles of uncollected rubbish and a persistent stench. The industrial action, initiated by the Unite union in January over planned role downgrades, has suspended recycling and green waste collections. Residents, including students and the elderly, express frustration over the mounting waste, with some storing recycling in their homes out of principle. Birmingham City Council states it is committed to resolving the dispute, despite having one of the lowest recycling rates in the country.</p>

          <p>India's securities regulator, SEBI, has temporarily barred U.S. trading firm Jane Street Group from its markets, accusing it of extensive market manipulation. The regulator also ordered a freeze of over $566 million in what it claims are illegal gains.

While Jane Street disputes the findings, the regulator's interim order described the firm's behavior as "egregious" and untrustworthy, especially after it ignored a prior advisory from the National Stock Exchange.

          <p>More than 175 Democratic members of Congress are backing a lawsuit filed by the NAACP against the Trump administration's efforts to overhaul the U.S. Department of Education. They filed a legal brief arguing the president lacks the constitutional authority to unilaterally abolish or fundamentally downsize the agency, which was created by Congress. The lawsuit was prompted by measures that have slashed the department's staff and paused billions in congressionally approved education funding. Lawmakers like Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Jamie Raskin contend that these actions illegally undermine public education and violate the separation of powers.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the July Fourth holiday weekend, Los Angeles County public health officials have issued warnings for eight local beaches due to high levels of bacteria. Residents and visitors are advised to avoid swimming, surfing, or any water contact at the specified locations, which include areas at Santa Monica Beach, Mothers Beach, and Catalina Island. The elevated bacteria levels are attributed to street runoff, and officials warn that contact with the contaminated water can cause illness or skin infections. The warnings will remain in effect until subsequent tests show the water is safe.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the Interior Department to develop a strategy for charging foreign visitors higher entrance fees at U.S. national parks. The order, framed as an "America First" policy, aims to fund park improvements while keeping prices lower for American citizens. The administration estimates such a surcharge could generate over $90 million annually. The directive also calls for giving U.S. residents preferential treatment in park access systems, such as lotteries or permitting, and revokes an Obama-era memorandum that promoted diversity and inclusion in the parks.</p>

          <p>On the eve of Independence Day, veterans, military families, and legal scholars have voiced strong opposition to the Trump administration's deployment of troops for law enforcement duties in U.S. cities like Los Angeles. Critics argue the practice violates the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars using federal troops for civilian law enforcement, and pits the military against American citizens. Speakers at a virtual news conference described the mission as inappropriate for troops not trained in de-escalation, creating fatigue and stress for service members and their families while undermining the democratic norms they are sworn to protect.</p>

          <p>New data from the Deportation Data Project reveals that immigrants with no criminal convictions constitute the most rapidly growing group within the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention system. Nearly half of the approximately 56,000 people currently in ICE detention have no criminal record, a figure that has nearly doubled since May. This trend appears to contradict administration claims of focusing on the "worst of the worst" criminals. The analysis suggests a significant shift in enforcement priorities, with many long-term residents who have regularly complied with check-in requirements now being detained and deported.</p>

          <p>Significant staffing shortages within the National Park Service (NPS) are raising safety concerns as the peak summer season begins, with some popular locations like Assateague Island National Seashore operating without lifeguards. Advocacy groups attribute the shortages to a hiring freeze and budget cuts enacted by the Trump administration, which have led to a 24% loss of permanent staff since 2024. While the administration claims public-facing personnel are prioritized, critics argue the "chaos and dysfunction" have left parks understaffed. This jeopardizes visitor safety and the overall experience at America's national parks.</p>
