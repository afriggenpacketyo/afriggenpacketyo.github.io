          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is suing Fox News for defamation, seeking damages of at least $787 million, an amount mirroring the network's settlement with Dominion Voting Systems. The lawsuit, filed in Delaware, alleges that Fox News anchor Jesse Watters falsely claimed Newsom lied about a phone call with former President Donald Trump. The suit contends the network knowingly distorted facts to curry favor with Trump and harm Newsom, a prominent progressive figure. Newsom's legal team has offered to dismiss the suit in exchange for a retraction and an on-air apology from Watters and the network.</p>

          <p>The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, a key inflation gauge for the Federal Reserve, rose to 2.3% year-over-year in May, up from 2.1% in April. Core PCE, which excludes food and energy, also increased to 2.7%. This data indicates that inflation remains persistent and above the Fed's 2% target. The report also showed a slight 0.1% pullback in consumer spending, the first decrease since January, while incomes also fell. Economists suggest the spending dip may be temporary payback after consumers bought goods earlier to get ahead of tariffs, which have so far had only a modest impact on prices.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the Trump administration should aggressively prosecute government officials who leak classified or sensitive information to the press. The author contends that journalists have become too credulous of leakers whose motivations are often partisan, citing a recent CNN report on an Iran strike as an example of manipulated information. The piece suggests that the risk of jail time would deter politically motivated leaks, forcing journalists to be more critical of their sources. This, in turn, would break what the author calls the "deep state to fake news misinformation pipeline" and ultimately improve the quality and reliability of American journalism.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced $30 million in funding for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a private food distribution group. The organization has faced severe criticism from the United Nations and other aid agencies, with one UN official labeling its operations a "death trap" for Palestinians. Reports indicate hundreds of civilians have been killed and thousands wounded by Israeli forces near GHF's distribution hubs. The State Department defended the funding and dismissed criticism as "Hamas propaganda," while other humanitarian groups refuse to work with GHF, calling it an "Israeli-U.S. proxy" that operates in a dangerous and dehumanizing manner.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced that the USNS Harvey Milk, a naval ship named for the assassinated gay rights leader, will be renamed the USNS Oscar V. Peterson. The new namesake is a Navy chief watertender who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroism during World War II. The announcement, made during Pride Month, was framed by Hegseth as a move to take "politics out of ship naming," contrasting it with the previous administration's decision. The renaming has drawn attention as it reverses a tribute to a prominent LGBTQ+ figure in American history.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has upheld a Texas law that mandates pornography websites verify the age of their visitors, a decision with national implications as numerous other states have similar laws. In a 6-3 ruling, the court found the requirement does not violate the First Amendment's free speech protections. Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the majority, argued that states have the authority to prevent children from accessing sexually explicit content, and the law simply requires adults to verify their age to view it. The decision rejects claims from adult entertainment companies that the law unconstitutionally burdens adults' access to protected speech.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has limited the ability of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions, which have previously blocked policies from both Republican and Democratic administrations. The 6-3 ruling came from a case concerning President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship. Writing for the majority, Justice Amy Coney Barrett argued that such universal orders often exceed the authority granted to federal courts by Congress. While the court did not rule on the constitutionality of the birthright citizenship order itself, this decision significantly curtails a tool used to challenge executive actions on a national scale, a move praised by the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has announced it will re-hear arguments in a case concerning Louisiana's new congressional map during its next term. The map, which was redrawn by the state legislature to create a second majority-Black district, is being challenged by a group of voters who claim it constitutes an illegal racial gerrymander. The state had argued the new map was necessary to comply with the Voting Rights Act and was drawn to protect incumbent seats, making it a political, not racial, gerrymander. This postponement leaves the current map with two majority-Black districts in place for now, delaying a final resolution on the contentious issue.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has defended his government's welfare reform package, stating it strikes "the right balance" after he was forced to make significant concessions following a rebellion from his own Labour MPs. The initial plan would have applied stricter criteria for Personal Independence Payment (Pip) benefits to all recipients. However, after facing a likely defeat, the government agreed the new rules would only apply to new claimants, and a planned freeze on a component of Universal Credit was reversed. The U-turn has been criticized by opposition parties for creating a "two-tier" system and could cost an estimated Â£3 billion.</p>

          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren SÃ¡nchez are celebrating their wedding with a lavish, multi-day affair in Venice, Italy, estimated to cost around $50 million. The guest list of approximately 200 people includes a host of celebrities and business leaders like Oprah Winfrey, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Bill Gates. The festivities, which include a black-tie ceremony and a reception at the historic Arsenale complex, have drawn some protests from locals over the use of the city as a playground for the ultra-rich. Guests are being hosted at several of Venice's most luxurious hotels, arriving via private jets and superyachts for the opulent event.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has intensified his public attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whom he appointed, calling him "terrible" and a "very stupid person." The criticism comes as the Trump administration reportedly considers naming a potential successor to Powell well before his term expires in 2026, a move that could undermine the central bank's independence. This political pressure is occurring as the Fed navigates key decisions on interest rates and banking regulations. The uncertainty has impacted markets, with traders increasing bets on rate cuts, reflecting concerns that the Fed's apolitical stance on monetary policy is under threat. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid economic uncertainty, many retirees are exploring annuities for guaranteed income. A $300,000 immediate fixed annuity purchased at age 65 could generate approximately $1,942 per month for a man and $1,861 for a woman, based on current data. The payout difference is due to women's longer average life expectancy. A joint-life annuity for a couple would provide a lower monthly amount, around $1,684, as it covers two lives. These figures are influenced by prevailing interest rates, which are currently favorable, but retirees should consider trade-offs like liquidity and inflation risk before investing.

          <p>In a decision stemming from challenges to a Trump administration birthright citizenship policy, the Supreme Court ruled to limit the use of nationwide injunctions. This analysis suggests the move isn't as sweeping a loss for opponents of the policy as it might appear. Justice Barrett's opinion leaves open the possibility for broad relief, including potentially in this specific case, to provide "complete relief" to plaintiffs like states who would face unworkable "patchwork" systems. While the ruling immediately benefits the Trump administration, it also addresses the practice of "judge shopping" and could benefit future Democratic administrations by creating a more consistent legal standard.</p>

Simultaneously, retailers and manufacturers are shrinking their inventory and reducing the variety of products they import to manage trade uncertainty and potential consumer softness. This dual effect of rising prices on fewer goods suggests a cautious business environment, with supply chain data pointing toward a milder-than-usual peak holiday shopping season.

It explores the broader context of Latinos serving in the U.S. military at high rates while their communities face aggressive immigration enforcement under the Trump administration.

Rutte's compliments and his reference to Trump as "daddy" were seen by some as a strategic, if demeaning, effort to manage the president and secure commitments on defense spending. However, critics, including former Trump officials, argue that such sycophancy does not earn respect but instead signals weakness and fealty.
