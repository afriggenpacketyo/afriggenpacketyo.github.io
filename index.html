          <p>This New York Times article discusses Melania Trump's infrequent presence at the White House since her husband's inauguration, noting she has spent fewer than 14 days there in the past 108 days. The article highlights the unusual absence of the first lady, with many believing she primarily resides in Trump Tower in Manhattan or Mar-a-Lago in Florida. While administration officials claim she visits the White House more often than publicly known, they provide no specific details. The article draws a comparison to Greta Garbo, emphasizing the first lady's reclusive nature.</p>

          <p>CNBC reports that Nvidia shares increased following a report that the Trump administration intends to revise chip trade restrictions known as the "AI diffusion" rule. The rule, proposed during the Biden administration, places countries into tiers with varying restrictions on exporting advanced AI chips. Chipmakers, including Nvidia and AMD, have opposed the rule, with executives expressing concerns about being locked out of the Chinese AI market. AMD CEO Lisa Su emphasized the need for a balance between national security and boosting the American chip industry.</p>

While some hope for a return to the old order after Trump, others advocate for Europe to develop its own security policy.

          <p>CBS News reports that a federal appeals court ordered the Trump administration to comply with a lower court order to transfer Tufts Ph.D. student Rumeysa Ozturk from Louisiana to Vermont. The court rejected the administration's bid for emergency relief in Ozturk's challenge to her detention. The judges said that transferring Ozturk would provide access to legal and medical services and expedite resolution of the matter. Ozturk's lawyers are challenging her arrest and detention as a violation of the First and Fifth Amendments.</p>
