        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite challenges like halted permits under the Trump administration and supply chain issues, the U.S. wind energy industry is experiencing a resurgence through "repowering," which involves upgrading or replacing aging turbines. This trend benefits companies like GE Vernova, Vestas, and Siemens Gamesa, all of which reported revenue increases in 2024. Repowering offers economic advantages, such as avoiding property acquisition costs and increasing electricity output, although public opposition and interconnection limitations remain hurdles. This repowering offers a pathway for delivering more electrons to the grid in a way that sidesteps or at least minimizes some of the challenges associated with all these issues.</p>

          <p>Recent cancellations of data center projects by major tech companies like Microsoft and Amazon have raised concerns about a potential bust in the AI data center boom, however, industry leaders and analysts suggest this is more of a strategic pause than a collapse. Companies are reassessing their spending strategies due to factors like evolving AI technology, geopolitical tensions, and infrastructure limitations, particularly regarding power availability. Demand for data centers remains strong, driven by the increasing adoption of AI and the need for low-latency, high-efficiency facilities, indicating long-term growth in the sector.</p>

          <p>Chinese manufacturers are responding to the impact of U.S. tariffs by pausing production, furloughing employees, and exploring new markets, leading to job losses in key export hubs.

          <p>Director Jon M. Chu voiced concerns about the ethical implications of generative AI training, particularly the unauthorized use of copyrighted Hollywood content. Speaking at the L.A. Times Festival of Books, Chu expressed disappointment with studios for not strongly challenging tech companies' data gathering methods. While acknowledging the potential of AI, he emphasized the importance of human creativity and the industry's role in defining the value of art, rather than allowing algorithms to dictate it.</p>

          <p>Following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the Vatican, President Trump expressed newfound sympathy for Zelenskyy and criticized Russia's continued attacks. Trump stated his desire for a Russia-Ukraine deal within two weeks and claimed progress in trade talks with China, though Chinese officials have denied these talks are taking place. The meeting appears to have softened Trump's stance toward Zelenskyy, who he now sees as "calmer" and wanting to make a deal.</p>
