          <p>The Trump administration has mandated that Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico dissolve their joint venture by January 1st, citing anticompetitive effects that harm consumers. The partnership, which began in 2016, allowed the airlines to coordinate flights and pricing between the U.S. and Mexico. Both airlines expressed disappointment, with Delta warning of significant harm to U.S. jobs and consumers, while noting the decision does not affect its 20% equity stake in Aeromexico.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive investigation into the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University has led to the arrest of 22-year-old Tyler Robinson. Officials described the incident as a "targeted attack" and have recovered a high-powered rifle believed to be the weapon used, along with bullet casings bearing inscriptions. The suspect, who was not a student at the university, was reportedly apprehended after his father recognized him in photos released by law enforcement and urged him to surrender.</p>

          <p>President Trump's administration is facing questions over its response to political violence, particularly after the president ordered flags lowered for conservative activist Charlie Kirk but initially claimed unfamiliarity with the assassination of Minnesota's Democratic House Speaker, Melissa Hortman. The article highlights how Trump and his allies have focused blame for political violence on the "radical left," while largely ignoring attacks targeting Democrats. This selective focus underscores the deep partisan divisions in reacting to politically motivated attacks.</p>

A key principle is to prioritize quality over quantity by keeping items that are genuinely uplifting, and to distinguish between true sentimental value and simple nostalgia for the past.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel is facing criticism for his active and sometimes premature use of social media during the investigation into Charlie Kirk's assassination. Patel posted that a suspect was in custody, only to backtrack hours later when that individual was released, a move that starkly contrasts with the traditionally cautious communication style of the FBI. While Patel defended his actions as a form of transparency, critics and former agents argue that real-time updates on a sensitive, fast-moving case risk compromising the investigation and represent an inappropriate focus on public relations.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military conducted a second strike in international waters against a boat allegedly operated by Venezuelan "narcoterrorists," killing three individuals. The president warned that anyone transporting illicit drugs will be hunted down, citing bags of cocaine and fentanyl found in the water as proof of the boat's cargo. This action occurs amid escalating tensions with Venezuela, as the U.S. increases its military presence in the Caribbean and accuses Nicolás Maduro's government of collaborating with drug cartels.</p>

A witness reported seeing the suspect waiting outside the store, suggesting the attack was planned rather than random.

Speaking at a USC event, Schwarzenegger argued that the proposal, intended to counter Republican gerrymandering in other states, undermines the democratic principles of the independent redistricting commission he helped create. He warned that trying to fight political opponents by adopting their tactics is a dangerous path, stating, "we have to fight Trump, [yet] we become Trump."</p>

          <p>President Trump's second state visit to the United Kingdom is surrounded by potential diplomatic pitfalls, despite careful planning by both governments. The recent dismissal of the UK's ambassador to the US, Lord Mandelson, over his ties to Jeffrey Epstein has already cast a shadow over the event. Beyond managing protests and intricate royal protocol, the UK government aims to secure policy wins on trade and technology, while navigating profound differences with the Trump administration on issues like NATO, Ukraine, and the Middle East.</p>

The report from Alzheimer’s Research UK highlights that over a third of the nearly one million people with dementia in the UK remain undiagnosed, with many waiting over two years for answers.</p>

          <p>President Trump has suggested that U.S. companies should move from reporting their earnings every quarter to a semi-annual schedule, a proposal the Securities and Exchange Commission is now reportedly reviewing. Trump argued the change would save companies money and allow management to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term profits, contrasting it with what he described as China's long-term business view. While some business leaders like Warren Buffett have previously criticized the focus on quarterly guidance, supporters of the current system argue it provides crucial transparency for investors.

While the full details are not yet public, any agreement would require the sale of TikTok to a U.S.-based owner to address these national security concerns.</p>
