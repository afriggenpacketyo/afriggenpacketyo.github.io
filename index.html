          <p>Protests against federal immigration sweeps in Los Angeles escalated, leading to demonstrators blocking the 101 freeway, prompting police to declare it an unlawful assembly. The Trump administration deployed 2,000 National Guardsmen to address the perceived lawlessness, a move criticized by California Governor Gavin Newsom as inflammatory and a federal takeover of the California National Guard. Newsom requested the deployment be rescinded, arguing it would escalate tensions, but the White House defended the action as necessary for community safety. The situation underscores the deep divisions over immigration enforcement in California. Optimism is tempered by the potential for further clashes and the unresolved tensions between state and federal authorities.</p>

          <p>Activists reported that Israeli troops boarded a yacht attempting to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza, resulting in a loss of communication with the vessel. The ship, named Madleen, was carrying symbolic aid and had climate activist Greta Thunberg onboard. Israel's foreign ministry stated that the navy instructed the yacht to change course due to its proximity to a restricted area, citing security concerns and the need to prevent weapons from reaching Hamas. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition maintains that the sea blockade is illegal and that the vessel was unarmed and sailing in international waters, carrying humanitarian aid and human rights defenders.</p>

          <p>A mural in downtown Los Angeles dedicated to Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna was vandalized for the second time, just days before riots erupted in the city over immigration raids. The "Mambas Forever" artwork, which had recently been restored with the help of Lakers star Luka Doncic, was defaced with white spray paint. The mural is located in the Fashion District, approximately 20 miles from the center of the protests. No suspects have been identified, and it is uncertain whether the mural will be restored again. The original vandalism occurred in April, with the restoration completed on May 30.</p>

          <p>Following clashes between immigration authorities and demonstrators in Los Angeles, President Trump deployed National Guard troops to the city. The move marks the first time in decades that a state's national guard was activated without a request from its governor, prompting California Governor Gavin Newsom to call for the order to be rescinded. ICE operations in Los Angeles resulted in 118 arrests, including individuals linked to criminal organizations. Protests erupted after the arrests, with demonstrators blocking agents and throwing objects at law enforcement vehicles.

          <p>Nursing staff in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland will vote on a 3.6% pay increase, amid ongoing disputes over fair compensation. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has criticized the offer as inadequate, raising the possibility of strike action. The vote is considered crucial in determining the next steps, with the RCN already dismissing the pay award as "grotesque." Nurses have endured over a decade of pay erosion, leading to increased resignations, and the vote outcome will reflect their sentiment on whether the proposed increase adequately addresses their concerns. The vote may cast a shadow over a government 10-year plan for the NHS in England.</p>

          <p>Nine U.S. veterans with PTSD traveled to Mexico for a psychedelic retreat organized by the Heroic Hearts Project, seeking relief from their combat-related trauma. The retreat involved traditional healers conducting ceremonies with psilocybin and 5-MeO-DMT, aiming to help veterans revisit traumatic moments. Participants reported varied experiences, with some finding the process transformative and others finding it unsettling. The Veterans Administration is now conducting clinical trials using MDMA and psilocybin to treat PTSD, depression, and addiction, reflecting growing interest in the therapeutic potential of psychedelics. Eight of the nine veterans reported improved symptoms and described the experience as life-changing.</p>

          <p>Hezbollah's losses in a conflict with Israel have weakened Iran's power and influence in the Middle East, according to analysts. A Mossad operation involving explosive pagers and subsequent Israeli airstrikes led to the assassination of Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and other key commanders. This resulted in a ceasefire and a significant degradation of Hezbollah's capabilities. The proxy war strategy that Iran has pursued with Hezbollah for decades is now seen as failing, impacting Iran's ability to project its influence in the region. The weakening of Hezbollah and the loss of key allies in Syria have created a challenging environment for Iran's regional ambitions.</p>

          <p>During Indira Gandhi's Emergency in the mid-1970s, her government considered reimagining India as a centralized state governed by command and control, historian Srinath Raghavan reveals. Top bureaucrats and party loyalists pushed for a presidential system to centralize executive power, sideline the judiciary, and weaken parliament. Inspired by Charles de Gaulle's France, the proposal aimed to move beyond the constraints of parliamentary democracy. Despite serious flirtation, India never made the leap to a presidential system, as the nation's parliamentary system proved sticky. The Forty-second Amendment Act, passed in 1976, expanded Parliament's powers, limited judicial review and further centralized executive authority.</p>
