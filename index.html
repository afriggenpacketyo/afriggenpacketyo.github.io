          <p>Roki Sasaki, the Dodgers' new Japanese pitcher, displayed significant improvement in his recent start against the Philadelphia Phillies, contributing to a 3-1 victory. After struggling with command in his initial outings, Sasaki showcased better control of his fastball and effectively utilized his splitter, allowing only one run in four-plus innings. Kiké Hernández and Michael Conforto provided the offensive support with home runs, while the Dodgers' bullpen secured the win with five scoreless innings. This performance suggests Sasaki is adapting to the major leagues and finding his footing in the Dodgers' rotation.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has placed an attorney, Erez Reuveni, on leave after his performance in a case involving a Maryland man wrongly deported to El Salvador. Reuveni reportedly struggled to provide Judge Paula Xinis with key details about the deportation and the government's inability to facilitate the man's return. Attorney General Pam Bondi emphasized that DOJ attorneys are expected to "zealously advocate" for the government's interests, and failure to do so will result in consequences.

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been using tattoos to identify alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua (TDA) for deportation. However, tattoo artists have stated that the tattoos cited by DHS have innocent meanings, such as commemorating the birth of a child or referencing the band AC/DC. Experts say that TDA does not typically use tattoos to signal membership, and the ACLU has accused DHS of wrongly deporting people based on these criteria.</p>

          <p>Two nearly 100-year-old Galapagos tortoises at the Philadelphia Zoo have become first-time parents, marking a historic event for the zoo. The four hatchlings are being cared for behind the scenes and are reported to be growing appropriately. The mother, Mommy, is considered one of the most genetically valuable Galapagos tortoises in the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' species survival plan, and this is her first clutch of eggs. The zoo plans to publicly debut the hatchlings later this month.</p>
