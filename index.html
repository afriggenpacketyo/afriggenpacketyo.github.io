          <p>The UK government established a confidential resettlement program for Afghans after a Ministry of Defence data breach inadvertently exposed the personal details of nearly 19,000 applicants. The leak, which occurred in 2022 but was discovered in 2023, contained names and details of individuals potentially at risk from the Taliban. In response, the government created the "Afghan Response Route," which has so far relocated 4,500 people at a cost of £400 million, with the total cost expected to double. The existence of this scheme was kept secret by a court injunction, which has now been lifted.</p>

          <p>China's leadership has announced a significant policy shift in its approach to urban development, moving away from large-scale expansion to focus on enhancing and optimizing existing city resources. At a high-level meeting, officials emphasized the need to adapt to a new phase of stable urban growth, prioritizing human well-being, efficiency, and improved governance. With 67% of its population now in urban areas, the new model will concentrate on renovating urban villages and repairing old housing. This change is part of a new growth framework for the country's struggling property sector.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Utilize Public NASA Data to Identify Potential Deep-Sea Mining Sites in Indian Ocean</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 08:00:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers have successfully used publicly available satellite data from NASA to pinpoint promising locations for deep-sea mining in the Indian Ocean. NASA's GRACE satellites detected gravity anomalies over the Ninety East Ridge, which Chinese scientists correctly interpreted as signs of a thickened oceanic crust. An expedition confirmed their hypothesis, revealing dense rock formations 5km thicker than normal, which indicates the presence of valuable minerals like copper, cobalt, and rare earths pushed up by magma. This use of open-source data has potentially saved the research team years of work and significant financial resources.</p>

          <p>The UK government is launching a new grant scheme to lower the cost of new electric cars, offering discounts of up to £3,750 for eligible vehicles priced under £37,000. Funded by a £650 million program, the initiative aims to accelerate the transition from petrol and diesel cars ahead of the 2030 ban on their new sales. While the government hopes this will make EVs more affordable, critics and industry figures point to the insufficient number of public charging points as a major barrier to widespread adoption. The scheme is part of a broader effort that includes funding for more charging infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a bill to officially rename the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge in Texas as the "Jocelyn Nungaray National Wildlife Refuge." The unanimous 372-0 vote honors the 12-year-old girl who was sexually assaulted and killed in June 2024, a crime for which two Venezuelan nationals have been charged. The case drew national attention to the border crisis, with her death becoming a focal point in political debates about immigration policy.

CEO Jamie Dimon noted the resilience of the U.S. economy but reiterated warnings about risks from trade uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, and high fiscal deficits. Despite a 17% drop in overall earnings compared to the prior year, which was skewed by a large gain, the underlying performance was robust. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has imposed a 17% tariff on most tomatoes imported from Mexico, effective immediately. The move follows the U.S. withdrawal from a 2019 agreement that suspended previous anti-dumping duties, with the Commerce Department arguing the deal failed to protect American tomato growers from unfairly low-priced imports. Mexico has rejected the dumping accusations, attributing the popularity of its tomatoes to their quality. The tariff is expected to increase prices for consumers on products like fresh tomatoes, salsas, and pizza sauces, as about 70% of tomatoes consumed in the U.S. are from Mexico.

          <p>The National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) is currently operating without an official policy on the participation of transgender athletes, as its 2021 policy was not renewed. This lack of guidance exists as the U.S. Supreme Court prepares to hear cases on the issue and conservative groups increase pressure on sports organizations to ban transgender women from women's sports. The U.S. Soccer Federation also lacks a specific policy for its national teams.

          <p>In this opinion piece, a pastor and divinity school professor argues that churches should not endorse political candidates, despite a recent IRS rule change that now permits it. While acknowledging the historical necessity of the Black church's political engagement on moral issues like slavery, the author draws a firm line at candidate endorsements. He contends that such actions would reduce the church's role, disrespect the conscience of congregants, and deepen political polarization by turning houses of worship into partisan spaces. The pulpit, he concludes, was not made for this purpose and should serve a higher calling.</p>

          <p>This opinion article offers a personal account of leaving the conservative evangelical church in order to reconcile Christian faith with a gay identity. The author, who grew up in the Southern Baptist tradition, describes the church's rigid opposition to same-sex marriage as an existential threat to its worldview. The essay argues that the choice for many gay Christians is not between God and personal desire, but between an exclusionary church and their own integrity. Ultimately, the author finds a deeper, more authentic faith in an affirming congregation, reframing the idea of Christian faithfulness.</p>
