        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's stock experienced a 10% surge after the company launched its Model Y robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, this past weekend. The autonomous rides were initially available to a select group of Tesla enthusiasts, promoters, and shareholders. CEO Elon Musk noted a flat fee of $4.20 per ride, while early access program participants reported positive experiences. However, other observers noted the robotaxis appeared to violate some traffic regulations, with one instance of traveling the wrong way and another of braking abruptly for stationary police vehicles. The launch represents a culmination of a decade of work by Tesla's AI software and chip design teams.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. airstrikes on Iran's nuclear sites, Iran has vowed retaliation, potentially targeting U.S. military assets in the Middle East or disrupting oil flow through the Strait of Hormuz. Iran could target the 45,000 U.S. military personnel stationed across the Middle East, along with naval assets like aircraft carriers. Closing the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial waterway for global oil and gas, could cause significant economic disruption, potentially raising oil prices by 50-60%. Experts also warn of potential asymmetric warfare, including terrorist and cyber attacks, with the U.S. National Terrorism Advisory System already issuing a warning about a heightened threat environment.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Co. is recalling nearly 200,000 Mustang Mach-E SUVs from model years 2021-2025 because of potentially faulty door latches. The electronic door latches may remain locked after a driver exits, potentially trapping passengers, especially children, in the back seat. Letters notifying owners of the safety risk are scheduled to be sent on June 23, and the problem will be fixed by updating the vehicles' software. The remedy is expected to be available by late September, and owners can contact Ford customer service or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for more information.</p>

          <p>China's exports of hi-tech goods to the European Union surged last month, coinciding with a significant drop in exports of the same goods to the United States. This suggests that ongoing trade and technology tensions between the US and China may be influencing trade patterns with Europe. Several EU countries experienced unprecedented import levels of Chinese batteries, laptops, smartphones, and solar panels in May. While many EU markets saw falling exports to China, the overall impact was a 22% increase in the union's trade deficit with China.</p>

          <p>Senator Markwayne Mullin stated that U.S. intelligence suggests Iran did not move nuclear material from its Fordo facility before American airstrikes, despite claims to the contrary. Mullin, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the U.S. believes Iran stored more material at Fordo, thinking it was impenetrable. He warned that if the U.S. finds it did not completely destroy Fordo's nuclear production capabilities, it will work with allies to finish the job. The Fordo facility was hit by American airstrikes, and President Trump claimed the strikes had "completely obliterated" Iran's major enrichment facilities.</p>

Medvedev claimed countries would line up to supply Iran with nuclear warheads, prompting Trump to call out Medvedev's claims, arguing the word "nuclear" shouldn't be used so casually. Trump took to his own social media page to express his concern, though Medvedev did not say Russia was ready to provide nuclear weapons to Iran. The exchange underscores heightened tensions following recent military actions in the region.</p>

          <p>An 18th-century oil painting at Florence's Uffizi Gallery was allegedly damaged after a museum visitor tripped while taking a selfie. The painting, a portrait of Ferdinando de' Medici by Anton Domenico Gabbiani, sustained damage that the museum believes can be repaired quickly. Gallery director Simone Verde warned that restrictions on visitor behavior might be imposed in the future due to the increasing problem of visitors focusing on taking selfies and creating memes. The visitor has been identified by the police and reported to judicial authorities, and the exhibition is temporarily closed for repairs.</p>

          <p>Compass is suing Zillow, claiming that the online property website's new rule, which bans home listings from its platform if they appear on any other service for more than 24 hours before being posted on Zillow, violates antitrust laws. Compass alleges that Zillow is leveraging its market dominance to impose this block on listings outside of its website, aiming to stifle competition. Compass CEO Robert Reffkin argues that the "Zillow ban" restricts consumer choice and gives Zillow undue power over the real estate market. Zillow, however, maintains that the rule ensures fair access to listings for all buyers and denies Compass's claims.</p>

          <p>A former acting ICE director warns that the Biden administration's border policies may have increased the risk of Iranian sleeper cells operating within the U.S. This concern arises after the U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear sites, which prompted a DHS advisory about potential domestic terrorism from Iranian-backed individuals. The former official suggests that the high number of undocumented individuals entering the country, coupled with limited vetting, creates opportunities for adversaries to send in individuals to spy or plan attacks. Other national security experts have echoed these concerns, highlighting the potential risks associated with released and unapprehended Iranian nationals.</p>

The violin, made in Florence in 1740 by Lorenzo Carcassi, belonged to a member of London's Philharmonia Orchestra and was on long-term loan from a businessman. The violinist, David Lopez Ibanez, reported the theft after the instrument was snatched while he was eating dinner. The violin has a unique heart-shaped cut-out on the back of the scroll, and police are urging anyone with information to come forward.</p>

          <p>The UK government, led by Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, plans to proscribe Palestine Action under anti-terror laws, effectively branding the group a terrorist organization. This decision follows a series of incidents, including activists breaking into RAF Brize Norton and spray-painting military planes red. Cooper stated that Palestine Action has a "long history of unacceptable criminal damage" and that the government will not tolerate actions that put national security at risk. If the ban is passed in Parliament, membership or support of the group will become a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison.</p>

          <p>Researchers have observed orcas in the North Pacific using kelp to "massage" each other, rubbing pieces of seaweed between their bodies. Drones captured footage of the whales selecting and biting off kelp, then placing it on the back of another whale. Scientists suggest this behavior, dubbed "allokelping," may serve a health, hygiene, or social bonding function. The findings indicate tool use in killer whales, with the animals fashioning tubular pieces of seaweed for a specific, planned purpose.</p>
