          <p>A planned visit by U.S. trade representatives to New Delhi has reportedly been called off, signaling escalating trade frictions between the two nations. The postponement follows President Trump's imposition of a cumulative 50% tariff on Indian exports, partly as a penalty for India's purchase of Russian crude oil. India has criticized the tariffs as unfair, highlighting that the U.S. and EU also continue to trade with Russia. The U.S. remains India's largest export partner, making the ongoing dispute economically significant for both countries. (not investment advice)</p>

Coach Sean McVay is expected to provide an update on Monday regarding the 37-year-old veteran, who has been sidelined with an aggravated disc. The mystery surrounding Stafford's health places a greater focus on backup quarterbacks Jimmy Garoppolo and Stetson Bennett, who led the team to a preseason victory against the Chargers.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has defended the government's decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist organization, stating it is more than a simple protest group. Cooper cited the group's "Underground Manual" and its claims of responsibility for various crimes as justification for the ban. The defense comes as the Metropolitan Police announced that 60 more individuals will be prosecuted for supporting the group, bringing the total arrests to over 700. Palestine Action is challenging the ban in court, arguing it infringes on free speech.</p>

Chad Volk of LC Car Care found the wallet lodged under the airbox of a 2015 Ford Edge he was repairing. After finding the owner's employee ID, Volk used Facebook to contact retired autoworker Richard Guilford and mailed the wallet back to him. Guilford was reunited with his lost cash, expired lottery tickets, and surprisingly still-valid gift cards.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the Atlantic season, briefly intensified into a powerful Category 5 storm before weakening slightly to a Category 4. The storm is undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle, a process that can cause temporary fluctuations in intensity but may lead to it re-strengthening. While its outer bands are affecting the northern Leeward Islands with heavy rain and dangerous surf, the hurricane's center is forecast to remain at sea. It is expected to pass north of Puerto Rico and curve away from the U.S. East Coast.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are developing a hypersonic drone carrier concept featuring an innovative single, rotating "scissor wing" design, potentially realizing an idea once explored by NASA. This design allows the wing to sit perpendicular to the fuselage at low speeds for maximum lift and then pivot to become parallel at hypersonic speeds up to Mach 5. This adaptability helps mitigate shock waves and wave drag during transonic flight. In its hypersonic configuration, the entire aircraft functions as a "waverider," generating high pressure for sustained high-speed travel.</p>

The investigation began after a business partner grew suspicious of a package containing potassium cyanide delivered to their dental office.

          <p>An executive counselor and couples' therapist outlines five common psychological drivers that can lead individuals, even those in seemingly stable relationships, to risk having an affair. These reasons include rebelling against a lifetime of being "good" or a perfectionist, having poor personal boundaries developed in childhood, and being in an abusive or emotionally neglectful marriage. Additionally, a recent significant loss can act as a catalyst, prompting a re-evaluation of life priorities that may lead to infidelity as a way to reclaim a sense of self or escape from pain.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin underwent an "astonishingly rapid intensification," strengthening from a Category 1 to a Category 5 storm in just over 24 hours, making it one of the fastest-strengthening Atlantic hurricanes on record. This phenomenon, where storms gain significant wind speed in a short period, is becoming more common due to warming oceans caused by climate change. Erin is the 11th Category 5 hurricane recorded in the Atlantic since 2016, highlighting a trend of storms more easily reaching peak strength. The storm is currently forecast to remain at sea, avoiding direct landfall.</p>

Strategies include buying reduced "yellow sticker" items to freeze for later, batch cooking meals, and organizing the fridge to use food before it expires. Some parents also pre-portion daily snacks into separate bags to prevent them from being eaten all at once. For many families, local food pantries and council-issued food vouchers have become essential resources to cope with the increased financial pressure.</p>

The drought conditions are causing trees to enter survival mode by shedding leaves and branches to conserve water.

          <p>During his summit with Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump hand-delivered a personal letter from First Lady Melania Trump regarding children affected by the war in Ukraine. The letter speaks in general terms about children's dreams for safety and innocence, urging the Russian president to "restore their melodic laughter." While administration officials said the letter mentioned abductions, the released text does not explicitly reference the thousands of Ukrainian children that Russia is accused of forcibly transferring from occupied territories, a practice deemed a war crime by the International Criminal Court.</p>

          <p>Villa Baviera, a German-style village in Chile, is now a tourist town with a hotel and restaurant, but it was once a secretive and abusive cult known as Colonia Dignidad. Founded in 1961 by Paul Schäfer, the compound was a site of forced labor and child sexual assault, and it later collaborated with the Pinochet dictatorship as a torture center for political prisoners. The Chilean government now plans to expropriate part of the land to create a memorial for the victims. This plan has divided the remaining residents, some of whom see themselves as victims and oppose the disruption to their rebuilt lives.</p>

This decisive win, in what was considered the biggest test of his career, extends Itauma's undefeated professional record to 13-0. The performance strengthens his position as a major contender in the heavyweight division and a potential future champion.</p>

          <p>A new music collection, "Sunset Boulevard," documents the final burst of studio creativity from Elvis Presley between 1972 and 1975, 48 years after his death. The set includes his last Top 10 hit, "Burning Love," and soulful ballads recorded as his marriage to Priscilla Presley was ending. The period is framed by a significant missed opportunity: a potential role opposite Barbra Streisand in "A Star Is Born," which some friends believe could have revitalized his career. The recordings showcase his expressive vocal talent in middle age and his strong rapport with his TCB live band.</p>
