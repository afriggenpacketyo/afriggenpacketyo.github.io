          <p>Grant Hardin, a former Arkansas police chief convicted of sexual assault and murder and known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," was recaptured after escaping from prison. He was found about 1.5 miles from the Calico Rock prison, disguised as a law enforcement officer. Hardin had been serving a 30-year sentence for murder and a 50-year sentence for sexual assault since 2017, after pleading guilty to fatally shooting James Appleton and to two counts of sexual assault.

          <p>Five members of the Proud Boys, including Enrique Tarrio, are suing the U.S. government and several FBI and Department of Justice employees for $100 million, alleging constitutional rights violations during their January 6 prosecutions.

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has detained numerous undocumented immigrants attending routine check-in appointments at a federal building in Los Angeles, holding some overnight in the building's basement. Immigration lawyers report that hundreds were detained, with dozens held in rooms lacking beds and with limited access to necessities. One case involved a couple and their children, including a U.S. citizen, who were detained despite the father having a stay of removal. ICE denies these assertions, stating they treat detainees with dignity and follow the law, while the Department of Homeland Security said those arrested had final orders of removal.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native mistakenly deported from the U.S., has been returned to face charges of transporting undocumented migrants within the country. A federal grand jury indicted Abrego Garcia on two counts, alleging his involvement in a conspiracy to transport migrants from Texas. The Trump administration faced court battles to bring him back, initially claiming it was unable to do so, and Attorney General Pam Bondi thanked El Salvador for their cooperation in his return. His attorney calls the charges an abuse of power, while prosecutors seek to detain him due to community danger and flight risk.</p>

          <p>Tesla is grappling with significant challenges, exacerbated by a public feud between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. The dispute, triggered by Musk's criticism of Trump's spending bill, led to a sharp decline in Tesla's stock value and a breakdown in their relationship. This fallout could impact government support, regulatory decisions, and tariff exemptions for Tesla. The company was already struggling with declining revenue, increased competition, and consumer backlash to Musk's political activities, prompting concerns about its future performance and the board's role in ensuring stability.</p>

The conservative-majority court lifted an injunction, enabling DOGE to pursue its goal of targeting waste and fraud in the federal government. This decision has raised concerns among labor unions and advocacy groups, who fear misuse of personal data, including financial and medical information.

          <p>Analysts are questioning Apple's AI strategy as the company's response to generative AI, Apple Intelligence, has been underwhelming. Despite advantages like a large installed base and custom chips, Apple has struggled to compete with rivals like OpenAI and Google. Investors are urging Apple to make major advancements in AI, especially as some executives suggest AI could replace the iPhone. The initial rollout of Apple Intelligence features was rocky, and a key improvement to Siri has been delayed, leading to class-action suits. The company is facing renewed competition from OpenAI and Meta in the AI space.</p>

Protesters argued the administration aims to dismantle the VA and replace it with a private voucher program, which they believe would provide substandard care.
