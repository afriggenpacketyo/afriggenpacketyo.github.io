          <p>Peter Coker Jr., a defendant in the $100 million New Jersey deli fraud case, was attacked by inmates in a Thai prison while awaiting extradition, according to his lawyer at his sentencing. Coker Jr. was found in Thailand after being indicted in the U.S. for securities fraud involving Hometown International, a deli owner, and E-Waste, a shell company. He was sentenced alongside his father, Peter Coker Sr., who received six months in jail and home confinement for his role in artificially inflating the companies' stock prices. The judge deemed the companies worthless and the scheme a sophisticated fraud that caused harm. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Qatari royal family's proposal to gift President Trump a $400 million luxury Boeing 747-8 for use as Air Force One has sparked controversy, raising concerns about potential corruption and violations of the Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act and the Constitution's emoluments clauses. While presidents often exchange gifts with foreign governments, the sheer value of this gift raises questions about Qatar's motives and the expectation of a quid pro quo. Critics argue that accepting such an extravagant gift could lead to conflicts of interest and undue influence over the president's decision-making, especially given Trump's existing business ties to Qatar. The legality of transferring the plane to Trump's presidential library is also under scrutiny, potentially leading to legal challenges.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026 is projected to be 2.4%, which would be the lowest annual benefit increase in five years, according to estimates from policy analysts and senior groups. This adjustment, which helps beneficiaries cope with inflation, is calculated by comparing third-quarter inflation data from the current year to the previous year. The CPI-W, used to calculate Social Security's COLA, increased by 2.1% over the past 12 months. The actual COLA may change depending on the pace of inflation in the coming months, but a lower adjustment could impact retirees, disabled individuals, and their families.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-13 15:10:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's imposition of large tariffs on goods from every country, inflation slowed in April, leading to questions about the immediate impact of these trade policies. The primary explanation for this is that US companies stocked up on foreign goods earlier in the year in anticipation of the tariffs, allowing them to keep prices low temporarily. However, as companies exhaust their pre-trade war inventories, consumer prices are expected to rise, with some companies already announcing price increases. While the risk of a severe economic crisis has fallen due to Trump's deal with China, the long-term effects of the tariffs on prices and economic growth remain uncertain.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration imposed sanctions on nearly two dozen firms operating in Iranâ€™s illicit international oil trade, targeting companies that allegedly allocate billions of dollars worth of oil annually to Iran's armed forces. This action was coupled with President Trump's remarks in Saudi Arabia, where he urged Iran to pursue a "new and better path" towards a nuclear agreement with the United States. Trump warned of "massive maximum pressure" if Iran does not agree to a deal, while also stating that Iran could have a much brighter future if it chooses to cooperate. The sanctions and the offer come as the U.S. engages in ongoing nuclear talks with Iran.</p>

The two-free-checked-bags policy is a collaboration with Bank of America and will be available to travelers with Spirit's branded credit card later in 2025.

          <p>Three key House committees are meeting to advance their portions of a major budget package addressing President Trump's priorities in defense, energy, and taxes, with Republican leaders aiming for a floor vote next week. The committees are debating proposals that include changes to Medicaid and food stamps to offset tax cuts, but divisions remain among Republicans on issues such as Medicaid overhauls and a tax deduction expiring in December. The Energy and Commerce Committee's plan includes work requirements for Medicaid recipients and cuts to federal funds for states providing healthcare to undocumented immigrants, while the Ways and Means Committee proposes raising the debt limit and extending tax cuts enacted during Trump's first term.</p>

          <p>President Trump praised Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) for his leadership and friendship during a speech at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum, four years after the U.S. intelligence community concluded that MBS approved the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi. Trump lauded the crown prince for Saudi Arabia's recent economic development, crediting him for transforming Riyadh into a major business and cultural capital. Trump also announced the end of sanctions against Syria, suggesting he did so at Saudi Arabia's request, marking a significant shift in U.S. policy towards the country.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. will remove all sanctions on Syria, aiming to give the country a chance at greatness and stability. Speaking at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in Riyadh, Trump highlighted the new government in Syria and expressed hope for its success in stabilizing the country and keeping peace. This move marks a significant shift in U.S. policy, as Syria has been designated a state sponsor of terrorism by the U.S. government since 1979, with additional sanctions imposed in 2004 and 2011.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's decision to lift sanctions on Syria, potentially meeting with Syrian leader Ahmad al Sharaa, signals a seismic shift in Middle East policy. The move poses a political risk given Sharaa's past as a wanted leader of a rebel group, previously designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S. This decision also has implications for U.S. relations with Israel, which has taken a more hawkish approach to the new Syrian government. Trump's planned meeting with Sharaa marks the first time leaders of the two countries have met in person since 2000.</p>

The hearing will center on whether the brothers have been rehabilitated in prison and deserve a lesser sentence, which would make them eligible for parole under Californiaâ€™s youthful offender law. Defense attorneys argue the brothers killed their parents in self-defense after years of sexual abuse, while prosecutors maintain they wanted their inheritance and were not abused.</p>

          <p>A lawyer for a group of small businesses argued in federal court that President Trump's tariffs are an "unprecedented and unlawful expansion" of executive power. The lawsuit challenges the legality of Trump's tariffs, arguing that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not give the president the right to unilaterally impose tariffs. The small businesses claim they rely on imports and would be irreparably harmed by the tariffs, describing the national emergency Trump used to justify the tariffs as a "figment of his own imagination." The Department of Justice has defended the tariffs, arguing that Congress permits the president to impose some tariffs and that Trump's invoking of a national emergency makes his power "broader."</p>
