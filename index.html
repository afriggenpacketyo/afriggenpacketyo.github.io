          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested more than 20 individuals at a protest in Parliament Square for showing support for Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000. The ban makes it a criminal offense to be a member of or express support for the group, punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The protest occurred the day after the ban took effect, which the government implemented following significant property damage attributed to the group's activities. Demonstrators held placards with messages like "I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action" before being detained by officers.</p>

          <p>As the death toll from the Texas floods rises to at least 27, harrowing stories of survival and loss are surfacing from the Hill Country. Reports detail dramatic rescues, such as a woman found clinging to a tree after being swept 12 miles downriver, and tragic heroism, like a man who died saving his family. Families are using social media to plead for information about missing loved ones, including several children and adults from Camp Mystic and nearby campgrounds. Officials have noted the area lacks a dedicated flood warning system, contributing to the disaster's scale.</p>

          <p>The grim task of recovering victims has begun in Texas following deadly flash floods, with the death toll confirmed at 27, including nine children, and dozens still missing. The disaster has prompted discussions about the role of climate change in intensifying rainfall and the accuracy of weather forecasting, with some officials noting the storm's severity exceeded predictions. Critics have also raised concerns about budget cuts at the National Weather Service under the Trump administration, questioning if they impaired forecasting capabilities. The event highlights the vulnerability of the "flash flood alley" region to extreme weather events.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration is facing backlash for sending an email that critics label as "blatant misinformation" regarding President Trump's new spending bill. The email claimed the legislation eliminates federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for most recipients. However, the bill actually provides a temporary tax deduction for seniors, which phases out for higher earners, rather than a permanent elimination of the tax. Former SSA officials and Democratic lawmakers have condemned the communication as a partisan and misleading political statement from a typically apolitical agency.</p>

          <p>A year after a significant election victory, the UK Labour government under Sir Keir Starmer is grappling with widespread voter disappointment, according to a focus group of 2024 Labour voters. Participants expressed frustration over a perceived lack of progress, particularly on immigration, and felt the party had not been transparent about its initial plans. Recent parliamentary chaos and policy U-turns have reinforced a sense of aimlessness, with some voters now considering supporting the Reform UK party. While some acknowledge the difficulty of turning the country around in one year, the overall sentiment reflects a soured relationship with the electorate.</p>

          <p>President Trump has intensified his use of threats against perceived opponents, raising alarms among democracy advocates. In the past week, he has suggested deporting Elon Musk, arresting New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, and investigating Joe Biden's former homeland security secretary. These warnings, often delivered via social media or at staged events, follow a pattern of retribution that has included revoking security clearances from political rivals. Critics argue that even if the threats are not legally executed, they create a chilling effect on free speech and weaponize the state against dissent.</p>

The U.S. Forest Service described the fire's growth as exponential, driven by weather, terrain, and fuel conditions.

          <p>The increasing prevalence of digital payment systems has led to a phenomenon dubbed "tipflation," where customers are prompted to tip in more situations than ever before, causing confusion and frustration.

Marketing professors note that while this technology was widely adopted during the pandemic, many businesses have not opted out of the embedded tip requests.

This could drive North Korea to further develop and disperse its nuclear capabilities to ensure a second-strike option. The analysis comes in the context of past diplomatic efforts, including President Trump's historic but ultimately unsuccessful summits with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.</p>

Endocrinologists explain that cortisol is a necessary hormone and that doctors rarely aim to lower it except in specific medical conditions like Cushing's Syndrome. While the drink is likely harmless for most and can aid hydration, its ingredients are not proven to reduce stress or cortisol levels in the body.</p>

Invented by linguist Lin Yutang and dubbed the "MingKwai," the machine ingeniously solved the challenge of typing a language with tens of thousands of characters by breaking them down by shape rather than sound. This concept of predictive input based on component shapes underlies the technology used today to type Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. The restored machine is now housed at Stanford University.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's top military commander, Oleksandr Syrskyi, has warned that Russia may be preparing for a new offensive in the northeastern Kharkiv region. After visiting units in the area, Syrskyi noted that Russian forces are attempting to press their advantage in troop numbers and munitions. This warning comes as Moscow's forces have been making slow but steady gains along the front lines and have already established a small foothold in the neighboring Sumy region. Syrskyi emphasized the need for Ukraine to be prepared with appropriate tactical and technological solutions to counter any Russian advance.</p>

          <p>For the first time in over a century, Parisians are legally swimming in the Seine River after a swimming ban enacted in 1923 was officially lifted. The reopening follows a massive $1.5 billion cleanup project, tied to last year's Olympics, which has significantly improved water quality. Designated swimming areas have been established with strict safety measures, including lifeguards and floating buoys. While some residents remain skeptical about the water's cleanliness, many eagerly took the plunge, celebrating the realization of a long-held dream to reclaim the iconic waterway for recreation.</p>

          <p>At Oregon State University's Big Fish Lab, scientists are working to change the public's negative perception of sharks while studying their crucial role in marine ecosystems. Led by Dr. Taylor Chapple, the team researches sharks in Washington's Willapa Bay, examining their stomach contents to understand their diet and the overall health of the bay. Researchers explain that a healthy shark population is an indicator of a healthy ocean. Despite the public's fascination with sharks, the scientists note that securing financial support for their vital research remains a significant challenge.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has elaborated on his idea of forming a new political party, suggesting it could gain significant influence by focusing on a small number of key congressional races. In a post on X, Musk proposed that winning just two or three Senate seats and eight to ten House districts would be enough to act as a deciding vote on major legislation, given the narrow political margins in Congress. This idea follows a public feud with President Trump over a new spending bill, which prompted Musk to threaten to form the "America Party" to challenge the two-party system.</p>

          <p>North Korea has opened a large-scale luxury beach resort in the coastal city of Wonsan, a project that took nearly a decade to complete amid international sanctions and pandemic lockdowns. The Wonsan Kalma Coastal Tourist Area features hundreds of buildings, including high-rise hotels and villas, designed to boost the nation's tourism-driven economy. However, the country remains largely closed to foreign tourists, with the exception of small, curated groups from Russia. Analysts view the resort's opening as a sign of Pyongyang's dual pursuit of economic development alongside its military ambitions and political isolation.</p>

          <p>An Arizona man was fined $4,000 by his property management company after posting negative online reviews about his rental experience, which included black mold and unfinished repairs. The fine was based on a "non-disparagement" clause in his lease, which penalizes tenants for reviews rated three stars or less. However, such clauses are illegal under the 2016 Consumer Review Fairness Act (CRFA), which protects consumers' right to share honest feedback. The case highlights a broader issue of businesses attempting to silence criticism through unenforceable contract terms, and the renter has filed complaints with state and federal agencies.</p>

          <p>A multi-story residential building collapse in southern Pakistan has resulted in the deaths of at least 16 people, with search and rescue operations continuing for a second day. The building collapsed on Friday, and rescue workers have been using heavy machinery to search for at least eight more people believed to be trapped in the rubble. Such incidents are common in Pakistan, where poor construction standards, substandard materials, and a lack of regulation enforcement often lead to structural failures. The narrow street where the building was located has reportedly hampered rescue efforts.</p>

          <p>A physician details the severe impact that new federal work requirements for Medicaid will have on the country's most vulnerable patients. The article argues that bureaucratic hurdles, such as proving employment or exemption status, will disproportionately affect individuals who lack stable housing, internet access, or the ability to navigate complex systems. Citing projections that nearly 12 million Americans could lose insurance, the author contends that the policy is designed to cut costs by making it difficult for eligible people to receive care. This will likely lead to more uninsured patients and financial strain on safety-net hospitals.</p>

          <p>Mo Gawdat, a former Google executive and happiness researcher, promotes a "90-second rule" for living a more fulfilled life. Based on neuroscientist Jill Bolte Taylor's findings, the rule posits that the physiological response to anger or stress, involving hormones like cortisol, lasts only about 90 seconds. After this initial period, individuals can choose not to re-engage the thought that caused the emotion, preventing a cycle of negativity. Gawdat suggests that by allowing the initial feeling to pass and then consciously shifting focus, people can more quickly recover from life's daily upsets and build emotional resilience.</p>

The piece suggests that the outcome, while not a full acquittal, is another example of a system that fails to deliver true justice for survivors of intimate partner violence, and it criticizes media portrayals that soften the image of powerful abusers.</p>

          <p>This article explores the importance of decoupling exercise from the singular goal of weight loss, a mindset that can be counterproductive for long-term health and well-being. For many, the association between working out and getting thin can create a negative relationship with physical activity. The piece highlights that finding a form of movement that is enjoyable and empowering, such as weight lifting or group fitness, can be more beneficial. Shifting the focus to how movement makes one feel, rather than how it makes one look, can lead to a more sustainable and positive approach to physical fitness.</p>
