          <p>A former top European Union official, Charles Michel, has urged the EU to manage its competition with China responsibly, emphasizing that their relationship should not be dictated by other global powers. Michel highlighted the importance of stability and predictability, acknowledging potential tensions arising from differing traditions, cultures, and political systems. He stressed that the EU-China relationship should be based on its own merits, especially as both sides mark 50 years of diplomatic relations and ease reciprocal restrictions. Chinese President Xi Jinping has also called for a sound and stable relationship to benefit both sides and the world, amidst easing strains between Europe and China.</p>

          <p>Stephen Miller, a White House deputy chief of staff, indicated that the Trump administration is exploring the possibility of suspending immigrants' right to challenge their detention in court, known as habeas corpus, during an immigration crackdown. Miller argued that the Constitution allows for such suspensions during times of invasion, though legal experts dispute this interpretation. The move would represent a significant escalation in the administration's battle with the courts over deportation efforts, raising concerns about executive overreach. Historically, habeas corpus has been suspended only in times of rebellion or invasion, with congressional approval, and the administration's likening of immigration to an invasion has been rejected by federal judges.</p>

          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced that her government is suing Google for changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America on its maps, following a decree by former U.S. President Donald Trump. Mexico asserts that Google should only label the U.S. portion of the gulf as the Gulf of America, while retaining the name Gulf of Mexico for the territorial parts belonging to Mexico and Cuba. Google claims its changes align with the official U.S. government geographic designations, but Mexico's Foreign Ministry had previously requested the company not to apply the new name to Mexican territorial waters.</p>

          <p>Rand Laycock, a 70-year-old music conductor with Parkinson's disease, has experienced significant improvement in his symptoms through deep brain stimulation (DBS). Diagnosed nearly a decade ago, Laycock's tremors and involuntary movements progressed despite medication. After undergoing DBS, which involves an implanted device delivering electrical currents to the brain, he transitioned to a more advanced form called adaptive DBS (aDBS). This technology fine-tunes stimulation in real-time, reducing the risk of tremors during concerts. Laycock's experience highlights DBS and aDBS as viable options for Parkinson's patients seeking better symptom control and quality of life.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes China's strategy, led by Xi Jinping, to dominate global supply chains and reduce reliance on the West. Since 2020, China has ramped up exports and deepened its position as a manufacturing hub, using state-directed lending and new economic warfare tactics like export controls. This approach has allowed China to retaliate against U.S. tariffs by restricting critical minerals, impacting American industries and consumers. However, this strategy has costs, including strained relationships with trading partners and potential economic imbalances within China, where state control may stifle innovation and consumer spending.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a robotic Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intended destination of Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth's atmosphere by the end of this weekend after being stranded in orbit for 53 years. Due to a rocket malfunction, the spacecraft never reached Venus and has been slowly spiraling back towards Earth. Experts are unsure of the exact re-entry location, but the spacecraft's orbit places it between 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south latitude. While the spacecraft is expected to mostly burn up, some pieces could survive the re-entry and impact the Earth's surface.</p>
