          <p>This article traces the complex relationship between former FBI Director James Comey and Donald Trump, culminating in Comey's recent indictment. It highlights Comey's 2017 firing after refusing a loyalty pledge and confirming the FBI's Russia investigation, which led to the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. The article also notes the irony of Comey's prior actions, such as his handling of Hillary Clinton's email investigation, which inadvertently aided Trump's 2016 election campaign. The narrative underscores the long-standing political animosity between the two figures.</p>

          <p>Asian pharmaceutical companies experienced a market downturn after U.S. President Donald Trump announced new 100% tariffs on branded or patented pharmaceutical products. The tariffs, effective October 1, exempt companies that establish drug manufacturing plants within the U.S. Major pharma stocks in Japan and South Korea, including Daiichi Sankyo and Samsung Biologics, saw significant drops. This article also briefly mentions additional tariffs on heavy trucks, kitchen cabinets, and upholstered furniture, alongside an approved TikTok deal.</p>

This 'superbug' bacteria is resistant to many powerful antibiotics, making treatments extremely difficult and increasing risks of severe complications or death.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The indictment of former FBI Director James Comey is analyzed in this article not merely as an act of personal retribution by President Trump, but as a strategic move within his broader plan to use the justice system against political opponents. The article links the indictment to Trump's stated intentions to target donors to anti-Trump causes and his administration's efforts to investigate left-wing groups. It suggests this action is part of a forward-looking plot to undermine the rule of law and protect his administration from accountability, raising concerns about future elections.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed a memorandum aimed at combating what he terms a 'radical leftwing domestic terror network,' a move critics fear will lead to a broad crackdown on political opponents. Trump suggested philanthropists like George Soros and Reid Hoffman could be targets, prompting strong pushback from the Open Society Foundations and the ACLU. The memorandum seeks to establish a comprehensive strategy to investigate and dismantle organized political violence, but legal experts and activists warn it could be used to label protected activities as terrorism.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer highlights a significant economic divide, with a robust segment driven by the artificial intelligence boom contrasting sharply with a weaker consumer sector. He argues that the AI-centric economy, dominated by Big Tech, is indifferent to interest rates, while consumer-oriented businesses like autos, housing, and retail are struggling. Cramer suggests that despite strong GDP growth, the broader economy requires interest rate cuts to prevent further decline in consumer-facing industries. This article reflects on the concentrated nature of recent economic gains in the tech sector.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dietitians are advocating for increased consumption of brown rice as a key strategy to potentially lower the risk of dementia, a condition projected to affect nearly 7 million Americans over 65. This article explains that brown rice is rich in antioxidants like ferulic acid, which combats inflammation, and provides fiber to stabilize blood sugar levels, crucial for brain health. It also contains B vitamins that help lower homocysteine, an amino acid linked to cognitive decline. Incorporating brown rice into a plant-rich, low-sugar diet, alongside physical activity, can support long-term cognitive function.</p>

          <p>Cities worldwide, including London, New York, and Washington D.C., are experiencing a significant increase in rat populations, prompting concerns about health and infrastructure. This article highlights that rising temperatures, particularly warmer winters, are a major contributing factor, as rats do not hibernate and can breed more frequently. Urban rodentologist Bobby Corrigan's study found substantial increases in rat activity in numerous cities. Overflowing bins, fast food consumption, and increased urbanization also exacerbate the problem, making traditional pest control methods less effective. The solution may lie in better urban waste management and environmental care.</p>
