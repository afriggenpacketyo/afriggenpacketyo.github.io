          <p>Republicans in California, led by Assemblymember Carl DeMaio, have launched a campaign to place a voter ID requirement on the 2026 ballot. The initiative needs to gather 875,000 signatures to qualify, with over 300,000 already collected. Proponents argue that requiring identification is a necessary step to restore public confidence in the electoral process and improve internal controls against potential fraud. This effort aligns with a broader national trend, as 36 other states currently have some form of voter ID law in place.</p>

          <p>A recent cyberattack on Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has been identified as the most economically damaging in UK history, costing an estimated £1.9 billion. The incident forced the shutdown of multiple production facilities for weeks, halting the manufacturing of about 1,000 vehicles per day and severely impacting over 5,000 organizations in the supply chain. A report from the Cyber Monitoring Centre highlighted that the majority of the financial impact stemmed from lost manufacturing output, underscoring the increasing threat of disruptive attacks on operational technology.</p>

          <p>The United States has carried out its eighth strike against a suspected drug-trafficking vessel since September, with the latest attack occurring in the Pacific Ocean and resulting in two to three fatalities. This marks an expansion of operations previously focused on the Caribbean, where at least 34 people have been killed in similar strikes. The Trump administration has defended these actions by classifying the conflict with drug cartels as a "non-international armed conflict," though some lawmakers have questioned the legal and constitutional basis for the strikes.</p>

          <p>The Richmond-Upon-Thames Council has rescinded a £150 fine given to a woman for pouring a small amount of leftover coffee down a road gully. The woman, Burcu Yesilyurt, stated she was trying to be responsible by not spilling the liquid on the bus she was about to board. After she was stopped by three enforcement officers in what she described as an "intimidating" encounter, the council ultimately cancelled the fine, acknowledging it was a minor contravention and apologizing for the inconvenience.</p>

          <p>Shares of plant-based food company Beyond Meat experienced a turbulent trading session, initially surging over 100% before dramatically cutting gains. The rally was triggered by its inclusion in the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF, which also appeared to initiate a short squeeze, as over 63% of its available shares were sold short. This week's comeback follows years of significant decline for the stock, which has fallen from over $230 per share in 2019 to penny-stock status, reflecting the unpredictable nature of retail-driven meme trading.

However, the company faces significant headwinds, including the expiration of federal EV tax credits, higher tariff costs, and a sales slump in Europe driven by increased competition and consumer backlash against CEO Elon Musk. Despite reporting record vehicle deliveries for the quarter, total deliveries for the year are down about 6% compared to the same period in 2024. (not investment advice)</p>

In a letter to federal planning commissions, the group expressed concern that the proposed 90,000-square-foot annex will "overwhelm the White House itself" and has not undergone the legally required public review process. This follows similar concerns from other architectural groups regarding the project's scale, while the White House has dismissed the criticism as "manufactured outrage."</p>
