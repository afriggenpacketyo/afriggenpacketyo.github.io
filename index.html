          <p>Chinese officials are scrambling to adhere to President Xi Jinping's austerity directives, which include ensuring modest offices, proper meal receipts, and returning lavish gifts, as inspectors conduct checks. This campaign, ongoing since 2012, aims to curb overspending within the Communist Party and government bodies, enhance the party's image, combat corruption, and reduce wasteful expenditures. Analysts suggest this initiative also ensures wise spending to aid China's rivalry with the United States and identifies politically loyal cadres for potential promotion. Questions remain about the campaign's effectiveness due to media control and enforcement challenges on a large scale.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has cautioned Elon Musk about potential "serious consequences" if he funds Democratic candidates opposing Republicans who supported Trump's tax bill. This warning follows Musk's criticism of the bill, which he labeled "an abomination" on his social media platform, X. Musk, previously a top Trump donor and advisor overseeing cost-cutting initiatives, allegedly considered backing Democratic opponents in primary elections to punish Republicans who voted for the bill. Trump expressed no desire to reconcile with Musk, deeming him "disrespectful," and dismissed Musk's deleted claims linking him to Jeffrey Epstein as "old news."</p>
