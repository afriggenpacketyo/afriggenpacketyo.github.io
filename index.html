Ronaldo dismisses the idea of a personal rivalry, emphasizing it's a team versus team contest, while Yamal's Spain prepares to challenge Ronaldo's Portugal in Munich for the trophy. This game will be the first time that Barcelona's Yamal, a potential Ballon d'Or winner, will face Ronaldo, who is currently out of contract with Saudi club Al-Nassr.

          <p>The Trump administration is deploying the National Guard to Los Angeles in response to large-scale protests following ICE operations. Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the move as inflammatory, stating that local authorities can handle the situation, while President Trump claims federal intervention is necessary due to the inability of local leaders to manage the protests. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth indicated that active-duty Marines could also be mobilized if violence escalates, and the deployment involves at least 2,000 National Guard troops under Title 10 authority, which is a waiver of the Posse Comitatus Act.</p>

          <p>Keir Starmer’s government plans to modernize and potentially expand Britain’s nuclear weapons arsenal, undermining international non-proliferation efforts. This decision fuels a global nuclear arms race led by the US, China, and Russia, increasing the risk of deploying lower-yield tactical nukes in conflict zones. The move deviates from previous Labour policies advocating nuclear disarmament and perpetuates illusions about Britain's global power status. Critics argue that retaining nuclear weapons does not enhance Britain's safety and diverts resources from essential public services.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece discusses President Trump's increased personal wealth since starting his 2024 election campaign, with billions of foreign dollars flowing into his family’s real estate and crypto ventures. The author argues this is more than just self-dealing, transforming the political system and likening it to corrupt strongman regimes like Vladimir Putin's Russia and Viktor Orban's Hungary. These leaders leverage power for personal gain, eroding checks and balances, ethical frameworks, and consolidating power through corruption. The piece raises concerns about the United States becoming another country where the leader's interests are indistinguishable from the nation's.</p>

The article examines the conflict through the prism of laws designed to regulate warfare and protect civilians, featuring insights from the ICRC, lawyers, and Western diplomats. Evidence, including casualty numbers and restrictions on aid, suggests Israel has violated laws protecting civilians, leading to accusations of weaponizing hunger.

          <p>Researchers in China have used the rare mineral tellurium to create an artificial retina that restored sight in blind animals and gave them the ability to see infrared light. The study, led by Wang Shuiyuan at Fudan University, showed how tellurium nanowire implants in a biocompatible device restored vision in blind mice and a monkey. Tellurium, a byproduct of copper refining, converts visible light and infrared radiation into electrical energy, replacing photoreceptor cells in the retina. The advance offers significant promise for treating human blindness.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles under Title 10 authority, without the request of the governor, has raised legal concerns. Experts argue this move is an overreach of federal power and a misuse of the military to quell dissent. Critics point out that Title 10 activation is rare and typically prohibits troops from directly assisting civilian law enforcement. The ACLU has condemned the deployment as dangerous and an abuse of power, while others fear Trump might invoke the Insurrection Act to further escalate the situation.</p>

The study, co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, argues that subsidies for fathers produce higher long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. China faces a rapidly ageing population and shrinking workforce, making the decline in fertility rates especially urgent. Traditional expectations placing the burden on women clash with rapid economic changes.</p>

          <p>UCLA's baseball team secured a 5-2 victory against Texas San Antonio in the first game of the Super Regional, putting them one win away from the College World Series. Despite UTSA taking an early lead, UCLA's offense rallied with contributions from multiple players, and their defense limited the damage. Pitcher Michael Barnett delivered a solid performance, and Roman Martin's two-RBI triple in the eighth inning provided a crucial cushion. Freshman Easton Hawk closed out the game, earning the save and highlighting his emergence as the team's closer.</p>
