        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Automakers like Ford, Hyundai, and Kia reported significant year-over-year U.S. sales increases in April, driven by consumers buying vehicles ahead of potential tariff-related price hikes. The tariff fear-buying began in late March and continued into April, spurred by automakers offering discounts or promising to hold prices steady. However, experts warn that this sales momentum may not last, as demand slowed in late April due to tightening inventories and rising prices. President Trump's 25% tariffs on imported vehicles took effect on April 3, with additional levies on auto parts expected to begin soon.</p>

          <p>Starbucks is reversing its course on automation, opting to hire more baristas and focus on customer experience rather than relying on its "Siren" automated equipment. The company's CEO, Brian Niccol, stated that staffing stores and deploying technology behind the scenes is more effective than relying solely on equipment. Starbucks will expand its "Green Apron service model" in May, involving hiring new baristas and fine-tuning an algorithm to manage orders. While the Siren system is taking a backseat, Starbucks is still testing a new sequencing algorithm to reduce wait times.</p>

Under the RAP plan, monthly bills would be a percentage of a borrower's income, ranging from 1% to 10% depending on earnings.

Long-term CDs offer extended interest-earning potential but require sacrificing access to funds for a longer period. It's crucial to reach out to your bank before the CD matures to discuss intentions and avoid automatic rollover into a lower-rate account. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ed Martin, President Trump's nominee for U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, is facing scrutiny for allegedly misleading testimony about his relationship with Timothy Hale-Cusanelli, a convicted Jan. 6 Capitol rioter described by federal prosecutors as a "Nazi sympathizer." Despite NPR reporting in September 2024 about Hale-Cusanelli's antisemitic and racist statements, Martin continued to praise Hale-Cusanelli and appear with him at multiple events. In written testimony to the Senate, Martin claimed he was unaware of Hale-Cusanelli's past comments until after giving him an award, a claim contradicted by earlier evidence.</p>
