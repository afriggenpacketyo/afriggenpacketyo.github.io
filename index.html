          <p>Many Syrian families who returned to their hometowns after years in displacement camps are facing immense challenges, including widespread destruction and a lack of basic services. Nadima al-Barakat, a 36-year-old returnee, lives in a tent on the rubble of her destroyed home, emphasizing that while they've lost their homes, they haven't lost their will to survive. Basic infrastructure such as electricity, water, sanitation, and medical services are severely lacking, and families are struggling to rebuild with limited resources. Local activists are appealing for international organizations to help with reconstruction efforts, as the scale of the destruction is too vast to handle alone.</p>

          <p>A recent Kyodo News survey reveals that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens expect rice prices to decrease following the appointment of a new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, after his predecessor was dismissed for insensitive comments about receiving gifted rice. The average price of rice in supermarkets has remained high due to a poor harvest in 2023, reaching a record 4,268 yen per 5 kilograms. Many respondents believe that rice prices should be brought below 3,000 yen per 5 kg, which is lower than the target recently pledged by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. The survey also indicates a slight increase in support for Ishiba's Cabinet.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that the media committed malfeasance in its coverage of Donald Trump during the 2024 presidential campaign, not by covering up Joe Biden's age, but by normalizing Trump's actions surrounding the January 6th insurrection. The author contends that reporters downplayed or ignored Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 election in exchange for access and interviews. The author suggests that the media's failure to consistently remind voters of Trump's actions contributed to his return to the White House, and that voters ultimately prioritized issues like inflation over concerns about democracy.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK party has committed to fully reinstating winter fuel payments to pensioners and abolishing the two-child benefit cap if elected into government. The announcement puts pressure on Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has faced criticism for his approach to these policies. Reform UK plans to fund these initiatives by cutting net-zero projects and eliminating the use of hotels for asylum seekers. The move highlights the growing divisions within Labour and sets the stage for a contentious debate on social welfare policies.</p>

          <p>The American economy has been weathering a period of intense chaos marked by a pandemic, recession, inflation, and trade wars, which John Lettieri calls the "era of thrash." Despite these challenges, businesses have shown surprising resilience, with high corporate profits, low unemployment, and increased productivity. However, the article questions whether this resilience can last, as the economy faces new vulnerabilities, including higher interest rates, rising personal debt, and political instability. The author suggests that the government's response to the pandemic and the political instability are the main factors for these events. (not investment advice)</p>
