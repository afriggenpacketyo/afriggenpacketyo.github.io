          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-06 14:32:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center suggests that using a smartphone while on the toilet could increase the risk of developing hemorrhoids by 46 percent. Researchers surveyed 125 adults and found that phone users, particularly younger adults, tend to sit for significantly longer periods, which increases pressure on rectal veins. This prolonged sitting, rather than straining, is identified as the primary risk factor, as the unsupported posture of sitting on a toilet exerts more pressure on the pelvic floor. The study's lead author advises against turning bathroom visits into extended scrolling breaks to mitigate this health concern.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump has indicated he may send troops to Chicago for a significant crackdown on immigration and crime, sharing a provocative social media post alluding to deportations. This follows similar deployments in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., with the Los Angeles action being ruled a violation of the Posse Comitatus Act by a federal judge. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson have strongly condemned the threat as authoritarian. Meanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security has reportedly begun positioning personnel and equipment at a naval station near the city for a potential multi-week operation.</p>

          <p>More than 25 million people across the U.S. Northeast, from Pennsylvania to Maine, are under alerts for severe weather and potential flash flooding. A Severe Thunderstorm Watch is in effect for major cities including Philadelphia, New York City, and Boston, with the primary threats being damaging wind gusts and torrential rain. A cold front sweeping the region is expected to trigger scattered thunderstorms throughout Saturday afternoon and into the evening. Forecasters warn that slow-moving storms could lead to localized flash flooding, particularly in urban areas with poor drainage, before cooler air moves in on Sunday.</p>

Despite a somewhat unsteady first half, the team rallied to extend their winning streak to 30 consecutive Test matches. Sadia Kabeya and Kelsey Clifford each scored two tries in the decisive victory. However, the win was tempered by injuries to key players Ellie Kildunne and Hannah Botterman, which could pose challenges for the team as they advance in the tournament.</p>

          <p>The recent Reform UK party conference in Birmingham demonstrates the party's significant and rapid expansion over the past year. The event, held at the large NEC venue, has adopted the scale of a major party conference while maintaining an insurgent, grassroots energy. Political editor Chris Mason notes the professionalization of the party's structure, with regional stands and a growing volunteer network, attracting disaffected voters from both the Conservative and Labour parties. Leader Nigel Farage's call for "discipline" among activists underscores a serious ambition to move beyond protest and become a major political force.</p>

          <p>Postal traffic into the United States has fallen by more than 80 percent after the Trump administration eliminated a long-standing tariff exemption for low-value imports. The Universal Postal Union (UPU) reported that the rule change, which took effect on August 29, 2025, has caused major operational disruptions as carriers are now responsible for collecting duties on parcels valued under $800. This has led 88 foreign postal operators to suspend some or all services to the U.S. The "de minimis" exemption was originally designed to ease trade, but its removal now subjects countless small purchases to new customs vetting and tariffs.

The reshuffle involves numerous changes in junior ministerial roles across various departments, including the appointment of business leader Jason Stockwood to the House of Lords as a business minister.

          <p>Hundreds of LGBTQ+ Catholics and their families participated in a Holy Year pilgrimage in Rome, celebrating a greater sense of acceptance within the Church. An Italian bishop celebrated a Mass for the pilgrims, stating it is time to "restore dignity to everyone," which was met with a standing ovation. Participants credited the late Pope Francis for fostering a more welcoming tone, which they hope will be continued by his successor, Pope Leo XIV. The event, listed on the Vatican's official Jubilee calendar, marks a significant shift from 25 years ago, when a similar pilgrimage was met with official resistance.</p>

          <p>School districts across the United States are implementing locked magnetic pouches, such as those made by Yondr, to enforce new statewide bans on cellphones in classrooms. Students are required to place their phones in the pouches upon entering school, which they carry with them but can only be unlocked at magnetic stations at the end of the day. The policy aims to reduce distractions and improve student engagement, a move supported by many educators who felt phones were hindering learning. While some students have welcomed the change, others have expressed frustration and sought ways to circumvent the system.</p>

          <p>Farmers in the American Midwest hold divided opinions regarding the effectiveness of the Trump administration's extended trade truce with China. While some remain hopeful that the go-slow approach to negotiations will eventually result in more stable and substantial orders, others are increasingly pessimistic. Many have already seen a significant drop in exports as Beijing has shifted to alternative suppliers, particularly Brazil, for key agricultural commodities. This has created a deep sense of uncertainty, with many farmers fearing that new markets will not be able to replace the massive demand once provided by China. (not investment advice)</p>

This shift is undermining the traditional social contract where the state was the primary employer.

          <p>Germany's pay-as-you-go pension system, established in the 1950s, is facing an existential crisis due to demographic shifts. The system relies on the working population to fund current retirees, but a declining birth rate and increasing life expectancy mean fewer workers are supporting a growing number of pensioners. With the baby boomer generation nearing retirement, economists warn of immense pressure on social security, rising pension fees for employees, and a potential downward spiral of higher taxes and an exodus of skilled workers.
