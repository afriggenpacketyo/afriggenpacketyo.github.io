          <p>An attack at Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Colorado, left six people injured, with the FBI investigating the incident as a targeted act of terrorism. Witnesses reported that the suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, yelled "free Palestine" during the attack, using a makeshift flamethrower and Molotov cocktails. The victims, ranging in age from 67 to 88, were participating in a walk to remember Israeli hostages, and one is in critical condition. The FBI is conducting law enforcement activity in El Paso County, and officials have condemned the hate-filled act.

          <p>China has refuted claims by the U.S. that it violated the Geneva trade agreement, asserting instead that the U.S. undermined the deal's terms. Trade tensions have resurfaced following a meeting between U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his Chinese counterpart, leading to accusations from both sides. The Trump administration's export restrictions on semiconductor design software and chemicals, along with visa revocations for Chinese students, have drawn criticism from Beijing. China, in turn, has maintained control over its rare earths exports, contrary to Washington's expectations; these actions have led to increased uncertainty in bilateral economic and trade relations.</p>
