          <p>The Justice Department has initiated an investigation into the student-run Harvard Law Review, raising concerns about the Trump administration's use of power for political purposes. The probe comes amid accusations highlighting how the administration is allegedly wielding its authority to pursue a political agenda. This action has sparked debate regarding the appropriate boundaries between governmental oversight and academic freedom, particularly within institutions dedicated to legal scholarship. The investigation's implications could extend beyond Harvard, potentially affecting other academic publications and institutions. </p>

          <p>President Trump is actively lobbying Senate Republicans to pass the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," a comprehensive tax bill that represents a significant portion of the GOP's legislative agenda. A senior White House official stated that the administration is undertaking an "all-out advocacy effort," including sending high-ranking officials to Capitol Hill and potentially to individual states, to secure support for the bill. Key sticking points include concerns among some Republican senators that the bill is too costly and could lead to significant Medicaid cuts, despite Trump's assurances that only waste, fraud, and abuse will be targeted. The bill's passage relies on a narrow Republican majority and the use of reconciliation to bypass the usual 60-vote threshold in the Senate. </p>

          <p>President Trump is advocating for his "Big, Beautiful Bill" as a solution to what he describes as the "four disastrous years" under former President Joe Biden, emphasizing its potential to revitalize the U.S. economy. The bill, already passed by the House, includes provisions for significant tax cuts, spending cuts, and investments in American energy and infrastructure. Trump claims the bill will balance the budget, stimulate energy production, upgrade air travel infrastructure, and enhance border security. He also asserts it will repeal Biden's EV mandate and redirect SNAP benefits exclusively to Americans. </p>

          <p>Shigeo Nagashima, a legendary figure in Japanese baseball and recipient of the People's Honor Award, has died at the age of 89 due to pneumonia. Nagashima, known as "Mr. Giants," was a key player for the Yomiuri Giants, leading them to nine consecutive Central League and Japan Series titles from 1965 to 1973, and later managed the team. His charismatic presence and on-field heroics made him a national icon during Japan's rapid economic growth in the 1960s and 1970s. His death marks the end of an era for Japanese baseball, and he is fondly remembered by many as a symbol of the country's post-war resurgence. </p>

          <p>A former assistant to Sean "Diddy" Combs, identified as "Mia," concluded her three days of testimony in Combs' sex trafficking trial, facing intense cross-examination from defense attorneys. Mia testified about alleged sexual assault and torment during her employment, while defense attorneys challenged her credibility by presenting text messages and social media posts expressing love and admiration for Combs. Prosecutors attempted to mitigate the damage to her credibility by highlighting that her social media posts were part of her job and did not reflect the abuse she allegedly suffered. The trial continues with further witnesses and evidence presented by both sides. </p>
