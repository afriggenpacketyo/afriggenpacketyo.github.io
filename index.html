          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey was indicted by a federal grand jury in Virginia on charges of making a false statement and obstruction related to his 2020 congressional testimony. This action followed President Donald Trump's public pressure on Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute Comey, raising concerns about political influence. Comey denies the charges, asserting his innocence and expressing confidence in the federal judicial system. His son-in-law resigned from the U.S. Attorney's Office shortly after the indictment.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a 100% tariff on branded or patented pharmaceutical products imported into the U.S. starting October 1, with an exemption for companies building manufacturing plants domestically. This measure aims to incentivize drug production within the U.S., a goal already pursued by some major pharmaceutical firms. The industry has warned that these tariffs could increase costs, deter investment, and disrupt the drug supply chain, potentially leading to higher prices and medication shortages for patients.

          <p>A grand jury in Northern Virginia indicted former FBI Director James Comey on two criminal counts: making a false statement to Congress and obstructing a congressional proceeding, but rejected a third charge. The allegations stem from his September 2020 testimony regarding media leaks about FBI investigations into Hillary Clinton and alleged Russian election meddling. Comey denies the charges, while Attorney General Pam Bondi stated the indictment reflects a commitment to accountability for abusing power. This article details the specific nature of the charges and the unusual rejection of one count.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump announced a new wave of tariffs, including a 100% levy on branded drug imports, a 25% tax on heavy-duty trucks, and 50% duties on kitchen and bathroom cabinets, effective October 1. These measures are intended to protect US manufacturers from foreign competition and address a perceived "flooding" of these products into the country. Despite calls from US businesses against further tariffs, the administration is expanding its protectionist policies, which could lead to higher prices for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The indictment of former FBI Director James Comey on charges of false statements and obstruction is widely seen as an escalation of President Trump's promise of political retribution against his critics. Concerns are rising about the weaponization of the Justice Department, particularly after Trump publicly called for Comey's prosecution. Legal experts describe the situation as an unprecedented collapse of the firewall between the White House and the Justice Department, with new prosecutors appointed who are perceived as loyalists. The case is poised to reignite debates over the 2016 Russian election-meddling investigation.</p>

          <p>An article critically examines the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, pointing out its extreme brevity and lack of specific details regarding the alleged false statements and obstruction. The piece argues that the indictment provides no substantive evidence to support the claims, contrasting it with typical federal indictments that offer detailed descriptions of alleged crimes. This vagueness fuels concerns among journalists and legal experts that the case is a politically motivated effort by an authoritarian president to target critics. Department of Justice sources reportedly describe the indictment as a significant abuse in the department's history.</p>

          <p>California Senate Bill 576, inspired by an 8-month-old baby being woken by a blaring commercial, seeks to regulate the volume of advertisements on streaming services like Netflix and Prime Video. Federal law already governs traditional TV ads, but streaming platforms are currently exempt. If signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, this bill could effectively set a national standard, as companies often adopt California's regulations nationwide. The Motion Picture Association has opposed the bill, citing complexities in controlling ad volumes from various sources.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Humberto, currently in the central Atlantic, has the potential to interact with another developing storm system nearby, possibly leading to the rare Fujiwhara effect. This phenomenon occurs when two tropical storms merge or spin around a common center. While unlikely for a full "dance" due to Humberto's greater strength, any interaction could slightly alter their forecast paths. Forecasters are monitoring the second system, expected to become Tropical Storm Imelda, as it tracks towards the Bahamas, increasing risks for the southeastern U.S. coast.</p>

The "very mean squirrel" has been observed leaping at legs, arms, and faces, causing lacerations requiring stitches in some cases. Animal experts suggest the unusual behavior likely stems from humans hand-feeding or raising the squirrel, causing it to lose its natural fear and become aggressive when not given food.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests the current U.S. economy is starkly divided, with a robust artificial intelligence sector contrasting sharply with a struggling consumer-oriented segment.

Cramer points to disappointing earnings from car dealers and homebuilders, and Starbucks' store reduction, as evidence of consumer weakness. He posits that strong GDP growth is largely skewed by AI-related gains, with little intersection with the daily lives of most workers. (not investment advice)</p>

Rats pose public health risks by transmitting diseases and contaminating food supplies. Experts emphasize that cutting off food sources and improving urban waste management are crucial to controlling these intelligent and prolific breeders, as traditional poisons are becoming less effective.</p>
