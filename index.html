          <p>A research note from CLSA suggests that China's leading semiconductor firms, SMIC and Hua Hong Semiconductor, will experience minimal negative effects from the Trump administration's proposed 100% tariff on imported chips. The analysis indicates these companies could even benefit from potential countermeasures by China and other nations. This assessment comes as President Trump announced the tariff, which would exempt companies manufacturing or investing heavily in the U.S., such as Nvidia and TSMC. China has already been diversifying its integrated circuit exports to other regions, which may help mitigate the impact of the new US policy.</p>

          <p>Following a significant 25% drop in Fortinet's stock due to comments about a nearly complete firewall refresh cycle, the broader cybersecurity sector experienced a downturn. The CNBC Investing Club notes that this has unfairly affected cloud-native companies like CrowdStrike, which do not rely on traditional firewalls. The article suggests this presents a potential buying opportunity, as the market reaction is seen as an overcorrection driven by sector-wide ETF trading rather than individual company fundamentals. The club is considering repurchasing shares in CrowdStrike and adding to its position in Palo Alto Networks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is reviewing a potential reversal of the ban on the "shark attack," an aggressive drill where drill sergeants swarm and yell at new recruits. The practice, largely ended in 2020 and replaced by a more structured exercise, is seen by supporters as essential for preparing soldiers for the chaos of battle. Hegseth has emphasized a "back to basics" approach to restore a warrior mentality and rigor in military training. The potential reinstatement is part of a broader effort to ensure training standards are sufficiently high, which also includes looking at other traditional practices.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly demanded the resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, citing problematic ties to China. The call follows concerns raised by Senator Tom Cotton regarding Tan's past investments in Chinese companies, some allegedly linked to the military. Intel, a major recipient of US government funds to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing, defended its chief executive, stating his commitment to US national security. The unusual presidential demand caused Intel's shares to fall and highlights the administration's aggressive stance on business ties with China in the technology sector.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed regulators to explore rule changes that would make it easier for employers to include non-traditional assets like cryptocurrencies, private equity, and real estate in 401(k) retirement plans. The initiative aims to give everyday workers access to investment classes previously reserved for the wealthy, potentially unlocking vast new funding sources. However, critics warn this could expose savers to higher risks, fees, and less transparency compared to traditional investments. This move aligns with the administration's broader efforts to roll back regulations and embrace the crypto industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tennis legend Venus Williams, age 45, was defeated by 22-year-old Jessica Bouzas Maneiro of Spain in the first round of the Cincinnati Open with a score of 6-4, 6-4. Despite a competitive effort where she recovered from an early deficit, Williams was ultimately outmatched by the in-form Spaniard's consistency. Williams expressed satisfaction with her performance, viewing it as a necessary step to gain more match experience rather than a disappointing loss. She is scheduled to compete next in the US Open mixed doubles and is likely to receive a wildcard for the singles tournament.</p>

The policy is predicted to have a negative impact on the U.S. economy, which was already showing signs of weakness.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced he will nominate Stephen Miran, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, to the Federal Reserve's board of governors. The temporary appointment, if confirmed by the Senate, would fill a vacant seat until January 2026. The move is seen as Trump's first opportunity to exert more direct influence on the independent agency, which he has frequently criticized for its interest rate policies. Miran, a defender of Trump's tariff policies and a past critic of the Fed, would likely add a voice in favor of lowering interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Netanyahu's Proposal for Full Gaza Occupation Sparks Division Among Israeli Leadership and Allies</h2>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plan for a full military occupation of Gaza is facing significant opposition from his own army chief, hostage families, and international allies. The army's chief of staff reportedly warned Netanyahu that such a move would be a "trap," endangering both soldiers and the remaining hostages. While Netanyahu has suggested handing governance to Arab forces post-occupation, the immediate plan for an expanded offensive in central Gaza raises fears of a worsening humanitarian crisis. This push is seen by many as a political maneuver to maintain his ultranationalist coalition government.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed a memorandum requiring colleges and universities to submit detailed admissions data to the Department of Education. The move is designed to enforce the 2023 Supreme Court ban on affirmative action by scrutinizing whether schools are using proxies like "diversity statements" to consider race. The new rule will compel institutions to report data on applicants' race, test scores, and GPAs, allowing the administration to clamp down on what it deems non-meritocratic practices. Critics call the move a "fishing expedition" that misunderstands the holistic nature of college admissions.</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old man has been arrested in Phoenix for allegedly throwing a sex toy during a WNBA game, which reportedly struck another fan. This is the second arrest related to a recent trend of fans tossing such objects onto the court or into the stands during games, a "prank" that appears to be spreading via social media. The incident is one of at least five to occur recently, prompting the league to reiterate its zero-tolerance policy. A cryptocurrency group has claimed responsibility for some incidents, though it denies affiliation with the arrested individuals.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the United States' recent response to a Chinese research vessel, the Xue Long 2, operating in international waters near Alaska reveals a hypocritical approach to maritime law. The U.S. Coast Guard's characterization of the vessel's legal scientific research as "malign state activity" contradicts the principles of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The author contends that while the U.S. frequently champions a "rules-based international order," its actions in this case prioritize political posturing over consistent application of the very laws it claims to uphold.</p>
