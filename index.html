          <p>The European Union is preparing for a potential trade conflict with the United States as the deadline for a new trade agreement approaches. Brussels has approved a significant package of counter-tariffs and is considering the use of its powerful "anti-coercion instrument," a tool designed to deter economic pressure from other nations. While negotiations for a deal continue, with a 15% tariff on EU imports being a possible outcome, the unpredictable nature of U.S. President Donald Trump's decision-making leaves the situation highly uncertain. The EU's response could range from targeted tit-for-tat tariffs to broader restrictions on trade and investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent summit between EU leaders and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing concluded with minimal progress, underscoring growing friction between the two powers. European officials voiced strong concerns over China's large trade surplus and its perceived support for Russia's war in Ukraine, which Chinese officials deflected. While the meeting yielded a joint statement on climate change cooperation, it failed to resolve fundamental disagreements on economic and geopolitical issues. The tense atmosphere suggests a long-term struggle for Europe, which is increasingly adopting a more hawkish stance while trying to maintain unity against China's attempts to divide the bloc.</p>

          <p>Military clashes between Thailand and Cambodia have intensified, resulting in dozens of casualties, primarily Thai civilians, after Thailand conducted airstrikes in response to alleged Cambodian artillery fire. The conflict, rooted in a century-old border dispute, represents the most severe escalation since 2011 and has been fueled by recent nationalist sentiments and internal Thai politics. Both nations have downgraded diplomatic ties, and despite calls for a ceasefire from regional partners like Malaysia, analysts fear the situation could worsen before any resolution is found. The conflict poses a significant challenge for the leaders of both countries amid a volatile political landscape.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has filed a $10 billion lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal and its owner, Rupert Murdoch, over an article detailing a sexually suggestive birthday card allegedly sent to Jeffrey Epstein. This legal action is the latest move in Trump's broader strategy of using the courts and executive power to punish media outlets he deems critical of his administration. Experts suggest the lawsuit serves multiple purposes: to discredit negative reporting, to warn other news organizations against unfavorable coverage, and to rally his base. This escalation marks a significant turn in the relationship between Trump and Murdoch, who have historically been allies.</p>

          <p>A coroner has officially ruled the death of 19-year-old Jay Slater as accidental, concluding he died from a fall from a significant height in a remote ravine in Tenerife. Slater went missing on June 17 after telling a friend he was lost in the mountains while attempting to walk back to his accommodation after a night out. The inquest heard that factors such as drug and alcohol consumption, lack of sleep, and inappropriate clothing likely contributed to the fatal fall. The coroner stated that the severe skull fractures would have caused instantaneous death, offering some consolation to the family that he did not suffer.</p>

Meanwhile, the humanitarian situation in Gaza has reached a catastrophic point, with U.N. agencies reporting that children are starving to death due to Israel's blockade and restrictions on aid. Aid organizations state that malnutrition is spreading rapidly, and preventable diseases are on the rise due to the collapse of sanitation and healthcare systems.</p>

          <p>Nearly two years into the war, the Gaza Strip faces a catastrophic humanitarian crisis, with official figures reporting over 58,000 Palestinian deaths, though independent studies suggest the toll could be much higher.

Medical infrastructure has collapsed, with no hospitals fully functional and basic supplies scarce.

          <p>A movement to eliminate artificial food dyes from American products is gaining traction, with the U.S. dairy industry recently pledging to remove them from ice cream by 2028. This follows pressure from health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s "Make America Healthy Again" initiative, which links these additives to health issues like hyperactivity in children. While most public health advocates support the move, food manufacturers face challenges in switching to natural colorings, which can be less stable and more expensive. The transition raises questions about consumer acceptance, as Americans have historically preferred the vibrant hues of artificial dyes, unlike their European counterparts.</p>

While some concerns have been raised about certain long-used chemicals being absorbed into the bloodstream, scientists emphasize that the dose makes the poison and the benefits of using sunscreen far outweigh the potential risks.

The legislation aims to convert these units into long-term housing for local residents by closing a loophole that allowed condos in apartment zones to be rented to tourists. Proponents argue the measure is a critical step to address the housing crisis, while opponents fear it will harm the local economy by hurting small businesses that service the tourism industry.

She cited disagreements with the party's direction, particularly its stances on transgender rights and the conflict in Palestine, as primary reasons for leaving. Black, who became the UK's youngest MP in centuries when first elected at age 20, had previously stepped down from Parliament, citing the toxic political environment. In a recent interview, she stated that the party had "capitulated" on issues important to her and that she would have left politics sooner if the more socially conservative Kate Forbes had become party leader.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold its benchmark interest rate steady at its upcoming meeting, despite escalating pressure from President Donald Trump to implement sharp cuts. Trump argues that high rates are hurting American families and businesses, while Fed Chair Jerome Powell has indicated that uncertainty from the administration's tariff policies has prevented rate reductions. Maintaining the current rate affects consumer finances, keeping borrowing costs for credit cards and loans high while offering better returns on savings accounts. Economists note that many consumer rates, like mortgages, are not directly tied to the Fed's benchmark. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A record-setting heatwave is gripping Finnish Lapland, with temperatures inside the Arctic Circle hovering around 30°C (86°F) for over two weeks, breaking a record from 1972. The extreme heat is causing concern for the region's ecosystem, particularly its famed reindeer, which are fleeing to roads to escape insects that thrive in the warmth. Scientists attribute the increasing frequency and intensity of such heatwaves to climate change, noting that the Arctic is warming four to five times faster than the rest of the planet. The unusual weather has also disrupted the region's tourism, which is traditionally centered around its cool climate and winter activities.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell engaged in a tense, public disagreement over the costs of a renovation project at the Fed's headquarters. During a rare presidential visit to the central bank, Trump claimed the project's cost had ballooned to $3.1 billion, a figure Powell immediately disputed. The confrontation, captured on camera, represents a direct and personal escalation of Trump's long-standing pressure on Powell to lower interest rates. Analysts view the focus on the renovation as a potential pretext for Trump to justify firing Powell, a move that would be legally contentious and could destabilize financial markets.</p>

          <p>Police in Scotland have arrested a 67-year-old man in connection with the murder of Shona Stevens, who was killed more than 30 years ago. Stevens, a 31-year-old university student, was brutally attacked in a wooded area near her home in Irvine, North Ayrshire, in November 1994 and died from severe head injuries three days later. The arrest marks a significant breakthrough in the cold case, which saw renewed attention last year when a £20,000 reward was offered for information.

          <p>Tennessee state attorneys are appealing a judge's order that requires them to transport a death row inmate to a hospital to deactivate his heart implant on the morning of his execution. The state argues the trip would cause security risks and "chaos," while the inmate's lawyers insist the device must be turned off to prevent it from delivering painful shocks during the lethal injection procedure. The inmate, Byron Black, is scheduled for execution on August 5. This unusual legal conflict highlights the complex medical and ethical issues that can arise in capital punishment cases, with the state and defense attorneys clashing over procedure, timing, and risk.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing increased pressure to formally recognize a Palestinian state, following France's commitment to do so and a recommendation from a parliamentary committee. The Foreign Affairs Committee report, supported by Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs, argued that statehood is an "inalienable right" that should not be conditional. However, the government's official position, echoed by Conservative MPs on the committee, is that recognition should be part of a long-term, negotiated two-state solution. The debate intensifies as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza worsens, with Starmer reiterating calls for a ceasefire as a step toward recognition.</p>

This shift is viewed not as a sign of decline, but as an indicator of the league's maturation and increased competitiveness. Historically, factors like vast travel distances, varied playing surfaces, and officiating bias gave MLS home teams a stark edge. Now, improved travel logistics, the implementation of VAR for more accurate refereeing, and more sophisticated away-game tactics have leveled the playing field, suggesting MLS is evolving into a more balanced and globally respected championship.</p>

The president has tried to downplay the scandal, but his efforts to change the subject with bizarre social media posts and attacks on political rivals have not managed to dislodge the Epstein story from the headlines.</p>

          <p>California's Democratic leaders are contemplating a significant political maneuver: abandoning the state's independent redistricting process to redraw congressional districts for partisan advantage. This potential move is a direct response to efforts in Texas, reportedly urged by Donald Trump, to gerrymander its own districts to favor Republicans and secure control of Congress. The proposal would likely require a statewide ballot measure and could upend California's voter-approved system designed to prevent political interference. The situation sets the stage for a potential "gerrymandering arms race" between the nation's largest blue and red states, with major implications for the balance of power in Washington.</p>

In an experiment where participants interacted with a robot greeter, the extroverted version was rated as more enjoyable, but the neurotic one, which expressed anxiety and tentativeness, was often described as understanding deep emotions. This research challenges the industry's overwhelming focus on creating confident, assertive robots. The findings suggest that incorporating traits like neuroticism could make robots more relatable in certain contexts, though it may not be desirable for tasks requiring high confidence, like autonomous driving.</p>
