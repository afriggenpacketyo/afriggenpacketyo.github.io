          <p>An object believed to be an unexploded wartime bomb was discovered at a construction site on Hiroshima University's Kasumi campus in western Japan. The object, measuring around 90 centimeters long and 25 cm in diameter, prompted the restriction of access to the site and cancellation of afternoon classes. The Self-Defense Forces were called in to dispose of the object, which was found during excavation work for the demolition of a building belonging to the university's School of Pharmaceutical Sciences. The location is approximately 1.8 kilometers south of JR Hiroshima Station.</p>

          <p>Addiction experts are cautioning that proposed congressional budget cuts to addiction funding could lead to a surge in overdose deaths. A letter signed by over 300 physicians, harm reduction workers, and researchers was delivered to Congress, warning of "dire consequences" if programs battling the drug overdose epidemic are defunded. The letter highlights the White House's proposed budget for 2026, which suggests slashing billions from key agencies like the CDC and SAMHSA, despite a roughly 26% drop in fatal overdoses in 2024. Experts fear that rural areas and poor urban neighborhoods will be disproportionately affected, potentially reversing recent progress in combating the opioid crisis.</p>

Judge Dabney Friedrich denied a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit filed by nonprofit groups, arguing that undocumented immigrants paying taxes deserve the same privacy protections as citizens. The decision comes after the resignation of a former acting IRS commissioner over the deal allowing ICE to submit names and addresses for cross-verification against tax records.

However, these rates do not include previous tariffs imposed during Trump's initial term or other duties on specific goods.

He asserts that this tactic is being used to meet political or military objectives, potentially constituting a war crime. The IPC reports that the entire population of Gaza is experiencing acute food insecurity, with a significant portion facing catastrophic conditions, leading to severe malnutrition and death.</p>

          <p>The United Nations' aviation council has ruled that Russia is responsible for the downing of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine in 2014, which resulted in the deaths of nearly 300 people. The Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) stated that Russia failed to uphold its obligations under international air law. The ruling follows a case launched by Australia and the Netherlands, who are now seeking reparations from Russia. The flight was shot down over eastern Ukraine by a Russian-made BUK surface-to-air missile during fighting between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian forces.</p>
