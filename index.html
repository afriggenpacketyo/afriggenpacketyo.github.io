          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying National Guard units to Oregon, following a legal challenge initiated by California and Oregon. This ruling came after the judge previously halted the use of Oregon's own National Guard and questioned the administration's subsequent attempt to send troops from neighboring states. The judge expressed incredulity at the federal government's actions, stating they appeared to contravene her earlier order, especially given that conditions on the ground in Portland had not significantly changed. This legal battle underscores a growing constitutional dispute regarding the President's power to deploy federalized forces against the wishes of state governors, raising questions about state sovereignty and the appropriate use of military assistance in civil affairs.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets are anticipated to open mixed, tracking Wall Street's recent gains which were fueled by a significant tech rally. This rally stemmed from a massive deal between OpenAI and AMD, presenting a direct challenge to chipmaker giant Nvidia. Investors in the region are closely watching chip stocks, with Japan's Nikkei 225 index poised for a higher open, contrasting with Australia's ASX/S&P 200 experiencing early losses. U.S. equity futures showed little change after major benchmarks hit fresh records on Monday, buoyed by AMD shares skyrocketing almost 24% following the OpenAI deal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Connecticut mother, Kristen Hogan, has been charged with two counts of attempted murder and interfering with an officer after allegedly poisoning her husband with antifreeze. The incident occurred amidst a custody battle for their child. Authorities claim Hogan admitted to putting ethylene glycol in her husband's wine and tea, intending to make him sick as "payback" for mental abuse, though she denied intent to kill. Their child was also hospitalized with similar symptoms. Investigators found searches on Hogan's phone for chemical compounds and their lethal dosages.</p>

          <p>Rescue workers are actively assisting hundreds of hikers who became trapped by heavy snow at tourist campsites on a slope of Mount Everest in Tibet. Around 350 hikers successfully reached a designated meeting point, while rescuers remain in contact with an additional 200 individuals, all stranded at elevations exceeding 16,000 feet. The snowstorm, which struck during a weeklong national holiday in China, was described as unusually severe for October, causing up to three feet of snow and crushing tents, leading to a real risk of hypothermia. This challenging situation highlights the unpredictable dangers of high-altitude environments, with ongoing efforts to clear paths and bring the trapped individuals to safety.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has closed a criminal investigation into Olivet University, an evangelical institution, declining to pursue human trafficking charges against its officials. This decision allows a civil lawsuit, brought by former students alleging surveillance, forced labor, and deprivation of independence, to proceed. The university, which previously faced fines and closures in New York for money laundering, welcomed the closure of the federal probe, asserting that accusers sought to manipulate the visa system. The outcome shifts the focus to civil courts to determine the university's accountability for alleged infractions.</p>

          <p>The article provides a comprehensive overview of the ongoing legal and political battle surrounding the Trump administration's attempts to deploy National Guard troops to Democratic-led cities like Portland and Chicago. Federal judges, including one appointed by Trump, have issued rulings blocking or delaying these deployments, citing concerns over state sovereignty and the justification for military intervention in civilian affairs. Governors and local officials in affected states have vehemently opposed these actions, describing them as an abuse of power and an exaggeration of local unrest to create a pretext for federal overreach. Protests have occurred in response to these deployments, with officials arguing that the federal presence escalates tensions rather than resolves them.</p>

          <p>New research published in Environmental Research indicates a link between long-term exposure to sulfur dioxide, a major pollutant from mining fossil fuels, and an increased risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The study was prompted by a higher incidence of ALS cases in New Brunswick, Canada, leading researchers to compare diagnosed individuals with healthy controls based on environmental records. Subjects with higher exposure had a 23% greater chance of an ALS diagnosis, though the study notes association, not causation.

Collier also revealed Engelbert's alleged dismissive comments about player salaries and the league's success. This critique comes as the WNBA experiences surging popularity and rising franchise valuations, yet faces ongoing labor negotiations with players demanding higher salaries and a larger share of revenue. Collier's strong remarks highlight a deeply strained relationship between players and league management, with many players supporting her stance.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he would "take a look" at pardoning Ghislaine Maxwell, the convicted sexual assault trafficker, despite claiming he hadn't heard her name in a long time. This comment followed the Supreme Court's rejection of Maxwell's appeal. Trump also mentioned that Sean "Diddy" Combs, recently sentenced for a prostitution conviction, had requested a pardon. These remarks have drawn scrutiny, especially concerning the Justice Department's handling of Epstein-related cases and the potential political implications of such pardons, which legal experts suggest could incentivize Maxwell's cooperation.</p>

          <p>Brian K. Williams, a former Deputy Mayor for Public Safety in Los Angeles, was sentenced to one year of probation and 50 hours of community service for making a false bomb threat. Williams admitted to fabricating a threat against City Hall, which he later attributed to severe stress and mental health issues following personal tragedies. Prosecutors and defense attorneys agreed on a probation sentence, acknowledging his lack of prior criminal history and years of public service. The incident, which diverted police resources, was deemed an aberration stemming from acute personal anxiety.</p>

This marks the second fatal bear attack in Arkansas in recent weeks, though a large mammal ecologist noted such incidents are "exceedingly rare."

          <p>The UK Conservative Party has announced plans to abolish the Sentencing Council and grant ministers direct authority to issue sentencing guidelines in England and Wales.

This proposal follows a dispute between the council and the Labour government over pre-sentence reports for minority groups. The Conservatives aim to ensure sentencing policy is set by parliamentarians, asserting that the public desires tougher sentences than current guidelines recommend.</p>

          <p>A career federal prosecutor in Virginia, Elizabeth Yusi, is reportedly resisting pressure from Trump allies to file criminal mortgage fraud charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James. Yusi believes there is insufficient probable cause for the charges, despite a Trump ally being installed as the US attorney for the eastern district of Virginia. This situation highlights direct political pressure on the Justice Department, with several prosecutors in the office having been fired or resigned recently.

This move removes a key talking point used by the United States and European Union, which criticized China's dual status as an economic powerhouse claiming benefits intended for poorer nations. By doing so, China aligns itself more closely with the Global South, reframing its international position. This tactical retreat, in line with Mao Zedong's theory of protracted war, allows China to conserve resources and reshape the geopolitical landscape in its long-term favor.</p>
