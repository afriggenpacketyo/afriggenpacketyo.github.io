          <p>Two 23-year-old men have appeared in court in Warwickshire, England, facing charges including sexual assault and kidnap related to a 12-year-old girl. The case has drawn political attention, with local and national figures commenting on the unconfirmed immigration status of the accused, sparking a debate about police transparency. Authorities maintain they are following national guidelines by not disclosing such details during an active investigation, while the suspects are due in crown court in late August.</p>

          <p>An electrical engineer in Orange County, Vermont, is addressing poor cellular reception by restoring old pay phones and making them available for free public use. He personally covers the minimal operating costs, allowing the modified phones to make free calls across the U.S. and Canada using only an internet connection. The project has proven highly useful for stranded drivers and for students needing to contact parents, a need that may grow with a new state-wide ban on cell phones in schools.</p>

          <p>Rupert Matthews, the police and crime commissioner for Leicestershire and Rutland, has defected from the Conservative Party to Reform UK, giving the party its first such position. Matthews, who was re-elected in May 2024, made the announcement alongside Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, stating a need to remove "wokeness" from the justice system. The move has been criticized by local Conservatives, who argue he should call a by-election as he was elected on a Tory platform.</p>

The lawmakers argue the proposed districts are a partisan gerrymander designed to unfairly expand the GOP's majority in the U.S. House. In response, Republican Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to remove the absent members from the legislature, citing a legal opinion, while the Democrats maintain their actions are necessary to protect the democratic process.</p>

          <p>Amid economic uncertainty, annuities are gaining attention as a tool for securing retirement income, but they are not suitable for everyone. Experts suggest that near-retirees looking to lock in currently high interest rates and risk-averse individuals prioritizing guaranteed income may find them beneficial. However, younger investors with long time horizons, individuals who may need liquid access to their funds, or those carrying high-interest debt should likely avoid purchasing an annuity at this time.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts predict that Certificate of Deposit (CD) rates will likely remain stable through August, as the Federal Reserve holds its key interest rate steady due to a recent uptick in inflation. However, with rate cuts still anticipated later in the year, some banks have already begun to slightly lower their CD offerings. Currently, short-term CDs of one year or less are providing more competitive rates than long-term ones, as banks are hesitant to lock in higher rates for extended periods in an uncertain environment.

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced his intention to significantly raise tariffs on goods from India, citing the country's large-scale purchases of Russian oil. In a social media post, Trump accused India of profiting from the war in Ukraine by buying Russian oil and reselling it on the open market. This follows a previous threat to impose a 25% tariff on Indian goods, though specific details of the new, substantial increase have not yet been provided. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers have identified a bacteria, Vibrio pectenicida, as the culprit behind a devastating sea star wasting disease that has killed over 5 billion sea stars off North America's Pacific coast since 2013. The epidemic, which caused lesions and limb detachment, decimated over 20 species, including a 90% population loss for the sunflower sea star. This discovery, detailed in Nature Ecology and Evolution, solves a decade-long mystery and may allow for interventions to help restore sea star populations and the kelp forest ecosystems they protect.</p>
