          <p>Ticketing marketplace StubHub is reportedly moving forward with its initial public offering, targeting a September launch after pausing plans in April. The company has filed an updated prospectus showing 10% revenue growth in the first quarter to $397.6 million, though its net loss also widened. This move comes as the IPO market shows signs of revival after a period of high inflation and interest rate hikes. StubHub, reacquired by co-founder Eric Baker in 2020, faces significant competition from rivals like Ticketmaster and Vivid Seats in the online ticketing space. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has stated that individuals who commit heinous crimes against women, such as sexual assault, should "probably" forfeit the right to choose their legal gender. The comments were made in an interview regarding the controversial case of Isla Bryson, a transgender offender convicted of two acts of sexual assault. Sturgeon acknowledged her part in the debate over gender recognition losing rationality and admitted she should have paused the legislation. Her apparent shift in position has drawn criticism from political opponents and some within her own party.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is expected to strengthen into the first hurricane of the season later this week. The storm developed west of the Cabo Verde islands, which experienced flooding, and currently poses no immediate threat to the United States. As of Monday, Erin had maximum sustained winds of 45 mph and was moving westward. Early models project it could become a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean, though its long-term path remains uncertain, with most forecasts showing a turn to the north.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has declared that gold will not be subject to tariffs, reversing a recent U.S. Customs and Border Protection ruling that would have applied duties to certain gold bars from Switzerland. The announcement was made via a Truth Social post, leading to a subsequent drop in gold futures prices. The customs ruling had indicated that 1 kilogram and 100-ounce gold bars, crucial for backing COMEX futures contracts, would face a 39% tariff. The Swiss Precious Metal Association had warned the duties could negatively affect the international flow of physical gold. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ford is pivoting its electric vehicle strategy toward affordability, announcing plans to produce a midsize electric pickup truck with a starting price around $30,000. This move represents a significant shift from its more expensive models like the F-150 Lightning and comes amid slowing EV demand and changing federal incentives. The company aims to compete with both gas-powered trucks and more affordable Chinese EVs by simplifying vehicle design and manufacturing processes. Despite the ambitious goal, Ford CEO Jim Farley acknowledged the historical difficulty of launching successful, profitable budget vehicles in the U.S. market.</p>

          <p>A new study on a major earthquake in Myanmar suggests that California's next "Big One" on the San Andreas fault may not follow expected patterns. Researchers from Caltech found that a recent magnitude 7.7 quake in Myanmar ruptured a much longer section of a similar fault than anticipated, including segments that had ruptured relatively recently. This implies that earthquakes do not necessarily repeat in predictable ways and that seismic gaps may not be reliable indicators of where the next major event will occur. The findings highlight the complexity and potential randomness of large seismic events.</p>

The discovery, designated GW231123, was made using the LVK gravitational wave detector network.

          <p>This opinion article argues that the current political crisis over partisan gerrymandering in states like Texas stems primarily from the Supreme Court's 2019 decision in *Rucho v. Common Cause*. The ruling declared that challenges to partisan gerrymandering are a "political question" that federal courts cannot decide, effectively removing a key check on the practice. The author contends this was a flawed decision that enables state legislatures to rig elections with surgical precision using modern data. It suggests that while Trump's actions are problematic, the court's abdication of its role is the root cause of the democratic decay.</p>

          <p>Renowned venture capitalist Mike Moritz has publicly defended Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan following President Trump's demand for his resignation. In an op-ed, Moritz, formerly of Sequoia Capital, called Trump's attack "artless bullying" and urged the Intel board to show "backbone" by standing with Tan. The president and other officials had raised concerns over Tan's ties to Chinese companies. Moritz praised Tan's track record, including his turnaround of Cadence Design Systems, and asserted there is no one better equipped to lead Intel's transformation. Tan has since met with the White House to address the concerns.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in Gaza that killed five Al Jazeera journalists has drawn widespread condemnation from the United Nations and the European Union. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for an independent and impartial investigation, noting that over 240 journalists have been killed in the conflict. The Israeli military claimed one of the journalists, Anas al-Sharif, headed a Hamas cell, an allegation rejected by Al Jazeera and media rights groups. The incident has intensified scrutiny of journalist safety in the region and prompted calls for greater protection and accountability under international law.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece highlights the significant privacy risks and ineffectiveness of growing facial-recognition and ID-check mandates online, such as those in the U.K.'s Online Safety Act. The author argues these measures, intended to protect children, create insecure systems that are easily circumvented while forcing users to surrender anonymity. The article points to the recent data breach at the Tea Dating Advice app as an example of how such verification systems can fail catastrophically. It suggests that instead of invasive surveillance, lawmakers should focus on generally applicable safety measures that protect all users, not just minors.</p>

          <p>A new research note from Melius Research has prompted a reevaluation of Salesforce, which was downgraded due to the disruptive threat of artificial intelligence on the software-as-a-service (SaaS) industry. The analysis suggests that as AI tools increase worker productivity, companies may reduce the number of employees, thereby cutting demand for seat-based software licenses like those sold by Salesforce. While Salesforce is actively developing its own AI products, the firm's core business model faces significant headwinds, leading to a more cautious investor outlook for the enterprise software giant.

          <p>A comprehensive new study warns that the global transition to clean energy could face significant shortages of up to 12 essential minerals by 2100, even under moderate emission-reduction scenarios. The research highlights the world's dependence on materials like lithium, cobalt, and tin for technologies such as batteries and solar panels. However, the article also notes that fears of "peak mineral" may be overstated, as rapid technological innovation is already creating substitutes and reducing the required amounts of certain minerals. This dynamic, similar to how technology overcame "peak oil" fears, suggests the future mineral landscape is highly unpredictable.</p>

          <p>A Romanian citizen, Catalin-Marius Graur, has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for his role in a large-scale fraud scheme targeting California's welfare recipients. Graur used sophisticated skimming devices on ATMs and point-of-sale machines to steal Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) card information, which was then used to create fraudulent cards and drain funds. The scheme, which was part of a broader criminal organization, impacted thousands of low-income individuals. The case highlights the vulnerability of older EBT cards, though California has recently rolled out new cards with microchips to combat such fraud.</p>
