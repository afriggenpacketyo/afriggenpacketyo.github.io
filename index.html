          <p>Due to high universal tariffs implemented by President Donald Trump, which have sparked global trade tensions, exchanges are implementing halts in trading to allow a moment for cooler heads to prevail and avoid market crashes. During regular hours, trading in equities may be paused market-wide if declines in the S&P 500 trigger a circuit breaker. There are three levels: a 7% fall before 3:25 p.m. ET halts trading for 15 minutes, a 13% drop before 3:25 p.m. ET also halts trading for 15 minutes, and a 20% plunge suspends trading for the day.

          <p>The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld a judge's order to return Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to the U.S. after he was wrongly deported to El Salvador. The court rejected the Trump administration's motion to block the order, emphasizing that the U.S. government cannot remove someone lawfully present without due process. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis had ruled that Garcia must be returned by a specific deadline. The appeals court judges deemed the government's arguments against intervention by federal courts as unconscionable.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked President Donald Trump's firings of two federal board members, Gwynne Wilcox and Cathy Harris, setting up a potential Supreme Court fight. The court cited Supreme Court precedent regarding removal restrictions for government officials of multimember adjudicatory boards. The Trump administration is likely to appeal the matter to the Supreme Court. The ruling has sparked intense backlash from the Trump administration, which accuses judges of hindering executive actions.</p>

          <p>The former top vaccine regulator at the FDA, Dr. Peter Marks, claims he was forced to resign after refusing to grant Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s team unrestricted access to a vaccine safety database. Marks feared the data might be manipulated. He had proposed a plan to increase vaccine transparency, including overhauling the VAERS system. Marks attributes a recent measles death to the HHS's tepid response and Kennedy's support for misinformation about vaccines.</p>

Apple had withdrawn its ADP system for U.K. users in February as a result of the government's order.

          <p>Measles, traditionally a childhood disease, is increasingly affecting adults due to declining vaccination rates. The current U.S. outbreak, centered in communities with low childhood vaccination, is spilling over into adult populations. Unvaccinated adults are particularly vulnerable to severe complications, as measles becomes deadlier with age. The virus also has the ability to induce “immune amnesia,” making survivors susceptible to other diseases. Public health experts warn that declining vaccination rates could lead to more adult cases and long-term health consequences.</p>
