          <h2>Musk Responds to Drug Use Allegations Amid Trump Meeting</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 14:41:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a White House event alongside President Trump, Tesla CEO Elon Musk addressed a reporter's inquiry about a New York Times report detailing his alleged drug use and family legal matters. Musk questioned the credibility of the New York Times, referencing a ruling against them regarding reporting on Russia-gate. Musk, who previously led Trump's DOGE government cost-cutting initiative, attempted to steer the conversation away from the allegations. Musk's actions and statements reflect his ongoing involvement in both the tech industry and political spheres, navigating scrutiny and controversy. Optimism around Musk remains divided given his penchant for controversy and high profile positions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has revised its COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, stating that healthy children "may receive" the vaccine, replacing the previous broad recommendation for universal vaccination. This change follows an announcement by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and reflects a shift towards shared clinical decision-making. While insurance companies are still required to cover the shots, the CDC now recommends the vaccine primarily for immunocompromised children and adults. The agency's updated guidance also removes the recommendation for universal vaccination during pregnancy, citing a lack of high-quality safety data, although some agency pages still advise vaccination for pregnant women due to their higher risk of severe disease.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's tenure as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) resulted in significant budget cuts, saving an estimated $175 billion. However, this falls short of the initial $2 trillion goal due to legal challenges and the need for congressional approval. Experts suggest DOGE's greatest impact lies in identifying potential cuts and gathering information for Congress. Despite these challenges, DOGE's efforts have shed light on government spending and could influence future budget decisions, even though many agencies could only be shrunk and limited.</p>

          <p>A review of the film 'Bring Her Back' discusses the current trend in horror movies to focus on psychological and philosophical themes rather than pure scares. While the film features Sally Hawkins in a strong performance as a foster mother with ulterior motives, it ultimately struggles to balance highbrow storytelling with visceral horror elements. The reviewer notes that the film is more successful in portraying the lead character's personal story of loss than in exploring the abuse faced by the children. The movie serves as an adequate example of a horror movie, but is not as good as it could be.</p>

The monthly payout varies based on age, gender, and contract terms, ranging from approximately $1,100 to $2,100. The decision to invest in an annuity depends on individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and the need for guaranteed income versus liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>
