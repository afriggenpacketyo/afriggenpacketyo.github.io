          <p>Democratic frontrunner Katie Porter faced criticism after a testy interview where she threatened to leave when pressed on appealing to Trump voters. The exchange, which gained significant attention, highlighted her strategic assessment that a Democrat in California doesn't need to win over Republicans in a general election. Rivals quickly seized on the incident, sharing their own interviews and questioning Porter's temperament and leadership abilities for the gubernatorial race. This event has potentially stirred the previously stagnant contest to succeed Governor Gavin Newsom.</p>

          <p>A growing shortage of air traffic controllers is causing increased flight delays across the U.S., a problem exacerbated by the ongoing government shutdown. The Federal Aviation Administration warned of further disruptions as many essential controllers work without pay, leading to concerns about the strain on the aviation system. While delays fluctuated, the underlying staffing issue, which has troubled airline executives for years, continues to pose a significant challenge. This situation highlights the broader impact of the government's fiscal impasse on critical public services and daily life.</p>

          <p>Home equity loan rates are becoming increasingly attractive for homeowners, especially as the Federal Reserve continues its interest rate reduction campaign. With average homeowners possessing significant equity, these loans offer a cheaper alternative to credit cards or personal loans. Current rates vary by repayment period, with opportunities for even better deals for those with strong credit. Prospective borrowers are advised to compare offers from various lenders to secure the most favorable terms, while also considering the inherent risks of using a home as collateral.

          <p>The New Jersey gubernatorial election is tightening, with Latino voters identified as a potentially crucial demographic. Democratic candidate Mikie Sherrill, despite a single-digit lead, faces challenges in articulating a strong economic message, a factor that saw Donald Trump make significant inroads with Latino communities in previous elections. National Democratic groups are increasing support for Sherrill, emphasizing her stances on housing, healthcare, and education. The outcome will test the party's ability to re-engage these voters and counter Republican gains ahead of next year's midterm elections.</p>

          <p>As gold prices surge past $4,000 an ounce amid geopolitical uncertainty and government shutdowns, financial advisors offer mixed views on its long-term investment appeal. While some experts, like Ray Dalio, suggest significant portfolio allocation to gold as a safe haven, others, including top-ranked advisors, argue that equities consistently outperform due to compounding earnings and dividends. This article highlights that despite gold's short-term sparkle during turmoil, a diversified portfolio with a limited, single-digit percentage exposure to gold, or none at all, is generally recommended for sustained growth.

Borrowers make no monthly payments, with the loan balance due upon selling the home, moving out, or death.

          <p>Legal experts suggest that President Trump's persistent public attacks on James Comey, coupled with leadership changes in the prosecuting U.S. Attorney's Office, could undermine the federal case against the former FBI director. Comey's defense plans to argue selective or vindictive prosecution, citing Trump's calls for action and the unusual appointment of his former personal lawyer as interim U.S. attorney, despite internal prosecutorial dissent. This article highlights the high legal bar for such claims but notes the unique circumstances surrounding Comey's indictment, including the grand jury's rare rejection of a proposed charge.</p>
