          <h2>Trump Expected to Withdraw Surgeon General Nominee Amid Criticism</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House is reportedly planning to withdraw Dr. Janette Nesheiwat's nomination for U.S. Surgeon General following criticism from right-wing activist Laura Loomer. Loomer questioned Nesheiwat's medical degree and her previous support for COVID-19 vaccines. Nesheiwat, a former Fox News medical contributor, had initially promoted the COVID-19 vaccine but later opposed vaccine mandates for children. Trump had previously praised her as a strong advocate for preventive medicine. The withdrawal also comes amid scrutiny of Nesheiwat's brother-in-law, Mike Waltz, who was recently removed as Trump's national security advisor. Loomer has become increasingly influential in Trump's inner circle, offering recommendations on personnel decisions.</p>

          <p>House Democrats are urging Attorney General Pam Bondi to maintain the Community Relations Service, an office created by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, often called the "peacemakers program". The office's mission is to prevent and resolve racial and ethnic tensions, conflicts, and civil disorders. Democrats argue the service combats violence and unrest, particularly after high-profile attacks on places of worship. The Community Relations Service does not investigate or prosecute crimes and offers confidential, free services to communities. The office has worked to ease racial tensions in various cities, including after police shootings and during the trial of Derek Chauvin.</p>

          <p>Protesters gathered outside Illinois Governor JB Pritzker's mansion believing that Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was holding a press conference there. However, Noem's press conference was held more than half a mile away, at the site where Emma Shafer was murdered by an illegal immigrant. Noem was joined by "Angel families" who had lost loved ones to crimes committed by illegal immigrants. The press conference aimed to highlight Illinois' sanctuary status and call on Pritzker to abandon sanctuary policies. Pritzker responded by stating that Illinois follows the law and accused the Trump administration of violating the Constitution.</p>

          <p>Arm shares experienced a drop of over 8% in extended trading after the chip-design company released a weaker-than-anticipated forecast for the current quarter. While the company surpassed estimates for the fiscal fourth quarter, Wall Street is focusing on the company's outlook for the first quarter. Arm projects revenue between $1 billion and $1.1 billion, falling short of analysts' expectations. SoftBank controls roughly 90% of Arm, which went public in 2023 and has a market capitalization exceeding $130 billion. Arm's technology powers a significant portion of premium smartphones, with royalty revenue rising 18% year-over-year.</p>

          <p>Three former Memphis police officers, Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, and Justin Smith, were acquitted on all state charges, including second-degree murder, in the death of Tyre Nichols. The verdict followed an eight-and-a-half-hour deliberation after a nine-day trial, sparking outrage from civil rights advocates and Nichols' family. The officers still face federal charges related to the incident. The case drew national attention and renewed calls for police reform after footage showed the officers beating Nichols during a traffic stop, resulting in his death three days later. The defense argued the officers followed police standards and that another officer, who was not on trial, was responsible for the most violence.</p>

Griffin's concession ends his six-month effort to overturn the election in the swing state. The ruling by Judge Richard E.

Mendoza sought to recreate the experience for a wounded SEAL, Elliott Miller, who lost his memory of the event. While the film is intense, it also offers a sense of closure and challenges stereotypes about veterans, emphasizing the importance of accurately portraying their experiences.</p>

          <p>A federal appellate court ruled that Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University doctoral student arrested by masked federal agents in March, must be returned to Vermont from a detention facility in Louisiana. The ruling affirms a Vermont court's decision, which the Trump administration appealed. Ozturk, a Turkish citizen with a student visa, was arrested for her pro-Palestinian activism, which the administration claims undermines U.S. foreign policy. The ACLU, representing Ozturk, argues her arrest violates the First Amendment. The court gave the administration one week to move Ozturk back to Vermont.</p>

The decision marks the third consecutive meeting without action, leaving the bank's key lending rate around 4.3%. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that tariffs have raised the risk of both an economic slowdown and faster price rises, complicating the bank's next move. Trump has criticized the Fed for not cutting rates preemptively. The European Central Bank cut interest rates last month due to trade tensions, and the Bank of England is expected to follow suit.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement of a potential 100% tariff on movies produced outside the U.S. followed a meeting with actor Jon Voight, who presented a plan to "rescue" the American film industry. Voight's proposal included federal tax incentives, co-production treaties, and subsidies for theater owners and production companies. While Trump's initial announcement lacked details, it sparked a debate about the film industry's struggles and potential policy solutions. Industry groups and unions have expressed mixed reactions, with some supporting efforts to increase U.S. production and others raising concerns about the impact on international film industries.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve maintained interest rates for a third consecutive meeting, acknowledging heightened uncertainty about the economic impact of President Trump's tariffs. Policymakers cited risks of higher unemployment and inflation, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell stating the appropriate response remains unclear. Since the Fed's last meeting, the Trump administration announced and then rolled back aggressive tariffs, creating volatility in financial markets. The central bank is struggling to assess the economic fallout and set monetary policy amidst conflicting goals of maintaining a healthy labor market and stable inflation. Powell reiterated the Fed would face a "difficult judgment" if the labor market weakened as inflation rose.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of senators sent a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. expressing concerns that cuts to the agency could severely impact the Indian Health Service (IHS). The senators noted that cuts to other agencies within HHS that serve Native communities are impacting IHS and that the hiring freeze is exacerbating existing critical staffing issues. They urged Kennedy to ensure that IHS programs serving Native communities have the necessary resources and staffing to fulfill their missions. American Indians and Alaska Natives face significant health disparities, making access to quality health care crucial.</p>

Asif suggested Pakistan had already responded by shooting down Indian planes and drones and said his country would refrain from further action if India took no additional steps to attack. He reiterated his call for an international investigation and hoped U.S. officials would push India to accept such an inquiry.</p>

The removal came after Republicans took away the authority to appoint election board members from the Democratic governor. The board agreed to replace Brinson Bell with Sam Hayes, the top lawyer for the Republican House speaker. Democrats criticized the move as a shabby way to treat a nationally admired election director, while Republicans stated the goal was to ensure fair elections and trust in the election system.</p>

The state case jury deliberated over eight hours following a seven-day trial. Civil rights lawyers called the verdicts a "devastating miscarriage of justice".
