          <p>A second unvaccinated school-aged child in Texas has died from complications related to a measles outbreak, marking the first measles death in the U.S. in a decade. The outbreak, originating in West Texas, has spread to multiple states and Mexico, with over 600 confirmed cases nationwide. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., despite his past anti-vaccine activism, has acknowledged the importance of the MMR vaccine in preventing the spread of measles, and CDC teams have been deployed to assist with outbreak response. Experts anticipate the outbreak could persist for months, raising concerns about the U.S. losing its measles elimination status.</p>

          <p>A large wildfire in Galloway, Scotland, has led to evacuations of people and properties, with emergency services responding to the scene. The fire, which initially broke out on Friday, has spread across a significant area of forest and onto nearby Lamachan Hill, prompting concerns about potential damage and risks to residents. Rising temperatures and dry conditions across the UK have contributed to wildfire warnings, with firefighters also battling another blaze in the west Highlands. Authorities are urging caution and advising against campfires or open flames due to the exceptionally dry weather.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is preparing to use industrial policy to shield British businesses from the expected impact of President Donald Trump's new tariffs on imports. Options under consideration include relaxing electric vehicle sales targets for car manufacturers and re-imposing safeguards to prevent the dumping of goods destined for the US onto the UK market. The government also plans to accelerate investment announcements in UK industry and infrastructure to address the urgency of the situation. These measures aim to mitigate the potential economic disruption caused by the tariffs.

          <p>An ESPN analyst likened Luka Doncic's recent performance with the Los Angeles Lakers to the struggling stock market following President Trump's implementation of tariffs. The analyst suggested that both Doncic's performance and the stock market have taken a hit, raising concerns about their respective trajectories. However, Doncic responded with a strong performance in a subsequent game, scoring 35 points, and the Lakers are currently in a good position in the Western Conference standings. The analyst's comments highlight the perceived impact of Trump's economic policies and the pressure on athletes to perform at a high level.</p>

Kevin Hassett, another top adviser, claimed that over 50 countries have contacted Trump to negotiate trade deals.

The firings, part of President Trump's efforts to downsize the federal government, have been met with legal challenges arguing they violate civil service laws. While some workers have been reinstated due to court orders, their long-term employment status remains unclear, with the Justice Department seeking Supreme Court intervention.

Despite the benefits, these programs are underfunded, with demand from farmers exceeding available funding by two to three times.
