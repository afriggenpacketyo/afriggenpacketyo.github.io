          <p>Reddit has initiated legal action against AI startup Anthropic, alleging breach of contract and unfair business practices. The lawsuit claims that Anthropic used Reddit's platform and user data to train its AI models without proper authorization or consent, infringing on user privacy. Reddit asserts that it has suffered harm due to this unauthorized commercial exploitation of its content, highlighting existing partnerships with OpenAI and Google as examples of companies respecting its licensing terms. Anthropic has stated it disagrees with Reddit's claims and will vigorously defend itself in court. Optimism regarding the lawsuit's outcome is low.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated he had a "good" but not immediately productive conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, during which they discussed the recent Ukrainian drone operation targeting Russian military airfields. Putin reportedly emphasized that Russia would need to respond to the attacks, and Trump said that he confirmed to Putin that the Americans were not informed about this in advance. The call occurred amid stalled U.S.-brokered peace talks between Ukraine and Russia, with Ukraine pushing for increased sanctions on Moscow.

          <p>President Donald Trump has reportedly expressed private frustration with some of his Supreme Court appointees, particularly Justice Amy Coney Barrett, feeling they are not sufficiently supportive of his agenda. Several Trump allies have echoed these sentiments, labeling Barrett as "weak," though she has not publicly responded to the criticism. Trump is said to be seeking judicial nominees in the mold of Justices Alito, Thomas, and Scalia, and the White House maintains that the president respects the court's foundational role. This situation highlights the complex relationship between the executive and judicial branches.</p>

          <p>Daniel Jongyon Park has been charged with conspiracy to manufacture an unregistered device and terrorism in connection with the Palm Springs fertility clinic bombing. Park allegedly supplied large quantities of ammonium nitrate, an explosive precursor, to Guy Edward Bartkus, the primary suspect who died in the blast. The two men shared a nihilistic ideology centered on anti-natalism and the belief that people should not be born without consent, with Park also allegedly possessing recipes for bombs similar to that used in the Oklahoma City bombing.

          <p>The Trump administration intends to transfer Greenland from the U.S. European Command to the U.S. Northern Command, signaling a shift in how the U.S. views the territory. This move suggests that the U.S. considers Greenland more as part of its own defense perimeter, similar to Canada, rather than as a European entity under Danish control. Top Trump officials have reportedly encouraged Greenland to separate from Denmark and align with the U.S. for security, citing the strategic importance of the Pituffik Space Base and Greenland's rare earth minerals. The majority of Greenlanders, however, do not favor joining the U.S.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Republican allies are challenging the credibility of economists and budget experts who have voiced concerns about the financial implications of the Republicans' proposed tax cuts. This effort to discredit experts reflects a broader strategy to downplay the potential negative impacts of the tax plan on the national debt and economic stability. The debate over the tax cuts highlights the ongoing ideological divide regarding fiscal policy and the role of government spending. (not investment advice)</p>

The new method combines AI, radiocarbon dating, and handwriting analysis to more accurately estimate the age of ancient texts. The AI analysis found the manuscripts are older than previous estimates overall, suggesting dates in the early second century BCE, and sometimes slightly earlier. This suggests that scribes were copying multiple literary manuscripts before the rise of the Hasmonaean kingdom.</p>
