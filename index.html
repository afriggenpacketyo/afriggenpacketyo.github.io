          <p>Recent trade discussions between the United States and China have concluded without major announcements, leading analysts to believe the talks were challenging. According to economists, the outcome suggests a strategic recalibration by both nations as they navigate their complex economic relationship. The lack of substantive progress points to ongoing difficulties in resolving trade disputes, with experts suggesting that an extension of the current terms is the most likely short-term result. This situation signals a potential shift that could reshape the global economic order. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a data analysis, a significant majority of the 109,000 arrests made by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the first five months of the second Trump administration occurred in Southern and border states like Texas and Florida. This represents a 120% increase in arrests compared to the same period under the previous administration, reflecting a shift in enforcement priorities. Experts attribute the geographic concentration to local law enforcement cooperation and demographic patterns, as the administration pursues a large-scale deportation strategy. Most individuals arrested were from Latin American countries, consistent with broader immigration trends.</p>

          <p>An in-depth article details systemic animal cruelty at dairy farms connected to Fairlife, a popular, Coca-Cola-owned milk brand known for its high-protein content. Undercover investigations by the nonprofit Animal Recovery Mission (ARM) have repeatedly documented horrific abuse, including workers beating and dragging cows, despite the brand's marketing of humane treatment. The report connects Fairlife's success to the consumer trend of high-protein diets, while arguing that the company has thrived by either misleading consumers or capitalizing on their willingness to ignore the harsh realities of industrial dairy farming. The article suggests these issues reflect a broader failure of industry self-policing and regulatory oversight.</p>

          <p>A new report has concluded that the UK's National Health Service (NHS) failed to listen to a mother's concerns before the death of her five-year-old son, Yusuf Nazir. Yusuf died from a lung infection in 2022, days after being sent home from a hospital emergency department. The investigation, led by former Royal College of Nursing general secretary Peter Carter, found that healthcare providers relied too heavily on clinical metrics over caregiver insight, leading to a breakdown in trust. The boy's family is demanding accountability and changes to ensure similar tragedies are prevented in the future.</p>

          <p>According to hospital officials in Gaza, more than 50 Palestinians were killed and hundreds were injured near the Zikim crossing while waiting for food aid. Hamas-run civil defense agencies accused Israeli forces of firing on the crowds, while the Israeli military stated its troops fired "warning shots" in response to a threat and was unaware of casualties from its fire. The incident occurred as a US special envoy arrived in Israel and amid dire warnings from the UN about a deepening famine in the region. The tragedy highlights the extreme desperation and danger surrounding aid distribution in the war-torn territory.</p>

          <p>A significant air traffic control issue caused major disruptions across all UK airports, leading to the cancellation of over 150 flights and grounding thousands more.

However, the knock-on effects are expected to last for days, with passengers urged to check with their airlines before traveling.

          <p>Shares of Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest brewer, fell by as much as 11% after the company announced a significant 1.9% decline in second-quarter volumes. This drop, led by underperformance in China and Brazil, was much steeper than analysts had anticipated. Despite the falling volumes, the maker of Budweiser and Corona reported a 6.5% rise in operating profit, as price increases helped offset weaker demand. Analysts suggest the scale of the volume miss is likely to weigh on the stock, overshadowing the otherwise strong profit growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of 43 peers, including several prominent lawyers, has cautioned the UK government that its plan to recognize a Palestinian state could violate international law. In a letter to the attorney general, they argue that Palestine does not meet the statehood criteria defined in the 1933 Montevideo Convention, citing a lack of defined borders and a single, effective government. The government defended its position, noting the UK is not a signatory to the convention and that 147 other UN members already recognize Palestine. The move comes as the government pressures Israel to agree to a ceasefire and a two-state solution.</p>

          <p>The family of the late Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, has publicly asked President Donald Trump not to consider a pardon for Epstein's accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell. In a statement, the family called Maxwell a "monster who deserves to rot in prison" and questioned Trump's recent comments about being aware that Giuffre was "stolen" from his Mar-a-Lago resort. Their plea comes as Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence, has been meeting with Justice Department officials, raising concerns that she might receive leniency in exchange for information.</p>

          <p>A Delta Air Lines flight from Salt Lake City to Amsterdam encountered severe turbulence, forcing it to make an emergency landing in Minneapolis and resulting in 25 people being hospitalized. Flight DL56 landed safely and was met by emergency medical teams who treated passengers for various injuries. Flight tracking data indicated the aircraft experienced a sudden, dramatic change in altitude, dropping approximately 1,350 feet in about 30 seconds before diverting. While serious injuries from turbulence are rare, scientists suggest such events may become more common due to climate change altering atmospheric conditions.</p>

          <p>This article provides an analysis of American cyclist Matteo Jorgenson's performance in the 2025 Tour de France, highlighting his crucial but selfless role as a "domestique" for team leader Jonas Vingegaard. Despite facing his own illness, Jorgenson repeatedly exhausted himself in attempts to wear down the dominant race leader, Tadej Pogačar. While Vingegaard's bid for the overall victory failed, Jorgenson's persistent efforts were instrumental in setting up teammate Wout van Aert for a prestigious final stage win in Paris. His performance is presented as a triumph of dedication and teamwork, demonstrating that victory in cycling can be measured beyond individual wins.</p>

The author argues that the EU made all the concessions, agreeing to a 15% tariff on most of its exports to the US while eliminating its own tariffs on American goods and committing to massive investments in US energy and military equipment. The piece contends that this one-sided agreement demonstrates Europe's diminished geopolitical influence and its subservience to American pressure, undermining the bloc's goal of matching the U.S. as a global power.
