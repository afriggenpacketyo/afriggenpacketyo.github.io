          <p>The U.S. and Ukraine have finalized a minerals deal granting Washington preferential access to Kyiv's natural resources in exchange for establishing a reconstruction investment fund. This agreement, pursued by President Trump, aims to accelerate Ukraine's economic recovery and facilitate an end to the conflict with Russia. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated the partnership sends a clear message to Russia about the U.S. commitment to a free and prosperous Ukraine. The deal allows joint development and monetization of Kyiv's rare earths, critical minerals, oil, gas, and other resources, effectively compensating the U.S. for aid provided during the war.</p>

Despite these revisions, the BOJ has maintained its benchmark interest rate at around 0.5 percent, but warned of potential declines in domestic corporate profits due to trade frictions.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several European auto giants, including Stellantis and Mercedes, reported sharp drops in first-quarter profit and suspended or cut full-year financial guidance due to uncertainties surrounding U.S. President Donald Trump's trade tariffs. Trump's tariffs have created volatility, impacting corporate investment decisions. While a recent move to ease car tariffs provides partial relief, analysts warn that long-term capital allocation decisions remain uncertain. Volvo Cars also ditched its financial guidance and announced cost-cutting plans, while Volkswagen expects operating return on sales, net cash flow, and net liquidity to be at the lower end of forecasts.</p>

          <p>Tyrique George, a teenager who broke into Chelsea's £1bn squad without a loan, was promoted from the academy team to the first team after signing a new three-year contract. Despite initial concerns about being overshadowed by other talented young forwards, Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca gave George a chance in pre-season, helping him stay at Stamford Bridge. George's rapid progress has increased his estimated transfer value from £2m to over £10m. He supplemented his Chelsea training with personal coaching and playing against men in nine-a-side matches, which helped him become fearless and improve his game.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Israeli reservists, including former Mossad head Danny Yatom, have signed letters demanding that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government end the war in Gaza and prioritize a hostage deal with Hamas. The reservists express concern that Netanyahu's personal interests are taking precedence over the return of the remaining hostages. Some reservists are refusing to serve, leading to a looming crisis for the military. Critics argue that the prolonged war is making it harder for Israel to claim its military is the most moral in the world.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Glasgow University have confirmed the continued rise of mosquitoes in Scotland, with more than 20 different species now identified, including some in Shetland. The discovery is attributed to a successful citizen science project, Mosquito Scotland, where the public reported sightings and photos. Researchers found mosquitoes in woodland areas and cities, with larvae discovered in stagnant water. The team used traps that mimic human breath to lure the insects, sometimes catching over 1,000 mosquitoes in two days. The findings highlight the growing extent of the mosquito population in Scotland.</p>

The Timberwolves dominated defensively in the fourth quarter, highlighting the Lakers' inability to win the biggest moments. Rudy Gobert's performance and Minnesota's cohesive teamwork exposed the Lakers' blemishes, leading to their elimination from the playoffs.</p>

          <p>The United States military possesses advanced equipment, but lacks the necessary personnel and materiel to fight a major war, according to Mackenzie Eaglen and Brady Africk. The U.S. military is equipped for short, high-intensity conflicts, but struggles with longer, more violent wars. The authors advocate for increased investment in active service members, ammunition, new ships, and new aircraft to ensure the military has the resources to endure and win large-scale wars. The United States produces only 40,000 artillery shells each month, while Ukraine uses up to 15,000 shells a day.</p>

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated the deal signals a commitment to a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine and ensures no one who financed the Russian war machine will benefit from reconstruction.</p>

These findings highlight concerns about assimilation and rising social tension within the diverse community, exacerbated by plummeting U.S.-China relations. The survey underscores a troubling disconnect between how Asian-Americans are perceived and their actual experiences, contributing to the stereotype of the “perpetual foreigner.”</p>
