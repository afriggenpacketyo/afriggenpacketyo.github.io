          <p>The 10-year Treasury yield significantly dropped below 4%, its lowest since October, driven by investor anxieties surrounding the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China.  China's retaliatory tariffs against President Trump's policy sparked a flight to safety, pushing yields lower.  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the tariffs' potential to increase inflation and curb growth, indicating a cautious approach to interest rate adjustments.</p>
