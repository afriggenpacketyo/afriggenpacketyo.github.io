        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Southwest Airlines will implement a $35 fee for the first checked bag and $45 for the second, ending its long-standing "two bags fly free" policy, a move influenced by activist investor pressure. This change accompanies the introduction of basic economy tickets, restricting changes, boarding priority, and credit expiration. Exemptions include top-tier loyalty members, Business Select fares, and co-branded credit cardholders. To accommodate anticipated increased carry-ons, Southwest is installing larger overhead bins and providing mobile bag tag printers for staff. These changes reflect a shift towards revenue generation strategies seen among competitors like Delta, American, and United Airlines.</p>

          <p>National Public Radio (NPR) is suing the Trump administration over an executive order that seeks to eliminate federal funding for the broadcaster, alleging it violates First Amendment protections and congressional authority. NPR, along with three member stations, argues the order aims to punish news coverage deemed "biased" by the administration. NPR's funding structure relies primarily on corporate sponsorships and member station fees, with only a small percentage coming directly from the federal government. The lawsuit asserts that Congress intended for public funding to support private speech protected from government interference, emphasizing the importance of a public radio system for news and information.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Informal dialogue between India and Pakistan, facilitated by NGOs and civil society groups through "track II diplomacy," has become less effective due to funding issues and decreased government engagement. These networks, which once fostered consensus on disputes like Kashmir, have suffered setbacks after events like the 2008 Mumbai terror attack and India's revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's semi-independent status. The Indian government's pressure on foreign NGOs has further weakened these initiatives, which struggle to connect with ordinary citizens. Despite these challenges, some youth-led initiatives offer hope for reviving interest in shared heritage and fostering dialogue between the two countries.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration and House Republicans are implementing policies to restrict federal benefits for immigrant families, primarily affecting children who are U.S. citizens with noncitizen parents. A tax bill would limit the child tax credit to parents with Social Security numbers, impacting roughly two million children. The bill would also tighten eligibility for federal health insurance programs and trim Medicaid expansion funding for states covering undocumented immigrants. Critics argue these changes undermine the well-being of children and could create a chilling effect, discouraging eligible families from enrolling in benefits due to deportation fears.</p>

          <p>Experts predict that CD interest rates in June 2025 could either drop, stagnate, or, less likely, increase, depending on the Federal Reserve's actions and overall economic conditions. The most likely scenario is stagnation, with the Fed expected to pause rates at its June meeting. If the Fed cuts rates, CD rates, especially for short- and medium-term certificates, could decline shortly after. A rise in CD rates is highly unlikely, but higher inflation could prompt the Fed to shift its stance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration and Congress aim to revive the American shipbuilding industry with subsidies and penalties against foreign-built ships, particularly from China. However, U.S. shipbuilding costs are nearly five times higher than in Asia, and production times are significantly longer. Hanwha, a South Korean conglomerate, bought a Philadelphia shipyard and plans to invest in automation to improve efficiency. Critics argue that previous government efforts to encourage domestic shipbuilding have largely failed, and that strategic fleets could be built more affordably in allied countries like Japan and South Korea.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage announced plans to support families by increasing tax breaks for married couples and abolishing the two-child benefit limit. He stated that the party would reverse government cuts to winter fuel payments for pensioners. Farage said these measures would be funded by scrapping net-zero climate initiatives, ending hotel accommodation for asylum seekers, cutting diversity initiatives, and reducing the number of quangos. An economist from the Institute for Fiscal Studies noted that increasing the annual income tax allowance to Â£20,000 could cost up to Â£80 billion.</p>

          <p>A flesh-eating parasite, the New World screwworm, is rapidly advancing toward the U.S. after breaching a long-standing barrier in Panama, causing alarm among ranchers. The USDA's program to control the parasite by releasing sterile flies is struggling to keep up with the screwworm's advance, exacerbated by illegal cattle trade and disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association is urging the USDA to build a new sterile-fly plant in the U.S. to combat the threat, which could significantly impact the cattle industry and potentially raise beef prices.</p>

Despite millions of supporters, Khan's hopes for regaining power appear remote as the military leadership seems disinclined to offer a deal. Cracks within Khan's PTI party are also growing, with internal disputes and fear of a crackdown hindering meaningful protests, while his political future mostly hinges on his own behavior.</p>

Climate change intensifies drought conditions, and unregulated groundwater pumping poses a significant threat to food production and municipal water supplies.</p>

To apply the rule, there must be at least two sales involving independent parties, proof that the item was destined for the U.S., and documentation of the first sale price.

          <p>The Trump administration is requesting that federal agencies cancel remaining contracts with Harvard University. This action follows the cancellation of over $2.6 billion in federal research grants for the university. The administration cites Harvard's resistance to demands for policy changes as the reason for the cuts. A draft letter from the General Services Administration directs agencies to review contracts with the university and seek alternate vendors.</p>
