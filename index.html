          <p>As President Donald Trump convened with top advisors in the White House Situation Room, U.S. officials indicated the next 24-48 hours were critical in determining the course of action with Iran. Despite saber-rattling rhetoric, U.S. negotiators assess Iran is in a weak position and could be forced back to the negotiating table to abandon nuclear enrichment. A high-level meeting led by Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and potentially Vice President JD Vance could happen this week if Iran moves quickly. However, sources familiar with the president's mindset said he has grown frustrated by Iran's inability to provide immediate answers and appears disinclined to allow Tehran to call his military bluff.</p>

          <p>The Group of Seven (G7) leaders have agreed to an action plan aimed at minimizing risks to their countries' supply chains for critical minerals, essential for modern technologies. This initiative comes at a time when China dominates the global supply of rare earth minerals, prompting the G7 to step up cooperation within the group and with like-minded countries. The plan includes monitoring for shortages, coordinating responses to market disruptions, and diversifying mining, processing, manufacturing, and recycling efforts. Six of the G7 leaders also rallied around Ukraine, emphasizing the need for maximum pressure against Russia to achieve a ceasefire. The G7 also urged China to refrain from distorting the market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports fell by 1.7% year-over-year in May, marking the sharpest decline in eight months, primarily due to a significant drop in shipments to the United States and China. Exports to the U.S. decreased by 11.1%, with automobile exports plummeting by 24.7%. This decline has raised concerns about Japan's economic growth, with the Bank of Japan noting that trade uncertainties could lead to a slowdown in overseas economies and a decline in domestic corporate profits. Japan's trade deficit stood at 637.6 billion yen in May, and U.S. President Donald Trump has reportedly stated that Japan is being "tough" in trade talks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier has been found in civil contempt of court for challenging a judge's order to pause a new state law that criminalizes illegal entry into the state. U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams ruled that Uthmeier violated a temporary restraining order by sending a letter to law enforcement stating that the order did not prevent them from enforcing the immigration law. As a result, Uthmeier has been ordered to file bi-weekly reports detailing arrests made under the law, with the first report due by July 1.</p>

          <p>California farmers and workers are experiencing confusion and uncertainty as the summer harvest season begins, due to contradictory signals from the Trump administration regarding immigration enforcement.

This fluctuation has left farmers unsure of how to proceed, with many seeking guidance on protecting their workers.

          <p>President Donald Trump's approach to Iran has revealed deep divisions among his supporters, particularly regarding whether the U.S. should intervene militarily. While Trump has campaigned against "endless wars," he has also maintained that Iran cannot possess nuclear weapons. This dilemma has pitted the isolationist and hawkish factions of the Republican Party against each other, with some conservatives siding with Democrats to block unauthorized military action. Figures like Tucker Carlson have called for the U.S. to stay out of the conflict, while others argue that intervention is necessary to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear capabilities.</p>

          <p>Newspaper headlines are dominated by President Trump's warnings to Iran amid escalating tensions, with reports suggesting the U.S. is considering military action. The papers also highlight the UK government's expected delay in opening the remaining leg of HS2, describing it as a "Â£37bn of failure." Meanwhile, domestic issues such as the decriminalization of abortion and Baroness Louise Casey's audit into grooming gangs also make front-page news, with the latter being called "one of the biggest scandals ever".</p>

          <p>Meta, the parent company of WhatsApp, has expressed concern over reports that Iranian state television is urging citizens to delete the app, accusing it of being used by Israel to target individuals. WhatsApp has refuted these claims, emphasizing that all messages are end-to-end encrypted and that the company does not track user locations or provide bulk information to governments. The claim comes amid heightened tensions between Iran and Israel and a reported reduction in internet usage across the country. Meta's platforms have previously been targeted by the Iranian government during times of unrest.</p>

These projects could help address land-utilization issues, as the world has closed more than 6,000 coal mines since 2010, most of which were in China and the US.</p>
