          <h2>Chinese Military Article Suggests Sixth-Generation Fighter Could Block Airspace Near Taiwan</h2>

          <p>A mainland Chinese military magazine article suggests that Beijing's sixth-generation fighter, unofficially dubbed the J-36, could block airspace to foreign bases in Guam for up to two hours from 1,000km away in a future conflict over Taiwan. The goal is to counter American B-21 stealth bombers within the first island chain. The article notes that the US also announced its sixth-generation fighter, the F-47, in March, while the B-21 Raider had its maiden flight in November 2023, with plans to deliver at least 100 aircraft to the air force in the mid-2020s. Should a war over Taiwan occur, the article posits that the Chinese and US air forces would likely focus on controlling airspace about 1,000km from the Chinese coast.</p>

          <p>Autism researchers and advocates are opposing the creation of a national autism database, citing potential misuse and ethical concerns. While the HHS denies it's a registry, they confirmed a "real-world data platform" to link existing datasets for research into autism causes and treatments. Critics worry about privacy, security, and the potential for discrimination or eugenics. They emphasize the importance of informed consent and participation from autistic individuals in research, cautioning against collecting information without permission. Advocates stress the need for support and inclusion, not eradication, of autistic individuals.</p>

The job scarcity has led to entry-level employees staying in their positions longer, further limiting opportunities for recent graduates.

          <p>Wally Lamb's novel, "The River Is Waiting," follows Corby, a troubled father who accidentally kills his son and is sentenced to three years in prison. The novel explores dysfunction and the effects of trauma, but Corby is portrayed as a narcissistic character more concerned with returning to normal than acknowledging his transgression. While the novel attempts to reflect prison life, much of it feels cliched, and the ending lacks an authentic epiphany. Despite the potential, the novel falls short of fully realizing its promise.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on movies made outside the US, citing concerns over the decline of the American movie industry and the use of incentives by other countries to attract filmmakers. The move has sparked debate and uncertainty within the industry, with questions raised about its impact on American production companies filming abroad and the definition of a US film. UK media union Bectu warned the tariffs could "deal a knock-out blow" to the industry. The governments of Australia and New Zealand have spoken out in support of their countries' film industries.</p>

The UN and aid agencies have voiced concerns that the plan would violate humanitarian principles, as the proposed strategy to shut down the existing aid distribution system could mean large parts of Gaza would continue to go without supplies.</p>
