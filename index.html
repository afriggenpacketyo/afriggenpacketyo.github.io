          <p>An independent report has concluded that police in Northamptonshire, UK, should have arrested Anne Sacoolas, the American diplomat who caused the fatal car crash that killed 19-year-old Harry Dunn in 2019. The report criticized the police's handling of the investigation, stating that a prompt and effective investigation was not considered. Sacoolas, who was driving on the wrong side of the road, left the UK under diplomatic immunity and later pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving, receiving a suspended sentence. Harry Dunn's mother expressed anger that Sacoolas's welfare was prioritized over her dying son, and the report also criticized the former chief constable for making erroneous statements and attacking the family's spokesperson. The report makes 38 recommendations to prevent similar failures in the future, and Northamptonshire Police has apologized for its shortcomings.</p>

          <p>Nintendo shares have surged 46% this year, adding approximately $39 billion to the company's stock value, driven by the successful launch of the Switch 2 console. The Switch 2, the successor to the original Switch, was unveiled in January and released this month, leading to shortages and special opening hours in some markets. Nintendo reported selling 3.5 million units of the Switch 2 in the first four days after its launch and forecasts sales of 15 million units in its fiscal year ending March 2026. Investors hope the Switch 2 will replicate the success of its predecessor, and Nintendo's strategy of leveraging strong franchises like Super Mario, Zelda, and Pokemon has significantly boosted its market capitalization since the original Switch's release in 2017.

          <p>Investigators are working to determine the cause of the Air India Flight 171 crash, which occurred shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad, India, killing all 242 people on board. The investigation will involve analyzing the wreckage, cockpit voice and flight data recorders to understand what went wrong in the crucial seconds after takeoff. Experts are considering various possibilities, including engine failure due to bird strikes or fuel contamination, improperly extended flaps, maintenance errors, or inadvertent crew actions. The focus will be on examining the engines and flight recorders to gather initial clues, and the investigation will also review maintenance logs, pilot training records, and the aircraft's service history to identify any potential systemic issues. The investigation aims to determine whether the crash was a unique event or indicative of a broader problem affecting the Boeing 787 fleet.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-18 03:24:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Businesses are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to reduce the impact of tariffs imposed by the U.S. government. Tariff engineering involves altering a product's materials, dimensions, or composition to fit into a different harmonized system code with lower duty rates. While most new tariffs are broad-based, exemptions exist, allowing companies to benefit from strategic design choices. For example, manufacturers bundled steel and aluminum into products to qualify for lower duties, but later removed them when tariffs on those materials increased. Experts say that tariff engineering is a legitimate strategy to reduce duty liability, as there are over 5,000 product classification codes used by U.S. customs authorities.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors are considering seeking the death penalty against Vance Boelter, who is charged with fatally shooting former Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and wounding another Democrat, Sen. John Hoffman, and his wife. Minnesota abolished capital punishment in 1911, making this a rare case for the state, but the Trump administration has lifted a moratorium on federal executions. Boelter is accused of meticulously planning the attack and targeting other Democratic officials, and the federal intervention has created tension with the Hennepin County Attorney. If the death penalty is pursued, federal officials will face a jury pool drawn from a state that has rejected capital punishment for over a century.</p>

          <p>Three additional bullet trains experienced malfunctions after services were suspended for over five hours between Tokyo and northeastern Japan due to a train failure. The affected trains are a new type that debuted last year, and all four cases involved failures of their auxiliary power units, prompting further investigation. One train came to a halt in Tochigi Prefecture due to an auxiliary power unit failure, while another became unable to move at Koriyama Station. JR East has suspended operation of this train type outside of coupled services until the cause is identified, and has cancelled over 20 trains between Tokyo and northeastern Japan.</p>

The agreement includes erecting memorials in both countries to honor North Korean soldiers who died in the Kursk region, and Kim Jong Un has expressed unwavering support for Russia's efforts. The deepening ties between North Korea and Russia have raised concerns among the U.S., South Korea, and their allies that Russia may provide Kim with advanced technologies to advance his nuclear and missile programs.</p>

          <p>The threat of deportation under the Trump administration has become a reality for many immigrants in Southern California, with ICE operations becoming more aggressive. Raids have been conducted in various cities, creating an atmosphere of fear within the undocumented community. In one incident, ICE agents conducted a raid at a Home Depot parking lot in Los Angeles, detaining approximately 25 people, and witnesses reported seeing agents from the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department and the LAPD assisting in the operation. While deportations have not been massive, the anti-immigrant policies have reduced the flow of people migrating to the U.S., and ICE has conducted operations in other locations, creating a sense of constant fear among immigrants.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' legal team is signaling a shift in their trial strategy as prosecutors are expected to rest their case this week, with the defense now needing only two to five days to present their case. Legal experts suggest this change may indicate that Diddy's lawyers have identified weaknesses in the government's case, which relies heavily on testimony from former girlfriends and employees. The defense may be emphasizing that the prosecution has not met its burden of proof, while the judge reprimanded lawyers for violating the court's sealing order. The jury was shown videos of "freak offs" between Diddy, Cassie Ventura, and a male escort, and the trial is expected to conclude by July 4.</p>

During the test, the spacecraft's escape engines ignited, and the return capsule reached its designated altitude before separating and landing safely using parachutes and an airbag cushioning system. This test ensures crew safety in the event of a rocket failure during launch, and marks China's first test of this kind since 1998.</p>

          <p>Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, claims that Meta Platforms attempted to recruit OpenAI employees with signing bonuses as high as $100 million, along with substantial annual compensation packages. Despite Meta's efforts, Altman stated that none of OpenAI's top talent has accepted these offers. Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, is reportedly frustrated with his company's AI progress and is investing heavily in top talent for its "superintelligence" AI lab. This effort follows delays in the release of Meta's latest flagship AI model due to capability concerns.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the San Diego Padres 8-6 in a game marked by contentious moments, including two hit batsmen, dugout warnings, and the ejection of Dodgers manager Dave Roberts. Roberts was ejected after arguing the umpire's decision to issue warnings to both dugouts following Shohei Ohtani being hit by a pitch, which Roberts believed was intentional. Andy Pages had a standout performance with four hits, including two home runs, and Max Muncy responded to Padres manager Mike Shildt's comments from the previous game. There were more controversies with the umpires arising in the seventh inning, but the Dodgers ultimately held on for the win.</p>

          <p>Australia has lifted its ban on plasma donation for gay and bisexual men, becoming the first country in the world to remove all sexual activity-based restrictions on plasma donation. The changes, approved by the country's health products regulator, are estimated to expand the donation pool by 625,000 people. Under the new rules, Lifeblood will no longer ask men if they have had sex with men in the previous three months, instead asking all donors if they have had anal sex with new or multiple partners. The plasma donation rules will come into effect on July 14, with updated blood donation approaches to be implemented in 2026.</p>
