          <p>Amazon plans to invest $4 billion by the end of 2026 to expand its delivery network in rural towns, aiming to cut average delivery times in half. This expansion will add over 200 delivery stations, tripling the size of Amazon's rural delivery network and creating about 170 jobs at each new site. This move is intended to improve service to rural customers, who are often underserved by other logistics providers due to the high cost of reaching them. The company aims to speed up deliveries, building upon previous efforts to make two-day delivery the standard and investments in one-day and same-day delivery options.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article reveals new details about the Trump administration's agreement with El Salvador to deport migrants, highlighting concerns about due process and potential human rights violations. El Salvador's President Bukele sought assurances that those deported were actually members of the Tren de Aragua gang, raising questions about the thoroughness of the U.S. government's assessment. The article details the rushed effort to deport migrants, the application of the Alien Enemies Act, and the struggles of families to get information about their loved ones. The arrangement involved sending Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador's prison in exchange for financial support and the deportation of MS-13 leaders from the U.S. to El Salvador.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments on whether to allow taxpayer funding for the nation's first religious charter school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School in Oklahoma. The case centers on the First Amendment's religion clauses, weighing the prohibition of state establishment of religion against the protection of free exercise of religious faith. The court's liberal members argued that charter schools are public institutions that cannot advance a specific ideology with taxpayer funds, while conservatives suggested charter schools are contractors for a public service, raising concerns about religious discrimination.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's promises to cut spending, the federal government has spent over $200 billion more in the first 100 days of his second term compared to the same period last year. The increase is attributed to rising costs in areas like military spending, Social Security, Medicare, and interest on the national debt. While the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has attempted cuts, many are focused on smaller targets and face legal challenges. The administration has spent more than $200 billion more than last year in a little over three months, according to CBS News' analysis of Treasury reports.</p>

The Littlejohns claim the school socially transitioned their daughter without their knowledge or consent, causing a rift in their family.

The authors argue that factors beyond economic prosperity, such as relationships, community involvement, and a sense of purpose, are crucial for overall well-being. Their research, based on a global study across 22 countries, reveals that some poorer nations report higher levels of overall flourishing than wealthier ones. The study suggests the need to foster economic development without compromising meaning, purpose, and relationships.</p>
