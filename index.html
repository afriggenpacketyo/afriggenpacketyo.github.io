        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Russia has inaugurated its Intervision song contest, a revival of a Soviet-era competition, positioned by President Vladimir Putin as a conservative response to the Western-oriented Eurovision. This initiative aims to promote "national identity" and "traditional values," with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov explicitly contrasting it with Eurovision's pro-LGBTQ+ stance. The event, featuring 23 countries including BRICS partners and former Soviet republics, offers a significant cash prize. This launch illustrates Russia's cultural and geopolitical aspirations amid its exclusion from Eurovision since 2022, marking a clear division in international cultural events.</p>

          <p>Estonia has requested urgent NATO consultations under Article 4 after three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets allegedly violated its airspace over the Gulf of Finland for 12 minutes. Italian, Finnish, and Swedish jets were scrambled in response to the incursion, which Russia denies. This incident follows similar alleged airspace breaches in Poland and Romania, intensifying regional tensions. Estonian Prime Minister Kristen Michal emphasized the need for a united and strong NATO response to such provocations, viewing it as a tactic to divert attention from the Ukraine conflict.</p>

          <p>England's Red Roses are set to clash with France in the Women's Rugby World Cup semi-final, with statistics heavily favoring England's dominant 31-game winning streak. Despite France's 16 consecutive losses against England, their coaches and captain express belief that past records don't dictate a World Cup semi-final outcome. France, however, faces significant team absences due to suspensions and injuries, making their challenge against the formidable English side even steeper. The article highlights the contrasting approaches of statistical analysis versus a belief in sport's inherent unpredictability.</p>

For most, surgical body contouring is the only effective solution, but these procedures are costly and rarely covered by the NHS unless specific medical criteria are met, creating a financial burden for patients.</p>

          <p>A CNBC investigation uncovered widespread sales of counterfeit and fraudulent products on Walmart's third-party online marketplace, attributed to lax seller vetting.

Walmart's rapid expansion of its marketplace, aiming to compete with Amazon, reportedly involved loosening vetting standards, allowing bad actors to impersonate legitimate businesses. The article highlights the challenges of policing online marketplaces and the evolving legal landscape concerning platform liability for such sales.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a third "lethal kinetic strike" by the U.S. military on an alleged drug trafficking boat in international waters, resulting in three deaths. This action follows two similar strikes this month, escalating tensions, particularly with Venezuela, which denies U.S. accusations of drug links. Democratic lawmakers have criticized the strikes, questioning their legal justification and constitutional authority. The administration maintains the actions are consistent with the president's role as commander-in-chief to protect U.S. interests and national security.</p>

          <h2>Understanding the FCC's Authority and Role in Broadcast Licensing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 20:34:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article clarifies the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) role and authority over broadcast licenses and content regulation, prompted by President Trump's suggestion that critical TV networks should lose their licenses. The FCC, which primarily regulates local TV and radio stations, does not directly oversee national networks but sets rules for public interest, obscenity, and decency. While it is legally barred from preventing specific viewpoints, experts note its broad rules and historical enforcement power, making the debate over its influence on content, like the Jimmy Kimmel suspension, highly contentious.</p>

          <h2>Trump and Xi Discuss TikTok's Future in the US Amid Sale Negotiations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 20:34:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping discussed the future of TikTok's US operations, with Trump stating they approved a deal for its sale to US investors, though Beijing offered no immediate confirmation. The proposed deal reportedly involves Oracle and licensing ByteDance's algorithm, a key sticking point in negotiations. Many US lawmakers remain uneasy due to national security concerns over ByteDance's links to the Chinese Communist Party. The discussion marks ongoing efforts to resolve the app's status following a Supreme Court ruling requiring divestment or a ban.</p>
