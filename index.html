While a specific date and location have not yet been disclosed, a Putin adviser confirmed that preparations for the summit are underway. The announcement follows a meeting between Putin and a White House special envoy, which Trump described as "highly productive" in working towards an end to the war in Ukraine.

Key players like Zoe Harrison at fly-half and captain Zoe Aldcroft in the back row have been retained or reinstated.

          <p>Prosecutors in South Korea have requested an arrest warrant for former first lady Kim Keon Hee on suspicions of bribery, stock manipulation, and influence-peddling. This move follows a seven-hour interrogation regarding allegations that include influencing political nominations and accepting improper gifts. Her husband, former President Yoon Suk Yeol, is already in detention over a martial law declaration. If the court approves the warrant, it would mark the first time in the nation's history that both a former president and first lady have been arrested, reflecting a significant political and legal development.</p>

          <p>Saudi Pro League club Al-Hilal has reportedly reached an agreement to sign Liverpool striker Darwin Nunez for a fee of £46.3 million (53 million euros). The 26-year-old Uruguayan international is expected to undergo a medical to finalize the move. Nunez joined Liverpool in 2022 for an initial £64 million and has scored 40 goals in 143 appearances for the club. The sale could provide Liverpool with the financial flexibility to pursue other transfer targets, such as Newcastle's Alexander Isak, before the current transfer window closes.</p>

          <p>The UK has started detaining migrants who have crossed the Channel as part of a new pilot scheme with France aimed at immediate returns. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper confirmed the detentions are underway but did not specify numbers, stating the government will robustly defend against legal challenges. Under the 11-month agreement, the UK will return one migrant to France in exchange for accepting one vetted asylum seeker from there. This policy is being implemented as Channel crossings in 2025 are nearly 50% higher than at the same point last year.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece critiques the NHL's leadership, including Commissioner Gary Bettman and Wayne Gretzky, for joining Donald Trump's sports council. The author argues this move contradicts the league's stated commitment to diversity and inclusion, particularly as the council aims to prevent transgender women from participating in women's sports. The article recounts the NHL's past actions, such as canceling Pride-themed jerseys, as evidence of a retreat from its inclusivity goals. The author suggests that aligning with a political agenda targeting marginalized groups is a significant step backward for making hockey a more welcoming sport.</p>

The author contends that a Colorado state law prohibiting such cooperation is a direct violation of U.S. Code and the Constitution's supremacy clause. The piece highlights the Justice Department's lawsuit against the state law, asserting that such sanctuary policies are reckless and endanger public safety by allowing criminals to remain in communities.

          <p>The National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, a leading research hospital for rare and severe diseases, has seen a significant drop in patient numbers under the second Trump administration. Government documents show a steep decline from February to April, with daily patient counts falling to between 60 and 80, down from over 110 pre-pandemic. Current and former employees attribute the drop to an exodus of staff, widespread firings, and research grant cancellations that have crippled the institution's ability to recruit and treat patients. This trend jeopardizes both critical patient care and vital medical research.</p>

          <p>Following severe floods in Texas, a federal aid hotline was largely unreachable for five days because the Department of Homeland Security allowed its funding to expire. Internal FEMA logs show that during this period, only about 15,000 of 55,000 calls from survivors were answered. The delay is attributed to an administrative bottleneck requiring DHS Secretary Kristi Noem to personally approve funding requests over $100,000, a change from previous administrations. This failure to promptly fund the call centers left many flood victims unable to access time-sensitive assistance for housing and basic needs.</p>

A lawsuit from public health organizations alleges that the government illegally withheld funding from the Title X program, a Nixon-era initiative designed to provide free contraception. Clinics in states like Montana and Utah report that funding suspensions, justified by claims of violating anti-discrimination rules, have forced service reductions.

          <p>SoftBank Group reported a second straight quarter of profit, largely driven by a $4.8 billion gain in its Vision Fund technology investment arm. The Japanese conglomerate's fiscal first-quarter profit of 421.8 billion yen significantly exceeded analyst expectations. The Vision Fund's strong performance was bolstered by gains in public holdings like Grab and private investments in Indian firms such as Swiggy. This positive result comes as investors watch for returns on SoftBank's substantial new investments in artificial intelligence, including a major funding round for OpenAI and the pending acquisition of Ampere Computing.

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the prevailing political tendency towards authoritarian control is ill-suited for solving complex global challenges like climate change and economic instability. The author critiques leaders who prioritize maintaining power over fostering real change, noting that a rigid, top-down approach stifles the creativity needed for a polycrisis world. Citing neuroscience, the article explains that the human brain is wired for certainty, a trait exploited by fear-mongering politics. The author advocates for a shift away from "power over" to a more collaborative and pluralistic model that embraces uncertainty to renew democracy.</p>

This follows two seasons of poor yields, which caused extreme price volatility and declining consumption.

However, analysts note that key exports such as IT services and pharmaceuticals are not targeted by the current duties.
