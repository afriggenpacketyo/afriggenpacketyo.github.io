          <p>A Chinese national, Zhimin Qian, has been convicted in London for her central role in a massive cryptocurrency money laundering operation. The scheme, which defrauded over 128,000 investors in China between 2014 and 2017, resulted in the seizure of 61,000 bitcoins, valued at over £5 billion. After fleeing China, Qian attempted to launder the funds in the UK by purchasing property before her arrest, which followed a complex, multi-jurisdictional investigation. Her legal team stated she hopes the guilty plea will help facilitate compensation for the victims from the seized assets.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration, alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has unveiled a 20-point peace plan aimed at ending the war in Gaza. The proposal includes a phased hostage-prisoner exchange, the disarmament of Hamas, and the establishment of a transitional government for the region. Key provisions demand the release of all remaining hostages within 48 hours of an agreement, followed by the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners by Israel. The plan, which reportedly had input from former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, has been presented to Hamas for review by mediators from Qatar and Egypt.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region traded without a clear direction as new data revealed China's manufacturing activity contracted for the sixth consecutive month. The official Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was 49.8, slightly better than expected but still below the 50-point mark indicating growth. In contrast, a private survey showed expansion, creating a mixed economic picture. Meanwhile, Australia's central bank decided to hold its benchmark interest rates steady at 3.6% amidst persistent inflation concerns, influencing regional market sentiment.

          <p>A Chinese court has sentenced 11 members of the notorious Ming crime family to death for their involvement in running extensive scam and gambling operations in Myanmar. The family was a key player in Laukkaing, a town on the China-Myanmar border that became a hub for criminal activities, including trafficking and forced labor in scam centers. The court found them guilty of generating over $1.4 billion from illegal activities and being responsible for the deaths of several workers. This verdict signals Beijing's intensified crackdown on cross-border criminal enterprises that have victimized thousands of Chinese citizens.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government plans to launch a new digital hospital service, NHS Online, by 2027 to help alleviate pressure on the healthcare system and reduce patient waiting lists. The service will be accessible via the NHS app and will feature dedicated doctors for online assessments, consultations, and follow-up appointments. Officials state the initiative aims to modernize the NHS, freeing up in-person capacity for those who need it most by handling millions of appointments virtually. While the plan builds on successful pilot programs, concerns remain about implementation, staffing, and ensuring access for patients who are not digitally proficient.</p>

The judge accused the agency of misleading the court about the certainty of the layoffs and warned that their conduct could have justified civil contempt proceedings.

Experts are now sifting through debris to assess the damage and recover what they can, but face immense challenges with limited resources.

          <p>The Taliban government has enacted a complete shutdown of internet and telecommunications services across Afghanistan, leading to what observers call a "total internet blackout." The move, which follows weeks of severed fiber-optic connections, has disrupted mobile networks, satellite TV, and communication with the outside world, including for international news agencies. While no official reason has been given, the shutdown is believed to be part of the Taliban's broader imposition of "morality measures." The blackout is expected to have a severe impact on the country's banking, e-commerce, and the daily lives of citizens who relied on the internet for education and business.</p>

While condemning racism, Lyons argued the issue stems from systemic pressure on housing resources, not just prejudice. Community leaders echo this sentiment, emphasizing that the core problem is the lack of available housing for everyone, which creates a competitive and tense environment.</p>

          <p>A Black woman who was knocked unconscious during a violent arrest by two Solano County sheriff's deputies in 2020 has secured a $17 million settlement. Nakia Porter had pulled over to switch drivers with her father when deputies approached, drew their guns, and slammed her to the pavement while handcuffing her, all of which was captured on body camera footage. Porter was jailed overnight for resisting arrest but was never charged. Her lawsuit accused the deputies of excessive force and civil rights violations, and the settlement resolves the case against the county.</p>

          <p>The 20-point peace plan proposed by the Trump administration outlines a detailed process for ending the Israel-Hamas war, beginning with an immediate ceasefire and the return of all hostages within 72 hours. In exchange, Israel would release a significant number of Palestinian prisoners and begin a phased withdrawal from Gaza. The plan proposes that Gaza be temporarily governed by a "technocratic" committee and an international stabilization force, sidelining both Hamas and the current Palestinian Authority. While it acknowledges Palestinian statehood as an "aspiration," it does not provide a clear roadmap, focusing instead on immediate demilitarization and economic redevelopment.</p>

          <p>Police in Morocco have detained dozens of young people as they attempt to suppress a third day of protests calling for reforms in education and healthcare. The demonstrations, organized online by youth networks under banners like "Gen Z 212," have seen a heavy security presence in major cities. Protesters have voiced frustration that the government is investing in stadiums for the 2030 World Cup while public services are neglected. The arrests, which include rights activists, have been condemned by human rights organizations as a restriction on freedom of expression amid growing public discontent over social inequality and youth unemployment.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an opinion piece, author Fatma Aydemir argues that the recent decline in support for diversity initiatives within Germany's cultural institutions is a deliberate political strategy, not simply "diversity fatigue." She contends that a backlash, fueled by the far-right AfD party and subtle resistance from within progressive circles, is pushing for a return to a "hollow neutrality" that reinforces the status quo. The article suggests that framing diversity as "woke" or "ideological" is a tactic to defend existing privileges and silence marginalized voices. This trend risks losing not just representation but also the complexity and truth that diverse art brings to society.</p>

          <p>Major grocery retailers in China, including Walmart and Alibaba's Freshippo, are shifting their strategy to combat an economic slump by emulating discount chains like Aldi. They are streamlining their large hypermarkets and increasingly focusing on their own private-label products, which offer quality comparable to name brands at lower prices. This move is a direct response to a change in consumer behavior, as shoppers become more frugal and value-conscious amid economic uncertainty. The goal is to win back customers by adopting a business model that has proven successful in the US and Europe.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto, currently a major Category 3 storm, is expected to generate life-threatening surf and rip currents along most of the U.S. East Coast this week. While the storm's center is forecast to pass to the west of Bermuda, its powerful swells will impact a wide area. Humberto rapidly intensified over the weekend, briefly reaching Category 5 strength before weakening slightly. Forecasters are also monitoring Tropical Storm Imelda, another system in the Atlantic, but Humberto's primary threat to the U.S. mainland will be hazardous coastal conditions rather than a direct landfall.</p>

The lawsuit follows a $6 billion settlement 3M paid in the U.S. to resolve similar claims from American service members. 3M maintains that the product is effective when used correctly and has stated it is prepared to defend itself in UK courts.</p>
