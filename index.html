          <p>A small panga-style boat carrying at least 16 people, believed to be migrants, capsized off the coast of San Diego near Torrey Pines State Beach, resulting in at least three deaths and four injuries. The U.S. Coast Guard has suspended the search for seven missing individuals, treating the incident as a suspected human smuggling operation. The boat, found near the shoreline, contained life vests and water bottles, suggesting the passengers were not tourists, and the Mexican consulate confirmed that some of the deceased and hospitalized are Mexican nationals. Local and federal authorities are investigating the incident, which is considered a mass casualty event, to determine the origins and circumstances surrounding the capsizing.</p>

          <p>India conducted strikes on Pakistan, targeting multiple sites in response to a recent terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that killed 26 people.

The attacks mark a significant intensification of the conflict, with India claiming to have targeted terrorist camps while Pakistan asserts civilian areas were hit.

          <p>President Trump has claimed that his administration has attracted nearly $9 trillion in new investments to the U.S., a figure that lacks supporting evidence. While the White House cited approximately $5 trillion in investments in Trump's first 100 days, some of these projects were announced before his term. The administration's comparisons to the Biden era are misleading, as Trump cites future investment pledges while contrasting them with a narrower list of projects completed under Biden. Experts caution that announcements about planned investments do not guarantee action, and it's too early to attribute new investments directly to Trump's policies.</p>

          <p>As cardinals prepare to elect the next Pope following the death of Pope Francis, deep divisions within the Catholic Church are becoming apparent. Pope Francis's 12-year tenure, marked by efforts to shift the Church's focus towards the poor and marginalized, has sparked both support and criticism. The upcoming conclave is the most diverse in history, reflecting Francis's appointments of cardinals from around the world, but differing priorities among regions, such as declining congregations in Europe versus social issues in Africa and Asia, complicate the selection process. The new Pope will need to balance spiritual leadership with global influence and address internal challenges such as sexual abuse and financial corruption.</p>

Experts raise concerns about potential violations of the Constitution's emoluments clauses and bribery provisions, citing examples such as foreign investments in Trump's crypto firm and the offer of exclusive dinners to coin holders.

Douthat notes that the show eliminates any sense of aspirational identification from its portrayal of affluent life in Connecticut, depicting characters as unhappy and insecure despite their wealth. The show functions as a reassuring response to meritocratic status anxiety by portraying its rich world as a place where unhappiness is only magnified and financial security is still an illusion.

          <p>Senate Democrats are rallying against the GENIUS Act, a crypto regulation bill, due to concerns about President Trump and his family's business ventures in cryptocurrency. The bill, which aims to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, has lost Democratic support following the announcement of an Abu Dhabi-backed firm investing in a Trump family-linked crypto firm. Democrats are now pushing for legislation to ban elected officials and their families from benefiting from crypto assets, with Senator Warren highlighting the bill's shortcomings in safeguarding against corruption.</p>

Robitaille emphasized the need for a new voice to elevate the team, citing ongoing discussions with former general manager Blake about the team's future.
