          <p>Miami Heat captain Bam Adebayo and coach Erik Spoelstra have publicly voiced their strong support for teammate Terry Rozier following his arrest in connection with an illegal betting scheme. Rozier is alleged to have feigned an injury during a 2023 game while with the Charlotte Hornets to benefit wagers placed by co-conspirators. Despite the serious charges of wire fraud and money laundering, which led to his immediate leave from the NBA, his current team emphasized their solidarity. The Heat organization is focusing on compartmentalizing the issue to prepare for upcoming games while sending their care to their teammate.</p>

          <p>A shooting at a large party in Robeson County, North Carolina, resulted in two fatalities and left several others with critical injuries. The incident occurred early Saturday morning, with authorities reporting that a total of 13 people were shot. The local sheriff's office has stated that the event appears to be isolated, posing no ongoing threat to the community, though many of the over 150 attendees fled before law enforcement arrived. Investigators are currently seeking information from witnesses, and no arrests have been announced in the case.</p>

          <p>Left-wing independent candidate Catherine Connolly is set to be the next president of Ireland after her main rival, Heather Humphreys of Fine Gael, conceded the election. While vote counting was still in progress, Humphreys congratulated Connolly, acknowledging her victory and wishing her the best in the largely ceremonial role. Connolly, a 68-year-old former barrister and lawmaker, gained support from several left-leaning parties and has been a vocal critic of Israel's actions in Gaza. She will succeed Michael D. Higgins, who served the maximum two seven-year terms as president.</p>

          <p>Financial experts are observing a trend where investors are moving beyond the popular strategy of passively investing in S&P 500 ETFs like VOO. The concern is a lack of diversification, as the index has become heavily weighted towards technology, now accounting for a record 35%. In response, traders are showing renewed interest in small-cap stocks, with the Russell 2000 index recently outperforming the S&P 500. This potential market broadening comes as major tech companies are scheduled to report their latest earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent report reveals that more than one-third of Manhattan condo apartments resold between July 2024 and June 2025 were sold at a loss. Despite headlines of high-priced sales, the median price per square foot for these properties has remained stagnant over the last decade, a stark contrast to rising home prices across most of the U.S. When accounting for inflation, transaction costs, and renovations, the actual losses for sellers are likely even higher. The luxury market, particularly apartments sold for over $10 million, was the exception, consistently yielding profits for sellers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a significant drop in the number of active serial killers since their peak in the 1970s and 80s, public fascination with them persists, fueled by social media rumors and popular entertainment. Authorities in cities like Austin, New York, and Boston have recently had to debunk online theories about active serial killers. Experts attribute the real-world decline to factors like the end of the hitchhiking era, advances in DNA technology, and better law enforcement communication. This article suggests that while the actual threat has diminished, the idea of the serial killer serves as a cultural 'monster' onto which society projects its fears.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused the United States of manufacturing a pretext for war after the U.S. deployed the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford to the Caribbean. This move significantly increases U.S. military presence in a region where it has already conducted air strikes against alleged drug traffickers. The Pentagon stated the deployment is to combat transnational criminal organizations, but Caracas fears the ultimate goal is regime change. The heightened military activity has escalated tensions between the two nations, with Maduro claiming the U.S. is seeking a "new eternal war."</p>

          <p>During an address marking the 80th anniversary of Taiwan's return from Japanese rule, senior Chinese leader Wang Huning issued a stern warning against separatist activities. He stated that Beijing will leave no room for any form of "Taiwan independence," emphasizing the need to deepen cross-strait integration and foster a shared Chinese national identity. The commemoration of "Taiwan Restoration Day" by Beijing is viewed as a strategic move to reinforce its sovereignty claims over the self-ruled island. Wang's comments underscore the Communist Party's unwavering commitment to achieving what it terms the complete reunification of the motherland.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly called for the prosecution of several former high-ranking Justice Department officials from the Biden era, including former Attorney General Merrick Garland and special counsel Jack Smith. Trump accused them of illegal conduct related to an FBI investigation, known as Arctic Frost, which reportedly obtained the phone records of nine Republican lawmakers. This marks the latest instance of Trump advocating for legal action against his political adversaries. The investigation in question was part of a probe into efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.</p>

          <p>A family in West Virginia has experienced a medical ordeal after four of their six children were diagnosed with Chiari malformation, a rare condition where brain tissue extends into the spinal canal. The journey began when their youngest daughter, Austyn, required brain surgery to alleviate severe symptoms, which dramatically improved her quality of life. Subsequently, three of her older sisters—Amelia, Aubrey, and Adalee—were also diagnosed after exhibiting various symptoms. While a genetic link is possible in about 10% of cases, seeing it in four siblings is highly unusual, leading to multiple successful surgeries and a new sense of normalcy for the family.</p>

Officers confiscated tens of thousands of empty pens, raw ingredients, and over 2,000 unlicensed products. The MHRA warned that such unauthorized medicines are untested and potentially deadly, urging the public to only purchase from registered pharmacies.</p>

          <p>Erie, Pennsylvania, a key swing county, is experiencing economic whiplash and deep political division due to President Trump's policies. The cancellation of a $300 million recycling plant project, attributed to a hold on a Department of Energy loan, exemplifies the local impact of federal spending cuts. Local businesses are divided on the effects of tariffs, with some farmers facing lost markets while manufacturers see it as a necessary pain for long-term gain. Despite growing needs at food banks and economic uncertainty, many of the president's supporters in the area remain steadfast in their backing.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

This potential policy shift has alarmed nutrition experts and organizations like the American Heart Association, who emphasize the consistent link between high saturated fat intake and cardiovascular disease. While some researchers note that replacing these fats with sugars can be more harmful, they agree that a broad recommendation to increase saturated fat intake is misguided and not based on comprehensive evidence.</p>
