          <p>A devastating fire at the Gabriel House assisted living home in Fall River, Massachusetts, has resulted in the deaths of nine residents. Firefighters arrived to a scene of heavy flames and people trapped in windows, ultimately rescuing many but facing what the fire chief described as an "unfathomable tragedy." In addition to the fatalities, over 30 people were hospitalized, and five firefighters sustained minor injuries. The cause of the fire is under investigation, though the building was reportedly equipped with sprinklers.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has implemented a hosepipe ban for 1.1 million customers in parts of southern England, including Swindon, Oxfordshire, and Berkshire, effective July 22. The restriction follows a period of prolonged dry weather and increased water demand, which has strained local supplies. The ban prohibits activities like watering gardens and washing cars with a hosepipe, with potential fines of up to £1,000 for violations. The Environment Agency has also declared a state of prolonged dry weather in the region, prompting calls for water conservation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from the Justice Department's Inspector General has uncovered systemic abuse of restraints within the federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), including cases leading to death and amputation. Investigators found that prison officials frequently violated their own policies by shackling inmates for extended periods, sometimes for days or weeks, and using restraints as a form of punishment. The report, which noted that poor record-keeping hindered the full scope of the investigation, prompted the BOP to agree to revise its policies and improve practices.</p>

          <p>Ewan Methven has been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 23 years for the murder of his 21-year-old girlfriend, Phoenix Spencer-Horn, in their East Kilbride home. Methven admitted to the violent attack, which involved choking and stabbing her, before attempting to dismember her body and conceal the crime for two days. During the sentencing, the judge highlighted the extreme brutality of the crime and the profound grief of the victim's family. Methven had tried to deceive the family by sending texts from his victim's phone after her death.</p>

          <p>London Southend Airport has ceased operations indefinitely after a private aircraft crashed upon takeoff, erupting into what witnesses described as a "huge fireball." The flight, operated by Dutch company Zeusch Aviation, was en route from Pula, Croatia, to Lelystad, Netherlands. While the number of casualties has not been officially confirmed, all Monday flights have been rerouted, and the Air Accidents Investigation Branch is investigating the incident. Eyewitnesses reported the plane banked sharply and inverted before hitting the ground shortly after an unusually rapid takeoff.</p>

          <p>The Dragon Bravo Fire, burning in the Grand Canyon's North Rim, has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and between 50 to 80 other structures. The fire expanded rapidly due to high winds, and firefighting efforts were complicated by a chlorine gas leak from a destroyed water treatment facility, which forced an evacuation. All guests and employees were safely evacuated, but the loss of the iconic 1930s-era lodge has been described as a devastating blow to Arizona's history.

          <p>The price of beef in the United States continues to hover at record highs, driven by a shrinking national cattle herd, the smallest since 1951. Factors such as prolonged drought, higher production costs, and trade disruptions have forced farmers to reduce their herds, tightening supply. Despite the elevated prices, consumer demand remains strong, prompting shoppers to seek more affordable cuts and restaurants to adjust their menus. The USDA predicts that prices will likely stay high into 2026, while the industry adapts by raising larger animals to maximize beef production. (not investment advice)</p>

The plan, funded by increased taxes on corporations and the wealthy, reflects a growing movement to treat childcare as a public good, similar to the city's successful universal pre-K program.

Modern lifestyles, characterized by stress, revenge bedtime procrastination, and constant screen use, actively sabotage rest. Furthermore, systemic issues such as housing insecurity, noise pollution, and the stress of discrimination disproportionately affect sleep quality in marginalized communities, creating significant health disparities.</p>

          <p>An independent investigation into the conduct of "MasterChef" presenter Gregg Wallace has substantiated 45 allegations against him, including unwelcome physical contact and inappropriate language. The inquiry, initiated by the show's production company after a BBC News report, uncovered claims spanning a 19-year period. The report also notes that Wallace was diagnosed with autism during the investigation, which he accepts may help explain but not excuse his actions. In response, the BBC has apologized for missed opportunities to address the behavior and confirmed it has no plans to work with Wallace in the future.</p>

          <p>Following the release of a preliminary report on the fatal Air India crash in June, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has stated that the fuel control switches on Boeing aircraft are safe. The Indian investigation highlighted that the switches on the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner were moved to the "cut-off" position moments after takeoff, a detail that drew attention to a 2018 FAA advisory about the switches' locking feature. However, the FAA clarified that it does not consider the issue an unsafe condition that would warrant a mandatory directive. The crash of Flight 171 killed 260 people.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's latest spending bill is projected to negatively impact health insurers that manage Medicaid plans, such as UnitedHealthcare and Aetna. Experts predict that funding cuts and new work verification requirements for recipients will increase administrative burdens and likely lead to insurers scaling back their Medicaid offerings. The changes could also result in a sicker pool of enrollees, as those with immediate health needs are more likely to complete the complex verification process. The Congressional Budget Office estimates these policy shifts could cause 7.8 million people to become uninsured by 2034. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Undocumented farm workers across the U.S. report feeling as though they are being "hunted like animals" as the Trump administration intensifies its immigration enforcement actions. In interviews, workers described losing income and living in constant fear due to raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The crackdown creates a paradox for the agricultural industry, which relies heavily on this labor force. Worker advocates are alarmed by proposals to give farmers more control over immigration enforcement, suggesting it could create exploitative, slavery-like conditions for vulnerable workers.</p>

The book details how the company, under S.I. Newhouse Jr., shaped American culture by creating an aspirational world of glamour, celebrity, and status. However, as author Michael M. Grynbaum explains, the rise of social media has democratized influence, diminishing the once-unrivaled power of Condé Nast's editors.

          <p>In an interview about her book "Resurface," author and former Olympic diver Cassidy Krug discusses how to navigate major life changes, which she calls "lifequakes." Krug explains that people are often resistant to change because society fosters an increasing need for certainty, making inevitable transitions feel more daunting. She advises that overcoming this paralysis involves reframing fear as opportunity, taking small concrete steps, and using rituals to honor what is being left behind. She suggests that by the time a decision to quit something feels 50/50, it is often best to move on and embrace the change.</p>

The article criticizes the branding and merchandising of the camp by Florida politicians as performative cruelty, noting that most immigration detainees have no criminal record. The author warns that this state-level project, operating with little oversight, may be a harbinger of a more inhumane national approach to immigration detention.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers are considering a reparations bill that would allow state colleges to factor an applicant's lineage as a descendant of enslaved people in the admissions process. The bill, AB 7, is carefully worded to focus on lineage rather than race, a distinction proponents hope will allow it to circumvent California's Proposition 209, which bans affirmative action. The measure is part of a broader package of reparations bills and represents a progressive state-level pushback against a national trend of dismantling diversity programs. Opponents argue the distinction is a proxy for race and will face immediate legal challenges if passed.</p>

          <p>Despite nearly every U.S. county experiencing flooding, only 4% of homeowners have flood insurance, creating a significant protection gap.

As climate change fuels more intense rainfall, experts stress the importance of purchasing coverage through FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program. However, rising premiums in high-risk areas are making policies unaffordable for many, forcing residents to weigh the high cost of insurance against the devastating risk of an uninsured loss.</p>
