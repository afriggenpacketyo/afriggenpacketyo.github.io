          <p>Federal immigration authorities have revealed that some migrants arrested in the Los Angeles area last week have prior criminal records, including assault and drug offenses. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers arrested nearly 45 individuals during a sweep across various locations, sparking protests against the operations. Among those arrested, several had serious criminal histories, including Rolando Veneracion-Enriquez, who had burglary and sexual assault convictions, and Jose Gregorio Medranda Ortiz, who was sentenced for conspiracy to distribute cocaine. President Trump deployed National Guard troops to Los Angeles following clashes between protesters and federal immigration authorities.</p>

          <p>Colombian presidential hopeful Miguel Uribe Turbay is in critical condition after being shot at a campaign rally in BogotÃ¡. The 39-year-old senator was attacked while addressing supporters, with reports indicating he was shot twice in the head. Police arrested a 15-year-old suspect at the scene, and an investigation is underway. President Gustavo Petro condemned the attack as an act of violence against democracy, while U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio blamed the shooting on violent leftist rhetoric. Uribe, a right-wing critic of Petro, announced his candidacy for next year's election in October and comes from a prominent political family.</p>

The alleged incident occurred last month after a group of soldiers visited a bar in the town of Nanyuki.

          <p>NPR and PBS's Frontline investigated how communities rebuild after disasters, questioning whether the $50 billion spent annually by the federal government helps communities build back safer. The investigation focused on areas affected by Hurricane Helene in North Carolina and compared them to Houston, New York, and New Jersey, finding failures to rebuild in ways that would prevent future disasters. The article highlights the struggle between the desire to quickly rebuild and the need for more resilient infrastructure. Experts emphasize that a lack of comprehensive planning and the influence of private developers contribute to ongoing vulnerability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has found that microplastics from polylactic acid (PLA), a widely used biodegradable material, can enter the metabolic cycle of bacteria and cells in the gut after being ingested. Researchers in China and the United States discovered that these microplastics altered gut metabolism and damaged the gut barrier in mice. This damage could potentially contribute to conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and diabetes. This marks the first time microplastics have been found to enter the body's metabolic cycle.</p>

          <p>Mauricio Pochettino has dismissed rumors linking him to the vacant Tottenham Hotspur managerial position, stating that it is "not realistic" for him to leave his role as US menâ€™s national team manager. Pochettino enjoyed a successful run at Spurs from 2014 to 2019, and has since been a possible candidate for the managerial position. He emphasized his commitment to the US national team, despite a recent loss to Turkey in a friendly match. He has called in a younger and less-experienced squad for this summerâ€™s games, with several of the teamâ€™s first-choice stars out.</p>

          <p>The Labour government's upcoming Spending Review is seen as a crucial opportunity to demonstrate a confident and deliverable economic vision to the private sector and international investors. After a cautious first year, the government must convince potential investors that its economic plans are real and address long-term challenges such as industrial energy prices and worker illness. The Chancellor's focus on long-term capital spending, with 2.7% of GDP earmarked for this purpose, marks the highest sustained level in nearly half a century.</p>
