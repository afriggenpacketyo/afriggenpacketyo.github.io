          <h2>Republicans Grapple with Trump's Ambiguous Stance on Tax Policy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Congressional Republicans are facing confusion due to President Trump's inconsistent messaging regarding tax policy within the 'big, beautiful bill.' Trump has suggested a 'tiny' tax increase for the wealthy, which clashes with the Republican Party's long-held stance against raising taxes. This mixed messaging has caused frustration among Republicans, especially after Trump stated he was 'OK' if they did it but Republicans 'probably should not do it.' Trump's economic message resonated with blue-collar voters, but the lack of clear direction from the White House is causing uncertainty as the House attempts to pass the measure.

          <p>Valeria Marquez, a beauty influencer with over 200,000 TikTok followers, was shot dead during a livestream at her beauty salon in Zapopan, Mexico. The 23-year-old was responding to someone off-screen when she was shot in the abdomen and head, leading to her immediate death. Authorities are investigating the case as a femicide, the killing of a woman for gender-related reasons, and local media reports suggest the shooter pretended to bring her a gift. The incident has sparked outrage in Mexico, highlighting the country's ongoing femicide problem, which is tied with Paraguay, Uruguay and Bolivia as nations with the fourth highest rates of femicide in the the Latin American region, as per the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>

The T-4 jet disappeared from radar shortly after departing Komaki Air Base, and the investigation may be hampered by the lack of a flight recorder.

Despite these hardships, his father reports that Edan's spirit remains unbroken, and he is described as still being his goofy, funny self, though simply tired.

          <p>House Republicans are pushing forward with legislation to enact President Trumpâ€™s domestic agenda, including tax cuts, Medicaid changes, and food assistance adjustments, but face internal dissent that could delay or derail passage. The measure would extend Trumpâ€™s 2017 tax cuts and enact campaign pledges not to tax tips or overtime pay, offset partly by cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, and clean energy subsidies. Conservative lawmakers argue the proposed cuts to Medicaid do not go far enough, while Republicans from high-tax states are upset about the state and local tax deduction limit. The bill is also facing Republican opposition in the Senate.</p>

          <p>A preliminary investigation by British maritime authorities found that the Bayesian superyacht, which sank off Sicily last year killing seven people, likely capsized due to high winds and its towering single mast. The report noted that the yacht's gigantic single mast increased its vulnerability to capsizing in high winds, and a deckhand's delay in waking the captain exacerbated the situation. The investigation also found that the yacht's stability book lacked critical data, and its angle of vanishing stability was lower than many sailboats. The report also indicates that the storm ripped apart a protective awning on the bridge, pushed the enormous yacht all the way over onto its side and sent passengers and crew members scrambling in the dark for their lives as water began to cascade through the cabins.</p>

In February, Trump halted all foreign aid to South Africa, claiming race-based discrimination, and in March, the administration expelled South Africaâ€™s ambassador after he criticized Trump.

          <p>Following Trump's offer of refugee status to white Afrikaners, the BBC explores varying perspectives within the community. Ulrich Janse van Vuuren, a social media influencer, expresses pride in his Afrikaner heritage and commitment to South Africa's success, dismissing those who have taken up Trump's offer as 'opportunists'. However, others, like Ilse Steenkamp, who lost her farm after an invasion, feel persecuted and see leaving as the only option. The South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has labeled their move a 'cowardly act' as he addressed farmers at a convention held in the Free State province.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole after serving more than three decades for the 1989 killings of their parents. Attorney Mark Geragos thanked the judge for his decision and relatives of the brothers expressed joy, but Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman opposed the resentencing, describing the decision as 'monumental' with significant implications. The case will now go to the California Board of Parole Hearings before a final decision by the governor, and the parole board is set to conduct separate hearings on June 13 for Erik and Lyle Menendez.</p>

          <p>Residents of a Richmond, California neighborhood are puzzled by a series of dead birds found under power lines, with some believing electrocution is the cause. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife received two dead birds from PG&E, but said they showed no signs of electrocution. Rather, signs of trauma, potentially from a pellet gun, a BB gun, or a slingshot. PG&E released a statement saying they do not believe there was an issue with their electrical equipment and agrees that these birds were not electrocuted.</p>

Under Newsom's plan, low-income adults without legal status will no longer be eligible to apply for Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program, starting in 2026, and those already enrolled won't be kicked off their plans. Starting in 2027, adults with "unsatisfactory immigration status" on Medi-Cal will also have to pay a $100 monthly premium.</p>
