The race pits Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears against former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger, with national issues like federal job cuts and immigration taking center stage. The election is also unfolding in the shadow of heightened concerns over political violence following the recent assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that he ordered a third lethal military strike on a vessel in the Caribbean Sea suspected of trafficking illicit narcotics, resulting in the deaths of three individuals described as "narcoterrorists." The strike is the latest in a series of actions taken under a new policy that treats drug cartels as terrorist organizations, allowing for the use of deadly military force. This approach has drawn criticism regarding its legal justification under international law, moving away from traditional law enforcement interdictions.</p>

The 85-page lawsuit was deemed overly long and full of "tedious and burdensome" language. The judge did not rule on the merits of the case but has given Trump's legal team 28 days to file a shorter, more professional amended complaint.</p>

          <p>Michael Eisner, who served as CEO of Disney for over two decades, has publicly criticized the company's decision to suspend late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. In a social media post, Eisner condemned the move as an example of "out-of-control intimidation," linking it to threats made by the FCC chairman against the network's broadcast license. He questioned the lack of leadership from corporations in standing up to bullies and defending the First Amendment, while also praising Kimmel as talented and funny.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a proclamation imposing a new annual fee of $100,000 for H-1B visas, a move that could significantly impact the U.S. tech industry, which heavily relies on the program to hire skilled foreign workers. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated the policy is designed to encourage companies to "Train Americans" instead of hiring foreign talent. The decision has drawn criticism for creating a disincentive to attract top global talent, with immigration experts also questioning the legal authority of the executive branch to impose such a fee.

          <p>Remnants of Tropical Storm Mario have caused severe rain and mudslides in the San Bernardino Mountains, heavily impacting communities like Forest Falls. Residents have faced power outages, property damage, and submerged vehicles as mud and debris flows have buried roads and toppled infrastructure. The storms have been particularly destructive in areas with wildfire burn scars, where the landscape is more vulnerable to flash flooding and debris flows, trapping residents and requiring emergency responses.</p>

          <p>Evans Kibet, a 36-year-old Kenyan long-distance runner, has appeared in a video as a prisoner of war in Ukraine, claiming he was tricked into joining the Russian military. Kibet says he traveled to Russia for what he believed was a series of running races but was coerced into signing a military contract and sent to a training camp with little instruction. He states he escaped during his first mission and surrendered to Ukrainian forces, pleading to be sent home to his family in Kenya rather than back to Russia.</p>
