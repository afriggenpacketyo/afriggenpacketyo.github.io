          <p>The New York Yankees shattered their franchise record with nine home runs in a single game against the Milwaukee Brewers, sparking debate about their uniquely shaped "torpedo" bats.  These bats, featuring a lower, larger sweet spot, are legal under MLB rules and have been adopted by several players, although some, like Aaron Judge, have opted to stick with traditional designs. The Yankees' unprecedented home run surge highlights the ongoing quest for marginal advantages in professional baseball.</p>
