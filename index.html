          <p>World leaders have condemned the fatal shooting of two Israeli Embassy staff members in Washington, D.C., with Israel blaming antisemitic incitement for the attack. The suspect, identified as a Chicago man, reportedly shouted "free, free Palestine" during his arrest. President Trump and European leaders expressed condolences and denounced the act, emphasizing that hatred and extremism have no place in society. Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar attributed the attack to ongoing toxic antisemitism and incitement against Israel, promising increased security at Israeli embassies worldwide.</p>

          <p>The Republican-led House passed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" by a narrow 215-214 vote, advancing President Trump's tax and immigration agenda after weeks of internal GOP disputes.

The SALT cap, set at $10,000 by Trump's 2017 tax cuts, has stirred controversy, particularly among lawmakers from high-tax states. The article details how the SALT cap became a sticking point in the GOP's spending and tax bill, highlighting the fragile political process in Congress and the complex Republican coalition.

          <p>A sell-off in global bonds is accelerating due to Moody's downgrade of U.S. credit rating and concerns over President Trump's tax bill, igniting fiscal worries. The U.S. 30-year Treasury yield broke above 5%, and the 10-year yield has climbed significantly. Investors are losing confidence in U.S. assets, leading to a broader exodus from bonds across major markets. Japan's 40-year government bond yield hit a record high, and German government bonds are also being dumped, reflecting growing unease with worsening fiscal trajectories.</p>
