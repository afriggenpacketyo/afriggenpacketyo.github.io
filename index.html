          <p>Energy Secretary Chris Wright credits President Trump's policies aimed at increasing domestic oil and gas production for the recent decline in oil prices.  He argues that the anticipated rise in supply is a benefit to American consumers, despite concerns about Trump's tariffs and OPEC's production plans.
