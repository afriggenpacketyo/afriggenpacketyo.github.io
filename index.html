          <p>The Trump administration is advancing efforts to incorporate cryptocurrency into American retirement plans, with a new executive order mandating its inclusion in 401(k)s. This move aligns with a broader push to make the U.S. a leader in digital asset innovation, fueling record inflows into crypto ETFs like BlackRock's Bitcoin Trust. While some financial advisors now advocate for significant crypto allocation, others caution about the inherent volatility and risks, especially concerning leveraged products not suitable for long-term investors.

          <p>The global oil market is largely discounting President Trump's threats to impose severe secondary tariffs on countries purchasing Russian energy exports. Despite a 25% tariff threat against India, a major importer, oil prices fell as traders speculate the move is a negotiation tactic rather than a firm policy. Analysts suggest that if the tariffs were fully implemented, they would significantly disrupt global supply and raise prices, but the market currently believes a deal will be reached or that countries like India would simply absorb the cost.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed the Commerce Department to develop a new census that explicitly excludes undocumented immigrants from its count. The announcement, made via social media, states the new survey will be based on "modern day facts and figures" and information from the 2024 election. This move represents a significant effort to alter the decennial count, which determines congressional representation and federal funding, and follows a previously blocked attempt to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.</p>

          <p>Restaurant Brands International reported mixed second-quarter earnings, with overall revenue beating expectations but adjusted earnings per share falling short. Strong international performance and growth at Tim Hortons were offset by a 1.4% decline in same-store sales at its Popeyes chain, which faces increased competition in the fast-food chicken market. The company's Burger King brand saw modest growth, particularly in the U.S. as its turnaround efforts and restaurant renovations continue.</p>

          <p>This essay argues that the decline of politeness, exacerbated by online interactions and AI, is harming individual happiness and well-being. The author defines politeness as a key component of the "agreeableness" personality trait and cites research showing that being courteous, even to nonhuman entities like AI bots, can improve one's own mood. To counteract the coarsening of modern discourse, the author suggests making courtesy a conscious habit, renouncing sarcasm, and responding to rudeness with dignity for one's own benefit.</p>

          <p>Attorney Alan Dershowitz was again refused service by a pierogi vendor at a Martha's Vineyard farmers market, escalating a local dispute that has drawn national attention. The vendor cited Dershowitz's legal defense of controversial figures like Jeffrey Epstein, while Dershowitz has accused the vendor of antisemitism and threatened legal action. The confrontation drew a crowd of residents who chanted for Dershowitz to leave, supporting the vendor's right to refuse service to someone they described as a "bully."</p>

          <p>A WNBA game between the Indiana Fever and the Los Angeles Sparks was briefly interrupted when a fan threw a sex toy onto the court, the latest in a series of similar incidents at league games. The object landed near Fever forward Sophie Cunningham, who had previously criticized the trend. Players and coaches condemned the act as "ridiculous" and dangerous, and the WNBA reiterated its policy of ejecting and banning any fan who throws objects onto the court.</p>

          <p>Energy Secretary Chris Wright has indicated that the Trump administration is reviewing and updating previously published National Climate Assessments, which were recently removed from government websites. Wright dismissed the past congressionally mandated reports as not being "fair and broad-based," a move that would represent a significant escalation in efforts to alter the official scientific record on climate change. This follows the administration's release of a separate report by climate-contrarian researchers that questioned the severity of climate change.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has implemented a new wave of "reciprocal" tariffs against dozens of U.S. trading partners, with a baseline rate of 10% for most countries. However, some nations face significantly higher duties; for example, Brazil and India are subject to 50% tariffs, while Mexico and Canada face rates of 25% and 35% respectively. Several key allies, including the U.K., E.U., and Japan, have struck deals to avoid the highest rates, while China is in a temporary truce with a 30% tariff rate. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the enduring power of the conspiracy theory surrounding a supposed "client list" of Jeffrey Epstein, a belief held by a majority of Americans. The theory's persistence is fueled by a lack of definitive proof of its non-existence, Epstein's known habit of meticulous record-keeping, and the Trump administration's own vacillating and secretive handling of related files. The author draws parallels to the JFK assassination, arguing that government opacity and selective release of information create a "where there's smoke, there's fire" effect that allows such theories to thrive.</p>

          <p>Astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope have found a candidate planet orbiting Alpha Centauri A, the closest Sun-like star to Earth. The potential planet is a gas giant, similar in size to Jupiter, and orbits within the star's habitable zone, where temperatures could potentially support life on a hypothetical moon. While the planet's existence requires further confirmation, the discovery in the same star system featured in the "Avatar" films has sparked excitement about the possibility of finding new worlds in our cosmic neighborhood.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides an overview of three key financial tools for retirees: Social Security, annuities, and reverse mortgages. It positions Social Security as a foundational but often insufficient income source, while annuities are presented as a way to create a guaranteed, pension-like income stream for those concerned about longevity risk. Reverse mortgages are described as a suitable option for "house-rich, cash-poor" seniors who wish to tap their home equity without moving, but are not ideal for those wanting to leave their home to heirs.

          <p>Eli Lilly's stock dropped after its experimental daily obesity pill, orforglipron, showed nearly 12% weight loss in a late-stage trial, a result that fell below some Wall Street expectations of around 15%. While doctors praised the outcome as clinically significant for an oral medication, the data was viewed as less effective than existing injectable treatments. The company plans to seek regulatory approval by the end of the year, positioning the pill as a more convenient, needle-free alternative in the booming weight-loss drug market.</p>
