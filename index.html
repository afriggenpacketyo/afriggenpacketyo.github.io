        <p>Polish President Andrzej Duda renewed his call for the United States to deploy nuclear weapons in Poland as a deterrent against Russia.  This follows a similar request made in 2022.  The appeal comes amid growing concerns about Russia in Poland and discussions among NATO members about nuclear protection.  France's potential use of its nuclear deterrent to protect Europe is also mentioned, along with President Macron's call for increased European defense spending and a potential US disengagement from European security.  Meanwhile, negotiations are underway for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine.</p>

        <p>The Court of Appeal is considering increasing the sentence of Urfan Sharif, Sara Sharif's father, to a whole life order for her murder.

        <p>Dollar General reported fourth-quarter revenue that slightly exceeded expectations, but profits were negatively affected by a store portfolio review resulting in the closure of 96 Dollar General stores and 45 Popshelf stores.  The company attributed a significant portion of its operating profit decline to charges related to these closures.  Despite the closures, Dollar General's full-year revenue increased, and the company projects continued revenue growth in the coming year, though slightly below analyst estimates.</p>
