        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The suspect in the Minneapolis Catholic school shooting, identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman, harbored intense hatred towards numerous groups and had a "deranged obsession" with past mass murderers. According to investigators, Westman, a former student at the school, legally purchased three firearms and fired from outside the church, killing two children and injuring 18 others before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Authorities are reviewing extensive writings and videos left by the shooter, which indicate a desire for notoriety and an intent to cause maximum terror and carnage. The attack has prompted renewed calls for gun control from local officials.</p>

          <p>An in-depth look at the Minneapolis school shooting reveals the 23-year-old attacker, Robin Westman, had previously attended the school and their mother had worked there. Westman, who legally changed their name in 2020 to reflect their female identity, meticulously planned the attack, as detailed in notebooks and videos posted online. These materials, which included sketches of the church and racist messages on ammunition, indicated a desire to kill children and an admiration for other mass shooters. The FBI is investigating the attack as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime, while officials have urged against directing hate toward the transgender community.</p>

          <p>Robert Primus, a Democratic member of the Surface Transportation Board, was abruptly fired by the Trump administration, an action he discovered after his work phone was locked upon returning from an Amtrak event. Primus, who was nominated by Trump during his first term, stated he was given no cause for his termination and intends to explore legal options to challenge the decision. The White House confirmed the firing, stating Primus did not align with the President's "America First agenda." This move comes as the board is reviewing a major freight rail merger and follows other recent high-profile dismissals by the administration.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gap Inc. reported second-quarter revenue that fell short of Wall Street expectations, primarily due to a significant 9% decline in comparable sales at its Athleta brand. While the company's other major brands like Old Navy and Banana Republic showed positive comparable sales growth, Athleta's underperformance dragged down the overall results, causing the stock to fall in after-hours trading. CEO Richard Dickson acknowledged the disappointment, stating the brand had moved away from its performance roots while trying to attract new customers. The company is now focused on a "year of reset" for Athleta under new leadership. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Best Buy exceeded revenue and earnings forecasts for its second quarter but maintained its full-year guidance, citing uncertainty around the impact of tariffs on consumer behavior and its business. The consumer electronics retailer has seen some positive trends, with its computing category marking six consecutive quarters of growth and strong sales in gaming, boosted by the new Nintendo Switch 2. However, CEO Corie Barry noted that customers remain thoughtful about big-ticket purchases and the company anticipates a potential slowdown as shoppers wait for holiday deals.

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) held a major hiring expo near Dallas, aiming to recruit thousands of new officers as part of a Trump administration plan to nearly triple the agency's workforce. The event drew a diverse crowd of applicants, including military veterans and individuals seeking a career change, motivated by patriotism, financial incentives like a $50,000 bonus, and a desire to serve. Many attendees expressed support for President Trump's immigration policies, citing a desire to "defend the homeland." The rapid hiring push, which includes a shortened training course, has raised concerns among critics about creating an ideologically driven workforce loyal to the president.</p>

          <p>Ford has issued a recall for 500,000 vehicles, specifically the 2015-2018 Ford Edge and 2016-2018 Lincoln MKX SUVs, due to a potential brake fluid leak. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a hose in the rear brake system can rupture, leading to increased brake pedal travel and longer stopping distances, which elevates the risk of a crash. Ford plans to notify affected owners in early September, though the remedy for the issue is still under development and is not expected to be available until next April. This action adds to a series of recalls Ford has issued this year.</p>

          <p>The Reform UK leader of Nottinghamshire County Council, Mick Barton, has banned reporters from the Nottingham Post and its online affiliate from speaking with him or his councillors. The ban, which extends to BBC-funded Local Democracy Reporters, was reportedly prompted by a disagreement over an article concerning local government reorganization. Barton accused the newspaper of misrepresentation and stated the move was to protect the credibility of his governance, not to silence journalism. The newspaper's editor called the decision an unprecedented "direct attack on the free press," a sentiment echoed by the Liberal Democrats, who urged Reform UK leader Nigel Farage to intervene.</p>

          <p>Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy is reportedly preparing for a 2028 Senate run against fellow Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, who has frequently clashed with President Donald Trump. Sources familiar with the governor's plans indicate he has discussed a potential run with Trump and has the former president's encouragement to challenge the long-serving incumbent. Dunleavy, a staunch Trump ally, has been a successful governor in a state with a complex political landscape, including ranked-choice voting. A potential matchup would pit Dunleavy's conservative base against Murkowski's more centrist appeal, with the state's influential Native vote likely being a key, and potentially conflicted, demographic for both candidates.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that while President Trump's political pressure on the Federal Reserve is a concern, the more significant and enduring threat to the central bank's independence is the nation's growing public debt. The author explains the concept of "fiscal dominance," where the Fed's monetary policy becomes subordinate to the government's need to manage its debt, forcing it to keep interest rates low. With U.S. debt exceeding 100% of GDP, rising interest payments create immense pressure on Congress, which may compel the Fed to suppress rates or tolerate inflation. This underlying fiscal reality, the article contends, will persist regardless of who is president.</p>

          <p>Average interest rates for home equity loans have fallen to their lowest point in 2025, reaching 8.22% and making them a more competitive borrowing option for homeowners. With American homeowners collectively holding a record high of nearly $18 trillion in home equity, this provides a substantial source of funds. The article suggests that these loans offer fixed rates, providing stability against market uncertainty, and may offer tax deductions for eligible home improvement projects. This combination of lower rates and high equity levels makes it a potentially opportune time for homeowners to consider this financing option. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon is significantly expanding its grocery business by integrating fresh and perishable items into its existing same-day delivery service for Prime members in over 1,000 cities. This strategic move allows customers to order items like eggs and produce alongside non-perishables and other goods for unified, rapid delivery from specialized fulfillment hubs. The initiative aims to close the convenience gap with traditional grocers like Walmart and Kroger, leveraging Amazon's formidable logistics network. While analysts note that the initial selection of fresh items is limited, the move signals a major long-term bet to capture a larger share of the U.S. grocery market.</p>

          <p>Nike is conducting another round of layoffs, affecting less than 1% of its corporate staff, as part of a strategic realignment under CEO Elliott Hill. This move follows a larger cut of 2% of staff last February and is aimed at restructuring the company to focus more squarely on specific sports categories rather than broad gender-based divisions like men's, women's, and kids'. The company is undoing a previous structure to put "sport and sport culture back at the center" and reignite its innovation pipeline. Impacted employees will be notified by September 8, with most changes taking effect later in the month.</p>

The trend marks a sharp reversal from the "Great Resignation," when workers frequently left jobs for better opportunities. Concurrently, the pay increase for those who do switch employers has diminished, with the median raise falling to 7% in July, down from a peak of 20% in 2022. This slowdown in job hopping and wage growth for switchers indicates a power shift back toward employers, potentially dampening future consumer spending growth as job opportunities become less abundant.</p>
