          <p>A catastrophic incident in Dhaka, Bangladesh, resulted in at least 19 deaths and 164 injuries after an air force training jet crashed into a school. The F-7 aircraft reportedly experienced a mechanical failure shortly after takeoff and slammed into a building at the Milestone School and College. The deceased include the pilot, who the armed forces stated had attempted to navigate the failing jet away from more populated areas. Many of the injured were children and adults who suffered severe burns, overwhelming local medical facilities.

          <p>Trump Media and Technology Group has announced the accumulation of approximately $2 billion in bitcoin and related digital assets, a move that significantly increases President Donald Trump's wealth. The company, which trades as DJT, stated these holdings now represent about two-thirds of its liquid assets, causing its stock to rise. This development is part of a broader embrace of cryptocurrency by Trump, who has vowed to make the U.S. a global crypto capital despite once being a skeptic. Critics and ethics experts have raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, as the president could profit from policies he is actively pursuing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the current interest rate climate, short-term Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are offering unusually high returns, making them an attractive option for parking significant sums like $20,000. This article advises savers to consider several factors before committing, such as the protection a CD offers against short-term market volatility amid ongoing inflation concerns. It also notes that while short-term rates are higher, a long-term CD might yield more total interest over time due to the extended earning period. Finally, the piece highlights that the most competitive rates are typically found at online banks, which may require moving funds from a traditional local institution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has sharply criticized Hunter Biden for comments he made during a web series interview regarding the Trump administration's immigration policies. In a profanity-laden rant, the younger Biden defended immigrants by questioning who would perform service industry jobs without them, a sentiment for which other Democrats have previously faced backlash. A White House spokeswoman condemned the remarks as "callous, self-interested maliciousness," contrasting his concerns with a recent incident where a CBP agent was shot by undocumented immigrants. The statement asserted that such an attitude from the Biden family is why Joe Biden left office with low approval ratings.</p>

As traditional soda consumption declines in the U.S., Pepsi is looking to innovate with products that offer health benefits like fiber and protein.

The release is part of a broader executive order signed by President Trump to declassify records related to the assassinations of King, John F. Kennedy, and Robert F. Kennedy.

At least four states have passed laws restricting their operations, citing public safety concerns, while more than a dozen other legislatures have introduced similar bills. Proponents argue these funds are a crucial lifeline that helps prevent people from being jailed simply due to poverty and demonstrate that cash bail is not essential for ensuring court appearances. Critics, however, demand tighter regulation, pointing to isolated cases where individuals released by these funds later committed violent crimes.</p>

It asserts that data consistently shows immigrants are less likely to commit violent crimes than native-born citizens and that the vast majority of so-called "criminal aliens" are convicted only of immigration offenses like unlawful entry. The piece traces the origins of criminalizing immigration to a 1929 eugenics-inspired law designed to exclude Mexicans.

The article notes that Trump uses tariffs as a flexible and unilateral tool to address perceived trade imbalances and achieve non-trade objectives, blurring the lines between economic policy and punitive sanctions. While this approach gives him direct control and raises revenue, it has led to retaliatory measures and destabilized relationships with key partners like China, Canada, and the EU. Experts warn that this unpredictable "tariff tango" could lead to a serious economic slowdown and is linked to historical periods of de-globalization and conflict.</p>

          <p>In a strongly worded joint statement, the United Kingdom and 27 other countries have condemned Israel's conduct in Gaza, calling for an immediate end to the war. The declaration criticizes Israel's aid delivery model as dangerous and inhumane, highlighting the killing of hundreds of Palestinians, including children, while seeking food and water. The statement asserts that the suffering of civilians has reached "new depths" and warns that the signatories are prepared to take further action to support a permanent ceasefire. Israel's foreign ministry rejected the statement, claiming it is "disconnected from reality" and wrongly blames Israel instead of Hamas.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Trump's Second Term Marked by Multifront War on Media Freedom</h2>

          <p>This analytical article argues that President Trump, in his second term, has moved beyond rhetoric to wage a comprehensive war against the free press using executive actions, lawsuits, and regulatory power. It details a pattern of actions including defunding public broadcasting, filing multi-billion dollar libel suits against major news outlets, and appointing a loyalist to head the FCC. The author compares these "repressive measures" to those of authoritarian leaders, suggesting a slow demolition of the Fourth Estate. The piece expresses alarm that these actions have been met with timidity from corporate media leaders and indifference from the public.</p>

          <p>Authorities in central Oregon are continuing their search for two people who are presumed dead following a tragic accident at Dillon Falls on the Deschutes River. The incident occurred when a group was swept over the 15-foot waterfall; one person was confirmed dead at the scene, and three others were rescued with minor injuries. Search and rescue operations involving divers, boats, and drones are underway, but officials believe survival is unlikely due to the powerful rapids and cold water. Investigators are working to determine how the group was swept over the falls, as warning signs are posted in the area.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines has announced it will officially end its long-standing open seating policy, with flights featuring assigned seats set to begin on January 27, 2026. Customers will be able to book these flights starting July 29 of this year. This major shift allows the carrier to offer new fare bundles and seating options, including extra legroom seats, which the airline says will unlock new opportunities for customers. The move, along with the recent elimination of its "bags fly free" policy, signals a significant change in the discount carrier's business strategy as it adapts to financial pressures and industry norms.</p>

          <p>California, along with a coalition of 19 other states and the District of Columbia, is suing the Trump administration over new rules that bar undocumented immigrants from various federally funded "public benefit" programs. The lawsuit argues that the restrictions, which affect programs like Head Start and community food banks, are a cruel and unlawful reversal of nearly three decades of precedent. California's Attorney General Rob Bonta stated the policy primarily targets working mothers and their children and will impose significant financial and administrative burdens on the states. The Trump administration has defended the rules as necessary to protect resources for American citizens.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced that the approximately 700 U.S. Marines deployed to Los Angeles amid immigration raids and protests will begin to withdraw. The decision follows an earlier announcement to release half of the nearly 4,000 National Guard soldiers also sent to the city. The military presence was a fiercely contentious issue, with local and state officials denouncing the deployment as inappropriate and incendiary. With protests having wound down, the Pentagon stated that stability has returned to the city. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called the withdrawal a "win for Los Angeles," reinforcing that troops should not be used for such domestic missions.</p>

          <p>The pilot of a SkyWest flight approaching Minot, North Dakota, performed an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a potential collision with a B-52 military bomber. The commercial jet was on its landing approach when the crew spotted the large aircraft on a converging course, which had not been announced by air traffic control. The pilot explained to passengers that he turned sharply to get behind the much faster military plane as the safest course of action. The Air Force confirmed a B-52 was in the area for a flyover of the state fair, and the FAA is now investigating the harrowing near-miss incident.</p>

          <p>The England women's national soccer team, the Lionesses, will no longer take the knee before matches, a decision manager Sarina Wiegman said was made because the anti-racism gesture's impact is "not good enough." The move comes after defender Jess Carter revealed she had been subjected to racist abuse on social media during the current tournament. The players stated that football needs to find a different way to combat racism, as the problem persists despite the long-standing gesture. Instead of kneeling, the team will stand together at kick-off to signal that current efforts are insufficient and to spark further conversation.</p>
