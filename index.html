          <p>T. Rowe Price is experiencing growth in actively managed exchange-traded funds, according to Tim Coyne, the firm's head of ETFs, who cites the T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation Equity ETF (TCAF) and T. Rowe Price U.S. Equity Research ETF (TSPA) as strategies catering to investor demand amid market volatility. The Capital Appreciation Equity ETF aims to outperform the S&P 500 with lower volatility and greater tax efficiency, holding around a hundred names, including Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple. The U.S. Equity Research ETF follows a similar strategy but emphasizes top tech stocks and is managed by the firm's North American directors of research. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon sellers are raising prices on various products, including kitchen appliances and household items, in response to President Trump's tariffs on goods manufactured in China. E-commerce software company SmartScout tracked 930 products on Amazon with an average price increase of 29% since April 9. While Amazon aims to keep prices low for consumers, some third-party sellers will need to pass on the tariff costs. This situation poses a challenge for sellers who operate on thin margins and face rising costs related to storage, fulfillment, and competition on the Amazon platform.</p>

          <p>ICE argues that the warrantless arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, an anti-Israel protester from Columbia University, was legal, claiming he was a flight risk after refusing to cooperate with agents seeking to verify his identity. Khalil's lawyers dispute this account, stating that he was cooperative and that agents did not present an arrest warrant. The Department of Homeland Security previously stated that Khalil led activities aligned with Hamas, a designated terrorist organization, and an immigration judge has ruled that he can be deported. The arrest has sparked protests and is viewed as an attempt by the Trump administration to target protesting visa holders.</p>

U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff met with Vladimir Putin in Moscow to advance U.S.-sponsored peace negotiations.

He dismissed concerns about the bond market's reaction, stating that it had gotten the "yips." Trump views ongoing tariff negotiations as a "total victory" even with substantial levies in place.</p>

          <p>President Trump's return to the White House has been marked by an unprecedented campaign of immigration enforcement, which has been met with less public opposition than in his first term. Public sentiment has shifted, driven by concerns about the influx of migrants under Biden's policies. This shift has emboldened the White House to pursue more aggressive immigration policies, including the deportation of alleged gang members and the revocation of visas for protesting students. These measures are facing criticism for overreach and potential violations of due process.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has stated that the UK's trade relationship with the EU is arguably "more important" than its relationship with the US. While in Washington for talks with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Reeves emphasized the need to rebuild trading relationships with European neighbors. She acknowledged the ongoing tariff issues and the desire for the UK to secure a trade deal with the US, but highlighted the significance of the EU as the UK's largest trading partner.</p>

Trump's tariffs are likened to self-inflicted oil shocks, potentially leading to higher prices, reduced demand, and layoffs. The article warns of potential economic turmoil reminiscent of the 1970s, with Trump's interventionist policies exacerbating the situation. The author suggests the only hope is that Trump will reverse course, but expresses concern that he will make the damage worse.</p>

This shift raises questions about the purpose of nightclubs and whether they are transforming into social spaces rather than dance venues. Some possible explanations include the influence of social media, the rise of large-scale venues mimicking festival culture, and a lack of space in denser cities. However, the issue may be a recurring one, with each generation complaining about the way the younger generation "clubs wrong."</p>

Cornwall Insight forecasts that the annual energy bill for a typical household will fall by £166, a drop of nearly 9%. This would bring the typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit to £1,683, the lowest level since last September.

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, is advocating for a ban on chemical dyes in food products. He announced an "understanding" with major food manufacturers to remove petroleum-based food colorings by 2026. While some companies like PepsiCo are considering phasing out synthetic colors, the FDA currently allows their use. The move aims to address concerns about the potential health effects of artificial dyes.</p>

          <h2>Hegseth's Use of Unsecured Line and Signal App Raises Security Concerns</h2>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth used the Signal app on a personal computer in his Pentagon office connected to an unsecured commercial internet line, known as a "dirty line." This practice raises security concerns due to the lack of firewall protections on commercial lines, making them susceptible to monitoring. Hegseth has denied sharing classified war plans over Signal, but the use of an unsecured line for communication raises questions about potential security breaches.</p>
