The report comes amid ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran and concerns about Iran's nuclear capabilities.

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that "multiple system failures" at Boeing led to the 2024 incident where a door plug flew off an Alaska Airlines flight. The NTSB report faults Boeing's inadequate training, guidance, and oversight, as well as the FAA's ineffective compliance enforcement. The incident, which left a gaping hole in the plane, resulted in minor injuries to eight passengers and prompted a lawsuit against Boeing and Alaska Airlines. The FAA stated that it has fundamentally changed how it oversees Boeing since the incident and has not lifted the 737 monthly production cap until Boeing can maintain the safety and quality of its aircraft.</p>

This comes amid controversy surrounding the meeting after the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, fired all previous members of the expert panel and appointed new members, some of whom have advocated against vaccines.

His proposals also include a significant expansion of community safety programs and making New York City a sanctuary for immigrants and the LGBTQ+ community.

          <p>Senate Republicans are attempting to force the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to sell its new electric vehicle (EV) mail delivery trucks through a provision in their bill to enact President Trump's agenda.

The Senate parliamentarian has deemed this provision a violation of budget reconciliation rules, and critics argue it would cost more to replace the EVs and undo infrastructure upgrades.

          <p>This article explores the debate surrounding lab-grown meat, also known as cultivated meat, as a potential solution to the environmental problems caused by traditional meat production. While advocates claim it can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and land use, critics argue that its environmental benefits are overstated and that it is an ultra-processed food controlled by multinational companies. The science behind lab-grown meat involves growing cells from farm animals in vats, but the process requires significant energy and resources. The article also discusses the regulatory landscape and consumer acceptance of lab-grown meat in various countries.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer observed that AI stocks are rebounding as investor fears regarding Chinese startup DeepSeek's potential to surpass leading tech companies subside. He highlights the resurgence of stocks like Nvidia and AMD, indicating that the AI narrative is once again prominent on Wall Street. Cramer suggests that the market's initial panic over DeepSeek was an overreaction, as the company's impact was not as significant as initially feared. This recovery signals a refutation of the idea that China had surpassed the U.S. in the AI race. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article examines the changing attitudes of voters toward political scandals, noting that scandals no longer serve as simple disqualifiers. Politicians now seem able to survive scandals, with voters and politicians treating them as just another factor in a cost-benefit analysis. The article cites examples such as Andrew Cuomo and Donald Trump, discussing how factors like scandal fatigue and partisan polarization influence voter behavior. The author suggests that while scandals can still hurt a politician, voters are often willing to overlook them if they believe the candidate is more electable or if they strongly oppose the rival's worldview.</p>

          <p>A new poll reveals that while Republicans largely support the U.S. airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, a majority of the public disapproves. There is bipartisan concern about a wider war with Iran, and differing views on the effectiveness of the strikes. Most Americans believe President Trump needs congressional authorization for military action against Iran. The poll also indicates that Americans remain concerned about the U.S. economy, with most saying prices are still rising. </p>
