          <p>In a recent interview, former President Trump expressed uncertainty about his duty to uphold the Constitution, stating he relies on his lawyers to adhere to Supreme Court rulings. He also teased the possibility of seeking a third term despite previously denying such intentions. Additionally, Trump mentioned he would not fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell before his term concludes in 2026. This statement raises questions about the separation of powers and the independence of the Federal Reserve. Optimism surrounding the stability of constitutional norms is tempered by Trump's remarks.</p>

          <h2>Experts Caution Women About the Risks and Costs of Egg Freezing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 19:05:03 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As egg freezing becomes increasingly popular, experts are cautioning women about relying solely on this procedure. Egg freezing is expensive, costing upwards of $12,000 per cycle, with additional storage and fertilization fees. There are no guarantees of success, as eggs may not survive the thawing process or develop into viable embryos. Critics also argue that the emphasis on profits in the fertility industry could lead to warped incentives, potentially pressuring doctors to encourage more cycles. The article also mentions that society's pressure on women to delay motherhood for career advancement should be addressed with better workplace policies.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing is on the rise as more women seek to preserve their fertility and expand their reproductive options.

This decision comes amidst concerns of an oversupplied oil market and rising tariffs, which have contributed to a more than 20% decline in oil prices this year.

          <p>Rory Truex, a Princeton professor and expert on Chinese politics, discusses President Trump's evolving China policy. Initially, there were questions about a potential alignment between Trump, Putin, and Xi Jinping. However, Trump's approach has become increasingly aggressive, marked by tariff wars and assertive rhetoric. Truex suggests that these tactics might be part of Trump's bargaining strategy, but it's unclear if he seeks a broader reset of the relationship with China.</p>

          <p>Marvel Studios' Thunderbolts* debuted at the top of the US box office with $76 million in domestic ticket sales, a solid opening but below Marvel's typical blockbuster launches. The film, featuring a team of antihero rejects, received positive reviews and an 'A-' CinemaScore from audiences. Despite the strong start, it remains to be seen if Thunderbolts* can restore Marvel's box office dominance, especially with upcoming competition from films like Deadpool & Wolverine. The film also teases the next MCU chapter, The Fantastic Four: First Steps, due out 25 July.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department's civil rights division is investigating the Hennepin County prosecutor's office in Minnesota over a policy directing staff to be mindful of "racial disparities" in plea negotiations. The investigation aims to determine whether the policy illegally considers race as a factor in prosecutorial decision-making. The inquiry stems from a policy memo instructing prosecutors to consider racial identity and age in plea negotiations and sentencing. The investigation comes amid turmoil within the civil rights division, with numerous resignations and demands for new types of investigations.</p>

          <p>President Trump discussed the possibility of acquiring Greenland and making Canada the 51st state. He stated he would talk to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney about making Canada the 51st state, but said he didn't expect it to get to the point of using military force. However, he did not rule out military action regarding Greenland, stating that "we need that for national and international security." The comments follow previous threats against Canada and indicate continued interest in acquiring Greenland.</p>
