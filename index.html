          <p>President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have presented a new proposal aimed at ending the war in Gaza. During a White House press conference, Netanyahu endorsed the plan, stating it represents a critical step toward resolving the conflict and securing the release of all hostages within 72 hours. Trump affirmed his administration's full support for Israel, warning that if Hamas rejects the deal, Israel would have the United States' complete backing to take necessary actions to eliminate the threat. Both leaders concluded their remarks without taking questions from the press, emphasizing the need to finalize the agreement first.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has launched "Instant Checkout," a new feature enabling ChatGPT users in the U.S. to purchase items directly through the chatbot, starting with Etsy sellers. The announcement caused Etsy's stock to jump over 15% and Shopify's to rise more than 6%, as Shopify merchants are expected to be integrated soon. This move creates a new revenue stream for OpenAI, which will take a transaction fee, and aims to streamline the user experience by allowing purchases without leaving the platform. The underlying technology, developed with Stripe, will be open-sourced to encourage broader adoption and diverse applications beyond e-commerce. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The musician Cat Stevens, also known as Yusuf, has postponed his upcoming North American book tour due to significant visa processing delays. In a statement, he expressed his frustration and disappointment, particularly for fans who had already purchased tickets and made travel arrangements. While the tour, which was scheduled to begin in October, is on hold, Stevens noted that the release of his book in the U.S. will proceed as planned. He remains hopeful that the tour can be rescheduled for a future date, once the unspecified visa issues are resolved with the authorities.</p>

          <p>The state of Oregon has filed a lawsuit to prevent the Trump administration from deploying 200 National Guard troops to Portland, arguing the move is unlawful and will escalate tensions. President Trump has justified the deployment by describing the city as "war ravaged," a characterization that state and local officials strongly dispute. Governor Tina Kotek stated that the president has been given false information about the situation on the ground, insisting there is no insurrection or threat to national security. The troops have been authorized to protect federal facilities and use force if necessary, continuing a pattern of federal intervention in Democratic-run cities.</p>

          <p>A tragic discovery in Los Angeles involves the body of a missing teenager, Celeste Rivas Hernandez, found in a Tesla owned by the musician D4vd. Police now believe she had been deceased for several weeks before being found on September 8, a day after her 15th birthday. The vehicle had been parked in a Hollywood Hills neighborhood for an extended period, leading to it being ticketed and eventually towed.

          <p>The Taliban has enforced a total internet and telecommunications blackout across Afghanistan, severing fiber optic cables to enforce its strict morality measures. The shutdown, confirmed by internet watchdog NetBlocks, has disrupted mobile phone service, banking, and international communications, with news agency AFP losing contact with its Kabul office. This action follows weeks of internet degradation in various provinces and represents the latest in a series of severe restrictions imposed by the Taliban since they regained power in 2021. The move is expected to have a significant negative impact on the country's economy and already limited access to information.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to stress physiologist Dr. Rebecca Heiss, a highly effective but often overlooked method for managing stress is to channel its energy outward by helping others. Her research indicates that traditional self-care methods can sometimes increase stress, while activities like volunteering have shown proven benefits for well-being. This approach, which she calls "stress springboarding," leverages the hormone oxytocin, which is released during stress and motivates social connection. By focusing on contributing to one's community or supporting colleagues and friends, individuals can activate reward centers in the brain and rewire their stress response, turning a negative feeling into positive, meaningful action.</p>

The company is expected to use proceeds from other asset sales to pursue further acquisitions in its faster-growing healthcare and water sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old man charged with the aggravated murder of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, made a remote court appearance where his counsel requested a preliminary hearing. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty, alleging Robinson fatally shot Kirk at a Utah Valley University campus event on September 10. Evidence cited includes text messages where Robinson allegedly confessed to the killing and a note stating he was taking the opportunity to kill Kirk because he'd "had enough of his hatred." The assassination has become a galvanizing event for Republicans, with President Trump declaring Kirk a "martyr" for his cause.</p>

A significant outbreak in West Texas was responsible for over 760 of these cases and led to the deaths of two unvaccinated children. Health experts attribute the resurgence of the highly contagious disease to declining vaccination rates, with kindergarten vaccination coverage falling below the 95% threshold needed for community immunity. The CDC reports that about 1 in 5 unvaccinated individuals who contract measles require hospitalization, and the disease can lead to severe complications or death.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has unveiled a plan to bolster the declining U.S. coal industry by providing $625 million for coal-fired power plants and opening 13.1 million acres of public land to mining. This initiative, a collaboration between several federal departments, aims to revive a sector that has seen its electricity production share fall dramatically. The funding is designated for modernizing plants, supporting rural energy projects, and upgrading wastewater systems to extend plant lifespans. The move comes as renewable energy sources have surpassed coal in U.S. electricity generation and has been criticized by environmental groups. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While annuities are often associated with retirees, it is both possible and potentially advantageous for a 55-year-old to purchase one as part of their retirement planning. At this age, individuals can typically opt for a deferred annuity, which allows the investment to grow tax-deferred for years before income payments begin. This can lead to more favorable terms from insurers and provides a way to secure a guaranteed income stream, which can be valuable in the absence of traditional pensions. However, the decision requires careful consideration of the illiquid nature of annuities and one's overall financial flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With mortgage rates in October sitting at a three-year low, prospective homebuyers face a compelling but complex market. The primary advantage is the increased affordability compared to the higher rates seen earlier in the year, presenting a window of opportunity for buyers. However, this is countered by the inherent volatility of the market, which could cause rates to rise again, and the logistical challenges of homebuying in the fall season. While another Federal Reserve rate cut is anticipated at the end of October, which could further lower rates, buyers must weigh this against the risk of waiting too long. (not investment advice)</p>

While the goal is to counteract generous foreign tax credits, critics, including California congressional members, argue that a tariff could have damaging consequences and that a federal incentive would be a more effective solution.</p>
