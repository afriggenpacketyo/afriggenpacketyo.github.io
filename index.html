          <p>President Trump's recent meeting with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has offered a glimmer of hope amidst the ongoing conflict with Russia. Trump questioned Putin's intentions regarding peace talks and hinted at potential sanctions, signaling a possible shift in approach. This development comes at a crucial time for Ukraine, which has been resisting pressure to accept a peace plan perceived as favorable to Moscow. The meeting has sparked cautious optimism that Trump may reconsider forcing Ukraine into a disadvantageous settlement. Optimism Score: 40</p>

          <p>While the AI data center boom is not going bust, some projects are experiencing a 'pause' as companies strategically reallocate resources amid evolving market dynamics. Amazon and Nvidia reaffirmed the data center market's strength, but factors like the emergence of new AI players, trade war concerns, and Microsoft's significant leased capex have prompted a reassessment. This pause reflects a reshuffling of priorities in an environment where power, fiber, water, and land are scarce and strategic.
