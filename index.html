          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk publicly told analyst Dan Ives to "Shut up" on the social media platform X after Ives suggested several changes for Tesla's board. Ives, a notable Tesla bull, had called for a new pay package for Musk, more oversight on his time, and guardrails on his political activities. The exchange highlights ongoing investor concerns about Musk's focus and political statements, which have coincided with a significant drop in Tesla's stock price this year. The incident underscores the tense relationship between Musk and Wall Street, even with his staunchest supporters.</p>

          <p>A top White House economic advisor, Stephen Miran, downplayed the likelihood of President Trump's tariffs causing significant price inflation, equating the odds to rare events like a meteor strike. Speaking on CNBC, Miran acknowledged that prediction is difficult but stated there is no evidence of widespread inflation from the tariffs so far. The comments came as the administration promoted a report showing a fall in imported goods prices, though many economists still anticipate price hikes due to implementation delays and other factors.

          <p>Real estate investors are purchasing a larger portion of U.S. homes, accounting for nearly 27% of sales in the first quarter, the highest share in at least five years. This trend is driven by high home prices and mortgage rates that are sidelining traditional homebuyers, creating opportunities for cash-rich investors. The housing market has experienced a sales slump since early 2022, leading to higher inventory and longer selling times. The report clarifies that small "mom-and-pop" investors, not large institutions, own the vast majority of these properties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans to impose a 50% tariff on copper imports, a move that caused copper prices to surge to a record high. During a Cabinet meeting, Trump also threatened future steep tariffs on other sectors, including pharmaceuticals. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated the goal is to bring copper production back to the U.S., aligning the duty with existing tariffs on steel and aluminum. The U.S. imports nearly half of its copper, primarily from Chile, and the new tariff is expected to benefit domestic producers. (not investment advice)</p>

The game was marked by Germany scoring four goals in a stunning six-minute span, leading to Miroslav Klose becoming the all-time World Cup top scorer. The humiliating defeat for Brazil, which was missing key players Neymar and Thiago Silva, was so profound that "Goal for Germany" became a common phrase for a blunder in Brazil.

The scheme involved recruiting North Korean IT workers to pose as American freelancers, using stolen U.S. identities to secure remote jobs at companies worldwide. The wages earned were then funneled back to North Korea to fund its weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs. This action is part of a broader U.S. effort to disrupt North Korea's illicit fundraising activities through cyber espionage and fraud.</p>

The author argues that the operation, part of a month-long series of raids across the city, is designed to intimidate immigrant-friendly municipalities and create a spectacle for political gain. Despite claims of targeting "the worst of the worst," data suggests most of those detained have no criminal convictions. The article contends that the operation is a waste of taxpayer money and a reckless display that is uniting Angelenos in resistance.</p>

The National Weather Service issued a "life-threatening" alert at 1:14 a.m. on July 4, but the local sheriff stated he was not made aware until hours later.

          <p>For Americans struggling with high-interest credit card debt, pursuing debt forgiveness could be a timely strategy. This article presents four reasons why it might be worth exploring this option now. With the Federal Reserve unlikely to cut interest rates this month, relief from high APRs is not imminent, and interest continues to compound daily. Furthermore, any future rate cuts are expected to be minimal, offering little help. Addressing high-rate debt through forgiveness can also improve one's overall financial health by positively impacting their credit score and borrowing ability long-term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The American Federation of Teachers (AFT) is launching a National Academy for AI Instruction, a $23 million initiative funded by tech giants Microsoft, OpenAI, and Anthropic. The academy aims to train educators on how to effectively and ethically use artificial intelligence in the classroom. AFT President Randi Weingarten emphasized that while technology cannot replace teachers, harnessing it correctly can enhance teaching and learning. The program, which will offer free virtual training to all 1.8 million union members, seeks to put educators in control of how AI is integrated into schools.</p>

          <h2>Feral Honeybees Are Outcompeting Native Bee Species in Southern California, Study Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 13:46:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that non-native, feral western honeybees are dominating ecosystems in San Diego County, a global hotspot for bee biodiversity. These honeybees, which now constitute about 90% of all bees in the area, are monopolizing pollen resources from native plants. Researchers found that honeybees can remove over 80% of a flower's pollen in a single day, leaving little for native pollinators like bumblebees. This competition threatens native bee populations and may impact the long-term health of the plant community, as honeybees are not always the most effective pollinators for native flora.</p>

          <p>Intel's stock price saw a significant jump on Tuesday after the company began laying off 500 employees at its main fabrication hub in Oregon. The job cuts are part of a broader cost-saving strategy that will reduce its global workforce by 20%. The move comes as Intel faces increasing competition from rivals like AMD and has seen its market share in chip shipments fall to its lowest level since 2002. The company stated the restructuring aims to make Intel a "leaner, faster, and more efficient company" to better serve customers. (not investment advice)</p>

In the other quarterfinal, American Amanda Anisimova beat Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in a tight two-set match, saving five set points in the second-set tie-break. Sabalenka will now face Anisimova for a place in her first Wimbledon final, continuing her streak of reaching the final four in recent major tournaments.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recently signed "Big Beautiful Bill" does not eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits, a long-standing campaign promise. Instead, the legislation introduces a new $6,000 federal income tax deduction for Americans aged 65 and older. While this deduction could make some Social Security income tax-exempt for certain individuals, it does not apply to all beneficiaries and phases out for those with higher incomes. The White House estimates that 88% of seniors will not pay taxes on their benefits under the new law, which is in effect for the 2025 tax year. (not investment advice)</p>

Stewart and guest Steve Kroft characterized the payment as a "shakedown" or "protection money" intended to ensure Trump's FCC would not block Paramount's pending merger with Skydance Media. Trump had sued over a "60 Minutes" interview with Kamala Harris, claiming it was deceptively edited.

The June Survey of Consumer Expectations found that respondents anticipate inflation to be at 3% in one year, down from a peak of 3.6% in March and April. This easing of expectations comes despite ongoing trade negotiations and the implementation of some tariffs. While the overall inflation outlook has softened, consumers still expect price increases in specific categories like medical care, college education, and rent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a significant policy shift, the IRS has indicated in a federal court filing that churches can endorse political candidates without jeopardizing their tax-exempt status. This move effectively reinterprets the 70-year-old Johnson Amendment, which has long barred such endorsements by non-profits. The filing, part of a settlement with religious groups that sued the agency, states that communications from a house of worship to its congregation on political matters viewed through a religious lens do not constitute prohibited campaign intervention. The change fulfills a long-standing goal of President Donald Trump and religious conservatives.</p>
