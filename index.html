          <p>The United States imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, potentially raising prices for new and used vehicles, repairs, and insurance. These tariffs, ordered by President Trump, aim to promote domestic manufacturing and reduce reliance on foreign imports. While parts from Canada and Mexico are exempt under certain conditions, the tariffs are expected to increase costs for consumers and create uncertainty for automakers. Some companies may be forced out of business due to financial stress, leading to parts shortages.</p>

The next General Election is still some time away, but this week's results show that Farage has changed the race.
