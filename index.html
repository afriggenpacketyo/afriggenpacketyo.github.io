            <p>This Kyodo News digest summarizes key events in Japan, including Prime Minister Ishiba's ritual offering to the Yasukuni shrine, a controversial symbol due to its connection to Japan's militaristic past. Ishiba is unlikely to visit the shrine personally, considering diplomatic relations with China and South Korea. Additionally, the digest covers the resumption of train services in central Tokyo after a major suspension, a Japanese-style inn operator's U.S. expansion plans, the appearance of a giant Evangelion statue in Hamamatsu, and results from gymnastics, football, and baseball events.

Cooper stated that the government will strengthen laws to protect important memorials, emphasizing that freedom of speech does not justify criminal damage.

            <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the deportation of Venezuelans held in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, responding to an ACLU appeal. The court's order prevents removals from the Bluebonnet Detention Center, pending further review. This action follows previous rulings requiring due process for those facing deportation under the AEA. The Trump administration claims the detainees are foreign terrorists, while the ACLU argues they are being denied their right to a court hearing before being deported to dangerous situations.</p>
