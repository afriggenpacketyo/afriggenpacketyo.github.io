          <p>The U.S. Senate narrowly voted 51-49 to advance President Trump's major tax and spending package, following hours of delay as Republican leaders worked to secure support. The legislation, a centerpiece of Trump's second-term agenda, includes significant tax cuts, funding for defense and immigration priorities, and controversial spending cuts to programs like Medicaid and food stamps. Despite some Republican opposition and procedural hurdles, the White House has intensely pressured Congress to pass the bill and send it to the president's desk before the July 4th holiday.

Bernstein, a 19-year-old gay and Jewish college student, was stabbed to death in 2018. The verdict ensures Woodward, who was linked to a neo-Nazi group, will face a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole, bringing a painful chapter to a close for Bernstein's family and community.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced a new partnership with supermarkets and food manufacturers in England to encourage customers to make healthier food choices. Under the voluntary plan, businesses will decide how to promote healthy eating, potentially through special offers, revised loyalty programs, or changes to in-store layouts. The initiative aims to tackle rising obesity rates by making nutritious options more accessible, though some critics question the effectiveness of a plan that does not impose specific, mandatory targets on the industry.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the science behind the "urban heat island" effect, a phenomenon that causes cities to be significantly warmer than adjacent rural areas. The temperature difference, which can be as much as 10Â°C, is primarily caused by dark surfaces like roads and buildings that absorb and retain solar energy. This stored heat is slowly released, especially at night, while a lack of cooling vegetation and water further intensifies the effect, making urban populations more vulnerable to extreme heat.</p>
