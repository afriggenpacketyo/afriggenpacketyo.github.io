          <p>Chinese engineers have successfully created and tested an artillery-launched drone system after 12 years of overcoming technical challenges. The drones, designed to be launched from a 155mm cannon, can withstand forces exceeding 3,000 times their weight. The advance relies on a pyrotechnic ejection mechanism that separates the drone from its artillery shell mid-flight without electronic controls. Led by Huang Yunluan, the team stated that these drones can travel over 10 kilometers in seconds, conserve power, and extend loiter time, marking a significant advancement in military drone technology. The project, initially proposed in 2013, has now moved from concept to practical application.</p>

Brown was released on a substantial bail amount, allowing him to continue his "Breezy Bowl XX" world tour. Brown has a history of legal issues, including a felony conviction for assaulting Rihanna in 2009.</p>

          <p>Eutelsat shares experienced a significant increase after the European satellite operator announced a 1.35 billion euro capital raise, primarily supported by the French state. This capital injection, along with debt refinancing, will bolster Eutelsat's investment in its Low Earth Orbit (LEO) capabilities, focusing on business-to-business and business-to-government operations. Following this move, the French state will become Eutelsat's largest shareholder, holding nearly 30% of the capital and voting rights, positioning Eutelsat strategically within the European Union and NATO for military communications, cyber-resilience, and secure government connectivity. Emmanuel Macron highlighted the move as ensuring France's strategic independence and paving the way for Europe's autonomy.</p>

Population increases were mainly concentrated in western states, while eastern states experienced a decline, and the number of foreign nationals living in Germany rose to 12.4 million.

          <p>Retail sales in the UK experienced a significant drop in May, primarily driven by a 'dismal' performance in supermarkets, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Sales volumes fell by 2.7%, marking the largest monthly decline since December 2023, with food retailers seeing reduced purchases of alcohol and tobacco. The ONS noted that consumers were cutting back on spending due to inflation, which remained at 3.4% in the year to May, with rising food prices being a key concern. While sales volumes in the three months to May were up compared to the previous period, economists suggest that the initial economic growth seen earlier in the year may be slowing.</p>

          <p>Despite the Federal Reserve maintaining steady interest rates, credit card interest rates continue to climb, reaching their highest levels since December. The average annual percentage rate (APR) now exceeds 20%, with new cards averaging around 24.3%, driven by card issuers mitigating risks against potential borrower defaults. While the Fed cut its key borrowing rate benchmark three times in 2024 and has held it steady since December, banks continue to raise credit card interest rates to record levels. Financial experts suggest that even eventual Fed rate cuts may not significantly alleviate the burden of high interest charges for consumers carrying balances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The sale of the Los Angeles Lakers for $10 billion, a record for a sports franchise, highlights the growing trend of sports teams becoming too valuable for individual owners. The shift from family ownership to investment groups, led by Mark Walter, reflects the increasing financial demands of owning major sports properties. While the decline of cable poses a threat, the Lakers' strong connection to Los Angeles ensures continued growth and profitability, making the investment a sound one. The new ownership model raises questions about accountability for teams not as successful as the Lakers, potentially allowing for exploitation without public scrutiny.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study challenges the long-held theory that birds sing at dawn due to better acoustic transmission conditions, such as increased humidity and reduced wind. Researchers analyzed audio recordings of birds in the rainforest and found little support for the 'acoustic transmission hypothesis'. Instead, the study suggests that early morning vocal activity relates to birds marking their territory after being inactive at night and communicating about finding food. The researchers did find relationships between birds who were more territorial and those with an omnivorous diet, with these birds being more vocal at dawn.</p>

Symptoms began appearing on June 12 in the area around Saint-Quentin, with the affected children, aged 1-12, being admitted to hospitals. The cause of the outbreak remains unidentified, as the children are not believed to have been in contact with each other.

          <p>Japan has been proactively building supply chain resilience in response to China's dominance in rare earth minerals. Following China's 2010 export ban on rare earths, Japan diversified its sources, investing in non-China projects like Australia's Lynas, and reducing its dependence on Chinese rare earths to below 60%. While Japan has made progress, it still relies on China for heavy rare earth elements, highlighting the challenges of escaping China's mineral orbit. Western nations are looking to Japan's approach as a template for securing their own critical mineral supplies, especially as demand for these minerals grows with the clean energy transition.

There are concerns about potential pressure on vulnerable individuals, while supporters argue for the dignity of choice for those facing unbearable suffering.
