          <p>First responders successfully rescued 31 construction workers who were trapped following a tunnel collapse in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles. The workers were located approximately six miles from the tunnel's access point and had to climb over a large pile of dirt to escape. None of the individuals sustained any visible injuries during the incident. The collapse occurred at the site of the Clearwater Project, a multi-million dollar initiative to repair aging wastewater tunnels, which has now been placed on an indefinite hold pending a Cal/OSHA investigation into the cause.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has temporarily blocked a Trump administration executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants and foreign visitors. The ruling allows a class-action lawsuit, filed by the ACLU on behalf of immigrant parents and their infants, to proceed. This decision follows a recent Supreme Court ruling that limited the use of universal injunctions but still permitted them through specific legal channels, such as class-action suits. The White House criticized the judge's decision, vowing to fight what it termed an unlawful attempt to impede presidential policy.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 21:43:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced its intention to impose a 35% tariff on all imports from Canada, set to begin on August 1st. In a letter to Canada's prime minister, President Trump cited Ottawa's retaliatory tariffs and an alleged failure to stop the flow of fentanyl as primary reasons for the new duties. The letter suggests the tariff rate could be adjusted if Canada cooperates on the fentanyl issue but threatens further increases if Canada retaliates. This move escalates trade tensions with one of the largest U.S. trading partners, creating uncertainty for a trade relationship valued at over $760 billion in 2024.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a key negotiator during pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University, has filed a $20 million administrative complaint against the Trump administration. Khalil, who was detained by ICE for over three months, alleges false arrest, malicious prosecution, and emotional distress, claiming he was targeted for his constitutionally protected speech. His legal team stated he would accept an official apology and policy change in lieu of payment. The Department of Homeland Security defended its actions, asserting it acted within its legal authority and accusing Khalil of terrorizing Jewish students on campus.</p>

          <p>An immigration raid at a Southern California agricultural farm, identified by officials as a marijuana facility, resulted in clashes between federal agents and protesters. Onlookers reported agents using crowd control measures like irritants and pinning at least one person to the ground. The incident is part of a broader increase in immigration enforcement operations in the state, which have been described by Governor Gavin Newsom's office as inhumane tactics that create fear. These large-scale raids follow President Trump's directive for ICE to oversee a mass deportation program.</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports, justifying it partly by citing Brazil's treatment of its former president, Jair Bolsonaro. To impose this tariff, the administration is using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the same authority currently being challenged in federal court over other tariffs. Critics argue this is an abuse of power, using a national security law for political purposes, especially since the U.S. maintains a trade surplus with Brazil, contradicting the administration's claims of a deficit. This move could further erode the administration's credibility on its aggressive trade agenda.</p>

While tough talk on tariffs and border policies also had a negative effect, travelers from Vietnam and the Philippines showed more interest, possibly due to large diaspora communities.

          <p>Tesla has officially applied to test and deploy its Robotaxi service in the Phoenix metropolitan area, following in the tracks of competitor Waymo, which has operated there since 2020. The Arizona Department of Transportation is expected to make a decision on the application by the end of July. This expansion effort comes after Tesla launched a pilot program in Austin, Texas, using remotely supervised Model Y vehicles with a human safety supervisor on board. The Austin pilot has encountered some issues, including minor accidents and traffic violations that have attracted regulatory attention.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Chargers running back Najee Harris sustained what his agent described as a 'superficial eye injury' during a Fourth of July fireworks accident. The incident prompted speculation about the severity of the injury, but his agent confirmed that the prized free-agent signing is expected to be fully recovered and ready for the upcoming NFL season. Harris, who has four consecutive 1,000-yard rushing seasons, was signed by the Chargers to bolster their running game. He is expected to be a key part of the team's offense this year.</p>

          <p>A BBC analysis highlights that the UK is experiencing increasingly frequent and intense heatwaves, a trend directly linked to human-induced climate change. With 2025 already seeing a record-warm spring and the third heatwave of the year, the article explains that global temperature rises disproportionately increase the severity of extreme heat events. Climate scientists warn that what was once a rare meteorological event, like the 1976 heatwave, is becoming a regular feature of British summers. Projections indicate this trend will continue, with hot spells becoming more common, especially in the southeast of the UK.</p>

          <p>Despite South Korea having the world's lowest birth rate, its fertility clinics are experiencing a significant boom in demand. The number of fertility treatments rose by nearly 50% between 2018 and 2022, with one in six babies in Seoul now born with medical assistance. Experts attribute this trend to a shift in attitudes, as more people delay parenthood for social and financial reasons and later turn to treatments like IVF to conceive. While the country's demographic crisis remains severe, the rise in treatments contributed to a slight increase in the birth rate in 2024, the first in nine years.</p>

          <p>A senior Israeli official has stated that Israel believes Iran could potentially retrieve deeply buried stocks of enriched uranium from the Isfahan nuclear facility, one of three sites targeted by U.S. military strikes last month. While the U.S. administration has asserted the sites were 'obliterated,' this assessment suggests a key component of Iran's nuclear program might be recoverable, albeit through a very difficult effort. This view adds complexity to the damage assessment, as international inspectors have not yet been granted access to survey the full extent of the destruction at the facilities.</p>

A deputy director for the agency stated they are accountable for the failure and are focused on ensuring it never happens again.

          <p>A new study from UCLA climate scientists reveals that the duration of heat waves is increasing at a rate faster than the overall pace of global warming. Researchers found that the longest and most extreme heat waves are showing the greatest increases in frequency, meaning each fraction of a degree of warming has a progressively larger impact. This accelerated effect poses significant risks to public health, agriculture, and infrastructure, underscoring an urgent need for adaptation strategies. The study predicts the harshest changes will occur in tropical regions near the equator, which are less accustomed to wide temperature variations.</p>

          <p>A new report from the United Nations Aids Agency (UNAIDS) warns that decades of progress in the global fight against HIV/AIDS are at serious risk due to sharp funding cuts, particularly from the United States. The Trump administration's decision to halt most funding for the PEPFAR program has left UNAIDS with a nearly 50% budget shortfall. The agency estimates that without this funding, an additional six million people could be newly infected and four million could die from AIDS-related illnesses over the next four years. The cuts are already impacting research and treatment programs in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
