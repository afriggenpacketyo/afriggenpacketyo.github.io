          <p>The House Oversight Committee has received documents from the Jeffrey Epstein estate, including a "birthday book" containing a note allegedly written by President Trump. Democrats on the committee released an image of the note, which Trump and the White House have vehemently denied as fake, leading to a defamation lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal for its initial reporting. The documents, obtained via subpoena, also include financial records and flight logs, though their public release timeline remains uncertain. This development continues the scrutiny of Epstein's network and his connections to powerful figures.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has initiated a new immigration enforcement operation in Chicago, named "Operation Midway Blitz," targeting individuals described as "criminal illegal aliens." The department stated the operation is a response to Illinois' sanctuary policies, while President Trump used aggressive rhetoric on social media in relation to the action. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson criticized the move, citing a lack of coordination and raising concerns about potential human rights abuses and unconstitutional enforcement. The operation represents an escalation in the conflict between federal immigration authorities and sanctuary cities.</p>

          <p>With interest rates remaining relatively high, savers with significant funds like $40,000 face a choice between Certificates of Deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts. While both currently offer similar returns, a key difference is that CD rates are fixed for the term, protecting against future rate drops, whereas savings account rates are variable. However, CDs require locking money away for a set period, with penalties for early withdrawal, making high-yield savings a better option for those needing liquidity. The article advises savers to consider their long-term financial stability and access needs before committing funds. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A coalition of nearly 100 pro-life organizations, led by Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, is urging Congress to ensure any extension of Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies includes provisions to prevent the funds from covering elective abortions. The groups argue that current ACA regulations circumvent the Hyde Amendment, which bars federal funding for most abortions, by commingling taxpayer-funded subsidies with private insurance payments. They contend that this effectively forces taxpayers to subsidize abortion coverage, a practice opposed by a majority of Americans. Pro-choice advocates counter that this is an attempt to further restrict abortion access.</p>

          <p>Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo confirmed that the state's decision to begin dismantling long-standing school vaccine requirements was made without any data analysis on its potential public health impact. In a recent interview, Ladapo stated that modeling for potential outbreaks of diseases like measles or polio was unnecessary because the issue is fundamentally about "parents' rights" and "bodily autonomy." The policy change, which starts by dropping requirements for hepatitis B and chickenpox vaccines, has been criticized by public health experts who warn that school mandates have been a crucial tool for preventing disease outbreaks for over a century.</p>

          <p>A freight train crashed into a double-decker bus in Atlacomulco, Mexico, resulting in the deaths of at least eight people and injuring 45 others. The collision occurred early Monday in an industrial area, ripping the bus apart as it was slowly crossing the tracks in heavy traffic. Video footage from the scene suggests there were no visible crossing gates or warning signals to stop traffic for the approaching train. This incident highlights a growing trend of accidents at grade-level crossings in Mexico, which have been increasing in recent years according to official reports.</p>

The Unite union leader, Sharon Graham, also warned that Labour risks losing financial support and voter confidence if it fails to deliver tangible improvements for workers.

          <p>With mortgage rates falling to an 11-month low, many homeowners who bought during recent peaks are considering refinancing. The article advises evaluating several key questions before proceeding, such as whether current rates are low enough to justify the action, typically a one-percentage-point drop. Homeowners should also weigh the risk of waiting for even lower rates against the potential for rates to rise unexpectedly. It is also crucial to calculate the closing costs, which can range from 2% to 6% of the loan amount, and ensure the homeowner plans to stay in the home long enough to recoup those costs.

          <p>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans has raised its settlement offer to clergy sexual assault survivors from $180 million to a new minimum of $230 million. The move comes as the archdiocese, which filed for bankruptcy protection in 2020, seeks to gain the necessary two-thirds approval from the 660 claimants for its reorganization plan. The previous offer faced opposition from a significant number of survivors who deemed it inadequate. The new deal could be further increased by a potential contribution from the archdiocese's primary insurer, which is reportedly in active negotiations to join the settlement.</p>

In other business news, analysts estimate that BlackRock's recent deal to take on $80 billion in client assets from Citigroup could add a notable 25 cents to its adjusted earnings per share. Separately, a partnership between Meta Platforms and Anduril Industries was officially awarded a U.S. Army contract. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A survey from the New York Federal Reserve shows that U.S. workers' confidence in their ability to find a new job has plummeted to an all-time low. The August Survey of Consumer Expectations indicated just a 44.9% probability of securing new employment after a job loss, the lowest reading since the survey began in 2013. This data reflects a significant reversal from the "Great Resignation" era, as a cooling labor market with slower hiring has led more workers to stay in their current positions. The sentiment aligns with a recent dismal jobs report, which showed minimal payroll growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study published in Nature Climate Change reveals a correlation between rising temperatures and increased consumption of products with added sugar in the United States. Researchers analyzed household food purchase data and found that as temperatures rise, people buy more sugary items, particularly sweetened beverages like soda and frozen desserts. The trend was more pronounced among lower-income and less-educated groups. The authors suggest this behavior is driven by a physiological desire for chilled products in warmer weather, but warn that it could have negative public health consequences.</p>

A state investigation later confirmed the significant delay, noting that hospital staff understood such an order should be completed within an hour.

          <p>For individuals struggling with significant credit card debt amid high interest rates, generic advice is often insufficient. This article outlines three ways to get personalized help, starting with consulting a non-profit credit counseling agency. These professionals can create a comprehensive debt management plan, potentially negotiating lower interest rates with creditors on your behalf. Another option is working with a for-profit debt relief company, which can negotiate to reduce the total amount owed. Finally, the article suggests proactively contacting credit card issuers directly to inquire about hardship programs or temporary payment plans.</p>

Transport for London (TfL) has called the demand for a shorter week "simply unaffordable," stating it would cost hundreds of millions of pounds.

          <p>A federal appeals court has rejected President Donald Trump's attempt to overturn the $83.3 million verdict against him for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll. The court ruled that the jury's damages award was fair and that Trump's claims of expanded presidential immunity, based on a recent Supreme Court decision, did not apply to this case. The judges affirmed that the jury in a related case had already established that Carroll was telling the truth about the underlying sexual assault, which could not be relitigated. This decision marks another significant legal defeat for Trump in the long-running defamation lawsuits brought by Carroll.</p>
