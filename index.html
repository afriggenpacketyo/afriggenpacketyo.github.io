          <p>A woman on trial in New Zealand has admitted to causing the deaths of her two young children, whose remains were tragically found in suitcases four years after their presumed demise. Prosecutors allege she used an antidepressant, nortriptyline, while her defense contends she is not guilty by reason of insanity, having experienced a severe depressive spiral following her husband's death in 2017. The advanced state of decomposition of the bodies has complicated the precise determination of the cause of death, a point raised by the pathologist. This high-profile trial is anticipated to last for four weeks.</p>

          <p>Tennis legend Boris Becker has launched his new book, "Inside," detailing his time in a British prison and attributing his legal and financial troubles partly to his early Wimbledon success at 17. Becker presents himself as a victim of a harsh justice system and early fame, rather than an intentional perpetrator. The memoir offers insights into prison life, his rivalry with Andre Agassi, and his relationship with his current partner, while also touching on his path to becoming debt-free post-insolvency proceedings.</p>

          <p>Germany's upcoming local elections in North Rhine-Westphalia are seen as a critical litmus test for Chancellor Friedrich Merz's federal government, with polls indicating potential significant losses for the Social Democrats and gains for the far-right AfD. The elections, held in Germany's most populous state, reflect public dissatisfaction with local infrastructure and federal issues like immigration. Merz has attempted to downplay the national significance, but a poor SPD performance could further strain the governing coalition in Berlin amid challenging budget negotiations.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe revealed that his relationship with striker Alexander Isak changed significantly after Isak went on "strike" to force a £125m move to Liverpool. Howe stated that communication became difficult during the transfer, which saw Isak train separately and miss early season games. While acknowledging their previously strong, mutually beneficial relationship, Howe expressed hope that Newcastle can retain its key players by fostering a desirable environment, noting that Isak's desire to leave stemmed from the new club's interest.</p>

          <p>Following a recent incursion of Russian drones into Polish airspace, German politicians are calling for urgent expansion of the Bundeswehr's air defense capabilities and increased domestic drone production. Social Democrats spokesperson Siemtje Möller and Hesse State Premier Boris Rhein emphasized the need for more Patriot, Iris-T, and short-range Skyranger systems, citing a top Bundeswehr officer's assessment of anti-drone defense as Germany's biggest weakness.

          <p>The Supreme Court's upcoming term, starting in October, is expected to address numerous challenges to President Trump's second-term policies. Key cases include the legality of global tariffs imposed under emergency powers, the termination of Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelan migrants, and the application of the Alien Enemies Act for deportations. The court will also examine the president's power to dismiss officials from independent agencies and the constitutionality of his executive order on birthright citizenship. These rulings carry significant implications for executive authority and the nation's commitment to the rule of law.</p>

          <p>A recent Supreme Court ruling has granted Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers broad latitude to detain and question individuals based on factors like ethnic appearance, sparking significant civil rights concerns. Justice Kavanaugh's opinion suggested such checks are quick, but former ICE officials and advocates argue there's no swift way to verify legal status, leading to U.S. citizens being unlawfully detained.

          <p>A major UN report reveals North Korea is increasingly using the death penalty, including for individuals caught watching or sharing foreign films and TV dramas, as part of a broader crackdown on citizens' freedoms. The report, based on interviews with escapees, highlights that surveillance has become more pervasive, and forced labor is more common. Since Kim Jong Un prioritized weapons development in 2019, human rights have degraded, and food scarcity has worsened. Public executions are used to instill fear, reflecting the regime's near-total control over its population.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration's FDA Seeks to End External Expert Reviews for New Drugs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FDA, under the Trump administration, is moving to abandon its long-standing policy of consulting outside experts for reviews of new drug applications, a move critics say will reduce transparency and scrutiny. George Tidmarsh, head of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, stated these advisory meetings are often redundant and time-consuming, preferring to focus on broader regulatory questions. Former FDA officials and academics, however, argue these committees are vital for decision-making, public understanding, and independent oversight, expressing concern that the change could consolidate power within the agency and diminish accountability.</p>

          <p>U.S. healthcare costs are projected to surge, with employers facing nearly 9% higher costs per employee and planning to pass these increases onto workers through higher paycheck deductions, deductibles, and copays. This "perfect storm" for employers is driven by factors like new expensive treatments, increased demand for care post-pandemic, and industry consolidation reducing competition. The trend highlights how employers largely determine healthcare costs for most Americans, and with consumers already uneasy about the economy, these rising expenses could further strain household finances.

          <p>Colorado and other Democratic-led states are independently revamping vaccine policies, creating new systems to assess science and maintain immunization access, amidst concerns that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. is undermining trust in public health. Colorado, for instance, now allows pharmacists to provide COVID shots without prescriptions and can consult non-federal scientific sources for school vaccine requirements. This shift represents a significant decentralization of public health authority, with states acting to protect residents from potential federal policy changes and the spread of misinformation regarding vaccines.</p>

          <p>German authorities are funding the cleanup of hundreds of tons of illegally dumped toxic waste, including fiberglass and shredded electronics, in the small Czech municipality of Jirikov. The waste, mislabeled as plastic for recycling, was offloaded by an insolvent German company, leading to the arrest of its CEO and a truck driver. Environmental analysis revealed high concentrations of toxins in the soil, with potential for groundwater contamination. This incident highlights a broader European problem of illegal cross-border waste trafficking, prompting calls for stronger international cooperation, digital tracking, and stricter penalties to prevent future environmental crimes.</p>

Baroness Lawrence views this as the "last opportunity" for complete justice, hoping people previously unable to speak will now feel empowered.
