          <p>Andrew Witty has resigned as CEO of UnitedHealth for personal reasons, prompting the company to suspend its 2025 financial outlook due to unexpectedly high medical costs for new Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. Stephen Hemsley, who previously served as CEO from 2006 to 2017, has been appointed as the new CEO. The company's shares have declined since the death of former CEO Brian Thompson in December 2024, and Hemsley apologized for the performance setbacks during a conference call. Witty had acknowledged the flaws in the healthcare system in a New York Times op-ed following Thompson's death.</p>

Short-term CDs, particularly those around six months to one year, often have higher interest rates due to the inverted yield curve.

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in April rose 2.3% on an annual basis, slightly less than economists had expected, but still reflecting price hikes above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Housing costs were a major driver of inflation, and energy costs also ticked higher despite lower gasoline prices. Economists are looking for early signs of the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs on American households. Earlier this month, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank is taking a wait-and-see approach on Mr. Trump's tariffs.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are advancing key components of their bill to fund President Donald Trumpâ€™s agenda, including taxes and Medicaid cuts, despite internal divisions. The bill includes Medicaid work requirements, more frequent eligibility checks, and prohibitions on funding for gender transition for minors and non-citizens. The legislation has received pushback from Republicans in the Senate and faces resistance from different wings of the House caucus. The bill also proposes extending Trumpâ€™s 2017 Tax Cuts and Job Act and increasing the debt limit by $4 trillion.</p>

          <p>Consumer prices rose 2.3% in April compared to a year ago, cooling slightly from the previous month and defying fears of an inflation surge in the aftermath of President Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs.

However, many analysts anticipate a rekindling of inflation over the coming months as retailers replenish inventory with goods imported after the tariffs took effect.

          <p>The pace of inflation slowed in April, the month that Donald Trump announced his sweeping tariffs, with the annual inflation rate at 2.3%, down from 2.4% in March. While the inflation report covers April, businesses are still assessing the impact of the tariffs. Consumer sentiment dropped sharply in April, and expectations of inflation rose to 6.5%, the highest since 1981. Federal Reserve officials expect tariffs to have an impact on prices, potentially delaying inflation from reaching the Fedâ€™s target rate of 2%.</p>

          <p>President Trump's administration cut its China tariffs from 145 percent to 30 percent, with China reciprocating by lowering its retaliatory levies. This move signals a retreat from Trump's earlier promises that China needed the U.S. more than the U.S. needed China. The reduction in tariffs occurred without any significant concessions from China, reflecting the mutual benefits of trade and the pressure from rising prices and market instability. Despite the temporary pause, tariffs remain much higher than before Trump's second term, potentially leading to higher prices for consumers.</p>
