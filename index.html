          <p>During a game between the Chicago Sky and the Los Angeles Sparks, Angel Reese and Rickea Jackson were involved in a physical altercation in the first quarter. The incident began when Jackson and Sky player Rebecca Allen got tangled up while vying for a loose ball, leading to a double technical foul. Reese intervened, pushing Jackson away from her teammate, which resulted in Jackson pushing back, prompting Kelsey Plum to step in and diffuse the situation. Despite the altercation, Reese and Jackson were seen hugging after the game, which Chicago won 97-86, with Reese recording a double-double. The Sky improved to 4-10 on the season, while the Sparks fell to 4-11.</p>

          <p>A severe heat wave is impacting a large portion of the United States, particularly the eastern regions, with temperatures soaring 10-20 degrees above average. The heat index, or "feels like" temperature, is expected to reach as high as 110 degrees Fahrenheit in some areas. Over 125 million Americans are under heat alerts, marking one of the most extensive heat alert events in history. The National Weather Service attributes the heat wave to a heat dome, which traps heat and humidity, and experts warn that the early heat waves of the season are especially dangerous as bodies have not yet acclimatized. A cold front is expected to bring rain and cooler temperatures to the Midwest, Eastern Seaboard, and Southeast, offering some relief by the end of the week.</p>

Wood departed from Mexico in March and sailed approximately 13,000 kilometers on a custom-built aluminum catamaran, arriving in Hiroshima, Japan, after 90 days. Wood hopes his achievement will inspire others, especially those living with limb loss, to challenge their perceived limitations. Wood, who sustained his injuries in 2009 at the age of 18, plans to visit the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum to pay his respects to the victims of the atomic bombing, reflecting on his own experiences as a result of war.</p>

          <p>Tesla's car sales in Europe have experienced a fifth consecutive month of decline in May, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. Sales fell by 27.9% year-on-year to 13,863 units, resulting in a drop in market share from 1.8% to 1.2%. This decline is attributed to increasing competition from cheaper Chinese electric vehicles, which have seen a significant rise in market share. Despite EU tariffs on Chinese EVs, Chinese manufacturers sold 65,808 units in May, doubling their market share to 5.9%.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's claims of "obliterating" Iran's nuclear facilities, intelligence reports suggest the strikes only set back the program by months, prompting European allies to push for renewed nuclear diplomacy. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has reportedly acknowledged the need for a diplomatic solution, but the Trump administration has sent mixed signals regarding the urgency of negotiations. Publicly, Trump has stated that Iran will not have a nuclear weapon, while officials have avoided using the term "maximum pressure" to describe the U.S. approach. Experts suggest that the U.S. may need to demand a complete dismantling of Iran's enrichment facilities to prevent the country from restoring its nuclear program.</p>

          <p>Amazon is leveraging artificial intelligence to transform its online grocery business, aiming to increase profitability in a traditionally low-margin sector. The company sees consumer packaged goods, including groceries, as its largest growth opportunity, with online sales representing only 15% of the total market. Amazon plans to use AI to improve logistics, demand forecasting, inventory placement, and robotics efficiency, which will speed up delivery times and cut costs. The expansion of same-day and next-day delivery to smaller cities and rural communities is expected to further drive growth in the everyday essentials category. (not investment advice)</p>

Over 130 MPs, including 120 from Labour, have signed an amendment to reject plans to cut disability and sickness-related benefits payments. The reforms aim to save Â£5 billion a year by 2030, but critics cite concerns about the number of people potentially pushed into poverty, a lack of consultation, and inadequate impact assessments. While Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer intends to "press ahead" with the changes, the revolt highlights internal divisions within the party.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is implementing a mass-deportation campaign, using harsh enforcement tactics and lurid imagery to generate fear among immigrants. A key component of this strategy is the CBP Home app, designed to encourage self-deportation by offering incentives like exit bonuses and subsidized airfare. The app is being marketed to immigrants who have been living and working legally in the U.S. but have had their provisional residency revoked. The administration's goal is to reach 1 million deportations a year, and it sees self-deportation as a more humane alternative to ICE arrests.</p>

          <p>A US judge has ruled that using books to train artificial intelligence (AI) software is not a violation of US copyright law. The decision came out of a lawsuit brought last year against AI firm Anthropic by three authors, including best-selling mystery thriller writer Andrea Bartz, who accused it of stealing her work to train its Claude AI model and build a multi-billion dollar business. But he rejected Anthropic's request to dismiss the case, ruling the firm would have to stand trial over its use of pirated copies to build its library of material. The ruling is among the first to weigh in on a question that is the subject of numerous legal battles across the industry - how Large Language Models (LLMs) can legitimately learn from existing material.</p>
