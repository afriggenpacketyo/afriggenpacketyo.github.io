          <p>President Trump stated he would not make a deal with China regarding tariffs until the trade deficit is resolved, citing a trillion-dollar deficit. He also discussed the stalled TikTok deal, attributing China's reluctance to tariff issues, suggesting that tariff concessions could expedite the agreement. The president's comments highlight the administration's firm stance on trade imbalances and its willingness to use tariffs as leverage in negotiations. These policies create uncertainty in global markets, influencing investment decisions and international relations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australia's Liberal Party has reversed its policy requiring government workers to return to the office full-time, a move seen as a response to growing public concern over cost of living issues.

This shift highlights the sensitivity of work-from-home policies in the current political climate and the potential impact on electoral outcomes.

          <p>The Trump administration is considering closing the Community Relations Service, a Justice Department office created during the civil rights movement. The office's mission is to prevent and resolve racial and ethnic tensions and civil disorders. Former leaders worry that shuttering the office could lead to a surge in disputes between law enforcement and minority communities. Critics fear the move could harm the federal government's ability to prevent racial strife in U.S. cities.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson and Rep. Anna Paulina Luna reached an agreement on proxy voting for new parents, ending a legislative stalemate. The deal involves formalizing "vote pairing," allowing an absent member to coordinate with a present member on the opposite side of an issue to offset the absence. This agreement aims to increase accessibility for new mothers in Congress and reflects ongoing debates about remote voting procedures.</p>

          <p>Newly qualified doctors in the UK are facing uncertainty as they are only being told their job location with weeks to spare. Many have been given "placeholder jobs", meaning they have only been told the rough part of the country they will be in. This situation is due to a new allocation system and an increase in medical school places. The BMA accuses the government of failing to plan for the increase in resident doctors, leading to potential dissatisfaction and doctors moving abroad.</p>
