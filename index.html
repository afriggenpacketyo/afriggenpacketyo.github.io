          <p>States and cities along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts are facing hurricane season with uncertainty due to significant cuts at federal agencies like FEMA and NOAA. These cuts, part of the Department of Government Efficiency initiative, threaten essential functions such as weather forecasting, emergency response coordination, and financial aid. FEMA has lost a quarter of its full-time staff, and NOAA has lost one-fifth, raising concerns about less accurate forecasts and less effective disaster responses. This article underscores the potential risks of downsizing government services during a period of increasing extreme weather events.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration ended efforts to push for reform in Minneapolis, Louisville, and several other cities, raising questions about the effectiveness of federal involvement in policing. Consent decrees, agreements that place police departments under strict federal oversight, have led to significant improvements in some cities, such as New Orleans. Critics argue that these agreements are too broad and restrictive, while supporters maintain they are necessary to address systemic civil rights violations. This article examines the complexities and debates surrounding federal intervention in local law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Nike will resume selling its products directly on Amazon in the U.S. for the first time since 2019, a move driven by the need to distribute more directly to customers and have greater control over the shopping experience.

The new deal represents a win for Amazon, which has sought to attract more high-end brands to its platform, and a shift in strategy for Nike, which is investing in its marketplace to bring more products and services to consumers.</p>
