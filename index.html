          <p>Israeli strikes across Gaza have reportedly killed at least 24 Palestinians, according to medics and Civil Defence officials. One strike hit a school in Gaza City that was housing displaced families, resulting in numerous fatalities, including children, with many bodies severely burned. The Israeli military claims the targeted area was a Hamas and Islamic Jihad command center used to plan attacks against Israeli civilians and troops, while Hamas is accused of using the Gazan population as human shields. This escalation is part of a broader Israeli offensive in the northern part of Gaza.</p>

          <p>Marcel Ophuls, the German-born filmmaker renowned for his documentary "The Sorrow and the Pity," has passed away at the age of 97. His landmark film debunked the widely held belief of vast French resistance to the Nazi occupation during World War II. Through interviews with ordinary citizens, the film exposed the complexities of collaboration and resistance during the Vichy regime, challenging the myth fostered by Charles de Gaulle. Ophuls' work sparked controversy but also paved the way for revisionist historical accounts of wartime France.</p>

The RBI aims to reduce reliance on government-backed credit lines and currency swap arrangements by enabling commercial banks to provide rupee liquidity on market terms.

This rule allows U.S. importers to calculate customs duties based on the initial sale price in a series of transactions, effectively stripping out the costs associated with intermediary profits. While the first sale rule has been around since 1988, it is gaining renewed attention amid recent tariff regimes.

          <p>Tencent and Baidu, major Chinese technology companies, are adapting to U.S. chip restrictions to maintain their positions in the global artificial intelligence (AI) race. Strategies include stockpiling chips, improving AI model efficiency, and utilizing domestically produced semiconductors. Tencent emphasizes its substantial chip stockpile and its ability to achieve effective AI training with smaller chip clusters. Baidu highlights its "full-stack" capabilities, combining cloud computing infrastructure, AI models, and applications, to mitigate the impact of chip curbs.</p>

          <p>Venezuela's electoral council, loyal to Nicolás Maduro, has claimed a sweeping victory in regional and legislative elections, despite sparsely populated polling places. The results, announced on state television without evidence, strip the opposition of key positions. The electoral council asserted a turnout exceeding 40 percent, though independent observers were absent, and results were not posted online as in previous elections. Some Venezuelans view the low turnout as a sign of loyalty to opposition leader María Corina Machado, who called for abstention from voting.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the change in tone from leaders in the UK and EU regarding Israel's actions in Gaza, marking a break from previous expressions of concern. Rhetoric now labels Israel’s actions as "morally unjustifiable" and "wholly disportionate," yet this condemnation has not translated into tangible action. The author argues that international censure has been ineffective, with Israel continuing to violate laws of morality and logic. While public opinion has shifted, and Palestine has become a mainstream issue, governmental action is still lacking, resulting in a gulf between the world’s reaction and Israel’s actions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Chinese study has discovered that sleep helps the brain clean up harmful oxygen-derived free radicals that accumulate during wakefulness. The research, published in Cell Metabolism, reveals that hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), a by-product of metabolism, acts as a molecular signal to trigger sleep and restore balance in the brain. When H₂O₂ levels rise in sleep-regulating neurons, the brain switches to “repair mode,” prompting restorative slumber. The findings offer insights into age-related insomnia and degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has expressed his disapproval of Russian President Vladimir Putin's recent escalation of attacks in Ukraine, describing it as "absolutely crazy." In a rare rebuke, Trump stated that he was "not happy" with Putin's actions, particularly the targeting of cities and the resulting casualties. He also raised the possibility of imposing additional sanctions on Russia in response to the increased violence. However, Trump also criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for his public statements, indicating a complex and evolving stance on the conflict.</p>

This follows the detention of three shipyard officials earlier in the week.
