          <p>President Donald Trump announced he will hold a press conference to address violent crime in Washington, D.C., following the deployment of increased federal law enforcement in the city. He claimed his actions would soon make the capital one of the safest cities, a statement made in the context of a recent high-profile assault. Local officials have condemned the move, expressing concerns that the federal intervention infringes upon the district's home rule and autonomy, especially as data shows violent crime has been decreasing.</p>

          <p>In a move to ease tensions, North Korea has reportedly started removing its propaganda-blasting loudspeakers from the inter-Korean border, according to the South Korean military. This action follows a similar step taken by South Korea under its new president, who has sought to improve relations with Pyongyang. The propaganda campaigns, which involved broadcasting K-pop and critical messages from the South and unsettling noises from the North, have long been a source of friction in the heavily fortified region.</p>

          <p>The co-owner of the Trump Burger restaurant chain, Roland Mehrez Beainy, is facing deportation after being arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Federal officials allege the Lebanese national overstayed his visitor visa and engaged in sham marriages to obtain legal status. The case is notable as it involves an outspoken supporter of President Trump being targeted by his administration's own crackdown on illegal immigration, with ICE stating that enforcement applies regardless of an individual's political beliefs.</p>

          <p>Police in London arrested at least 200 people at a demonstration in Parliament Square for showing support for Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed under the Terrorism Act. Protesters held signs with the message "I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action," leading to their arrests for supporting a banned organization. The event highlights the ongoing legal and social conflict surrounding the group's activities, which activists defend as legitimate protest while the government cites security risks and criminal damage.</p>

          <p>An anti-immigration protest drew hundreds of participants in Nuneaton, England, part of a wave of similar demonstrations across the country. The event was organized after a local council leader made an unverified claim that two men charged with the sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl were asylum seekers. The protest proceeded peacefully but underscores rising tensions and social unrest surrounding immigration issues in the UK, fueled by high-profile criminal cases and political rhetoric from groups like Reform UK.</p>

Prominent Democrats, including governors and former Attorney General Eric Holder, are now advocating for retaliatory measures to level the political playing field and defend against perceived authoritarian threats.</p>

          <p>According to a recent Charles Schwab survey, Americans believe a net worth of $2.3 million is needed to be considered wealthy in 2025, though this figure varies significantly by region, peaking at $3 million in the West. Despite the high benchmark, many respondents define wealth more broadly, citing happiness and health as equally important. The survey also found that the average net worth needed to feel financially "comfortable" is much lower, at $839,000. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The American shopping mall is experiencing a potential rebirth by replacing failed traditional anchor stores with a diverse mix of non-retail tenants. Mall owners are subdividing large, empty spaces to accommodate businesses like churches, entertainment complexes, hotels, and large bookstores, which drive foot traffic and encourage "cross-shopping." This strategic shift away from a purely retail model is helping to revitalize once-dying malls by transforming them into broader community hubs, leading to a tangible increase in visitor traffic.</p>

Zelenskyy emphasized that any peace decisions made without Ukraine's participation would be illegitimate and ultimately fail to bring lasting peace.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's proposal to roll back protections and expand oil and gas drilling across the 23-million-acre National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska has generated massive public opposition. Over a quarter of a million comments were submitted, with conservation groups, Alaska Native communities, and the public expressing outrage.

          <p>A New Jersey teenager's debilitating symptoms following a football concussion, which persisted for months, led doctors to a surprising diagnosis of a rare brain condition. After an MRI was finally ordered, Logan Coleridge was found to have an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), an abnormal tangle of blood vessels that was likely the true cause of his severe headaches. Following a successful surgery to remove the AVM, he has recovered and is now raising awareness about the importance of thorough diagnostic testing.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after California implemented a landmark heat safety law, farmworkers continue to get sick and die from preventable heat-related illnesses, especially during peak harvest season. A recent state audit and a review of death cases reveal significant lapses in enforcement by the state's occupational safety agency, Cal/OSHA. Advocates argue the system is failing to protect a vulnerable workforce, as many undocumented laborers fear retaliation if they complain about unsafe working conditions.</p>

In the early 1990s, her meticulous investigation into why Soviet assets were disappearing led directly to the identification of Aldrich Ames, the CIA's counterintelligence chief for Soviet operations. Grimes's crucial work brought an end to a devastating espionage case that had resulted in the execution of numerous U.S. informants.</p>
