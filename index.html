          <p>President Trump barred most international students from studying at Harvard University, escalating the administration's conflict with the Ivy League school. The proclamation suspends entry of foreign students unless deemed in the national interest, citing concerns about Harvard's trustworthiness and ties to researchers in China. The administration has repeatedly sought to restrict Harvard's ability to enroll international students, threatening the school's diversity and financial stability. This move follows previous attempts to revoke Harvard's certification in the student visa database and increased vetting of travelers to the university, sparking debates over academic freedom and national security. The situation highlights the administration's broader crackdown on international students and institutions. The optimism score is not explicitly stated in the article.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered an investigation into whether former President Joe Biden's administration used an autopen machine to sign key presidential documents, alleging a conspiracy to conceal Biden's cognitive decline. The order cites executive actions by Biden, including pardons and federal judge appointments, raising doubts about the decision-making process and Biden's awareness. Trump suggests that if Biden's aides secretly used the autopen, it could impact the legality of numerous executive actions. While presidents have used autopens for decades, Trump claims Biden's alleged use could be illegitimate, escalating scrutiny over Biden's mental acuity.

          <p>The Trump administration announced a new travel ban that restricts or prohibits citizens from over a dozen countries from entering the United States. The restrictions range from complete visa suspensions to limitations on certain visa categories, affecting millions seeking relocation, travel, work, or school opportunities.

          <p>Palisades Charter High School's graduation ceremony was relocated to the Hollywood Bowl after the Palisades fire damaged their high school. The event was bittersweet for students, as the Bowl wasn't their beloved Stadium by the Sea, but they were honored to graduate at such a storied venue. The January fire destroyed homes of many students and faculty, forcing them to adjust to online learning and later in-person classes at a former Sears building. Speakers like Steve Kerr and Billy Crystal addressed the graduates, emphasizing resilience and important life lessons.

          <p>UK scientists have discovered that early exposure to certain bacteria in newborns may protect against dangerous infections. The study found that babies colonized with Bifidobacterium longum in the first week of life were less likely to be hospitalized with lung infections. Researchers at University College London and the Sanger Institute analyzed stool samples from over 1,000 newborns and tracked their health for two years. The protective bacteria were more commonly found in babies born via vaginal delivery, highlighting the importance of early microbial exposure. The study suggests potential therapies to boost beneficial bacteria in infants.</p>

The Thunder, led by MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, finished the regular season with a dominant record, while the Pacers, led by Tyrese Haliburton, secured a No. 4 seed in the Eastern Conference.

          <p>President Donald Trump has moved to block nearly all international students from attending Harvard, claiming it jeopardizes national security. He signed an executive order stating Harvard is an unsuitable destination for international students and researchers. The order applies to students attempting to enter the U.S. after the date of the order and lasts for six months, with potential for extension. For current Harvard foreign students, Secretary of State Marco Rubio will determine if visas should be revoked. The article also mentions Trump's new travel ban on 12 countries.
