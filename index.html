          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 13:36:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After years of studying parent-child relationships, a new parenting framework called 'emotionally safe parenting' has emerged, emphasizing attunement to a child's emotional needs. This approach encourages parents to focus on building emotional resilience, trust, and connection through open and honest conversations, setting clear boundaries with empathy rather than control. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions without dismissing them, respond without shaming, view 'bad' behavior as stress signals, and take responsibility after conflicts. By prioritizing emotional safety, parents can create an environment where children feel safe expressing their authentic selves and navigating emotional storms. The article provides practical steps for implementing this parenting style, including inner work for parents and empathetic boundary setting.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stated that the 'silence' from the United States regarding recent Russian attacks is emboldening President Vladimir Putin. This statement follows a massive aerial assault by Russia, which launched a record number of drones and missiles in a single night, resulting in numerous casualties, including children. Zelenskyy argues that Russia's 'brutality cannot be stopped' without increased pressure on the Russian leadership, specifically referring to Washington's reluctance to impose further sanctions on Moscow. The article suggests that Zelenskyy believes the current approach is insufficient to deter Russia's aggression and incentivize meaningful ceasefire negotiations.</p>

          <p>Following his first-round victory at the French Open, tennis player Tommy Paul shared a humorous anecdote about his truck being repossessed due to missed payments. Paul explained that a change in banks led to him forgetting to update his automatic payments for his Ford F-150, resulting in the vehicle being towed away in the middle of the night. After his trainer alerted him, Paul reviewed his security camera footage and discovered the repossession, which he found amusing despite the inconvenience. Fortunately, Paul was able to recover his truck, turning what could have been a frustrating situation into a funny story.</p>

          <p>President Trump's warming relationship with the new Syrian leader has complicated Israel's military strategy in the region, leading to a decrease in Israeli airstrikes.

This change has potentially undermined Israeli efforts to prevent the rise of another anti-Israel neighbor and secure its interests in southwestern Syria.
