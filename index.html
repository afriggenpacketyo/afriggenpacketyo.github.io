        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Insurance costs are rising dramatically in states within Tornado Alley, primarily due to the increasing frequency and severity of hailstorms rather than tornadoes themselves. Hailstorms cause widespread damage to homes, breaking windows, tearing siding, and puncturing roofs, leading to a significant increase in homeowner insurance claims. Insurance companies are responding by raising premiums and scaling back coverage, particularly on roofs. While fortified roofs can offer some protection, they may not be financially worthwhile for the average homeowner, and they provide limited defense against the most powerful tornadoes.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Ukraine and Russia have completed a major prisoner exchange, involving the swap of hundreds of soldiers and civilians. This exchange, the largest since the beginning of the conflict, was agreed upon during talks in Turkey and is seen as a potential step towards building trust between the two nations. Both sides released hundreds of servicemen and civilians, with the exchange taking place on the Ukrainian border with Belarus. The deal, though significant, did not yield any progress towards a ceasefire, as Moscow insists on Ukraine's withdrawal from certain territories as a prerequisite for any truce.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration following the revocation of its ability to enroll international students. The lawsuit argues that the administration's decision violates the First Amendment and due process rights, jeopardizing the education of over 7,000 visa holders. The administration claims Harvard failed to comply with requests for information and fostered an unsafe campus environment, while Harvard insists it responded adequately to the demands. This legal challenge marks an escalation in the ongoing conflict between Harvard and the administration over campus policies and governance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Treasury yields retreated from recent highs after President Trump threatened to impose new tariffs on the European Union and Apple. Trump's social media posts recommending a 50% tariff on the EU and a 25% tariff on iPhones manufactured outside the U.S. triggered a flight to safety, driving down yields. This move reversed some of the upward pressure on yields that had been driven by concerns over Trump's budget bill and the U.S. deficit, highlighting the market's sensitivity to trade policy uncertainty.</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened to impose a 25% tariff on Apple's iPhones if the company does not shift its production to the United States. This threat comes as Apple's supplier, Foxconn, plans to invest $1.5 billion in its Indian operations, potentially shifting some iPhone production away from China. While Apple announced a significant investment in U.S. manufacturing, analysts believe producing iPhones in the U.S. would substantially increase the cost of the devices. Trump's move aims to incentivize domestic manufacturing, but experts remain skeptical about its effectiveness.</p>

Utilizing a HELOC to consolidate high-interest credit card debt or fund home improvements can be beneficial, particularly with potentially falling interest rates. However, using a HELOC for non-essential expenses like vacations or non-essential home additions like pools is discouraged due to the risk of long-term debt and potential foreclosure. Careful consideration and a solid repayment plan are crucial before leveraging home equity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Memorial Day Weekend travel is projected to break records, with AAA estimating that over 45 million people will travel at least 50 miles from home. The majority of travelers are expected to drive or fly, leading to crowded roads and airports. Travelers are advised to plan ahead, arrive early, and pack emergency kits to mitigate potential disruptions. Despite safety concerns and economic uncertainties, airlines are putting many flights and seats in the sky, though it remains to be seen how many will be filled.</p>

          <p>During a severe ocean heat wave off the coast of Papua New Guinea, scientists observed that clownfish shrank in size, an adaptation that appears to help them survive hotter ocean temperatures. The study found that fish that shrank had a higher chance of survival, suggesting that downsizing may be a beneficial response to heat stress. This research adds complexity to the understanding of how marine life adapts to climate change, even as heat waves devastate coral reefs.</p>

          <p>A court summons for Taylor Swift has been withdrawn from the legal battle between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni. Baldoni's lawyers sought to obtain messages between Lively's lawyers and Swift, but Swift's legal team objected to the subpoena. The legal action stems from a case where Lively is suing Baldoni for sexual harassment and a smear campaign.</p>
