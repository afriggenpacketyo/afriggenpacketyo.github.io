          <h2>US Imposes Significant Tariffs on Southeast Asian Solar Panel Imports</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 02:14:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has announced tariffs as high as 3,521% on solar panels imported from Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam, responding to allegations of Chinese subsidies and unfair dumping practices. The tariffs, which vary by company and country, aim to protect US solar equipment producers who requested the action a year ago. While US manufacturers welcome the move as a victory against unfair competition, businesses and consumers who have benefited from cheaper solar products may face increased costs. The tariffs are expected to impact the $12 billion in solar equipment America imported from these four countries in 2023.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has lobbied Japan to invest in new infrastructure, particularly energy production, to support the growing demands of artificial intelligence development. Huang emphasized Japan's strong position in robotics and industrial manufacturing as key assets for advancing AI. However, he cautioned that generating and creating intelligence requires significant energy resources, highlighting the challenges Japan faces in balancing data center electricity needs with restarting nuclear reactors and importing fossil fuels. Japan is considering investing in a US$44 billion liquefied natural gas project in Alaska as part of trade negotiations with the US.</p>

          <p>China has significantly reduced exports of critical metals to the United States in response to US tariffs on Chinese goods. Exports of tellurium, used in solar panels, and tungsten products have dramatically decreased, with some shipments halting entirely. This move is expected to pressure US manufacturers who heavily rely on China's rare earth supply chain, where China holds a dominant position. The export restrictions highlight China's strategic advantage in leveraging its control over rare earth minerals amid escalating trade tensions with the United States.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. dollar has dropped below 140 yen for the first time in seven months following criticism from President Donald Trump regarding Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's monetary policy. Trump urged Powell to implement preemptive interest rate cuts to stimulate the economy, leading to concerns about the central bank's independence and a subsequent sell-off of the U.S. currency. The dollar also faced downward pressure amid speculation that the U.S. administration would press Japan to address the yen's weakness during upcoming finance talks in Washington. The dollar's decline reflects broader market anxieties about the US economy and potential policy interventions.</p>

ICE denied the request, prompting criticism from Dr. Abdalla, who stated that the separation was an attempt to silence Khalil's advocacy for Palestinian freedom.

          <p>A U.S. District Court in Georgia has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate the legal statuses of 133 international students, granting a temporary restraining order (TRO) on their behalf. The lawsuit, filed by the ACLU, alleges that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) unlawfully terminated the students' records in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), making them deportable. The lawsuit argues that ICE's actions appear designed to coerce students into abandoning their studies and self-deporting, despite not violating their status.
