          <p>King Charles and Queen Camilla will host a tea party at Buckingham Palace for World War Two veterans to commemorate the 80th anniversary of VE Day. The event will include a military procession, a flypast by the Red Arrows and historic aircraft, and a celebratory concert. The tea party will host approximately 50 veterans, their families, and members of the wartime generation. This year's VE Day commemorations are especially poignant as it may be the last major anniversary with a sizeable group of surviving veterans.</p>

          <p>The Tennessee Titans selected Miami quarterback Cam Ward as the No. 1 overall pick in the NFL Draft, fulfilling predictions.

Shedeur Sanders' draft stock fell sharply, while the draft was held in Green Bay, Wisconsin, for the first time. This draft is not considered as talent-laden as previous years.

While China has invested heavily in infrastructure projects, it has largely relied on government-to-government aid. In contrast, Western countries have cultivated a vibrant NGO ecosystem that fosters community ties and provides social services. The author argues that an NGO approach could help China build stronger human connections and counter narratives of neocolonialism.</p>
