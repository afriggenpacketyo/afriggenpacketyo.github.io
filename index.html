        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority by implementing reciprocal tariffs, a key component of his economic strategy. The court determined that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president the power to unilaterally impose sweeping duties without congressional approval. The ruling specifically addresses tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China related to drug trafficking, stating they do not align with the threats outlined in the orders. Dow futures experienced a surge following the announcement, reflecting the market's positive reaction to the news, though the Trump administration has swiftly appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

          <p>Nvidia reported earnings and revenue figures that surpassed expectations, driven by a 73% surge in its data center business. The company anticipates approximately $45 billion in sales for the current quarter, although this forecast is reduced due to export restrictions on its H20 chips bound for China. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang noted that the Chinese market for AI chips is essentially closed to U.S. industry because of the export ban, which has affected their Hopper data center business in China. Despite these political challenges, Nvidia's growth continues to be propelled by strong demand for its AI chips, essential for applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT, with large cloud providers contributing significantly to the data center unit's revenue.

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the Trump administration will "aggressively revoke" visas of Chinese students with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in "critical fields." The State Department is also revising visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of future applications from China, including Hong Kong. This move is expected to cause anxiety on university campuses in the United States, which rely on international students for research skills and tuition revenue. The announcement lacks detail on the scope of the directive, fueling worries among the approximately 275,000 Chinese students in the United States, as well as professors and university administrators.</p>

The restrictions are part of a broader review within the Commerce Department regarding exports of strategic goods to China. The move is pushing the world’s largest economies a step closer toward supply chain warfare, as Washington and Beijing try to flex their power over essential economic components in an attempt to gain the upper hand in an intensifying trade conflict.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has criticized Nigel Farage's Reform policies, likening him to former PM Liz Truss and warning that Reform's policies would lead to increased mortgage costs. Starmer accuses Farage of pledging unfunded tax cuts that could trigger an economic meltdown. Farage pledged more generous benefits for pensioners and parents and also a commitment to raising the threshold at which someone starts to pay income tax from £12,570 to £20,000. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the policy could cost between £50bn and £80bn a year – and that Reform had not spelled out how they would raise the cash.</p>

This marks the central bank's fourth rate cut in the last six meetings, aiming to mitigate downside risks to economic growth while inflation remains broadly stable. South Korea's GDP growth unexpectedly contracted in the first quarter, shrinking 0.1% from a year earlier, marking its first contraction since the fourth quarter of 2020.

          <h2>Government Fast-Tracks New Reservoirs to Secure Water Supply</h2>

          <p>The government is fast-tracking two new reservoir projects in East Anglia and south Lincolnshire to shore up England's water supplies. Declared "nationally significant", the projects can speed through the planning process, though they could still be more than a decade away from opening. The announcement means that final decisions about the Fens Reservoir in Cambridgeshire and the Lincolnshire Reservoir will be taken by Environment Secretary Steve Reed, rather than at a local level. Experts warn that managing how we use water needs to take greater precedence in a warming climate, and that the new reservoirs could prove unpopular with local communities.</p>

Often tipped as a potential Nobel laureate, his writings explored the misdoings of the postcolonial elite and led a passionate campaign for African authors to eschew the languages of foreign occupiers.</p>

The president also tapped his former defense lawyer, Emil Bove, to be a federal appeals judge.

Satellite tagging confirms that some are beginning to venture into Northumberland and further afield and these sightings reaffirm the importance of us extending our groundbreaking work. Golden eagles were wiped out in England and Wales by the mid-19th Century, mainly due to persecution by those who saw them as a threat to livestock or game birds.</p>

          <p>S. Jack Hu, former University of Georgia provost, has been appointed as the new chancellor of UC Riverside, starting July 15. Hu's appointment comes at a crucial time for the UC system, which faces challenges including funding cuts and scrutiny over diversity efforts. He will replace Chancellor Kim A. Wilcox, who is retiring after serving in the role since 2013. At Riverside, Hu will take the helm of a campus grappling with deep cuts to federal funding grants, including those from the National Institutes of Health, a UC-wide hiring freeze and a UC-wide Department of Justice investigation over allegations of antisemitic employment discrimination tied to pro-Palestinian protests.</p>

Hoover, convicted of federal charges in 1997, was already serving a 200-year sentence on state charges in Illinois for a 1973 murder. It's unclear how soon he will be released from federal custody, but he still faces the remainder of his 200-year sentence in Illinois, dating back to 1973 for Young's murder. Hoover's attorneys said he has spent nearly 30 years in solitary confinement at ADX Florence, a maximum security prison in Colorado that they described as "the most restrictive, draconian supermax prison in the United States."</p>

The manufacturing sector contributed to over 25% of China's GDP in 2023, according to the World Bank.
