          <p>Six Bulgarians have been sentenced to lengthy prison terms in the UK for spying for Russia, targeting investigative journalists and Russian dissidents across Europe. The spy ring, which referred to themselves as "minions," conducted operations in the UK, Austria, Spain, Germany, and Montenegro. The group's activities, directed by fugitive Jan Marsalek, posed a serious risk to the UK's national security and undermined freedom of the press. The judge emphasized that using the UK as a base for spy operations was a grave offense, and the spies were motivated by money, discussing sums of up to €1 million for their services.</p>

          <p>Todd Blanche, former personal criminal attorney for President Trump, has been appointed acting Librarian of Congress, adding to the turmoil following the firing of Carla Hayden. The appointment has raised concerns, particularly as two other Justice Department officials have also been assigned Library of Congress positions. Democrats have argued that the President lacks the authority to fire the Librarian of Congress, as the library is an agency of the legislative branch. The situation has sparked controversy and uncertainty regarding the leadership and direction of the Library of Congress.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed an executive order aimed at lowering drug prices in the United States, but it lacks clear legal authority to mandate price reductions. The order directs federal agencies to investigate why European countries obtain lower prices and encourages them to pay more. The move follows House Republicans' proposal of health care policy changes that would cut Medicaid and Obamacare marketplaces. While pharmaceutical stocks initially dropped, they rebounded upon learning the details of the executive order, and industry groups have voiced concerns about looking to other countries for drug pricing models.

          <p>House Republicans are proposing to raise the cap on the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) to $30,000 for those with a modified adjusted gross income of $400,000 or less, as part of President Trump's tax and spending package. The SALT deduction limit has been a contentious issue in tax bill negotiations. The current $10,000 limit on the federal deduction for state and local taxes, enacted via the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, is set to expire after 2025 unless Congress takes action, and lawmakers from high-tax states are prioritizing raising the cap.</p>

          <p>U.S. tariff receipts surged to a record $16.3 billion in April, driven by President Trump's trade policies, which helped to reduce the budget deficit.

While the U.S. still faces a substantial budget deficit, the increase in tariff revenue contributed to a surplus for April.

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced tighter British immigration rules, declaring an end to what he termed a "failed experiment in open borders." The new regulations will make it more difficult to obtain work, family, and student visas to the UK, requiring higher-level English proficiency tests and longer residency periods for citizenship. Employers will also face restrictions on recruiting overseas workers, particularly for low-skilled jobs. Critics have raised concerns that Starmer's rhetoric could incite violence against migrants, while others argue the proposals do not go far enough.</p>

          <p>The Episcopal Church has terminated its partnership with the federal government to resettle refugees, citing moral opposition to resettling white Afrikaners from South Africa, who have been classified as refugees by the Trump administration. The Most Rev. Sean W. Rowe, the presiding bishop, stated that the request crossed a moral line, given the church's commitment to racial justice and its ties with the Anglican Church of Southern Africa. The church will continue to support immigrants and refugees in other ways, but will wind down federally funded services by September. The decision comes as the Trump administration has largely frozen the refugee program.</p>

          <p>Ukraine and its allies are increasing pressure on Russia to agree to an unconditional truce, with European leaders threatening new sanctions. President Zelensky challenged President Putin to meet him in Turkey, and President Trump suggested he might participate. Trump's potential involvement was welcomed by Zelensky, who has been trying to align himself with the U.S. leader. The Kremlin has not yet responded to the proposed meeting. European leaders are demanding an unconditional 30-day truce, while Putin has called for renewed negotiations without a cease-fire.</p>

          <p>A power failure caused major disruption to the London Underground, London Overground, and the Elizabeth line, leading to suspensions and delays across the network. Transport for London (TfL) reported that the issue stemmed from a brief power outage, and power has since been restored, but delays persist. Passengers experienced frustration as they were redirected between stations, and a separate fire alert suspended the entire Suffragette line on London Overground. National Grid attributed the problems to a fault on its transmission network, while Network Rail cited heavy rainfall as causing issues at King's Cross station.</p>

          <p>Austan D. Goolsbee, president of the Chicago Fed, indicated that there remains a risk of higher consumer prices and slower economic growth due to the uncertainty surrounding the White House's trade policy. While a temporary easing of trade tensions between the United States and China has lowered the likelihood of an economic shock, the risk of stagflation has not been completely eliminated. This warning underscores the potential economic impact of ongoing trade disputes.</p>

Prime Minister Netanyahu credited Alexander's release to military and political pressure from President Trump.
