          <p>Israel is currently reviewing a response from Hamas regarding a U.S.-brokered ceasefire proposal for the ongoing conflict in Gaza. High-level officials from Israel, Qatar, and the United States are scheduled to meet in Italy to discuss the details of Hamas's submission. These negotiations are proceeding amid dire warnings from over 100 aid organizations about the imminent risk of mass starvation in the enclave. The discussions in Doha have been ongoing for over two weeks, seeking a resolution to the 21-month-long conflict.</p>

          <p>American Airlines has significantly scaled back its profit outlook for 2025, with its third-quarter forecast also falling short of analyst expectations. The airline now projects an adjusted per-share result for 2025 ranging from a 20-cent loss to an 80-cent profit, a sharp decrease from its earlier estimate of $1.70 to $2.70 in earnings. This revision comes after the company, along with other carriers, had previously withdrawn its 2025 forecast in April. The airline industry continues to face challenges from fluctuating tariffs and demand that has been weaker than anticipated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock value dropped by 6% in premarket trading after the company reported its second straight quarter of declining automotive sales and missed revenue expectations. CEO Elon Musk acknowledged that Tesla could face "a few rough quarters" ahead, citing the expiration of federal EV tax credits and increasing competition from lower-cost Chinese manufacturers. The company's sales in Europe also showed a decline in June. Amid these financial pressures, some investors have expressed concern that Musk's political activities are negatively impacting the Tesla brand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following Bryan Kohberger's life sentence, police have released documents revealing unsettling incidents at the victims' home before the November 2022 murders. These included one victim seeing an unknown man staring at her and the residents finding their front door ajar on another occasion. The extensive files detail the police investigation, including following up on numerous public tips and using DNA from a knife sheath to identify Kohberger. The documents also recount Kohberger's brief interaction with police after his arrest, where he requested a lawyer before any substantive questioning occurred.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and India have signed a significant free trade agreement, hailed by UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer as the most substantial deal for Britain since Brexit. The agreement will lower tariffs on UK exports like cars and whisky to India, and on Indian exports such as textiles to the UK, aiming to boost the British economy by £4.8 billion annually. In addition to the trade components, the deal establishes a new collaborative plan to address illegal migration. The agreement, which took three years to negotiate, also includes closer cooperation on defense, technology, and security.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has rescinded a $20 million grant intended to provide clean drinking water to communities in California's Monterey County, where wells are contaminated with toxic pesticides. The EPA labeled the grant a "wasteful DEI program," a move advocates call unjust as thousands of residents, primarily agricultural workers, have lacked safe tap water for decades. The funding was meant to improve municipal infrastructure and connect contaminated wells to safe water sources for about 5,500 people. This action is part of a broader administration effort to cut funding for environmental and climate justice initiatives.</p>

          <p>Electricity prices across the United States have been rising faster than inflation since 2022 and are expected to continue this trend through 2026. This increase is driven by a combination of high demand, insufficient supply, and broader inflationary pressures. A key factor is the urgent need to replace aging grid infrastructure, with utilities now spending more on transmission and distribution than on power generation. The buildout of power-hungry data centers, increased use of EVs, and regulatory delays in approving new power projects are also contributing to the sustained rise in consumer energy bills.

          <p>In this essay adapted from the Mellon Lectures, playwright and actress Anna Deavere Smith explores her lifelong artistic project of understanding American character by embodying the words of others. She reflects on her upbringing, the inhibitions of being a Black child in a segregated society, and her journey into theater. Smith discusses the power of language and intention, drawing inspiration from poet Édouard Glissant's "poetics of relation"—the idea of finding oneself by taking up the problems of the Other. She connects this to the American experience, where finding a collective "us" requires confronting broken promises with hope and grace.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the deep-seated cultural taboo around death in the United States, exploring why many Americans avoid discussing mortality despite acknowledging its importance. It traces the modern aversion to death back to the 19th century, with the rise of the professional funeral industry and embalming, which distanced people from the dying process. The consequences of this silence are significant, leading to a lack of end-of-life planning and unpreparedness for grief. However, the article also notes a growing "death positive" movement, which advocates for more open, transparent, and personal approaches to death and dying.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that broad economic sanctions, primarily imposed by the U.S., are a devastating weapon that kills hundreds of thousands of people annually, a toll comparable to armed conflict. The author cites a recent study estimating 564,000 annual deaths, disproportionately affecting children, due to sanctions that cripple economies and block access to essentials like food and medicine. The article contends that these sanctions are often illegal under international law, constituting a form of collective punishment.

The article emphasizes Head Start's 60-year record of bipartisan success in giving vulnerable children a strong start.

The two survivors, however, were both found with personal flotation devices. The tragedy occurred when a boat with ten people aboard capsized in a sudden, severe storm with high waves and freezing water temperatures. The report suggests that the decision to wear a life jacket was a critical factor in survival. Investigators found no evidence of a hull leak or other mechanical failure with the boat.</p>

These large, standardized apartment complexes, or "apateu," function like miniature towns with their own amenities and are seen as symbols of upward mobility.

          <p>The California Department of Motor Vehicles has filed a lawsuit against Tesla, accusing the company of false advertising by misleading consumers about its vehicles' autonomous driving capabilities. The state argues that labeling features "Autopilot" and "Full Self-Driving" implies a level of autonomy that the cars do not possess, seeking to suspend the company's sales in California as a penalty. This legal challenge adds to Tesla's recent troubles, including declining sales and scrutiny of CEO Elon Musk's public statements.

This has led to criticism that the protests have become a platform for Serbian nationalism, exposing deep rifts among students on issues like Kosovo and the Srebrenica massacre.
