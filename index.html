          <p>According to President Trump, Russia and Ukraine are set to begin immediate negotiations toward a ceasefire and an end to the war, following discussions with both President Putin and President Zelensky. Trump emphasized that the conditions for peace would be negotiated directly between the two parties, as they possess unique insights into the negotiation details. Zelensky has stressed the importance of U.S. involvement in these talks, warning against any distancing that could benefit Putin. Putin has expressed readiness to collaborate with Ukraine on a memorandum for a potential peace agreement, though details remain vague. This article describes Trump's continued role as a negotiator, despite earlier frustrations with the lack of progress.</p>

          <p>China has accused the U.S. of undermining preliminary trade agreements after the U.S. issued an industry warning against using Chinese chips, specifically those from Huawei. A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce stated that the Trump administration should correct its mistakes, calling the U.S. Commerce Department's guidance discriminatory and market-distorting. The U.S. Commerce Department had warned of the risks of using Chinese advanced-computing ICs, citing potential violations of U.S. export controls.

          <p>The U.S. State Department has announced a visa ban on owners, executives, and senior officials of India-based travel agencies accused of facilitating illegal immigration to the United States. The State Department's Consular Affairs and Diplomatic Security Service mission in India identified those engaged in facilitating illegal immigration and human smuggling and trafficking operations. The visa restriction would apply even to individuals who would otherwise qualify for a Visa Waiver Program. The State Department vows to continue imposing visa restrictions on representatives of travel agencies in order to cut off alien smuggling networks, reinforcing the Trump administration's crackdown on migration.</p>

          <p>A recent escalation of clashes between India and Pakistan, which resulted in a ceasefire brokered by the U.S., has underscored the dangers posed by new technologies in military conflicts. The conflict, shaped by the use of missiles, drones, and loitering munitions, also showcased the use of Chinese, American, Russian, and French weapons systems. This article argues that the use of these advanced technologies incentivized limited action, giving rise to tit-for-tat exchanges and a protracted crisis, while simultaneously creating an environment where both sides alluded to being constrained in their military responses, highlighting the restraint-escalation paradox.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's takeover and gutting of the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) was unlawful. The decision declared the actions of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, at USIP "null and void." The ruling came after DOGE team members took over USIP's headquarters, replaced its acting president, and terminated nearly all of its staff. Judge Beryl Howell ordered the reinstatement of George Moose, calling the officials who replaced him "illegitimately installed," and emphasized that Congress's restrictions on the President's removal power of USIP Board members are constitutional.</p>

          <p>A Michigan woman, Linda Stermer, has been sentenced to life in prison for the murder of her husband, Todd Stermer, nearly 20 years after his death. This is her second conviction for the crime, after winning an appeal and getting a new trial. Prosecutors alleged Stermer doused her husband with gasoline and set him on fire in 2007, a day after he learned she was having an extramarital affair. Stermer maintains her innocence, claiming it was an accident, but the jury found her guilty.</p>

          <p>Experts are warning that the Republican-backed tax and spending bill moving forward in the House could add trillions to the U.S. deficit. The proposed tax breaks are projected to far outstrip any savings in the bill, potentially leading to mounting U.S. debt and a worsening fiscal outlook. Moody's Ratings has downgraded the nation's debt, citing the potential for the bill to add $4 trillion to the federal primary deficit over the next decade. The Trump administration disagrees with these assessments, claiming the bill includes significant savings.</p>

The sculpture was found during a search tied to a fraud case led by the Paris public prosecutor's office. The bust, by Croatian artist Mladen Mikulin, had been placed at the grave to mark the 10th anniversary of Morrison's death. Morrison's grave remains a popular destination for rock fans, and the exact circumstances of his death in 1971 remain shrouded in mystery.</p>

Garwin's role was long obscured, even from his family, as he advised presidents and devoted his life to undoing the danger he created. Inspired by Enrico Fermi, Garwin became a key figure in nuclear arms control, advising 13 presidents. Despite his pivotal role in creating the H-bomb, Garwin did not take personal or moral responsibility, arguing its birth was inevitable, and spent his life working to mitigate its potential for destruction.

The 30-year Treasury yield briefly hit 5.03%, a level not seen since November 2023, before settling around 4.921%. Moody's attributed the downgrade to the increasing burden of financing the government's budget deficit and the high cost of rolling over existing debt amid high interest rates. The downgrade brings Moody's rating in line with other major credit rating agencies. The 10-year yield also climbed to 4.459%. (not investment advice)</p>

While the tax cut would reduce federal revenues by about $11 billion a year, some analysts argue that it primarily benefits middle-income earners, as many lower-income individuals already owe no federal income taxes due to the standard deduction. Additionally, the policy could create wage pressure in the service industry and may not provide significant relief to the working class overall. (not investment advice)</p>
