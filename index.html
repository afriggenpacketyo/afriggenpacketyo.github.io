          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to be used for private school tuition. The bill provides $10,000 per year for most students attending accredited private schools and up to $30,000 for students with disabilities. Democrats argue that the legislation will harm public schools by siphoning funds to wealthier students already in private education.

          <p>This New York Times guest essay by Damon Linker discusses how President Trump, in his second term, has sought to greatly enlarge executive power, drawing upon radical right-wing thought. The author identifies Carl Schmitt, Leo Strauss, the Claremont Institute, and Adrian Vermeule as key intellectual influences, arguing that they favor explicitly monarchical and even dictatorial rule. The essay examines how Trump's administration has put these ideas into practice, raising concerns about the transformation of the American presidency into a dictatorial office that disregards the separation of powers. The article concludes by urging that presidents must accept the constraints of ruling within a constitutional order to prevent tyranny.</p>
