          <p>German authorities have arrested three individuals suspected of operating a people-smuggling network that allegedly facilitated the illegal entry of Chinese nationals into Germany. The network charged clients up to â‚¬230,000 (US$260,790) to help them move to Germany, promising to assist them via an accelerated government scheme for skilled workers. Around 750 officers searched 38 properties across nine German states as part of the investigation, which began in October 2023. The suspects reportedly targeted wealthy Chinese individuals online, offering assistance with relocating to Germany.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article analyzes how President Trump's Justice Department, under Ed Martin, is allegedly planning to target and discredit individuals deemed enemies, even without sufficient evidence for prosecution. Martin stated the goal is to 'name and shame' those they believe are guilty, regardless of formal charges. This approach deviates from traditional prosecutorial norms of focusing on crimes, not people, raising ethical concerns and potentially violating Justice Department rules. The article details instances where Martin's actions have been questioned, including attempts to investigate political opponents, leading to concerns about the politicization of the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>The Senate has passed a surprise 'no tax on tips' bill, which could allow workers to deduct all 'qualified tips' from 2025 through 2028, requiring that tips are reported to qualify. This bipartisan bill, supported by both Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 campaign, aims to provide tax relief to tipped workers, primarily in restaurants, hotels, and courier services. However, analysts note that the benefits may be limited to moderate to middle-income workers, with little impact for those with the lowest earnings. The policy may also lead to issues like income misclassification and the introduction of tipping in new occupations. (not investment advice)</p>

The number of students from low-income families rose by nearly 1%, and there was a more than 9% increase in students experiencing homelessness.

Stokes praised Bethell's winter performances, suggesting he is part of England's future plans. Bethell, yet to score a century in professional cricket, is seen as having the potential to surpass Crawley and Pope, who have middling records in their England careers. Crawley, averaging 30.51 in 53 Tests, has faced recent struggles, while Pope averages 34.02 in 55 Tests.</p>

          <p>This article argues that the "One Big, Beautiful Bill" reflects traditional Republican priorities, despite perceptions of a changing party. The bill includes tax cuts primarily benefiting the wealthy, spending cuts targeting programs for the poor, and increased defense spending. This pattern aligns with the long-standing economic and budgetary goals of the Republican party since the Reagan era. While some Republicans may express interest in deviating from this orthodoxy, the bill's composition indicates a continuity of core Republican principles.</p>
