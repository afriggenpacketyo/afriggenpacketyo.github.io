            <p>A significant crash involving multiple police vehicles occurred on the A1 in Newcastle, leading to the hospitalization of five individuals. The incident, which took place near Denton Burn in the early hours, caused substantial damage to the vehicles and scattered debris across the northbound carriageway. The road was closed for investigation, causing major disruptions during the morning rush hour as drivers sought alternative routes across the River Tyne. Emergency services, including ambulance crews and fire rescue teams, responded to the scene to provide assistance and manage the aftermath of the collision.</p>

            <p>In response to increased tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump, China has announced its own tariffs on American imports. Trump's actions raised import duties significantly, prompting Beijing to vow a firm stance in the trade war. The Chinese government has also intervened in capital markets to bolster investor confidence by increasing purchases of A shares through state-backed funds. This escalating trade conflict signals further economic tension between the two global powers.</p>

            <p>According to Trump administration officials, the Biden administration engaged in private discussions with Beijing regarding the Chinese spy balloon incident in 2023 before informing the public. These talks focused on the potential impact of public knowledge of the balloon on US-China relations.

            <p>A new report indicates that several top US consumer goods corporations spent significantly more on share buybacks than on federal taxes after the 2017 Trump tax cuts. These companies, including PepsiCo and Comcast, used their tax savings to enrich investors rather than lowering prices for consumers or raising workers' wages. The analysis suggests that the tax cuts incentivized buybacks, contributing to wealth inequality. Critics argue that this trend exemplifies "shareholder primacy" and legal manipulation of stock prices. (not investment advice)</p>

However, this surge may be short-lived as rates have since increased, influenced by inflation data and tariff updates. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's trade policies are driven by a belief that trade deficits are a loss for the US, leading to tariffs on various countries. Economists criticize this view, arguing that trade benefits countries through specialization and ignores US advantages in service exports. Trump's approach faces challenges, including supply chain disruptions, workforce shortages, and currency issues. Some experts suggest a global accord to weaken the dollar as a potential solution, but the overall strategy remains economically problematic.</p>

            <p>An altar from the Teotihuacan culture, believed to have been used for sacrifices, particularly of children, was discovered in Tikal National Park in Guatemala. The remains of three children were found near the altar, indicating the practice of child sacrifice. The discovery reveals the interaction between the Maya and Teotihuacan cultures between 300 and 500 A.D. Archaeologists believe the find reinforces the idea that Tikal was a cosmopolitan center.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration's decision to omit transnational far-right extremists from the intelligence community's threat assessment is raising concerns. By focusing solely on groups like drug cartels and neglecting the threat posed by neo-Nazis and white supremacists, the administration is ignoring a core threat to American democracy. This shift in focus, coupled with personnel decisions and funding cuts, leaves the US more vulnerable to attacks from far-right extremists. The distortion of the threat assessment highlights the politicization of counterterrorism efforts.</p>

The SSA acknowledges long wait times but attributes the issues to problems that predate the current administration, though the changes by Musk's team are clearly adding to the issues.</p>
