          <p>Consumer confidence in March reached a 12-year low, driven by pessimism about future economic conditions and income prospects.  The Conference Board's index of future expectations tumbled to its lowest point in over a decade, signaling potential recessionary concerns. This drop was widespread across age and income groups, further highlighting the severity of the economic downturn.</p>

          <p>The White House is investigating how a journalist gained access to a Signal group chat involving top military officials discussing potential strikes in Yemen.  The White House denies that classified information or war plans were shared, attributing the leak to an inadvertent addition of the journalist to the group.  Despite this, concerns have been raised in Congress regarding the use of an unsecure platform for such sensitive discussions.</p>
