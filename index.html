          <p>Citadel's Ken Griffin cautioned that President Trump's trade policies risk damaging the U.S.'s reputation and the stability of its Treasury market, emphasizing America's global brand and the importance of respecting its financial strength. Griffin, who supported Trump, criticized his "bombastic" rhetoric and urged thoughtful behavior to protect the U.S. Treasury market's brand, which he sees as being put at risk by the political tensions and tariffs. Treasury yields have risen and the dollar weakened due to these concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves indicated the UK might lower tariffs on U.S. car imports to secure a trade agreement with the Trump administration, aiming to reduce both tariff and non-tariff barriers. The UK seeks to lower trade taxes imposed by President Trump of 25% for cars, steel and aluminium and 10% on other British exports. While open to reducing trade barriers, Reeves clarified that the UK would not compromise on food standards, addressing a previous sticking point in negotiations. The UK government is working to secure a deal that benefits British industry, jobs, and consumers.</p>

          <p>President Trump's desire for automakers to shift production to the U.S. faces significant hurdles, including upcoming tariffs on auto parts and the lengthy, costly process of relocating production lines.

While increasing production in existing facilities is a faster option, building new plants can stimulate the local economy. Despite challenges, some automakers are aiming to increase U.S. production, though timelines remain uncertain.</p>

          <p>Kemi Badenoch has denied claims of a rift with shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick over whether the party should form a pact with Reform UK. Jenrick said he wanted the "fight" against Labour at the next general election to be "united" and he was "determined" to "bring this coalition together". Badenoch's spokesman insisted there no differences between them, stating that she has made it clear there will be no electoral pact with Reform. The Tory leader struck a similarly relaxed tone when asked by the BBC if Jenrick was undermining her leadership with his comments on Reform.</p>

          <p>International tourism to the United States is experiencing a slump, while Americans are increasingly traveling overseas. Foreign visitors to the U.S. by air fell nearly 10% in March, while U.S. citizens flying abroad increased 1.6%. This imbalance could widen the gap between what the U.S. generates through travel and tourism services and what Americans spend abroad. Factors contributing to the decline in international tourism include trade tensions, detentions of visitors, and a strong U.S. dollar.</p>

          <p>Jordan’s Interior Ministry said that it would enforce a widespread ban on the activities of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group that has been outlawed in several other Arab countries. The announcement came a week after Jordanian security services said that they had arrested 16 people accused of plotting threats to national security involving weapons, explosives and plans to manufacture drones and train combatants, both at home and abroad.</p>

          <p>In this episode of The David Frum Show, David examines the dangerous path the Trump administration is charting by deporting and detaining individuals without hearings—an assault on due process that threatens the foundation of American justice. He’s then joined by former Acting Attorney General Peter Keisler to explore what America’s institutions can realistically do to counter Trump’s executive overreach—and the serious risks facing the courts, the Federal Reserve, and the American public if Trump continues unchecked.</p>
