          <p>UK mobile provider EE has confirmed it performed overnight maintenance to resolve a technical issue that prevented some customers from making or receiving calls. This follows a more significant outage earlier in the week that affected thousands of users, including their ability to contact emergency services. Despite the company's statement that the network is now stable, some customers reported ongoing problems for a third consecutive day, criticizing the lack of communication. EE has apologized for the inconvenience and stated it is continuing to monitor the network to prevent future disruptions.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 15:00:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The increasing electricity consumption from data centers powering artificial intelligence is a significant factor in rising summer utility bills across the United States. PJM Interconnection, the country's largest grid operator, projects sharp usage increases, potentially leading to bill hikes of up to 20% in some areas. The energy demand from AI infrastructure is outpacing the development of new power sources, as fossil fuel plants retire and clean energy projects face delays. This strain on the power grid means the operational costs of AI are being passed on to all consumers, regardless of their personal use of the technology. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actress Gwyneth Paltrow has been hired as a "very temporary" spokesperson for the tech company Astronomer, which recently faced a public relations crisis. The move comes after the company's CEO and an HR executive resigned when they were filmed in an intimate embrace on a KissCam at a Coldplay concert. In a short video, Paltrow, the ex-wife of Coldplay's Chris Martin, humorously addressed the company's newfound attention without directly mentioning the scandal. The company stated it will now return to focusing on its data workflow automation services for its customers.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has stated that he is involved in mediating an end to the deadly border conflict between Thailand and Cambodia. He claimed to have spoken with leaders from both nations, who he says are seeking an immediate ceasefire to the fighting that has killed at least 33 people. Trump posted on social media that peace seems to be a natural outcome and also tied the successful conclusion of future trade agreements to the cessation of hostilities. The conflict stems from a long-standing territorial dispute over the area surrounding the 11th-century Preah Vihear temple.</p>

          <p>Over 136 million people in the United States are under heat alerts as a major heatwave impacts the Southeast and Midwest. The National Weather Service has issued warnings for dangerously hot conditions, with heat indexes expected to reach as high as 115°F in some areas of the Carolinas. This extreme heat, caused by a persistent high-pressure system known as a heat dome, is forecast to bring temperatures 10 to 15 degrees above average. Officials are urging residents to take precautions, such as staying hydrated and avoiding strenuous outdoor activity, to prevent heat-related illnesses.</p>

          <p>At least 42 Palestinians were killed in recent Israeli airstrikes and gunfire, including several individuals waiting for aid trucks near the Zikim crossing. The violence occurs as ceasefire negotiations have reportedly stalled and the United Nations warns of a deepening famine crisis across the Gaza Strip. Reports indicate a rising death toll from malnutrition-related causes, particularly among children, with aid agencies struggling to distribute supplies due to military restrictions and logistical challenges. International pressure is mounting on Israel to alleviate the humanitarian catastrophe as airdrops are being considered as a limited, temporary measure.</p>

She announced the news ahead of the Euro 2025 final, stating that the success of England's Lionesses and the changing landscape for women in sports made it a good time to revisit the characters. The original 2002 film, starring Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley, is credited with inspiring a generation of female football players.

          <p>A USAID analysis of over 150 reported incidents of aid loss in Gaza found no evidence of widespread, systematic diversion of assistance by Hamas. This finding appears to challenge repeated claims by the Trump administration and Israel, which have been used to justify altering aid distribution methods in the region. The report examined incidents between October 2023 and May 2024, concluding that in most cases, the perpetrators of aid theft could not be identified. The State Department and the Israel Defense Forces have strongly pushed back against the report's conclusions, maintaining that Hamas does exploit humanitarian aid.</p>

          <p>A BBC analysis argues that airdropping humanitarian aid into Gaza is a crude and desperate measure that will not solve the territory's hunger crisis. Drawing on past experiences in Iraqi Kurdistan and Bosnia, the article highlights the dangers and inefficiencies of this method, including aid landing in minefields or on shelters, and delivering far less than truck convoys. The piece contends that airdrops are a last resort for when ground access is impossible, which is not the case in Gaza, where land routes from Israel and Jordan exist. It concludes that only a ceasefire and an unrestricted, long-term ground operation can effectively address the starvation.</p>

While the DPP won the presidency, the KMT and its allies hold a majority in the legislature, enabling them to resist President Lai Ching-te's agenda. Proponents of the recall had criticized the KMT for passing controversial reforms and being overly favorable to China, while the KMT accused the DPP of political retaliation.</p>

          <p>Tadej Pogačar is set to win his fourth Tour de France title after safely navigating the penultimate stage and maintaining his overall lead. The final stage into Paris is traditionally processional, meaning his victory is all but guaranteed. Australian sprinter Kaden Groves won Stage 20 with a solo attack 16km from the finish, marking his first-ever Tour stage victory and completing a career trilogy of stage wins across all three Grand Tour races. The day also saw Pogačar secure his third King of the Mountains title, capping a dominant performance in this year's race.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq reached new record highs this past week, buoyed by positive earnings reports and developments in international trade. A key driver was President Trump's announcement of a trade agreement with Japan, with investor focus now shifting to upcoming talks with China and the European Union. Second-quarter earnings have been largely positive, with 80% of reporting S&P 500 companies beating expectations. However, housing market data presented a mixed picture, with existing home prices rising while new home prices fell, an important trend for monitoring inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The debate over how much coffee is safe to drink daily is complex, with experts advising that the right amount depends on the individual. While the FDA recommends a cap of 400 milligrams of caffeine per day, recent studies offer conflicting results on its health impacts. Some research links daily coffee to healthy aging and heart benefits, while other studies suggest a connection to dementia or cardiovascular risk for those with hypertension. Dietitians stress that moderation is key and advise people to be mindful of their own tolerance, stopping if they feel anxious, jittery, or experience sleep disruption.</p>

A White House spokesperson stated that "all options are being explored" to fulfill the president's deregulation promises but confirmed no single plan has been finalized.

The main accusations rely on a witness who later said her statements were made under pressure.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An international team of scientists has discovered that a significant portion of what was once considered "junk" DNA plays a crucial role in gene regulation. The study focused on transposable elements, or "jumping genes," which make up nearly half of the human genome. Researchers found that a specific family of these elements, believed to have originated from an ancient virus, can act as genetic switches that influence gene expression without altering the underlying DNA code. This finding challenges previous assumptions and suggests that these sequences have evolved to become integral parts of our genetic machinery.</p>
