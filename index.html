        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk has publicly criticized President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill, labeling it a "disgusting abomination" on X. Musk argues the bill will drastically increase the budget deficit to $2.5 trillion and burden American citizens with unsustainable debt. His comments reflect wider tensions within the Republican Party over the bill, which includes tax breaks and increased defense spending. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt responded that the President already knows Musk's stance on the bill, while Republican lawmakers defended the legislation, citing their campaign promises. The comments suggest a growing rift between Musk and Trump, despite Musk's previous support and donations. Optimism is relatively low given the public disagreement on economic policy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has rescinded a Biden-era policy requiring hospitals to provide emergency abortions. The central issue revolves around interpreting a federal law that prevents hospitals from turning away poor or uninsured patients. This action signifies a reversal in healthcare policy regarding abortion access and underscores the ongoing political and legal battles surrounding reproductive rights. The decision is likely to face legal challenges and further polarize opinions on abortion access. The overall outlook is somewhat pessimistic, given the restrictions on healthcare access.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military (IDF) has declared roads to Gaza aid centers as "combat zones," leading to the closure of these sites for a day. This announcement follows a deadly incident where at least 27 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire near a distribution center. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a US and Israel-backed aid network, is temporarily closing its sites for improvements. The UN has criticized the GHF's distribution methods and called for an investigation into the recent deadly incidents. The situation is dire, with warnings of starvation and concerns over aid distribution safety.</p>

          <p>The UK has been temporarily exempted from US President Donald Trump's executive order doubling steel and aluminum tariffs. Trump's order raises import taxes for US firms buying from other countries, but the UK's levy remains at 25% due to the US-UK Economic Prosperity Deal. However, the US might increase the tariff on the UK if it determines the UK has not complied with relevant aspects of the EPD. The UK government is committed to protecting British business and jobs and will continue to work with the US to implement the agreement. There is uncertainty over timings and final tariff rates, which may affect UK steel exports.</p>
