          <h2>UK Economic Inactivity Rate Remains High</h2>

          <p>Official figures reveal that over 21% of UK working-age adults are economically inactive (not working or seeking work).  This rate, while lower than previous quarters and years, remains a concern for the government, especially given plans to boost economic growth and recent cuts to sickness and disability benefits.  The Office for National Statistics cautions about the data's accuracy due to low response rates.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has lowered its U.S. economic growth forecast to 1.7% and raised its inflation projection to 2.8%.  This suggests a potential stagflation scenario, fueled by factors such as President Trump's tariffs. The Fed still anticipates two rate cuts in 2025 despite the increased inflation outlook.</p>
