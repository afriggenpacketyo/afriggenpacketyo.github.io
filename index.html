          <p>Following her acquittal in the death of John O'Keefe, Karen Read has reportedly secured a book deal and a potential TV series. However, witnesses who testified for the prosecution, as well as O'Keefe's family, are facing a campaign of public harassment and intimidation. One witness described being told by the District Attorney's office to stop contacting them for help, feeling abandoned after cooperating with the state. The case's fallout also includes professional consequences for law enforcement officers involved in the investigation, highlighting the deep and lasting divisions created by the high-profile trial.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests China's Tibetan Dam Project May Increase India's Dry-Season Water Supply</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to widespread fears in India that China's new mega-dam in Tibet could cause a water crisis, a recent study suggests it might have the opposite effect. By analyzing data from two existing upstream dams, researchers found that water flow during the dry season has actually increased. Specifically, low flows in February were observed to be over 50% higher, alleviating concerns about potential droughts. This new evidence provides a more nuanced perspective on the dam's downstream impact, suggesting a potential for more stable water management rather than conflict.</p>

          <h2>Florida Lawmakers Tour Controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" Migrant Facility Amid Conflicting Reports on Conditions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 23:57:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A bipartisan group of Florida lawmakers has toured the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" migrant detention facility in the Everglades for the first time. The visit follows weeks of denied access and lawsuits after detainees reported inhumane conditions, including extreme heat, lack of water, and insufficient food. Democratic lawmakers described the conditions as "appalling," noting an 85-degree temperature in the medical area and claims of drinking water coming from toilets. In contrast, Republican lawmakers expressed satisfaction, with one senator calling the beds more comfortable than his own, highlighting a stark partisan divide over the facility's operations.</p>

          <p>The European Union and Mexico have strongly criticized President Trump's announcement of a proposed 30% tariff on their imports, set to take effect on August 1. The EU's chief, Ursula von der Leyen, threatened "proportionate countermeasures" if necessary, while still expressing a desire to negotiate a resolution. Mexico labeled the move an "unfair deal," asserting that its national sovereignty is non-negotiable. The proposed tariffs, which Trump warned could increase if met with retaliation, mark a significant escalation in trade tensions and create substantial uncertainty for the global economy.

          <h2>U.S. Tariffs and Industry Shifts Create Uncertainty for UK Steel Towns</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Britain's historic steel towns, like Port Talbot and Redcar, are facing a precarious future due to a combination of plant closures, rising energy costs, and uncertainty surrounding U.S. tariffs. The potential for continued 25% tariffs on UK steel exports to the U.S. has frayed nerves and reportedly cost the industry orders. As the UK moves away from traditional blast furnaces, questions arise about the identity of these communities and whether they should pivot to new industries or fight to preserve steelmaking. The article explores the debate over romanticizing industrial history versus embracing future-focused economic development. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel has publicly denied rumors that he is considering resigning from his position. The speculation arose from reports of his dissatisfaction with a joint Department of Justice and FBI decision to conclude the review of the Jeffrey Epstein files without further disclosures, such as a rumored "client list." The decision has angered some hardline MAGA supporters and reportedly caused a rift between Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino. In a social media post, Patel stated the "conspiracy theories just aren’t true" and affirmed his commitment to serving the president.</p>

          <p>The BBC was granted rare access to the vast Rubaya mining site in eastern DR Congo, which is a critical source of the world's coltan and is currently controlled by M23 rebels. Thousands of miners work daily in the dangerous pits, extracting the mineral essential for mobile phones. An M23-appointed supervisor claims the rebel group has brought security and organization to the site, which the UN reports generates hundreds of thousands of dollars for the M23 monthly. The visit comes as a fragile ceasefire deal, backed by the U.S., aims to bring stability and potential American investment to the mineral-rich region.</p>

          <p>With the cost of package holidays soaring, families are employing creative strategies to save money on their summer vacations. One couple saved thousands by booking an all-inclusive trip to Mexico just two days before departure, finding it cheaper than European destinations. Another family saved over £3,000 by traveling off-peak and using a "kids go free" filter on travel websites. Other money-saving hacks include using home-swapping websites to trade flats for villas, collecting credit card points for flights, and house-sitting to get free accommodation both in the UK and abroad.</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods along the Guadalupe River in Texas killed at least 129 people, including children at a summer camp, with dozens still missing. The disaster was caused by a massive, slow-moving weather system that dumped extreme rainfall onto the flood-prone Texas Hill Country. Officials are now facing scrutiny over the timeliness and effectiveness of their emergency warnings, as many survivors reported receiving no alerts before the deluge struck. A previous proposal for a more robust, siren-based flood warning system had reportedly stalled due to concerns over cost and local resistance.</p>

          <p>Investigators have begun a two-year excavation at the site of a former church-run mother-and-baby home in Tuam, Ireland, where a mass grave is believed to hold the remains of 796 infants. The St Mary's home, which operated from 1925 to 1961, housed unmarried women and their children, who were often separated. The grave's existence was uncovered by an amateur historian, and a 2017 test excavation confirmed "significant quantities of human remains." The complex operation aims to carefully recover and identify the remains, bringing a long-awaited and somber reckoning for a dark chapter in Irish history.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, ordering officials to stop "indiscriminately" arresting people suspected of being in the U.S. illegally. The ruling, by U.S. District Judge Maame Frimpong, bars arrests based solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish. The order stems from a lawsuit filed by immigrants and U.S. citizens who were detained without reasonable suspicion during recent enforcement actions.
