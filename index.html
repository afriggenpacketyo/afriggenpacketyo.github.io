          <p>The U.S. has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, establishing a 15% tariff on Japanese exports. President Trump stated the agreement includes a $550 billion investment from Japan into the U.S. and will open Japanese markets to American goods like vehicles and agricultural products. The deal, which comes after Japan's ruling coalition faced election setbacks, aims to create thousands of American jobs and was met with a positive surge in Japanese auto stocks. An additional agreement concerning liquified natural gas is also reportedly being finalized. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The family of a man who died at Castle Hill Hospital in the UK alleges the institution covered up a medical mistake by issuing two different death certificates. An initial certificate mentioned a failed heart procedure (TAVI), but a revised version removed this reference. This case is part of a wider police investigation into numerous deaths following the same procedure at the hospital, which has a mortality rate above the national average. An unpublished review found the patient's care was "very poor" and that the hospital did not accurately disclose the events to the family.</p>

          <p>Police in Hillsborough County, Florida, are warning the public about a dangerous social media trend known as the "door kick challenge." The challenge involves individuals, often minors, kicking homeowners' front doors and sometimes firing airsoft guns to frighten residents before fleeing. Authorities have released video of an incident and are urging parents to discuss the risks with their children. Experts warn that such pranks, performed for online attention, could lead to tragic consequences if a homeowner reacts defensively.</p>

          <p>Following the announcement of a new U.S.-Japan trade deal, shares of major Japanese automakers soared, with some seeing double-digit gains. The surge was fueled by reports that U.S. tariffs on Japanese vehicles would be lowered to 15% from the previous 25% rate. Major companies like Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and Mazda all experienced significant jumps in their stock prices. This market reaction underscores the importance of auto exports to the Japanese economy, which constituted over 28% of all its shipments in 2024. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A musician from Worcestershire has spoken out after being cyberflashed, stating she felt ignored by police who she had to contact over 20 times before her case was properly handled. Anna Downes reported receiving unsolicited pornographic images from a man she met once, but the investigation stalled for months until media intervention. Her harasser was eventually convicted and given a community order, having had a prior conviction for a similar offense. Downes' experience highlights ongoing issues with how law enforcement handles such crimes, even after the case of Sarah Everard, who was abducted, sexually assaulted and murdered by a police officer.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) has directed its sports federations to comply with a presidential executive order that effectively bars transgender women from competing in women's sports. In a letter, the USOPC stated its obligation as a federally chartered organization to follow the directive, which threatens to rescind funding from non-compliant bodies. This policy shift aligns with recent changes by the NCAA and has been condemned by civil rights groups as sacrificing athlete needs for political demands. The move marks a significant change from the USOPC's previous stance of letting individual federations set their own eligibility rules.</p>

The article also highlights House Republicans cutting their workweek short to avoid a vote on releasing files related to Jeffrey Epstein.

The claim is based on a recently declassified report from the Director of National Intelligence which Trump's allies say shows the Obama administration manipulated intelligence. An Obama spokesperson dismissed the accusations as "bizarre," "ridiculous," and a "weak attempt at distraction." The controversy stems from emails between Obama aides that critics argue show a conspiracy to harm Trump, while supporters maintain they do not undercut the conclusion that Russia attempted to influence the election.</p>

The tragedy and the photo's widespread publication prompted Boston to implement a new city code requiring fire escapes to be certified as safe every five years.

          <p>One month after Israeli airstrikes targeted Iran's notorious Evin Prison, transferred inmates report they are being held in inhumane and unbearable conditions in other facilities. Families of prisoners describe overcrowded cells, a lack of beds and air conditioning, and insect infestations at prisons like Fashafouyeh. The attack, which Iran calls a "war crime" and Israel justified by alleging intelligence operations, killed 80 people. Amnesty International has called for a war crimes investigation, stating there is no credible evidence that the prison was a lawful military objective.</p>

          <p>The Hershey Company has confirmed it will raise candy prices by a "low double-digit" percentage due to the unprecedented cost of cocoa. The price hike will affect products across its portfolio, including iconic brands like Hershey Kisses and Reese's. The company attributes the change to a global cocoa shortage driven by adverse weather and disease in West Africa, which has caused commodity prices to skyrocket. In response, Hershey also plans to focus on developing products that are less cocoa-intensive as part of its strategy to become a broader "snacking powerhouse."</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Trump administration is systematically removing women from the highest ranks of the U.S. military, citing the recent reassignment of the Naval Academy's first female superintendent. The author connects this to a pattern of firings of other high-ranking female officers and the public statements of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who has expressed views that women are a distraction in the military. The piece contends these actions send a chilling message that women are not welcome in leadership, reversing decades of progress and potentially harming military recruitment.</p>

The shift is also impacting community life, with the local primary school's enrollment down 29%. While the tourism industry supports over 40,000 jobs in the city, some residents feel the area no longer serves the people who live there, creating a challenging balance for city officials.</p>
