The State Department described this potential action as a "direct and grave" violation of the current ceasefire agreement, which could undermine recent mediation efforts. Hamas has denied the allegations, accusing Israel of supporting rival armed factions. This development occurs as Hamas attempts to reassert control in Gaza following a partial Israeli withdrawal.</p>

          <p>New media reports allege that Prince Andrew sought to obtain personal information about his accuser, Virginia Giuffre, using his police protection detail in 2011. These claims surface as King Charles faces increasing pressure to strip Andrew of his "prince" title, following Andrew's decision to relinquish his other titles. Ms. Giuffre, who alleged she was sexually exploited by Jeffrey Epstein's circle, claimed she was forced to have sex with the prince on three occasions. Prince Andrew has consistently denied all allegations against him.</p>

          <p>Several major companies, including Accenture and Lufthansa, have recently announced significant job cuts, publicly attributing the restructuring to the integration of artificial intelligence. However, some experts and critics argue that AI is being used as a "good excuse" to conceal other business challenges, such as overhiring during the pandemic or a general economic slowdown. Research from institutions like Yale University suggests that AI has not yet caused widespread labor disruption, with many firms using the technology to retrain existing employees rather than replace them.</p>

          <p>A BBC Scotland investigation using secret filming has helped expose a £28 million "bait-and-switch" timeshare fraud, resulting in the conviction of 14 people. The scheme, run by the company Sell My Timeshare (SMT), targeted over 3,500 mostly elderly timeshare owners who were desperate to exit their contracts. Victims were subjected to high-pressure sales tactics, losing significant sums of money for useless fake "credits" while remaining locked into their expensive contracts. The investigation, which began nine years ago, was crucial for the police case against the fraudsters.</p>

          <p>Betfred's co-founder, Fred Done, has stated that a significant hike in gambling taxes could force the closure of all 1,287 of the company's high street shops, placing 7,500 jobs at risk. The warning comes as UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves considers increasing taxes on the sector, a move suggested to help fund reductions in child poverty. Done argues that any substantial increase would eliminate profitability, pushing bettors towards untaxed offshore companies and further damaging the UK's struggling high streets.

          <p>North Korea is actively pursuing stronger relationships with Southeast Asian nations, highlighted by recent high-level visits from Vietnamese and Laotian leaders to Pyongyang. During celebrations for the 80th anniversary of its ruling party, North Korea and Vietnam agreed to boost cooperation in defense and healthcare. Experts suggest these diplomatic efforts provide legitimacy for the heavily-sanctioned North Korean regime and may serve as corridors for bypassing international sanctions. While Vietnam and Laos share similar political ideologies with North Korea, their economic systems differ significantly.</p>

          <p>Over the past four decades, China has made significant progress in combating desertification in the Ningxia region through the Baijitan National Nature Reserve project. The initiative has successfully pushed back the encroaching Mu Us Desert by more than 20 kilometers, protecting the regional capital of Yinchuan and the crucial Yellow River. Through extensive sand control and afforestation efforts, the project has stabilized vast areas of drifting sands. This environmental effort has effectively reversed the desert's expansion, which once threatened local agriculture and livelihoods.</p>

The accusation follows President Donald Trump's announcement that the U.S. had struck a "drug-carrying submarine," killing two people.

The event featured executives from GM, Ford, and Stellantis, and Musk's exclusion was widely seen as a nod to the United Auto Workers, as Tesla's workforce is not unionized. Harris argues that presidents should set aside political loyalties to recognize major technological innovation and believes the snub alienated Musk, who later became a significant financial backer for Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>Psychologists and sexologists are exploring why sexual frequency often decreases in long-term relationships, a common experience for many couples. Research indicates that after the initial passionate phase driven by certain hormones, bonding hormones like oxytocin become more dominant, which can dampen sex drive. Experts emphasize that open communication about sexual needs and satisfaction is crucial for maintaining intimacy. Studies also highlight a "gender orgasm gap" and note that unmet sexual needs, particularly for women, can lead to lower desire over time.</p>

          <p>Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the opposition Japan Innovation Party have reportedly agreed to form a coalition, which would make LDP leader Sanae Takaichi the country's first female prime minister. According to local media, the agreement is set to be formalized, allowing Ishin lawmakers to vote for Takaichi in the upcoming parliamentary election. Takaichi's initial path to the premiership was complicated when the LDP's long-standing coalition with the Komeito party collapsed. This new alliance appears to have secured her position.</p>

          <h2>USC's Playoff Aspirations Suffer Setback After Loss to Notre Dame</h2>

          <p>The 20th-ranked USC Trojans' hopes for a College Football Playoff spot were significantly damaged after a 34-24 road loss to the 13th-ranked Notre Dame. The game, played in a heavy downpour, saw USC's defense struggle, giving up over 300 rushing yards. Critical errors, including a costly fumble on a trick play and two failed fourth-down conversions, hampered the Trojans' efforts. Coach Lincoln Riley took responsibility for several "stupid" play calls that put his team in poor positions to succeed.</p>

          <p>UCLA quarterback Nico Iamaleava overcame a late-game knee injury to lead his team to a dramatic 20-17 comeback win against Maryland. After briefly leaving the field, Iamaleava returned to orchestrate a game-winning drive in the final 35 seconds. A key 35-yard run by reserve running back Anthony Frias II set up a 23-yard field goal with just two seconds remaining. The victory marks the Bruins' third consecutive win, continuing an impressive midseason turnaround under interim coach Tim Skipper.</p>
