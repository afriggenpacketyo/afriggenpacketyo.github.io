          <p>Amazon's shares declined after the company announced a weaker-than-expected operating income forecast for the upcoming quarter, overshadowing its strong second-quarter results. The tech giant surpassed analyst predictions for both earnings per share and overall revenue, with its Amazon Web Services and advertising divisions also beating estimates. However, the cautious guidance for future profits triggered a negative reaction in the market, highlighting investor concerns about short-term profitability despite the company's robust sales growth and market dominance.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have determined that the modern potato originated from the hybridization of an ancient tomato species and a non-tuber-producing wild potato from Chile around nine million years ago. A study published in the journal Cell explains that a key gene from the tomato ancestor enabled the development of starch-rich tubers. This genetic mixing provided the necessary components for the potato to form its characteristic underground stems. The discovery resolves a long-standing puzzle about the popular vegetable's lineage and demonstrates how interspecies breeding can drive the evolution of new traits.</p>

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein who died by suicide, has expressed shock over President Trump's recent comments. Trump stated that Epstein had "stolen" Giuffre from his Mar-a-Lago club, a remark the family found startling and which raised questions about what the president knew of Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell's activities. In their statement, the family demanded answers, emphasizing that survivors of sexual exploitation deserve the truth. The White House responded by noting Trump was answering a reporter's question and had previously banned Epstein from his club.</p>

          <p>Shares for Meta and Microsoft saw significant gains after both tech giants reported earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, largely fueled by their substantial investments in artificial intelligence. The companies announced plans to continue their high levels of capital expenditure on AI infrastructure, with Meta raising its spending forecast and Microsoft projecting figures well above estimates. Analysts view this spending boom as beneficial for chipmakers like AMD and Broadcom. While some experts expressed slight apprehension about the scale of Meta's spending, the overall market reaction was strongly positive. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite a net loss, Roblox raised its bookings guidance for the next quarter, signaling confidence in its continued expansion. The strong performance is attributed to strategic investments in infrastructure and the platform's virtual economy, which supports its creator ecosystem. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, Jonathan Turley asserts that the narrative of Donald Trump's collusion with Russia was a political fabrication orchestrated by the Hillary Clinton campaign and facilitated by complicit government officials and media outlets. The author claims that newly declassified documents reveal a deliberate plan to create a false story to distract from other issues and undermine the Trump administration. The article frames the entire affair as a three-part illusion designed to fool the American public, suggesting the full extent of the alleged deception is only now being revealed. This piece reflects a highly partisan viewpoint on the origins of the investigation.</p>

          <p>The modern struggle with information overload and the battle for our focus, often called the attention economy, has deep historical roots. This article traces the phenomenon back to the rise of cheap, daily newspapers in the 19th century, which created the first mass market for constant novelty and sensation. Figures like Henry David Thoreau expressed concerns about the mental effects of this media consumption, anxieties that have echoed with the arrival of each new technology, from radio to AI. The analysis suggests that while society has adapted before, the current technological landscape presents unique challenges to intellectual and emotional well-being.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is proceeding with a plan to construct a 90,000-square-foot ballroom on the White House grounds, a project President Trump has envisioned for over a decade. The estimated $200 million cost will reportedly be covered by Trump and other private donors, with construction set to begin in September. The new venue, which will replace the current East Wing, is designed to host 650 guests for seated events, a significant increase from the East Room's capacity. For years, Trump has criticized the use of tents for large functions like state dinners.</p>

          <p>United Talent Agency (UTA) and Michael Kassan, the founder of MediaLink, have agreed to drop their respective lawsuits against each other, bringing an end to their public legal dispute. The conflict arose from UTA's $125 million acquisition of Kassan's advisory firm in 2021, with both sides later accusing the other of breaching their contract. UTA had alleged excessive spending by Kassan, while Kassan claimed UTA failed to honor the terms of the deal. The parties announced the amicable resolution in a joint statement but did not disclose the terms of the agreement.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review of research covering nearly 14.5 million students has found that prolonged exposure to heat significantly damages students' cognitive abilities and academic performance. The study, published in PLOS Climate, shows a clear correlation between higher temperatures and lower scores in complex subjects like mathematics. The effects are disproportionately worse for students from lower-income families and minority groups, who often lack access to air conditioning. Researchers warn that as global temperatures rise, these educational disparities will likely grow, hindering the success of future generations without adaptive measures.</p>

          <p>In response to proposed U.S. tariffs on European-made goods, wealthy American buyers of large yachts are expected to use a strategy known as "foreign flagging" to avoid the 15% tax. By registering their multimillion-dollar vessels in countries like the Cayman Islands or Malta, owners can enter U.S. waters as a visiting vessel, thereby bypassing import duties. While this workaround is common for superyachts, smaller boat owners will likely have to absorb the cost. The tariffs are causing uncertainty in the industry, which relies heavily on European shipyards and American buyers. (not investment advice)</p>
