          <p>The Trump administration is reviewing Harvard University's federally funded research programs, threatening to revoke valuable patents under the Bayh-Dole Act. This action is widely viewed as retaliation for the university's handling of pro-Palestinian campus protests, which the administration has labeled as antisemitic. The move escalates a conflict that has already seen the White House freeze federal research funds, prompting a lawsuit from Harvard to protect its academic and financial interests.</p>

          <p>The rapidly growing market for "functional beverages" that promise stress relief and other health benefits is facing increased scrutiny from nutritionists and dietitians. Experts argue that the minimal amounts of supplements like Lion's Mane and Ashwagandha in these drinks are unlikely to produce significant physiological effects. Psychologists suggest any perceived calming benefits may stem from a placebo effect, created by the ritual of taking a personal moment rather than the ingredients themselves.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested Josue Santiago Perez Gomez, an undocumented immigrant from Guatemala, shortly after he was released by Rhode Island authorities. Perez Gomez faces multiple charges related to child sex crimes, and ICE had issued an immigration detainer that local police reportedly did not honor. ICE officials criticized the local decision to release him, stating he posed a threat and will now remain in federal custody pending removal proceedings.</p>

These remarks underscore Kyiv's deep concerns about being marginalized in direct talks between Washington and Moscow, particularly after Trump suggested a deal could involve "swapping of territories."</p>

          <p>Emma Raducanu began her Cincinnati Open campaign with a decisive 6-3, 6-2 victory against Serbia's Olga Danilovic, marking a successful start with her new coach, Francisco Roig. Despite a slow beginning in the intense heat, Raducanu's strong defense and effective returns allowed her to capitalize on her opponent's errors and secure the win. This result continues her consistent performance against lower-ranked players and sets up a more challenging third-round match against a top-seeded opponent.</p>

          <p>The UK government has unveiled new plans that would permit the immediate deportation of foreign nationals upon receiving a fixed-term prison sentence. According to the proposal, these criminals would be removed from the UK and barred from re-entry, leaving their home countries to decide whether they serve any remaining prison time. The government claims this will save money and enhance public safety, but critics raise concerns that some nations may refuse to accept the deported individuals.</p>

          <p>Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah has publicly criticized UEFA for a social media tribute to Palestinian footballer Suleiman al-Obeid that failed to mention how he died. The Palestinian Football Association had reported that al-Obeid was killed in an Israeli attack while awaiting humanitarian aid in Gaza. In response to UEFA's post, which praised him as a "talent who gave hope," Salah pointedly asked, "Can you tell us how he died, where, and why?", highlighting the politically sanitized nature of the message.</p>

The mass arrests were labeled "deeply concerning" by Amnesty International, while the government maintained the ban is a necessary national security measure.</p>

          <p>The abrupt dismissal of IRS Commissioner Billy Long was reportedly preceded by a significant clash with the White House over a demand for confidential taxpayer data. The administration sought to use IRS records to help locate undocumented immigrants, but the agency refused to share the information, citing taxpayer privacy laws and its limited ability to verify the data. This conflict highlights concerns about political pressure on federal agencies and the potential misuse of sensitive personal information for immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Despite an incredible unbeaten 86 runs from just 50 balls by Jonny Bairstow, the Welsh Fire fell short in a tense eight-run loss to the London Spirit in The Hundred cricket competition. Bairstow's late-game assault, which included back-to-back sixes, brought his team tantalizingly close to their target. However, an earlier top-order collapse proved too much to overcome, as the Spirit's total of 163-5, anchored by David Warner's 70 runs, was enough to secure the victory.</p>
