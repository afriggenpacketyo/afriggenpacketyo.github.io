          <p>The United States and China report substantial progress in trade talks held in Geneva, leading to the establishment of an economic and trade consultation mechanism. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the discussions as productive, while China's Vice Premier He Lifeng emphasized their significance for global economic stability. The agreement aims to de-escalate the trade war initiated by President Trump's tariffs, which had caused market turmoil. While details are pending a joint statement, the development signals a potential easing of tensions between the world's two largest economies, though some analysts caution that tariff reductions need to be significant to have a real impact.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have unveiled a proposal to cut at least $880 billion from Medicaid, aiming to offset the cost of tax breaks. Democrats are criticizing the move, warning that millions could lose healthcare coverage. The plan includes new work requirements for Medicaid eligibility and stricter verification processes. Preliminary estimates suggest that 8.6 million people could lose healthcare coverage over the next decade. The cuts are part of a broader effort to achieve $1.5 trillion in savings to preserve the 2017 tax cuts, setting the stage for a major political battle over healthcare.</p>

          <p>A major power outage affecting Spain, Portugal, and southern France has sparked a debate about the role of renewable energy sources in maintaining grid stability. The blackout, which impacted millions and disrupted essential services, has led to investigations into its cause. While some have suggested that the region's reliance on wind and solar power may have contributed to the outage, Spanish authorities and grid operators deny that renewable energy was at fault. The incident highlights the ongoing challenges of integrating high levels of intermittent renewable energy into national grids while ensuring reliable power supply.</p>

          <p>Despite being detained in The Hague, former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is a candidate in the country's midterm elections, running for mayor of Davao City. Under Philippine law, candidates facing criminal charges can run for office unless convicted. The elections are seen as a key test for the Duterte family's political power, particularly concerning Vice President Sara Duterte, who faces impeachment. The outcome of the elections could significantly impact the political landscape and the 2028 presidential race.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have released a proposal that would cause millions of poor Americans to lose Medicaid health coverage and millions more to pay higher fees when they go to the doctor. The plan would reduce federal spending by an estimated $912 billion over the decade and cause 8.6 million people to become uninsured, according to a partial analysis from the Congressional Budget Office. The legislation would require co-payments of $35 for many medical services. Democrats in Congress immediately assailed the package as an attack on health coverage for vulnerable populations.</p>

The project aims to restore the elk's role in optimizing wetland habitats and engaging the public with the idea of their return.</p>

          <p>Bridgend Council is under scrutiny for a PowerPoint presentation, intended for use in schools, that appeared to endorse strangulation during sex. The presentation included the phrase, "It is never OK to start choking someone without asking them first." The council claims the slide was part of a draft version that was never shown to children and was removed after feedback. Critics question why the council deemed it appropriate to include an illegal act in any draft of the presentation.</p>

          <p>Serbia is witnessing a significant student-led protest movement challenging the country's increasingly autocratic president, Aleksandar Vucic. Sparked by a train station collapse that killed 16 people, the protests have grown into a widespread movement demanding accountability and change. The government's attempts to quell the protests have been unsuccessful, with a massive demonstration in March drawing close to half a million people. Despite facing intimidation and challenges, protesters are advocating for early elections and setting an example of solidarity and horizontal decision-making.</p>

Negotiations are ongoing, with reports suggesting growing frustration within the Trump administration regarding Netanyahu's position.

          <p>House Republicans unveiled a plan to cut $880 billion from Medicaid, which Democrats warn will leave millions without care. Republicans insist they are rooting out waste, fraud and abuse, but Democrats say the cuts amount to another attempt to repeal Obamacare. A preliminary estimate from the Congressional Budget Office said the proposals would reduce the number of people with health care by 8.6 million over the decade. The bill includes new community engagement requirements of at least 80 hours per month of work, education or service for able-bodied adults without dependents.</p>
