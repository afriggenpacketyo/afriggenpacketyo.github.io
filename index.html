          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion purchase of Hess Corporation, securing access to valuable oil reserves in Guyana. The deal proceeded after an International Chamber of Commerce ruling defeated a challenge from Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the region's Stabroek Block. While the acquisition is a major strategic win for Chevron, the company anticipates some headcount reductions as it integrates Hess's operations, continuing its recent trend of workforce consolidation to improve efficiency.</p>

          <p>In an economy marked by persistent inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) present a secure savings option with returns currently outpacing the inflation rate. This article highlights that while national average yields are modest, top online banks offer significantly higher rates, particularly for short-term CDs. Savers can lock in these high rates for a fixed term, benefiting from FDIC or NCUA insurance up to $250,000, making CDs a powerful tool for preserving and growing purchasing power.

          <p>For prospective homebuyers and those considering refinancing, current mortgage rates remain a significant factor amid a challenging housing market. As of mid-July 2025, average rates for 30-year mortgages hover around 6.70%, with 15-year loans offering slightly lower rates. The article suggests that while rates are higher than in previous years, borrowers with strong credit profiles can still secure favorable terms by shopping around, and there is cautious optimism that rates may stabilize if the Federal Reserve pauses its rate hikes.

          <p>President Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to request the court-approved release of grand jury testimony related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. This move follows public pressure and dissatisfaction from some of the president's own supporters with a recent Justice Department memo that stated Epstein died by suicide and did not possess an incriminating "client list." The unusual request requires judicial approval, which could be a lengthy process involving potential objections from individuals named in the testimony.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a funding package that cuts $9 billion from federal spending, primarily targeting foreign assistance programs and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The legislation, demanded by President Trump, passed on a near party-line vote of 216-213 and now heads to the president's desk to be signed into law. The vote followed earlier Senate changes that protected funding for some global health and food programs, which placated some Republicans who had previously opposed the bill.

          <p>The Supreme Court has lifted an injunction, permitting the Trump administration's layoffs of approximately 1,400 Department of Education staffers to remain in effect. The decision reverses a lower court's ruling that had blocked the staff reduction, which is part of a broader effort to downsize the agency. Education and consumer advocates have expressed concern that the reduced staffing could hinder the department's ability to manage federal student aid programs, potentially causing delays and support issues for millions of borrowers.

          <p>This article explores the profound ethical questions facing engineers and researchers in the field of artificial intelligence, where staggering financial rewards are juxtaposed with significant societal risks. While AI offers potential for immense good, there are growing concerns about its misuse, the creation of dangerously deceptive AI agents, and the potential for catastrophic outcomes. The author argues that working at a frontier AI lab is ethically questionable unless one has a clear, defensible plan to mitigate these risks, as the immense financial incentives often overshadow safety.</p>

Shapps justified the use of a super-injunction to block reporting, arguing it was necessary to prevent the information from spreading and leading to individuals being "pursued, murdered and executed."</p>

The piece posits that while personal prejudice exists everywhere, structural racism wielded by those in power poses a far greater danger, and Mamdani's rise offers a chance to challenge these harmful stereotypes.</p>
