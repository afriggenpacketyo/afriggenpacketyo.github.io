          <h2>Analyst Questions Apple's iPhone Assembly Shift to India</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-26 14:05:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Craig Moffett, a leading analyst, casts doubt on Apple's plan to move iPhone assembly to India, suggesting it won't effectively reduce costs tied to tariffs since components still originate from China. He argues that diversifying to India isn't straightforward, as Apple's supply chain would remain anchored in China and could face resistance. Moffett also anticipates backlash against Apple in China due to U.S. tariffs, potentially impacting iPhone sales, and notes carriers are unwilling to absorb tariff costs, which could decrease consumer demand. Moffett maintains a "sell" rating on Apple, citing valuation concerns amid a potential global trade war. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A New York Times/Siena College poll reveals that voters are concerned about President Trump's expansive use of executive power and have doubts about his agenda. Majorities view the early months of his administration as "chaotic" and "scary," even among those who approve of his job performance. Voters express declining confidence in Trump's handling of key issues like the economy and immigration, despite widespread support for deportations. His approval rating stands at 42%, reflecting his persistent unpopularity, though he remains capable of winning battleground states.</p>

Her legal battle against Prince Andrew brought significant public attention to the issue. Despite the out-of-court settlement with Prince Andrew, she has been hailed as an unflinching campaigner for survivors of sexual assault, who took on the wealthy and the powerful during the course of her life.</p>
