          <p>Jasveen Sangha, dubbed the "Ketamine Queen," has agreed to plead guilty to five federal charges for supplying the ketamine that led to actor Matthew Perry's death in 2023. She is one of five individuals charged in the case, which includes two doctors and Perry's personal assistant, who allegedly administered the drug. Sangha's plea agreement also acknowledges her role in another fatal overdose in 2019 and details a history of drug trafficking from her North Hollywood residence. She now faces a statutory maximum sentence of several decades in federal prison upon her formal plea.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article presents a critical perspective on the generative AI boom, arguing it has become a form of mass delusion driven by Silicon Valley's exaggerated promises of superintelligence. The author points to bizarre applications, like reanimating a deceased teenager for a gun control campaign, as evidence of a hastily accepted and bloodless future. The piece contends that the constant hype creates widespread anxiety about job loss and a sense of psychosis, while the technology itself may never deliver on its grandest claims. The true risk, the author suggests, is that society reorients its economy and culture around a technology that ultimately proves to be just 'good enough' to be disruptive but not revolutionary.</p>

          <p>The two-time defending champions, Oval Invincibles, solidified their position at the top of the men's Hundred cricket league table with a decisive seven-wicket victory against the Southern Brave. The team's bowlers were instrumental, dismissing the Brave for 133, with notable performances from Jason Behrendorff and Rashid Khan. In the chase, a powerful partnership between Jordan Cox and Sam Curran, who both scored half-centuries, guided the Invincibles to victory with 11 balls remaining. This win places them four points clear, making them strong contenders to secure a spot in the final stages of the tournament.</p>

          <p>Recently released police documents in the Idaho student murders case show that Bryan Kohberger once expressed support for the death penalty during a university class discussion. According to a classmate's interview with police, Kohberger stated that a victim's family should have a say in whether capital punishment is imposed. This revelation contrasts with his eventual decision to accept a plea deal, resulting in four life sentences to avoid the death penalty. The plea deal has caused a split among the victims' families, with some expressing relief and closure while others feel that justice was not fully served.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds American Wages Have Not Kept Pace with Inflation Over Past Four Years</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 17:00:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study by Bankrate reveals that American wages have failed to keep up with inflation since the pandemic, with average earnings lagging 1.2 percentage points behind the rise in living costs. This gap contributes to widespread economic dissatisfaction, as many households struggle with diminished purchasing power. The report highlights that educators have experienced the most significant wage gap, while professions in leisure, hospitality, and healthcare have seen pay growth outpace inflation due to high demand. This analysis suggests that financial strain continues to affect many Americans, hindering their ability to save for emergencies or long-term goals. (not investment advice)</p>

The union, CUPE, stated its 10,000 members will remain on strike, with its president expressing a willingness to face penalties, including jail time. The work stoppage, which began over disputes regarding pay and working conditions, has already caused the cancellation of hundreds of flights, affecting over 130,000 travelers daily during the peak summer season. Air Canada's operations remain suspended as the standoff between the airline and the union continues.</p>

          <p>City officials in Anaheim, California, have issued a public warning about what they describe as the "most significant and disruptive federal enforcement" actions in weeks, following a series of immigration raids. The city has seen increased activity since a federal judge blocked agents from using racial profiling for random arrests. Recent incidents, including one at a local car wash and another outside a Home Depot, have heightened fear and uncertainty within the community. Anaheim, which has a large immigrant population, has condemned the federal actions, arguing they destabilize families and the local economy without enhancing public safety.</p>

          <p>A source within Hamas has indicated that the group has agreed to the latest ceasefire proposal presented by Egyptian and Qatari mediators. The deal is reportedly based on a framework that includes an initial 60-day truce, during which Hamas would release approximately half of the remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The proposal also involves negotiations for a permanent ceasefire to end the 22-month war. Israel's response remains uncertain, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously insisted on the release of all hostages at once, while intense Israeli military operations continue in Gaza City.</p>

          <p>This article examines whether debts from 'buy now, pay later' (BNPL) services like Klarna and Afterpay can be included in debt forgiveness programs. As unsecured debts, BNPL plans are technically eligible for negotiation and settlement by debt relief companies, similar to credit card debt. However, the process is complicated by the novelty of these services, as many debt relief firms may not have established relationships with BNPL providers. The article suggests that direct negotiation with the provider, debt consolidation, or credit counseling may be more effective strategies for consumers struggling to manage these increasingly popular, yet potentially risky, payment plans.

          <p>The organizers of the Polari Prize, a prominent UK-based award for LGBTQ+ literature, have canceled this year's event following significant controversy. The backlash began after author John Boyne was longlisted for his novel, which came shortly after he wrote an article defending J.K. Rowling's views on trans issues. In response, numerous other nominated authors withdrew from consideration, a judge resigned, and over 800 publishing figures signed an open letter criticizing Boyne's inclusion. Organizers stated the intended celebration was "overshadowed by hurt and anger" and have paused the prize to review their governance and increase trans representation on judging panels.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has pledged to issue an executive order to change U.S. election procedures, including eliminating mail-in voting and voting machines, but constitutional experts note he lacks the authority to do so. The U.S. Constitution grants states the power to determine the "time, place and manner" of elections, with Congress having the ability to alter rules for federal elections, but the president has no specified role. Trump's assertions, based on repeatedly debunked claims of widespread fraud, represent an escalation of his rhetoric and signal an intent to influence the 2026 midterm elections, despite previous court rulings that have blocked similar executive actions.</p>

          <p>As U.S. tariffs on imported goods take effect, a specific accounting practice known as the retail inventory method (RIM) could temporarily distort the reported profitability of major retailers. Used by companies like Walmart and Target, RIM relies on an average cost-to-retail price ratio, which is slower to reflect sudden cost increases from tariffs compared to cost accounting. This can initially make gross margins appear stronger than they actually are, masking the immediate financial hit. Experts note this discrepancy between operational reality and financial reporting can complicate how retailers navigate and communicate the impact of trade policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has revoked more than 6,000 visas for international students due to violations of U.S. law, including overstays and criminal offenses. The department cited assault, DUIs, and burglary as common violations, and also included "support for terrorism" as a reason for about 200-300 revocations. This action is part of the Trump administration's broader crackdown on immigration and its increased scrutiny of international students, which now includes enhanced social media vetting. Critics, including Democratic lawmakers, have raised concerns that these measures are an attack on due process and academic freedom.</p>

          <p>The musical "& Juliet" offers a vibrant and empowering revision of Shakespeare's classic tragedy, built around the hit songs of producer Max Martin. The show's premise has Shakespeare's wife, Anne, intervening to prevent Juliet's suicide, sending the heroine on a journey of self-discovery in Paris. This review praises the production for its witty book by David West Read and its euphoric, dance-party atmosphere, which successfully integrates pop anthems from artists like Britney Spears and Katy Perry. The result is a feel-good spectacle that transforms the original story into a celebration of second chances and female agency.</p>

          <h2>A Guide to Age Considerations When Purchasing Annuities for Retirement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 15:24:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores whether age limits affect the ability to purchase annuities, a popular retirement income tool. While there are no federal age caps, most insurance companies impose their own limits, typically between 80 and 85 years old, primarily to manage risk related to life expectancy. The best age to buy an annuity depends on individual financial strategy rather than a specific number. Purchasing in one's late 50s or 60s allows for growth in deferred annuities, while buying an immediate annuity closer to retirement age can supplement Social Security, with older buyers often receiving higher monthly payouts.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors have started their closing arguments in the landmark national security trial of 77-year-old pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai in Hong Kong. Lai, who founded the now-shuttered Apple Daily tabloid, has pleaded not guilty to charges of colluding with foreign forces and sedition, which could result in a life sentence. Authorities accuse him of using his newspaper to advocate for international sanctions against China and Hong Kong. The trial, which began in December 2023, is being closely watched internationally as a key indicator of the state of press freedom and judicial independence in the city.</p>

          <p>Hollie Strano, a former longtime meteorologist for WKYC-TV in Cleveland, has started a new role providing morning weather forecasts for Mix 94.1, a radio station in Canton, Ohio. Strano's departure from WKYC in 2024 came after 22 years with the station, following a charge for operating a vehicle under the influence. She has since filed a lawsuit against her former employer, alleging her termination was related to her decision to publicly share her journey of recovery from alcoholism. In addition to her new radio gig, Strano also hosts a podcast and provides forecasts for stations in Georgia and Alabama.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the Trump administration's recent emphasis on enforcing the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act against wind energy projects. While wind turbines do pose a threat to eagles, the author argues that this newfound concern is a pretext for undermining renewable energy, a frequent target of President Trump. The piece points out the hypocrisy, noting that the administration has simultaneously worked to weaken broader environmental protections for migratory birds and endangered species to benefit the oil and gas industry. It concludes that far greater threats to birds, including climate change, are being exacerbated by the administration's own policies.</p>

          <p>After a two-week standoff, Democratic members of the Texas House of Representatives have returned to the state capitol, ending a quorum break that had paralyzed the legislature. The lawmakers left the state to block a Republican-led effort to redraw U.S. House district maps in a way that would significantly favor the GOP in the 2026 midterm elections. With their return, the Republican majority can now resume business, and the controversial redistricting bill is expected to move forward in committee. The fight has drawn national attention, prompting Democrats in states like California to consider their own mid-decade redistricting plans in response.</p>

          <p>A reserve police officer in Old Orchard Beach, Maine, who was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), has agreed to voluntarily leave the country. The officer, Jon Luke Evans of Jamaica, was arrested in July as part of increased immigration enforcement actions. The arrest created a dispute between local officials and federal authorities, as the police department stated it had used the federal E-Verify system and was told Evans was legally authorized to work. ICE confirmed that a judge has granted the voluntary departure, allowing the officer to leave the U.S.</p>

          <p>Reflecting the influence of internet culture on language, the Cambridge Dictionary has added thousands of new words, including popular slang terms like "skibidi," "delulu," and "tradwife." "Delulu," short for delusional, describes believing things that are not true, while "skibidi" is a versatile, often nonsensical word popularized by a YouTube series. These additions are part of a larger update of over 6,000 words that lexicographers believe will have lasting power in the English language. The new entries highlight how social media, celebrities, and online trends are rapidly shaping modern vocabulary.</p>
