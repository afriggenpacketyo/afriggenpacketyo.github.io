          <h2>Musk Scales Back Government Role After Tesla Profit Decline</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 05:16:40 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk has committed to reducing his involvement in the U.S. government's Department for Government Efficiency (Doge) following a significant drop in Tesla's profits and car sales. Musk's role in Doge, which began last year, has faced criticism for diverting his attention from Tesla, leading to protests and boycotts. Tesla reported a 20% decrease in car sales and a 70% profit decline for the first three months of the year, citing "changing political sentiment" as a potential factor. Despite scaling back his Doge commitments, Musk intends to remain involved in the Trump administration to some extent, deeming the work "critical".</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>BP shares experienced a notable increase after activist investor Elliott Management revealed a stake exceeding 5% in the oil major. Elliott's investment is anticipated to exert pressure on BP to reconsider its green strategy and refocus on its core oil and gas operations. BP had previously announced plans to increase fossil fuel investments to $10 billion through 2027, reversing its earlier commitment to emissions reduction. The company's shift in strategy and the activist investor's involvement have led to reduced support for BP's CEO and outgoing Chair during board re-election votes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government faces increasing financial pressure as borrowing exceeded expectations, reaching Â£151.9bn, ahead of the full impact of US tariffs. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is pursuing a trade deal with the US to mitigate the effects of these tariffs on UK exports. The IMF has lowered its growth forecast for the UK, citing tariffs, rising inflation, and borrowing costs as contributing factors. Increased government spending on pay and benefits contributed to the higher borrowing figures, with debt interest payments also rising.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has seemingly softened his stance on both China and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell after recent disagreements. Trump stated he has "no intention of firing" Powell, although he still desires lower interest rates, and expressed optimism regarding improved trade relations with China. While acknowledging the tariffs on Chinese imports would decrease, he indicated they would not be eliminated entirely. Trump's administration aims to encourage the return of factories and jobs to the U.S. through tariffs and interest rate cuts.</p>

          <p>Travis Hunter, a Heisman Trophy winner, seeks to play both offense and defense full-time in the NFL, a feat rarely achieved in modern professional football. Hunter dominated at both cornerback and receiver in college, leading to discussions about how teams will utilize his unique skillset. Some believe splitting time will limit his potential, while Hunter insists on playing both ways, citing his love for being on the field. The decision presents challenges for teams, including managing his practice time, injury risk, and determining his optimal value on either side of the ball.</p>

Aluko faced threats and abuse on social media following Barton's defamatory posts in January 2024, which included claims about her father and accusations of using the race card. She expresses feeling self-conscious and needing to disguise herself due to the impact of the online abuse.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's initial rise to power inspired right-wing populists globally, but his second term's aggressive trade policies and confrontational stance are now undermining that support. Populist candidates in countries like Canada and Australia, who once embraced Trump's anti-establishment rhetoric, are distancing themselves due to the negative impact of tariffs. The shift is attributed to voters seeking credible leaders who can address the challenges posed by Trump's policies. This decline in Trump's appeal is straining ties with like-minded foreign leaders, who are finding it difficult to navigate the complexities of parliamentary systems and shifting public sentiment.</p>

Lewis Jones had been under investigation for grooming and sexually abusing a vulnerable child since 2020, but the case languished due to workload pressures and a lack of oversight. An internal review revealed a series of errors that left Jones free to abduct and assault the young girl. The judge in the case criticized the police delays, stating that the defendant would not have been at liberty to commit the crime if he had been charged earlier. The Merseyside Police have since implemented changes to improve the management of sexual offense investigations.</p>
