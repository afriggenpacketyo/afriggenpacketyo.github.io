          <p>Young people's passion for live theater is significantly boosting Shanghai's nighttime economy, with many Gen Z residents dedicating a large part of their income to attending multiple weekly shows and related activities. In response, the city government has launched its "Night Economy 2.0" initiative, which aims to support this trend by simplifying the approval process for nighttime cultural events. This strategy is part of a larger effort by Chinese authorities to stimulate domestic consumption and bolster the economy, viewing cultural spending as a vital engine for growth amidst broader economic pressures.</p>

In a joint statement, leaders from the UK, France, Germany, and others stressed that international borders must not be changed by force and that any deal made without Kyiv would be considered illegitimate. This comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has vehemently rejected any territorial concessions, and European nations express deep concern over being excluded from negotiations that are critical to their own security.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's Mohamed Salah has publicly challenged UEFA over its tribute to deceased Palestinian footballer Suleiman al-Obeid, criticizing the organization for not specifying how he died. The Egyptian star's social media post highlighted the omission, as the Palestinian Football Association stated al-Obeid was killed by Israeli forces while waiting for humanitarian aid in Gaza. This incident has amplified the conversation around the conflict within the sports world, with other prominent football figures also speaking out about the dire humanitarian situation and the power of sport to address such issues.</p>

This marks the second fatality from the same event, as another fighter, Shigetoshi Kotari, had passed away just a day earlier from similar injuries, raising serious questions and concerns about fighter safety protocols and medical oversight within the sport.</p>

The piece emphasizes his remarkable character, noting that for his wedding, he requested donations to local charities instead of gifts, embodying a rare combination of humility and gratitude.</p>

          <h2>Robotics Breakthrough Comparable to ChatGPT Could Occur Within Three Years, Says Unitree Founder</h2>

          <p>The founder of Chinese robotics firm Unitree, Wang Xingxing, has predicted that the field of robotics could experience its own "ChatGPT moment" within the next two to three years. He defines this significant breakthrough as the point when a robot can autonomously perform a complex task, such as cleaning a room, in a completely new and unfamiliar environment. While he notes that hardware like dexterous hands is sufficiently advanced, Wang believes the crucial bottleneck is the development of more sophisticated "AI for embodied intelligence," which is currently inadequate for such a leap.</p>

          <p>Officials in Los Angeles are urgently pleading with residents in the Porter Ranch and Granada Hills neighborhoods to cease all non-essential water use, including flushing toilets, during a prolonged service outage. The disruption began when a critical water control valve broke amidst a heatwave, affecting approximately 9,200 households and triggering a boil water advisory. Ongoing efforts to repair the valve and repressurize the system are being severely hampered by continued residential water consumption, which is draining the area's primary water tank faster than crews can refill it.</p>

          <p>Beijing has once again been impacted by deadly floods, marking the fifth major flooding event in northern China since 2012 and raising concerns about increasing climate volatility. The recent storms in late July were notably unusual because they primarily affected the northern districts of the capital city. This geographical focus contrasts sharply with the severe floods of 2016 and 2023, which were concentrated in Beijing's southern areas, suggesting a potential shift in regional weather patterns and highlighting new vulnerabilities for the sprawling metropolis.</p>

The piece serves as a stark warning that these weapons are increasingly being viewed not just as deterrents but as offensive, war-winning tools, pushing the world closer to an unthinkable catastrophe.
