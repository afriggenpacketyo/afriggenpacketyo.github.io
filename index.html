          <p>President Trump has issued letters to 17 major pharmaceutical companies, demanding they take steps to lower U.S. drug prices within the next 60 days. The administration is reviving its "most favored nation" policy, which aims to tie the prices of some medicines in the U.S. to the significantly lower ones abroad. Trump threatened to deploy every available tool to combat what he termed "abusive drug pricing practices" if the companies fail to comply with his goals by the September deadline. The announcement has already caused a drop in the stock prices for several of the named drugmakers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CBS News correspondent Norah O'Donnell is set to release a new book titled "We the Women," which highlights the stories of often-overlooked female pioneers from 1776 to the present day. The book, described as a passion project, was inspired by the lack of female representation in historical education. O'Donnell features figures like Mary Katharine Goddard, whose name is on the Declaration of Independence, and Emily Warren Roebling, who was instrumental in building the Brooklyn Bridge. The book aims to celebrate the grit and courage of these women and is scheduled for release ahead of America's 250th birthday. </p>

          <p>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), a federal agency distributing over $12 billion annually to community health programs, has been severely impacted by Trump administration staffing purges. Since February, approximately a quarter of the agency's workforce has departed, raising concerns about its ability to manage grants for primary care, HIV/AIDS treatment, and rural hospitals. Former agency leaders and health associations warn that the cuts could disrupt essential services for the nation's most vulnerable populations. The reductions are already affecting program oversight and have led to the cancellation of at least one scholarship program for disadvantaged students.</p>

          <p>The chairwoman of the Los Angeles County Republican Party, Roxanne Hoge, has accused California Democrats of fostering a "two-tiered" legal system through pro-sanctuary policies. In an interview with Fox News, Hoge, a legal immigrant herself, argued these policies are designed to exploit immigrants and trap them in a "permanent underclass." She cited recent instances of alleged child labor and accused state leaders of manipulating immigrant communities with scare tactics. Hoge contrasted the current situation with a past era under a Republican mayor, which she described as more prosperous for the city.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As homeowners increasingly tap into their home equity, financial experts are highlighting several costly mistakes to avoid in the current economic climate. One major error is choosing a variable-rate Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) when predictable payments are needed, as interest rates could rise. Another pitfall is borrowing more than necessary, which increases interest payments and financial risk if home values decline or income changes. Homeowners are also advised to carefully scrutinize closing costs and hidden fees, as these can significantly increase the total cost of the loan, even in so-called "no-closing-cost" offers.

Analysts are monitoring key metrics for its e-commerce business, which faces uncertainty from President Trump's trade policies, although some believe Amazon may be gaining market share from Chinese competitors affected by tariffs. Another major focus is the growth of Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud division, where performance has been linked to AI-related capacity constraints. The company has pledged to spend up to $100 billion this year, largely on AI investments for AWS. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is hearing a major legal challenge to President Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose widespread tariffs on U.S. trading partners. During arguments, judges questioned whether the law, which has never before been used for this purpose, grants the president such broad authority to set levies without specific congressional approval. The case was brought by a group of states and small businesses after a lower court ruled against the administration. The outcome of this legal test, which is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court, could significantly impact the president's economic agenda. </p>

          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell reveals that the modern potato evolved from an ancient interbreeding event between a wild potato species and a tomato ancestor approximately 9 million years ago. Researchers analyzed hundreds of genomes and solved the long-standing puzzle of how potatoes developed their starchy tubers. The findings show that the ancient tomato provided a crucial gene that signals the plant to form tubers, while the wild potato ancestor contributed a gene that controls their growth. This discovery illustrates how hybridization between different species can lead to the evolution of entirely new traits and organisms.</p>

The most common method will likely be registering the vessel in a foreign country, such as the Cayman Islands or Malta, which allows it to enter U.S. waters as a visiting vessel without being subject to import duties. While this strategy involves registration fees, the savings on a multi-million dollar yacht would be substantial.

          <p>The S&P 500 turned negative on Thursday after President Trump publicly pressured major drugmakers like Eli Lilly and Bristol Myers Squibb to lower prescription prices, causing their stocks to fall. The broader market was also weighed down by investor caution following the Federal Reserve's decision to hold interest rates steady due to inflation concerns. Despite the downturn, the tech sector showed strength, with Meta and Microsoft rallying after positive earnings reports. Investors are now looking ahead to earnings from Apple and Amazon, as well as the July jobs report for further economic signals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ahead of Apple's third-quarter earnings report, users on the prediction platform Kalshi are placing bets on which key terms will be mentioned during the company's conference call. The platform shows a high probability that executives will discuss "China" and "Tariff," reflecting investor concerns over the company's manufacturing and market position amid U.S.-China trade tensions. President Trump has threatened tariffs on iPhones not made in the U.S., prompting Apple to expand production in countries like India. Analysts predict a challenging quarter for iPhone sales due to macroeconomic pressures and increased competition in the Chinese market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The opening day of the final Test match between England and India was disrupted by rain and a significant injury to England's Chris Woakes. The pace bowler injured his shoulder late in the day, leaving England's already depleted attack with a potential disadvantage in a series they need to avoid losing. Before the injury, England's bowlers had a mixed performance, reducing India to 204-6 in the 64 overs possible. The day's play was marked by erratic bowling and a calamitous run-out of India's captain, leaving the crucial match evenly poised but with major concerns for England's bowling depth.</p>

The plan also includes more personalized customer interactions and new menu items.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A key consumer protection for federally backed reverse mortgages is the "95% rule," which can be crucial for heirs who wish to keep a family home. The rule stipulates that if a homeowner with a reverse mortgage passes away or moves out, their heirs can settle the debt by paying either the full loan balance or 95% of the home's current appraised value, whichever is less. This prevents a situation where the heirs would have to pay more than the property is worth, especially if the loan balance has grown larger than the home's value. This FHA-insured provision offers peace of mind and a predictable path for estate planning. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, rose 2.6% in June from a year ago, up from a 2.4% pace in May. The data indicates that President Trump's tariffs are beginning to push some prices higher, particularly for imported goods like furniture and appliances. This report validates the Federal Reserve's recent decision to hold interest rates steady, as officials remain cautious about whether the tariff impact will be a one-time price adjustment or a more persistent inflationary trend. The figures may also lessen the likelihood of a rate cut at the Fed's next meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>West Ham United midfielder Lucas Paqueta has been cleared of spot-fixing charges by an independent regulatory commission following a nearly two-year investigation by the Football Association. The Brazilian international was accused of deliberately getting booked in four separate matches to improperly influence betting markets and faced a potential lifetime ban if found guilty. While the four main charges were found to be "not proven," the commission did find him guilty on two lesser counts of failing to cooperate with the investigation. Paqueta, who has maintained his innocence, expressed his relief and eagerness to return to playing.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a 90-day extension for reaching a new tariff agreement with Mexico, maintaining the current rates while negotiations continue. In a social media post, Trump stated the extension was due to the complexities of the U.S.-Mexico trade relationship, particularly concerning the border. Under the extension, Mexico will continue to face a 25% tariff on fentanyl and cars, and a 50% tariff on steel, aluminum, and copper. This move comes as a deadline approaches for dozens of other countries to finalize trade deals with the U.S. or face punitive import duties.</p>

Wine distributors and producers warn that they will have to pass the increased costs on to retailers and restaurants, ultimately affecting consumer prices. Trade groups are concerned that the tariffs will reduce demand, hurt thousands of U.S. jobs in related industries, and disproportionately impact restaurants that rely on the high margins from imported wine sales.

          <p>An investigation has found that China is evading U.S. sanctions by secretly purchasing Iranian oil through a network of tankers known as a "dark fleet." These tankers conduct ship-to-ship transfers in international waters, often with their identification transponders turned off to avoid detection. This illicit trade, which primarily occurs off the coast of Malaysia, provides a crucial revenue stream for Iran, generating billions that could potentially fund its nuclear program. Despite multiple rounds of U.S. sanctions targeting this activity, the trade appears to be ramping up, as China does not recognize the unilateral American sanctions.</p>
