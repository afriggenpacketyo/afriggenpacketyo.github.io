University administrators fear reducing their endowments, which are seen as a measure of excellence. Princeton's president has offered a strong defense of academic freedom, contrasting with the conciliatory approaches of other institutions facing similar pressures.</p>

            <p>TikTok Shop is alerting merchants about increased US tariff risks and promoting its European markets after the US tripled tariffs on small parcels from China. The platform is encouraging merchants to expand into European markets like Spain, Germany, Italy, and France. The move comes as a result of the end of the "de minimis" exemption, which previously allowed duty-free entry for goods valued under US$800. This change is prompting Chinese e-commerce exporters to adjust their strategies.</p>

            <p>While the US is concerned about inflation due to President Trump's tariff hikes, China is facing the opposite problem: deepening deflation. The country's overcapacity and potential loss of overseas markets could exacerbate these issues. However, China's efforts to boost domestic demand may help cushion the downward pressure on prices. The increasing US duties on Chinese goods are expected to worsen China's economic challenges.</p>

            <p>Thousands of drug tests conducted in California prisons by Quest Diagnostics are suspected of generating false positive results, potentially jeopardizing parole requests. The issue stemmed from a change in testing reagents, leading to a significant spike in positive opiate tests. State officials have identified thousands of affected patients but have not fully addressed the consequences. Attorneys and experts are calling for a review of medical records and parole board decisions influenced by the inaccurate test results, as some individuals have been denied freedom based on these false positives.</p>

            <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has stated that a recession is the "likely outcome" for the U.S. economy due to President Trump's tariff policies, which are causing turmoil in financial markets. Dimon cited the significant stock market decline as a factor that could lead to reduced consumer spending and economic contraction. JPMorgan economists expect a mild GDP contraction this year. While Dimon previously supported tariffs, he now encourages the U.S. to negotiate trade deals to mitigate the potential damage.</p>

            <p>U.S. crude oil futures have fallen sharply, declining more than 6%, following China's imposition of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. The oil sell-off is driven by concerns that the escalating trade war will trigger a recession, reducing crude oil demand. Additionally, OPEC+ has agreed to accelerate output in May, increasing the supply of oil in an already surplus market. Concerns about the impact of these factors have created a "toxic cocktail" for oil prices.</p>

            <p>President Trump has imposed reciprocal tariffs on imports from approximately 90 nations, citing unfair trade practices and aiming to erase the trade deficit. The tariffs, which took effect on April 9th, range from a baseline 10% to higher specific levies depending on the country. Asian nations face some of the highest rates. Economists warn that these tariffs could lead to inflation and retaliatory measures from other countries, potentially resulting in serious recessions for both the U.S. and its trade partners.</p>
