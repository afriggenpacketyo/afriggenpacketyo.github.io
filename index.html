Backup quarterback Mac Jones, who has led the team to a 3-0 record in his previous starts this season, is expected to take over despite being listed as questionable with an oblique injury.</p>

          <p>OpenAI's rapid expansion and massive investments across the technology landscape are creating a uniquely challenging environment for new startups, unlike previous tech booms. The company's influence extends from foundational data center infrastructure to consumer applications like ChatGPT and Sora, leaving entrepreneurs questioning where viable opportunities remain. Analysts note that OpenAI's private status allows it to spend vast sums without public market scrutiny, accelerating its vertical integration and making it difficult for smaller companies to compete or predict its next move.</p>

          <p>Members of the Scottish National Party (SNP) have formally backed First Minister John Swinney's strategy to pursue another independence referendum. The plan, endorsed at the party's conference, states that winning a majority of Scottish seats in the 2026 Holyrood election will be considered a mandate to negotiate for a new vote. This approach was chosen over an amendment that would have treated the election as a de-facto referendum itself, with Swinney arguing his method is the most realistic path toward achieving independence.</p>

          <p>Jack Wilshere, the 33-year-old former Arsenal and England midfielder, is reportedly the number one choice to become the new manager of Luton Town. He has held talks with the club's board and is considered the frontrunner for the position, which became available after the dismissal of Matt Bloomfield. While a deal has not yet been finalized, Wilshere is in a strong position to land his first major managerial role, having previously served as an interim coach at Norwich.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Australian soccer players are moving to Major League Soccer (MLS), viewing the North American league as a strategic step to advance their international careers. Players like Nashville SC's Patrick Yazbek have found that the high level of competition and visibility in MLS can serve as a springboard to earning a spot on the Socceroos, Australia's national team. This trend challenges the traditional notion that European leagues are the only viable path for aspiring Australian internationals.</p>

He stated that prices would be reduced by figures such as "100 percent, 400 percent, 600 percent, a thousand percent in some cases." A price reduction cannot exceed 100 percent, as that would imply the cost becomes zero or negative. This comment was made while contrasting these supposed future cuts with a much smaller reduction achieved during his first term.</p>

Officials argue the current routes give Chinese carriers an unfair competitive advantage with shorter flight times.
