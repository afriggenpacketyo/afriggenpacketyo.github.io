          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has revealed a new $1.6 billion stake in the embattled health insurer UnitedHealth, a move that surprised markets due to the insurer's recent struggles. The investment, disclosed in a regulatory filing, aligns with Buffett's history of value investing in companies facing temporary difficulties. UnitedHealth's stock, which had been down nearly 50% for the year amid a Justice Department investigation and leadership changes, surged following the news. This acquisition was part of several recent portfolio adjustments by Berkshire, including new stakes in homebuilders and a reduction in its Apple holdings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Labour councillor, Ricky Jones, has been found not guilty of encouraging violent disorder after making controversial remarks at an anti-racism rally. During the event in Walthamstow, Jones called far-right demonstrators "Nazi fascists" and made a throat-cutting gesture, which he later described to police as "ill-advised" but not intended to incite violence. The Dartford councillor, who was suspended by the Labour Party following the incident, was arrested after a video of his speech went viral. A jury at Snaresbrook Crown Court deliberated for only half an hour before reaching the not guilty verdict.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has implemented a new policy allowing Nvidia and AMD to export certain previously restricted AI chips, like the H20, to China, but with a new 15 percent tax on the proceeds. This move has sparked controversy and threats of resignation from some officials, with legal experts questioning its constitutionality under the Export Clause. The decision reverses a previous block on these exports and follows personal appeals from Nvidia's CEO. The policy raises significant questions about its impact on the U.S. competitive edge in AI and whether it will inadvertently bolster Chinese competitors like Huawei.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has announced a $10 million bounty for Juan José Farías Álvarez, also known as "El Abuelo," the leader of Mexico's United Cartels. This action is the culmination of a multi-year investigation that began with a car accident in a small Tennessee town and uncovered a vast drug trafficking network. The Justice Department unsealed indictments against Álvarez and four other high-ranking members, highlighting the cartel's role in distributing drugs across the U.S. and using the profits to fund violence. The case underscores the direct link between violent Mexican cartels and crime within American communities.</p>

          <p>International talks in Geneva aimed at creating a landmark, legally binding treaty to combat plastic pollution have ended in a deadlock. Negotiators from 183 countries failed to reach an agreement after 11 days, primarily due to disagreements over imposing caps on new plastic production. Oil-producing nations and the plastics industry advocated for a focus on waste management and recycling, while around 100 countries pushed for production limits to address the root cause of the crisis. Despite the disappointment, officials from the UN Environment Program stated that significant progress was made and that the process will continue at a later date.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates have seen a significant decline, with the average 30-year fixed rate falling to 6.58%, a substantial drop from the near 8% peak in late 2023.

Experts suggest that individuals with mortgage rates above 6% or 7% could see considerable savings, though they should consider closing costs and how long they plan to stay in their homes. The decrease has already spurred an increase in refinance applications to their highest level in four weeks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Liverpool FC is planning a tribute for former forward Diogo Jota, who tragically died at age 28 in a car crash last month along with his 25-year-old brother. Jota's family is expected to be in attendance at Anfield for the team's opening Premier League game, where a moment of silence will be observed. The tribute will include a fan-led mosaic in the stands and players wearing a 'Forever 20' emblem on their shirts for the season, as the club has retired his number 20 jersey. All Premier League matches this weekend will hold a moment of silence in honor of the late player.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin is intensifying in the eastern Atlantic and is forecast to become the season's first hurricane. With maximum sustained winds reaching 70 mph, just shy of hurricane strength, the storm is projected to continue strengthening and could become a major hurricane by the weekend. The U.S. National Hurricane Center reported that Erin's center is likely to pass near or north of the Leeward Islands over the weekend, though its longer-term path remains uncertain.

Elected officials in cities like Chicago and Baltimore have condemned Trump's claims as "pure lies," pointing to their own local data showing significant drops in crime.

          <h2>Journalists Injured by LAPD Batons During Protest Despite Court Order Restricting Use of Force</h2>

          <p>Several journalists were injured by Los Angeles Police Department officers' batons while covering an immigration protest, less than a month after a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) to protect reporters. The L.A. Press Club and others have now filed a contempt motion, alleging the LAPD violated the court order, which was specifically designed to prevent such incidents. The motion includes evidence of reporters being struck and detained while clearly displaying press credentials. This event is the latest in a series of conflicts over the LAPD's handling of protests and the 1st Amendment rights of the press.</p>

          <p>Federal immigration enforcement raids have intensified at Home Depot locations across Los Angeles, creating a climate of fear among day laborers and the broader Latino community. These renewed operations, some of which have been high-profile like "Operation Trojan House," mark a new phase in the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, despite a court order intended to limit such sweeps. Activists and local officials, including Mayor Karen Bass, accuse federal agents of racial profiling and violating the court's restraining order. Home Depot has become an unwilling epicenter in this conflict, facing pressure to condemn the raids occurring on its properties.</p>

          <p>A retired RAF test pilot, Squadron Leader Robert Burke, has alleged that the 1994 Chinook helicopter crash on the Mull of Kintyre, which killed 29 people, occurred during a "show flight." Burke claims the Mark 2 Chinook was used for the high-profile transport despite known safety concerns from engineers and pilots, in order to demonstrate its airworthiness to the Army. The flight, carrying senior security service members, was a "reckless act" influenced by internal politics. This new allegation adds to the families' long-standing campaign for a new public inquiry into the disaster, whose files are sealed for 100 years.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has formally requested that the prime minister appoint members of his party as peers to the House of Lords. In a letter to Sir Keir Starmer, Farage argued that the current composition of the upper chamber is a "democratic disparity," as his party has no representation despite significant electoral support. He pointed out that other parties with fewer MPs and votes have peers, while Reform UK, with four MPs and millions of votes, does not. A Downing Street spokesperson responded that appointments follow established conventions, while critics noted Farage's previous calls to abolish the chamber.</p>

          <p>The German government has strongly criticized a new plan announced by Israel's far-right Finance Minister to construct 3,400 housing units in a controversial area of the occupied West Bank. A German Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated that the plan violates international law, complicates a two-state solution, and effectively divides Palestinian territory. Germany reiterated its position that it will only recognize border changes agreed upon by both parties to the conflict. The planned construction in the E1 area is particularly contentious as it would hinder the creation of a contiguous Palestinian state, drawing condemnation from the EU and peace organizations as well.</p>

          <p>Aid agencies are raising alarms about a severe hunger crisis in Myanmar's Rakhine State, with the World Food Programme (WFP) warning of a potential "full-blown disaster." The civil war and a military blockade have cut the region off, causing food scarcity and a dramatic rise in prices, leading to deaths by suicide due to starvation. The situation is exacerbated by a 60% drop in WFP funding, forcing aid cuts to the region, which is home to thousands of displaced people, including Rohingya Muslims in long-term camps. Trapped by conflict and stripped of their livelihoods, families are reportedly resorting to desperate measures to survive.</p>

          <p>A research team from Tsinghua University in China has developed a new algorithm that promises to overcome a 40-year-old speed limit in computer science. The breakthrough addresses the "single-source shortest-paths" problem, which involves finding the most efficient route in a network. For decades, the standard method was limited by a necessary sorting step. The new approach, which won a Best Paper Award at a major symposium, bypasses this sorting process by focusing only on the shortest distances between the most critical points, significantly reducing calculation time and offering a more efficient solution to this fundamental challenge.</p>

          <p>Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian in history, has launched a sharp attack on the leadership of USA Swimming, accusing the organization of "weak" stewardship and "poor operational controls." He points to a decline in the U.S. team's medal share since 2016 as evidence of systemic issues and expresses reluctance to let his own children join the program in its current state. Phelps, along with other decorated swimmers like Ryan Lochte, is calling for an independent review and significant changes ahead of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. The criticism highlights a perceived leadership void and structural problems.</p>

          <p>Major League Soccer is facing scrutiny over its fan code of conduct, which bans political displays, leading to confusing and controversial enforcement. Recent incidents, such as the removal of a fan wearing a MAGA hat and the confiscation of anti-ICE banners, have highlighted the policy's ambiguity. The league's rule, which prohibits "electioneering, campaigning or advocating for or against any candidate, political party, legislative issue, or government action," is intended to keep stadiums safe and apolitical. However, critics and fan groups argue that it is inconsistently applied and can stifle expressions of human rights, placing MLS in a difficult position.</p>

Xi stressed that policies from the party's Central Committee must be carried out "without ambiguity, delay, or compromise."

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following President Trump's federal takeover of the Washington D.C. police, questions have arisen about whether he could legally repeat this action in other cities he has criticized for crime. Legal experts suggest it would be far more difficult, as D.C.'s unique status as a federal district grants the president authority he does not have in states. State governors command their own National Guard units, and federal law, like the Posse Comitatus Act, generally prohibits the use of military for domestic law enforcement. While Trump has previously deployed federal agents to cities, his authority to do so is limited and faces legal challenges.</p>
