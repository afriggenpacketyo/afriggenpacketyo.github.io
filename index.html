          <p>Tesla shares experienced a drop following CEO Elon Musk's continued criticism of President Trump's spending bill. Musk has expressed strong opposition to the bill, even threatening primary challenges for lawmakers who support it, marking a shift from his earlier stance. Despite weak sales figures, Tesla shares had previously seen a rally in May, coinciding with Musk's tenure as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk's recent attacks on the bill come after the end of his government service, suggesting a growing rift between him and the Trump administration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has announced a 25 basis point interest rate cut, lowering its inflation expectations due to a stronger euro and reduced energy costs.

Despite the rate cut, ECB President Christine Lagarde acknowledged that the outlook for euro area inflation remains more uncertain than usual, and the ECB left its growth forecast for 2025 unchanged at 0.9%.

          <p>Bin worker strikes in Birmingham may continue until December, as union Unite members voted to prolong industrial action over pay and job disputes.

Unite's general secretary, Sharon Graham, criticized Birmingham council for its handling of the situation and warned that strikes would persist until an acceptable offer is presented.

          <p>The Supreme Court ruled in favor of a straight woman in a job discrimination case, rejecting a requirement that members of majority groups must meet a heightened standard to win such cases. The justices overturned an appeals court decision that had imposed a stricter burden of proof on the plaintiff. This ruling clarifies the legal standards for employment discrimination cases and ensures that all individuals, regardless of their group affiliation, have equal protection under the law.</p>

          <p>According to a New York Times article, the U.S. health secretary has stated that people should have access to experimental therapies, including unregulated uses of stem cells. However, the article cautions that some stem cell treatments have resulted in blindness, tumors, and other injuries. The article highlights the ongoing debate about the balance between patient autonomy and the need for regulatory oversight of experimental medical treatments.</p>

          <p>President Trump's travel ban has been implemented, affecting Chad, Eritrea, Libya, Somalia, and several other African countries. In response, Chad has suspended visas for U.S. citizens. The ban prohibits people from these countries from entering the U.S. and also places travel restrictions on nationals from several other nations. The White House claims the restrictions are necessary to protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors. The ban has faced criticism and is likely to be challenged in court.</p>
