          <p>The Trump administration has indicated it may seek to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to a country other than his native El Salvador if he is released from jail. Abrego Garcia, who was previously deported in what the government called an "administrative error" despite a court order protecting him, was returned to the U.S. only to face federal smuggling charges. His attorneys are now fighting in Maryland federal court for his protection from another removal and his return to Maryland, while legal battles continue over his pre-trial release. The case highlights a complex struggle involving immigration law and criminal charges.</p>

          <p>Democratic Senator Elissa Slotkin of Michigan offered a stark critique of her party, describing it as a "solar system with no sun" due to internal divisions and a failure to work as a team. Speaking at the Center for American Progress, she urged Democrats to refocus on fundamental "pocketbook" issues affecting the middle class, such as job creation, housing affordability, and healthcare costs. Slotkin argued that the party's central split is between those who view the Trump administration as an existential threat and those who see it as survivable. She proposed a new vision centered on economic basics to reconnect with American families.</p>

The action follows the exposure of a massive, long-term bribery scheme at USAID involving a contracting officer who received over $1 million in illicit payments. In a letter, SBA Administrator Kelly Loeffler called the USAID fraud a reflection of "systemic failures" and mandated the audit to prevent similar abuses within the SBA's own programs. The audit will initially focus on high-dollar contracts within the 8(a) business development program to ensure fairness and protect taxpayer funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time since its launch, NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has captured direct images of what is believed to be a previously undiscovered exoplanet. The celestial body, named TWA 7b, orbits a young star and is estimated to be similar in mass to Saturn. Scientists utilized high-contrast imaging and a coronagraph, a tool that blocks a star's bright glare, to reveal the faint object. While a small possibility remains that the object is a background galaxy, researchers state the evidence strongly suggests it is a planet. The discovery could provide new insights into planetary formation and debris disks around young stars.</p>

His win is seen by some as a sign of momentum for the party's younger, progressive wing, while moderate Democrats have expressed concern over his platform.

While President Trump claims the program was "obliterated," assessments vary. The deeply buried Fordo enrichment site was targeted with specialized bunker-busting bombs, with officials claiming it is now "inoperable." The Natanz facility's underground halls were also hit, and the above-ground structures at the Isfahan uranium conversion site were reportedly destroyed. However, experts caution that Iran may have moved its stockpile of highly enriched uranium to undisclosed locations, and other secret facilities could exist, making a complete assessment of the program's capabilities difficult.</p>

          <p>A 67-year-old man was arrested after he allegedly attempted to gain entry into the home of Milwaukee Police Chief Jeffrey Norman. The incident occurred while the chief was not at home, and law enforcement sources confirmed the location of the attempted intrusion. Police reported that two firearms were recovered from the area following the man's arrest. The case has been referred to the Milwaukee County District Attorney's Office for potential charges as the investigation continues. The event took place just one day before the city's Fire and Police Commission was scheduled to vote on Norman's reappointment as police chief.</p>

          <p>A coalition of environmental organizations, cities, and tribes has filed a first-of-its-kind class-action lawsuit against the EPA and its administrator, Lee Zeldin. The suit seeks to restore approximately $3 billion in environmental and climate justice grants that were abruptly terminated by the Trump administration. The plaintiffs, including Air Alliance Houston, argue that the cancellation of their fully awarded federal contracts was illegal and unconstitutional. This legal strategy pools resources for smaller organizations, allowing them to collectively challenge the administration's actions, which they claim undermine critical projects addressing pollution, public health, and climate resilience in vulnerable communities.</p>

          <p>At the World Economic Forum's "Summer Davos" event, experts debated the future of the U.S. dollar as the world's primary reserve currency.

She suggested that China is actively working to create its own financial sphere centered on the yuan, which could present a viable alternative. Factors contributing to the dollar's potential decline include other countries' reluctance to rely on the U.S., the rise of digital currencies, and economic management in Washington.

          <p>Congressional Republicans have agreed to remove a contentious tax provision from President Trump's major spending bill following a request from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The provision, known as Section 899, would have allowed taxes on foreign-owned companies and investors from countries deemed to have unfair tax policies, a measure critics called a "revenge tax." Bessent requested its removal after reaching an understanding with G7 countries on a global tax deal, stating it would provide greater stability for the global economy. The removal complicates Republican efforts to offset the costs of the massive legislative package ahead of a July Fourth deadline. (not investment advice)</p>

The proposed changes would instead apply only to future claimants, and a Â£1 billion support plan may be fast-tracked.
