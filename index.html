          <p>Jerome Cohen, a highly respected and pioneering scholar of Chinese law, has died at the age of 95. As professor emeritus at New York University’s School of Law and founder of its US-Asia Law Institute, Cohen profoundly influenced global discussions on China's legal system, trade, and human rights over six decades. He was notably the first American to practice law in the country under Communist rule, and his writings on Chinese criminal procedure and international law are considered groundbreaking. The article highlights his reputation as both an advocate for Chinese dissidents and a proponent of continued engagement with Beijing, solidifying his towering impact on the field of Asian law.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly's oral weight loss pill, orforglipron, has demonstrated "meaningful weight loss" and cardiometabolic improvements in phase 3 clinical trials for adults without diabetes. Over 72 weeks, participants on the highest dose achieved an average loss of 27.3 pounds, with many losing 10-15% of their body weight. The article notes that while its safety profile is consistent with existing GLP-1 injectables, some medical professionals suggest its weight loss results might be less pronounced than with injectables. Eli Lilly plans to seek regulatory approval for both obesity and type 2 diabetes treatment, potentially by 2026, positioning it as a convenient oral alternative to current injectable medications. This development could address obesity as a global health challenge.</p>

          <p>Major medical and scientific organizations have strongly criticized President Trump's assertion that acetaminophen (Tylenol) use during pregnancy may be linked to autism, and that childhood vaccines contribute to it. Groups like ACOG and SMFM called the Tylenol claim "highly concerning" and "irresponsible," emphasizing over 20 years of research showing no direct causal link and highlighting the dangers of untreated fever and pain in pregnancy. Similarly, pediatricians refuted the vaccine-autism link, citing decades of research. The article also notes skepticism from autism scientists regarding Trump's promotion of leucovorin as an autism treatment, calling for rigorous, large-scale trials.</p>

          <p>President Trump's appearance at the UN General Assembly was marked by a chaotic and at times incoherent speech, followed by a significant reversal of his previous stance on the Russia-Ukraine war. After meeting with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and French President Macron, Trump suggested NATO countries should shoot down Russian jets and that Ukraine could reclaim all its original territory. This represents a sharp departure from his earlier, more conciliatory approach towards Russia, including a recent summit with President Putin. The article notes Trump's unpredictability on major policy questions, highlighting that his pronouncements, while often fluid, can have serious real-world implications.</p>

One theory suggests Trump dislikes being humiliated, while another posits he might be signaling a desire to disengage from the conflict, leaving Europe to shoulder the burden. The article concludes that this shift might be less about increased pressure on Russia and more about Trump washing his hands of the conflict, potentially normalizing relations with Moscow.</p>

          <p>California's Senate Bill 576, awaiting the governor's signature, seeks to prohibit streaming services from playing commercials louder than their programming. The legislation was spurred by consumer complaints, particularly from new parents like Richael Keller, whose baby was disturbed by blaring ads. While the federal CALM Act already regulates broadcast and cable TV, it doesn't cover streaming. The article explains how sound engineers can make ads seem louder while staying within average loudness rules. Streaming industry groups initially opposed the bill, citing control issues, but became neutral after an amendment removed private lawsuit provisions, highlighting a growing regulatory focus on streaming content.</p>

          <h2>Car Buyers Surge to Utilize Federal EV Tax Credits Before Expiration</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Car buyers are rushing to take advantage of federal tax credits for new and used electric vehicles before they expire on September 30, due to President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." The $7,500 for new and $4,000 for used EV credits, introduced under the Inflation Reduction Act, are being phased out. This impending deadline has driven EV sales to record highs in August, with new EV sales up 17.7% and used EV sales up 59% year-over-year. Dealerships are also offering incentives to clear inventory. The article notes that while September could be a record month, the end of the credits may challenge future EV sales, prompting automakers to slow production. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A late summer monsoon in Southern California last week triggered mudslides and flash floods, resulting in significant damage, including destroyed homes and one child's death. The storm, which dumped inches of rain on San Bernardino County, unleashed mud, rocks, and trees, particularly in burn scars. Three homes were destroyed, and over a dozen other structures were damaged, with one family losing their home and most pets. Tragically, 2-year-old Xavier Padilla Aguilera died when his family's vehicle was swept away in Barstow. Highway 38 remains closed indefinitely due to debris flows, and more storms are possible, including from Tropical Storm Narda.</p>

          <p>Aakash Singh, a top official at the Department of Justice, who is now directing aggressive prosecutions of minor crimes in Washington D.C., pleaded guilty to a DUI charge four years ago. His subsequent promotion to associate deputy attorney general is considered unusual by experts given his criminal history and relatively brief legal career. The article highlights Singh's role in prioritizing charges against protesters and misdemeanors, even advising prosecutors to impanel new grand juries if initial indictments fail. This situation raises questions about the DOJ's hiring standards under the Trump administration and perceived hypocrisy, particularly after a paralegal was fired for throwing a sandwich.</p>

          <p>This article addresses parental concerns regarding acetaminophen (Tylenol) and its purported link to autism, following President Trump's warnings. It clarifies that research findings are uncertain; while some studies show an association, others, particularly a large Swedish sibling study, found the link disappeared when controlling for genetics and other factors, suggesting no causal effect. Medical experts emphasize that untreated fever and pain during pregnancy pose known dangers, and acetaminophen remains one of the safest over-the-counter options. The FDA's new warning advises minimizing routine use for low-grade fevers but balances this with the drug's established safety for more serious conditions. Parents are advised to consult medical providers.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, with more anticipated, has made home equity loans a more affordable borrowing option for homeowners. This article calculates the monthly costs for a $40,000 home equity loan over 10 and 15 years, showing that payments are now lower compared to earlier in the year and last fall. For instance, a 10-year loan at 8.43% costs $494.45 monthly. It also compares these to Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs), which offer even lower variable rates but carry the risk of future increases. Borrowers are advised to compare current costs against potential future rate changes to determine the best time to act. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's UN speech offered an unfiltered exposition of his ideology, characterized by self-praise, attacks on opponents, and criticisms of the UN itself. He questioned the organization's effectiveness, blaming it for a broken escalator and teleprompter, and criticized its funding of asylum seekers. The article highlights his strong condemnation of European allies for investing in renewable energy and opening borders to migration, labeling climate change a "con job." While he issued a substantive warning on Russia's war in Ukraine, the article notes his policy statements are often inconsistent and should be treated with caution, as his audience listened in silence rather than laughter this year.</p>

          <p>President Trump abruptly canceled a planned meeting with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, increasing the likelihood of a federal government shutdown. Democrats are insisting on including protections for healthcare programs, specifically extending Affordable Care Act tax credits, in any stopgap funding deal. Trump, in a Truth Social post, slammed their demands as "unserious and ridiculous," accusing them of seeking to fund "Radical Left Views and Policies." Democratic leaders criticized Trump for "chickening out" and "running away from the negotiating table," asserting he would "own the shutdown" if it occurs.</p>

The article notes this comes amidst months of pressure from President Trump for lower rates, including attempts to influence the Fed's board.

          <p>This article critiques FCC Chair Brendan Carr's threats against TV networks, particularly Disney, over Jimmy Kimmel's comments, suggesting they are "antithetical" to the agency's mission of free speech. Carr's implied threat of license revocation, which led to ABC temporarily suspending Kimmel, is deemed unrealistic by experts due to legal complexities and the FCC's historical reluctance to use such measures. The article argues Carr's actions are likely aimed at pleasing President Trump and leveraging the FCC's power over mergers and acquisitions, rather than actual license revocations. It highlights concerns about censorship and the potential for political influence over media regulation.</p>

          <p>President Trump has officially classified the Antifa movement as a domestic terrorist organization, signing a decree to investigate and dismantle its operations and funding. This move follows Trump's earlier allegations linking the "radical left" to the death of activist Charlie Kirk. The article explains that Antifa, originating in Germany, is a loose coalition of groups fighting fascism, not a centrally organized entity. Legal experts and agencies like the FBI have previously stated that classifying Antifa as a terrorist organization is difficult under U.S. law due to its lack of formal structure and First Amendment protections for political beliefs. This designation raises significant legal and constitutional concerns.</p>
