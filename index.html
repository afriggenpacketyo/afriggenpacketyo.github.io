          <p>Donald Trump claimed that Jeffrey Epstein "stole" Virginia Giuffre and other workers from his Mar-a-Lago club, which he cited as the reason for severing ties with the disgraced financier in the mid-2000s. Trump's comments came amid ongoing legal battles, including a lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch over a Wall Street Journal story and demands for Murdoch's deposition. The article also notes that Ghislaine Maxwell's legal team has indicated she would invoke her Fifth Amendment rights if compelled to testify before a House committee without immunity. This context highlights the continuing legal and political fallout surrounding Epstein's network and associates.</p>

          <p>Spotify's stock price fell by over 11% after the company reported financial results that missed Wall Street expectations and provided a weak forecast for the upcoming quarter. The music streaming giant posted a net loss, citing increased personnel and marketing costs, and its revenue guidance fell short of analyst predictions. Despite growth in monthly active users and premium subscribers, the company is facing challenges with its advertising-supported revenue. CEO Daniel Ek acknowledged the performance issues but expressed confidence in the company's long-term strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom announced it will recognize a Palestinian state in September if Israel fails to take significant steps toward a ceasefire and a two-state solution, a move following a similar declaration by France. This diplomatic pressure coincides with reports that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is considering annexing parts of Gaza as ceasefire negotiations with Hamas have collapsed. The article provides a comprehensive overview, detailing the international reactions, the breakdown of talks, and the grim humanitarian situation, with the Palestinian death toll reported to have surpassed 60,000.</p>

          <p>Two-time Olympic biathlon gold medalist Laura Dahlmeier is reported to be seriously injured and missing following a mountaineering accident in Pakistan's Karakorum Mountains. The 31-year-old German athlete was caught in a rockfall at an altitude of approximately 18,700 feet while climbing with a partner. While her partner was able to call for help, rescue efforts have been hampered by the remote location. As of Tuesday, search crews had not yet made direct contact with Dahlmeier, who retired from professional competition in 2019.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: UK's Conditional Recognition of Palestine Faces Political and Practical Hurdles</h2>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's announcement to recognize a Palestinian state is a significant shift in British foreign policy, driven by both public and internal party pressure over the Gaza crisis. However, the recognition is conditional on actions from both Israel and Hamas, such as a ceasefire and disarmament, which seem unlikely given the current political realities. This analysis explores whether the move can be more than a symbolic gesture, as its ultimate impact is constrained by the positions of key players like Israel and the United States, which has not supported such unilateral recognitions.</p>

          <p>In one of the country's largest drug seizures, authorities in the Dominican Republic captured 1.5 tons of cocaine after a dramatic 12-hour chase at sea. The operation involved helicopters, boats, and cars, and concluded with the arrest of three Dominicans and one Colombian. The speedboat was found to be carrying 53 bales of the illicit substance. This major bust highlights the Caribbean nation's ongoing role as a significant transit point for drug trafficking and the efforts by law enforcement to combat it.</p>

The attacks occurred as a US-imposed deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire approaches.

          <p>President Trump is actively pursuing a long-held goal: building a large, permanent ballroom on the White House grounds. He argues that the current practice of using tents for large events like state dinners is inadequate and that, as a real estate developer, he is uniquely qualified for the project. Trump has been discussing this idea for over a decade, even offering to fund it himself during the Obama administration. While aides suggest the project is moving forward, critics and former White House staff raise concerns about aesthetics, historical preservation, and obstructing iconic views.</p>

          <p>Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, formerly Donald Trump's personal lawyer, is facing scrutiny for his direct involvement in the Justice Department's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case. Blanche personally conducted a multi-day interview with Ghislaine Maxwell, a move considered highly unusual for a senior DOJ official and one that raises questions about impartiality. Critics and former prosecutors express concern that his past relationship with Trump could create a perception of conflict, especially as the administration navigates the politically sensitive release of Epstein-related files and potential further investigations into his network.</p>
