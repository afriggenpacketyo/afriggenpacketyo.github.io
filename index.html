        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Protests erupted across Los Angeles following numerous arrests during citywide Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations. President Trump responded by ordering the deployment of at least 2,000 National Guard troops to L.A. County due to clashes between immigration authorities and demonstrators, invoking Title 10 Authority, a waiver of the Posse Comitatus Act. Advocates for immigrants' rights reported detentions outside various businesses, and tensions escalated as protesters attempted to obstruct law enforcement vehicles, leading to the use of non-lethal munitions. The situation remains tense as local and federal authorities clash over the appropriate response to immigration enforcement and public demonstrations.</p>

          <p>President Trump bypassed the authority of California Governor Gavin Newsom to call up 2,000 National Guard troops to quell immigration protests in Los Angeles.

The deployment comes amid escalating tensions between federal immigration authorities and protesters, raising concerns about the use of military force in domestic law enforcement. This action highlights the ongoing conflict between the federal government and California regarding immigration policies.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates, particularly in countries like China. Researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong found that subsidies for fathers yield higher long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. This policy proposal comes as China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system. The study challenges traditional expectations that place the burden of childcare primarily on women.</p>
