          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 09:48:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CNBC survey indicates a significant drop in public approval for President Trump's handling of the economy, reaching the lowest point of his second term. The decline is attributed to growing concerns about inflation, job security, and the potential economic fallout from the ongoing government shutdown, for which a majority of respondents blame the president and congressional Republicans. The survey highlights that independents, a key demographic, are leaning substantially negative on the president's economic policies, particularly regarding the rising cost of living. This shift is notable as his economic approval had previously been a consistent political strength. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Small business owners across the United States are facing significant financial distress due to President Trump's tariff policies, forcing many to take on high-interest loans, raise prices, and halt hiring. Unlike larger corporations, these smaller companies have less capacity to absorb the increased costs, making them a potential early indicator of broader economic trouble. Several business owners shared their struggles, detailing how increased duties on imported goods have slashed profit margins and created immense uncertainty for their future. Economists suggest their difficulties could foreshadow a wider economic impact if the trade policies continue unabated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House, just one day after a lengthy phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Zelenskyy is expected to request additional military aid, specifically long-range Tomahawk missiles that could strike deep within Russia, to continue Ukraine's war efforts. However, President Trump has expressed hesitation about depleting U.S. stockpiles and suggested he might use the missile request as leverage in peace negotiations with Putin. The meeting occurs as Ukraine reports another large-scale Russian strike, undermining ongoing peace efforts.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Global stock markets, including the UK's FTSE 100, experienced a sharp decline following warnings from two U.S. regional banks about bad or fraudulent loans. The disclosures from Zions Bank and Western Alliance Bank sparked fears about instability within the American banking sector, causing a ripple effect that impacted major European and Asian indexes. Investors reacted nervously to the possibility of poor risk management and loose lending standards, leading to a flight toward safer assets like gold, which hit a record high. While there is no evidence of similar issues in UK banks, the news created widespread market anxiety. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Using advanced AI-based facial recognition and historical records, researchers have identified the gunman in a well-known Holocaust photograph, previously titled "The Last Jew in Vinnitsa." The perpetrator is believed with 99% certainty to be Jakobus Onnen, a member of the Nazi Einsatzgruppe C. The breakthrough came after a high-quality print of the photo was discovered in a soldier's war diaries, which also corrected the location of the mass murder to Berdychiv, Ukraine. This identification marks a significant step in de-anonymizing perpetrators of Holocaust atrocities, though the victim kneeling at the edge of the mass grave remains unidentified.</p>

          <p>The UK's Court of Appeal has ruled against the government, allowing a judicial review of the decision to ban the direct-action group Palestine Action under terrorism laws. The ruling, delivered by the Lady Chief Justice, paves the way for a High Court hearing and is considered a significant development, as it provides a faster path to challenge the ban than the standard, lengthy de-proscription process. The group's co-founder argued the ban was an abuse of power, while the government maintains the group conducted a campaign of criminal damage and intimidation. The ban has led to over 2,100 arrests at demonstrations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's policy of using military strikes to destroy suspected drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean has resulted in at least 27 deaths and drawn criticism for its questionable legality and moral implications. Critics argue that the strikes constitute extrajudicial killings without due process, as the administration has not provided strong evidence that those killed were dangerous "narcoterrorists." Research suggests that crews on these boats are often impoverished fishermen coerced into service, not high-level cartel members. The policy is seen by some as a subversion of constitutional war powers and a dangerous precedent for executive authority in the war on drugs.</p>

          <p>Several U.S. airports, including those in Denver and Los Angeles, are experiencing significant flight delays due to a shortage of air traffic controllers, a situation exacerbated by the ongoing government shutdown. Federal data indicates that more air traffic control facilities are flagged for low staffing than at any point since the post-COVID travel surge in 2022. Air traffic controllers are deemed essential workers and must continue their duties without pay during the shutdown. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association warned that the staffing shortage leaves the aviation system vulnerable, forcing the FAA to reduce flight volumes to maintain safety.</p>

Both North Korea and Vietnam, along with Laos, have agreed to enhance bilateral cooperation, particularly in defense and healthcare. Analysts view this as a diplomatic win for the heavily sanctioned North Korean regime, providing it with a degree of legitimacy and potential corridors for bypassing international sanctions. While sharing a similar political ideology, Vietnam's capitalist-leaning economy differs from North Korea's, but the strengthened ties offer Pyongyang an alternative source of material goods beyond its heavy reliance on China.</p>

          <p>A U.S. government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass the necessary appropriations bills to fund federal agencies before the fiscal year begins on October 1.

Essential employees, such as active-duty military and air traffic controllers, must work but do not receive pay until funding is restored.

A review of Hochul's previous statements shows she frequently invoked the principle that "no one is above the law" during Trump's legal battles, including the civil fraud case brought by James herself.

          <p>Hundreds of mourners, including prominent figures from the world of women's football, gathered at Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral for the funeral of former Liverpool manager Matt Beard. Beard, who led the team to two consecutive Women's Super League titles, died on September 20 at the age of 47. An inquest revealed he was found hanged, prompting his family to request donations to a mental health charity in lieu of flowers. Players who played under Beard formed a guard of honor, and attendees wore red to celebrate his life and legacy in the sport.</p>

          <p>Colonel Michael Randrianirina has been sworn in as the new president of Madagascar following a military coup and the impeachment of former President Andry Rajoelina. The transition of power comes after weeks of youth-led "Gen Z" protests against unemployment and failing public services, which culminated in unrest and the military's intervention. Rajoelina was impeached for desertion of duty after reportedly fleeing the country amid the chaos. The new military-backed leader has promised to appoint a civilian prime minister and hold elections within two years, though both the United Nations and the African Union have condemned the unconstitutional change of government.</p>

A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman praised Murayama as a politician with a strong sense of justice, highlighting his historic visit to the Marco Polo Bridge, the site where Japan's full-scale invasion of China began in 1937.</p>

          <p>Prominent tech investor Ron Conway has resigned from the board of the Salesforce Foundation, citing a misalignment of values with CEO Marc Benioff. The departure follows Benioff's recent comments suggesting he would support President Trump sending federal troops to San Francisco to address policing shortages, which sparked significant controversy. Conway, a longtime Democratic donor, reportedly expressed his disagreement with Benioff's stance in an email. The incident highlights a growing rift within the tech community over how to address San Francisco's social issues and the role of federal intervention, with Benioff's remarks being amplified by right-wing figures and criticized by California's Democratic leaders.</p>

          <p>Progressive non-profit organizations in the U.S. are bracing for a crackdown after President Trump identified billionaire philanthropist George Soros and his Open Society Foundations (OSF) as a target for investigation. The Justice Department has reportedly instructed U.S. attorneys to develop plans to investigate OSF, which funds a wide range of causes including democracy, voting rights, and racial justice. In response, many non-profits, some of which receive OSF funding, are coordinating a united front, vowing not to be intimidated by what they call politically motivated attacks on civil society and the First Amendment. They view the action as part of a broader agenda to silence dissent.</p>

          <p>John Bolton, who served as President Trump's national security adviser, has been indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of unlawfully retaining and transmitting classified information. The indictment alleges that Bolton shared sensitive, "diary-like entries" containing top-secret details with two relatives who lacked security clearance, using non-governmental email accounts. It also claims his personal email was hacked by an actor linked to Iran, exposing the classified materials. Bolton has proclaimed his innocence, framing the charges as a politically motivated act of retribution by the Trump administration for his public criticism of the president.</p>

          <p>Decades of research have suggested a potential link between talcum powder and cancer, primarily due to the risk of contamination with asbestos. Talc and asbestos are naturally occurring minerals often found in close proximity, making it difficult to ensure talc products are completely asbestos-free. The World Health Organization classifies all forms of asbestos as carcinogenic, with inhalation linked to mesothelioma and lung cancer. Concerns also exist that perineal application of talc-based powders could be associated with ovarian cancer. Following numerous lawsuits, major manufacturers like Johnson & Johnson have transitioned from using talc to cornstarch in their powders.</p>

          <p>As U.S. energy demand is projected to surge due to AI data centers and manufacturing, experts are promoting "demand flexibility" as a bipartisan solution to prevent blackouts and lower household power bills. This policy involves rewarding customers, from homeowners to large data centers, for reducing their electricity usage during peak hours or for selling stored energy back to the grid. A recent study suggests that adopting these policies could add over 100GW of capacity, equivalent to building dozens of new power plants. While some states are already implementing such programs, advocacy groups are pushing for wider adoption to improve grid efficiency.</p>

          <p>An estimated one billion birds die each year in the United States from colliding with glass windows, making it one of the largest threats to avian populations after habitat loss and cats. Birds cannot perceive glass as a solid barrier, mistaking reflections for sky or seeing through transparent panes to habitats on the other side. Volunteer groups across the country, like Lights Out DC, monitor buildings to collect data on bird deaths and advocate for solutions. While the problem is widespread, effective solutions exist, such as films with dotted patterns that reduce collisions by up to 95%, prompting calls for more bird-friendly architectural standards.</p>

The company acknowledged that some user-generated content featuring the civil rights leader was "disrespectful." The decision came after Dr. King's daughter, Bernice A. King, publicly asked people to stop creating AI-generated videos of her father. The incident highlights the growing ethical debate surrounding AI's ability to create hyper-realistic deepfakes of historical and deceased figures, with critics arguing it disrespects their legacies and blurs the line between real and fake historical content.</p>

          <p>As exchange-traded funds (ETFs) grow in popularity, financial advisors are cautioning investors against common mistakes that can negatively impact long-term returns. One major error is "chasing performance" or following a herd mentality into funds that have recently seen high growth, without considering if they align with personal financial goals. Another pitfall is trend-hopping into volatile, narrowly focused thematic ETFs, such as those centered on AI or crypto. Advisors also stress the importance of paying attention to expense ratios, as seemingly small differences in fees can significantly erode returns over time through a process known as "fee drag."
