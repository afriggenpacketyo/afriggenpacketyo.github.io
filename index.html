          <p>Robert Primus, a member of the U.S. rail regulatory board, reported his termination by the Trump administration shortly after an Amtrak event unveiling new Acela trains. Primus, a Democrat nominated by Trump in 2020, plans to contest his removal, which has drawn criticism from labor unions. The White House stated Primus did not align with the 'America First agenda,' while unions suggest the timing is suspicious given his opposition to a proposed $85 billion freight rail merger. This incident follows other high-profile firings within the administration, raising concerns about the independence of federal oversight bodies.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York has denied Saudi Arabia's motion to dismiss a lawsuit, permitting 9/11 victims' families to pursue claims that the kingdom provided support to the hijackers. This ruling marks a significant development in a long-running legal battle, bolstered by the 2016 Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act. Allegations focus on two hijackers, Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi, and their alleged connections to Saudi individuals like Omar al-Bayoumi, who some reports suggest had ties to the Saudi government. The court found reasonable evidence to infer Saudi Arabia's involvement through these individuals, allowing the case to proceed to trial despite Saudi denials.</p>

Police Chief Brian O'Hara stated Westman aimed for maximum terror and notoriety, expressing animosity towards Black, Mexican, Christian, and Jewish people, as well as President Donald Trump. Despite previous attendance at the school, no specific trigger for targeting the church has been identified. The 23-year-old shooter, who died by suicide, killed two children and injured 18 people, with writings indicating a desire to inflict suffering on children.</p>

Westman had a past connection to the school, and officials are investigating the incident as a hate crime targeting Catholics, while also urging against anti-transgender sentiment following the revelation of the shooter's gender identity change.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of CDC staffers rallied in Atlanta to support senior officials who resigned or were fired by the Trump administration, protesting alleged political interference and the spread of misinformation. The upheaval follows the attempted removal of CDC chief Susan Monarez and the resignations of four top leaders, including Debra Houry, Demetre Daskalakis, and Daniel Jernigan. These officials cited concerns over vaccine science and the politicization of public health under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has restricted vaccine use and cut research funding. Staffers called for science to lead public health decisions, emphasizing the agency's role in protecting America.</p>

His brother and co-host, Jason Kelce, defended the Browns' decision to start veteran Joe Flacco, prioritizing the team's best chance to win.

CEO Richard Dickson acknowledged Athleta's struggles, attributing them to a shift away from its performance roots and a lack of offerings for its core customer, signaling a 'year of reset' for the brand.

          <p>An analyst argues that while President Trump's political pressure on the Federal Reserve, including the recent firing of Governor Lisa Cook, is concerning, the more significant threat to the Fed's independence stems from growing public debt and fiscal policy. The article explains that as national debt increases, monetary policy becomes increasingly intertwined with fiscal policy, leading to 'fiscal dominance.' This occurs when the central bank must prioritize government borrowing costs or tolerate inflation due to legislative inaction on spending and taxes. The piece suggests that without meaningful budgetary reforms from Congress, pressure on the Fed will persist regardless of who occupies the White House.</p>

Traditional Medicare often doesn't cover all medical expenses, leading to out-of-pocket costs that can accumulate. To bridge these gaps, seniors can explore options like Medicare supplemental insurance (Medigap) to cover deductibles and copays, reverse mortgages for homeowners aged 62 and older to access home equity without immediate repayment, or annuities to secure a consistent future income stream. These strategies offer ways to manage healthcare costs and provide financial peace of mind (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Pure Storage shares surged 32% to a record high after the data storage management vendor reported quarterly results that exceeded estimates and raised its full-year guidance. The impressive performance was significantly bolstered by the early success of its agreement with Meta, secured in March, positioning Pure as a key storage provider for the social media giant. The company has already begun recognizing revenue from Meta deployments and is confident in exceeding initial deployment targets. CEO Charles Giancarlo highlighted Pure's efficiency in managing space, power, and cooling, which is increasingly attractive to hyperscalers and other customers seeking AI infrastructure solutions.</p>

          <p>Senator Bill Cassidy, a Republican chairing the Senate Health Committee, urged the Department of Health and Human Services to 'indefinitely postpone' its upcoming vaccine advisory committee meeting. This call comes amidst significant leadership departures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including the firing of Director Susan Monarez. Cassidy, who had previously expressed misgivings about HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s anti-vaccine views, cited concerns about the meeting's legitimacy, agenda, and lack of scientific process. Ranking Member Bernie Sanders also called for a bipartisan investigation into Monarez's firing and a hearing with key officials.</p>

          <p>Police in Minneapolis reported that locked church doors prevented the shooter from entering Annunciation Catholic School during the mass shooting, likely saving 'countless lives.'

Investigators found a detailed diagram of the church interior and evidence of smoke canisters intended to trap students. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara stated the shooter had a 'deranged fascination' with mass killers and expressed broad hatred, but no specific grievance against the church has been identified as a motive.</p>

          <p>South Carolina officials have asked the Supreme Court to allow full enforcement of a state measure that ties education funding to school districts prohibiting transgender students from using restrooms aligning with their gender identity. This emergency relief request follows a federal appeals court ruling that blocked the policy's enforcement against a specific transgender high school student, John Doe. The state argues its policy does not discriminate and reflects the will of its legislature, aiming to restore the status quo and protect student privacy while litigation continues. The case draws on a previous 4th Circuit decision in favor of a transgender student challenging a similar policy.</p>

          <p>Home equity loan interest rates have dropped to their lowest point in 2025, averaging 8.22%, making them a more attractive borrowing option alongside HELOCs. With record-high home equity levels, homeowners have substantial funds available to borrow, potentially offering a simpler and cheaper alternative to personal loans or credit cards. The fixed nature of home equity loan rates provides protection against market uncertainty, unlike variable-rate products. Additionally, funds used for eligible home repairs or renovations may qualify for tax deductions, further enhancing the financial benefits.

While early adoption has been encouraging, analysts caution that initial selection may be limited and the initiative could impact Amazon's operating income due to thin grocery margins.

This strategic shift aims to re-center the company on sport and culture, reignite innovation, and deepen connections with athletes and consumers.

A Bank of America Institute analysis, based on customer deposit data, shows a significant decline in job changes since the 'Great Resignation' peak in 2022, now nearing 2019 levels. This trend is accompanied by a decrease in pay raises for job switchers, with the median raise falling to 7% in July from 20% in 2022. Economists attribute this shift to employers pulling back on hiring and general business uncertainty, leading to a less dynamic job market and potentially dampening consumer spending.</p>
