        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Irish center Garry Ringrose has withdrawn from the British and Irish Lions' second Test match against Australia after experiencing concussion symptoms during training. This marks the second time a head injury has sidelined him on the tour, disrupting the team's lineup, which now features a new midfield pairing. Coach Andy Farrell expressed disappointment for Ringrose but praised his honesty in prioritizing his health and the team's needs. The Lions, aiming for a historic back-to-back tour victory in the same country, face a determined Australian side in Melbourne.</p>

          <p>Renewed fighting has erupted between Thai and Cambodian forces along their disputed border, resulting in at least three civilian injuries from a Cambodian rocket strike. The clash occurred near ancient temples in a contested area, with both nations blaming the other for initiating the conflict. Thailand reported that its soldiers responded after a Cambodian drone was spotted and armed soldiers approached a border fence, while Cambodia claimed it was defending against a Thai incursion. The escalation follows heightened tensions and a recent downgrading of diplomatic relations.</p>

          <h2>Court Documents Reveal Late Jesuit Leader Pedro Arrupe Knew of Child Molestation Accusations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 02:00:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Court documents from a New Orleans lawsuit show that the late Jesuit leader Pedro Arrupe, a candidate for Catholic sainthood, was aware of multiple sexual molestation accusations against an aspiring priest, Donald J. Dickerson, in the late 1970s. Despite being warned that Dickerson was a "poor risk for ordination," Arrupe did not appear to prevent his ordination. Dickerson was later accused of abusing other minors, including the plaintiff in the current case. This revelation raises serious questions about Arrupe's legacy and the Jesuit order's handling of abuse.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed executive orders aimed at shaping the future of artificial intelligence in the U.S., including a directive to prevent the use of what he terms "woke AI" in the federal government. The order mandates that government-procured AI models must be neutral and avoid ideological agendas, specifically identifying Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives as a key concern. The administration argues such ideologies compromise truthfulness and can lead to manipulated outputs. Other orders aim to spur AI innovation by removing regulations and establish a program to promote U.S. AI exports.</p>

          <h2>Major Study Suggests Walking 7,000 Steps Daily Significantly Reduces Health Risks</h2>

          <p>A major study published in The Lancet suggests that walking just 7,000 steps a day is linked to a significantly reduced risk of major health issues like dementia, cancer, and heart disease. This more achievable target could encourage more people to track their activity, as the widely-known 10,000-step goal is not based on scientific evidence. The research, which analyzed data from over 160,000 adults, found that even modest increases in daily steps provide substantial health benefits. Researchers suggest a step-count recommendation could complement existing time-based exercise guidelines.</p>

          <p>A Venezuelan man, Arturo Suarez, has described enduring constant physical and psychological abuse after being deported by the Trump administration to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador. Despite having no criminal record, he was one of over 250 Venezuelan men accused of gang affiliation and sent to the CECOT prison, where he spent four months. Suarez, who was recently released in a prisoner swap, stated he was targeted for being Venezuelan and subjected to beatings and inhumane conditions. He claims he was denied due process and contact with his family.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials to offer migrant teenagers aged 14 and older the option to voluntarily return to their home countries. This policy change upends a long-standing practice under a 2008 anti-trafficking law, which required unaccompanied minors from non-contiguous countries to be transferred to government shelters. Previously, this voluntary departure option was limited to children from Mexico and Canada. If the teens decline, they will still be sent to the shelter system, but the new directive provides a path for their prompt removal from the U.S.</p>

          <p>The UK's Environment Agency (EA) has cancelled thousands of water tests for harmful pollution in England's rivers due to severe staff shortages. Internal documents show testing for pollutants like nitrates and phosphates, which indicate sewage or agricultural runoff, has been significantly curtailed. The regulator confirmed that seven national testing programs were paused and its main lab is operating far below capacity. This comes as the EA faces criticism for failing to effectively manage the water system, hindering efforts to identify and address pollution.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that EU-China relations are at an "inflection point" during a summit in Beijing marking 50 years of diplomatic ties. Meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, she highlighted the need to rebalance the relationship, pointing to the EU's historic €306 billion trade deficit with China. President Xi called for the two global powers to strengthen mutual trust and find common ground. Despite disagreements over trade, industrial subsidies, and geopolitics, both sides emphasized the importance of their partnership and the need for communication.</p>

          <p>A rare species of violet sea snail, Janthina janthina, has been found on a La Jolla beach, a sight not seen by Scripps Institution of Oceanography researchers in a decade. These pelagic snails, which float on the open ocean using a self-made bubble raft, are typically found in warmer tropical waters. Their appearance often coincides with warmer offshore currents, leading to speculation about a potential link to climate change. Researchers are urging the public to report any further sightings as they study whether the phenomenon indicates a broader environmental shift.</p>

          <p>South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix has announced record-breaking operating profit and revenue for the second quarter, fueled by soaring demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips used in artificial intelligence. The company, a key supplier to Nvidia, saw its operating profit rise nearly 69% year-on-year, solidifying its leadership in the advanced memory market. SK Hynix expects strong demand to continue, driven by ongoing AI investments from tech giants, and plans to double its HBM sales in 2025 compared to 2024. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New rules under the UK's Online Safety Act now require websites with pornographic content to implement robust age verification for their users. The law aims to prevent children from accessing explicit material, with potential fines for non-compliant sites reaching up to £18 million. Ofcom, the regulator, has outlined several acceptable methods, including credit card checks and photo ID matching. However, concerns remain about user privacy and the potential for people to circumvent the checks using tools like VPNs, which platforms are now required to discourage.</p>

          <p>San Francisco Giants' Rafael Devers made his debut at first base and made a surprising admission following the game. After previously being adamant about only serving as a designated hitter with his former team, the Boston Red Sox, Devers stated he prefers playing a defensive position. He explained that being on the field keeps him active and prevents him from overthinking his next at-bat. This contrasts with his time in Boston, where disagreements over his defensive role led to him becoming the full-time DH, a decision he had publicly contested.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of U.S. representatives has introduced a resolution to stop a federal plan to shoot nearly half a million barred owls in the Pacific Northwest. The plan is intended to protect the rapidly declining native spotted owl, which is being outcompeted for territory and resources. Opponents of the cull argue the plan is inhumane, unworkable, and a waste of taxpayer money. However, some conservationists warn that without managing the barred owl population, the native spotted owl faces certain extinction, presenting a complex environmental and ethical dilemma.</p>
