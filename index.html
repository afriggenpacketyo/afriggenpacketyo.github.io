          <h2>Future of Late-Night Television Questioned After CBS Cancels Stephen Colbert's Show</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 13:36:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CBS has announced the cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," effective May 2026, citing significant financial losses amidst a challenging television landscape. The decision has sparked a broader debate about the viability of traditional late-night programming as linear TV advertising revenue declines and audiences shift to streaming. While some speculate the cancellation was politically motivated, Paramount insists it was a purely financial move. The industry now looks to Disney's upcoming decision on Jimmy Kimmel's contract as the next indicator for the genre's future.</p>

          <p>A group of 21 Democratic senators, led by Chris Van Hollen, is pressuring the Trump administration to cease its $30 million in funding for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). In a letter to the Secretary of State, they expressed grave concerns over the GHF's operations, which use armed contractors and have been linked to hundreds of civilian deaths. The senators are urging a return to UN-led aid mechanisms, citing the escalating humanitarian crisis and reports of starvation. The letter also questions whether the administration bypassed normal oversight to fast-track funding for the controversial organization.</p>

Yu, who began swimming at age six, is also slated to compete in the 400-meter individual medley and the 200-meter butterfly. Although World Aquatics has a minimum age of 14, exceptions are made for swimmers who meet the high qualifying standards, a feat Yu accomplished.</p>

          <p>White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought indicated the Trump administration is considering further spending cuts through rescission packages, potentially targeting education and health funds. In a "Face the Nation" interview, Vought defended holding up congressionally-approved funds for programmatic review, citing wasteful spending. He also expressed a desire for a "less bipartisan" appropriations process, raising concerns about a potential government shutdown in September. Vought's comments suggest a looming fiscal battle between the executive branch and Congress over spending authority and budget priorities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Facing intense international condemnation over a deepening hunger crisis, the Israeli military has initiated a daily "tactical pause" in parts of Gaza to allow humanitarian aid distribution. This move, which includes establishing secure corridors for aid convoys and conducting airdrops, is seen by analysts as a gesture to allies horrified by the starvation. However, critics and humanitarian groups remain skeptical, arguing that airdrops are insufficient and that only a full ceasefire and unrestricted land access can resolve the catastrophic situation.

          <p>A growing cyber threat known as "quishing" is exploiting the ubiquity of QR codes to scam millions of Americans. Hackers are placing malicious QR code stickers on everything from parking meters to mail, tricking people into visiting phishing websites that steal personal and financial information or download malware. The Federal Trade Commission has issued warnings about this tactic, noting that cybercriminals rely on the public's trust and the urgency of situations like paying for parking. Experts say these scams are on the rise as they are a low-effort, high-return tactic for criminals.</p>

          <p>Preparations are moving forward to refit a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet, donated by the Qatari royal family, for use as Air Force One by President Trump. The plane, valued at $400 million, will be used while new official presidential aircraft are being built and is slated to be donated to Trump's presidential library after his term. The arrangement has drawn scrutiny from Democrats, who cite constitutional rules preventing a president from accepting gifts from foreign states without congressional consent. The plane will require extensive and costly security and communication renovations before it can be used.</p>

          <p>During a private visit to Scotland, US President Donald Trump played golf at his Turnberry resort ahead of key trade talks with EU officials. The visit, however, was met with protests in both Turnberry and Edinburgh, where demonstrators gathered to express their opposition to his presence and policies. Protestors held signs with messages like "We don't negotiate with fascists," sending a clear message of disapproval. Despite the demonstrations, which were kept at a distance by a major security operation, the president's schedule, including meetings with UK and Scottish leaders, continued as planned.</p>

          <p>The United States and China are reportedly set to extend their current tariff truce by another 90 days during trade negotiations in Stockholm. This would continue the pause on most of the heavy tariffs the two economic giants have levied on each other's goods, which was set to expire in August. Sources indicate that while the extension prevents an immediate escalation of the trade war, the talks are unlikely to yield major breakthroughs on core issues like China's industrial overcapacity. The Chinese delegation is also expected to press the US on its tariffs related to fentanyl. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A protest on the Greek island of Syros against a visiting Israeli cruise ship has ignited a heated debate within Greece about the Gaza conflict and antisemitism. Around 300 demonstrators carrying Palestinian flags gathered at the port, leading the cruise line to prevent its 1,600 passengers from disembarking. The incident has highlighted a national divide, with some supporting the protest as a stance against the ongoing violence in Gaza, while others, including government officials, condemned it as harmful to tourism and potentially antisemitic. Opinion polls show Greek public opinion is split, though support for Israel has declined during the conflict.</p>

          <p>European leaders are escalating diplomatic efforts to address the "appalling" humanitarian situation in Gaza. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot stated that Gaza is on the brink of a food catastrophe and called for Israel to stop the GHF's operations, which he said caused a "bloodbath." Separately, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is expected to raise the urgent need for a ceasefire and increased aid access during his meeting with US President Donald Trump. These actions reflect growing international frustration with the ongoing conflict and its devastating impact on Gaza's civilian population.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent global trials of a four-day, 32-hour workweek have shown significant boosts in employee happiness and well-being. According to lead researcher Juliet Schor, this isn't just due to having more free time. A key factor is that the compressed schedule forces teams to become more efficient, cutting out busywork and focusing on high-impact tasks, which makes workers feel more effective and accomplished. This increased sense of productivity and control over their work-life balance leads to lower stress and higher job satisfaction, benefiting both employees and company profits.</p>
