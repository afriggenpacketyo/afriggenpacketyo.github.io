        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Novo Nordisk is undergoing a CEO change as Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen departs, prompted by increasing competition from Eli Lilly in the weight loss drug market. Eli Lilly's Zepbound is gaining market share over Novo Nordisk's Wegovy, leading to investor concerns and a significant drop in Novo Nordisk's stock value. The new CEO will face challenges including launching new weight loss drugs before patents expire, managing Medicare price negotiations, and navigating potential tariffs. Analysts are skeptical whether a new executive can resolve the company's challenges without a significant strategy shift, especially as other drugmakers enter the obesity treatment market.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled against the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP), declaring the actions unlawful. The ruling orders the reinstatement of USIP's acting president, George Moose, and criticizes the administration's takeover and termination of staff. Judge Howell stated that the administration's actions, including the use of force to seize USIP headquarters, were unconstitutional because the agency is not part of the executive branch. The USIP supports both the Executive and Legislative branches as an independent think tank.</p>

          <p>House Republicans plan to vote on a tax bill this week that includes tax cuts, border security, and defense spending, but internal disagreements persist. Conservative hardliners initially blocked the bill, demanding more cuts to clean energy subsidies and Medicaid.

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to remove protections from nearly 350,000 Venezuelan immigrants under the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program, pending appeal. The court's order permits the administration to proceed with deportations but preserves individual immigrants' ability to challenge the cancellation of their work permits. A lawyer representing the immigrants called the decision "truly shocking" and noted it as the largest single action stripping noncitizens of immigration status in modern U.S. history. The case originated after the homeland security secretary terminated an extension of TPS granted by the Biden administration, citing administrative procedures and racial bias.</p>

          <p>The article discusses how tax relief programs offered by the IRS can assist taxpayers struggling with past-due debt by reducing the total amount owed, pausing collection efforts, or making payments more manageable. Programs like Offers in Compromise, installment agreements, and penalty abatement are highlighted, but the article emphasizes that eligibility depends on financial circumstances and compliance with future tax obligations. While these programs can provide relief, they don't always eliminate the debt entirely, and taxpayers should be wary of scams and understand the potential consequences like liens or wage garnishments.

          <p>House Republicans are considering a proposal to eliminate federal income taxes on tips, a plan that has gained bipartisan support but also faces criticism. While tipped workers in the bottom 60% of the income distribution could receive an average tax cut of $1,260, some argue the policy would create disparities between tipped and non-tipped workers. Concerns have been raised about potential wage pressure on the service industry and whether the tax break would truly benefit lower-income individuals who already owe little in federal income taxes. The National Restaurant Association supports the policy, while some economists and budget hawks oppose it as another special tax exemption.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Treasury yields increased after Moody's downgraded the U.S.'s credit rating, citing concerns about the government's growing debt burden. The 30-year Treasury yield briefly topped 5%, reaching levels not seen since November 2023. The downgrade, attributed to the increasing burden of financing the government's budget deficit, prompted initial investor concerns. However, bond buying later in the session drove yields lower from their highs. The article also notes that loans for houses and credit cards track these rates.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 350,000 Venezuelan migrants living in the U.S., pending appeal.
