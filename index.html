          <p>The White House refutes claims that it disregarded a judge's order halting deportations to El Salvador.  261 individuals, allegedly gang members, were deported, some under a rarely used law.

          <p>Senator Adam Schiff dismissed President Trump's assertion that President Biden's pardons for the January 6th committee members are invalid. Trump's claim centers on the use of an autopen for signing the pardons. Schiff and other recipients of the pardons maintain their work was legitimate.</p>
