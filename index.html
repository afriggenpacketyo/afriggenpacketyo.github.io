          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and other semiconductor experts are questioning the effectiveness of U.S. chip export controls on China, suggesting they may be causing more harm to American businesses than to China's technological advancement. Huang noted that Nvidia's GPU market share in China has significantly decreased due to these restrictions. Experts argue that the curbs incentivize China to become self-sufficient in semiconductor technology, accelerating domestic innovation and the growth of local competitors like Huawei. The restrictions are expected to boost the demand and development of Chinese alternatives, leading to a closing of the gap between U.S. and Chinese AI capabilities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Illinois state lawmakers engaged in heated debates over the issue of transgender athletes participating in girls' sports, highlighting a growing political divide. The controversy intensified after a biological male won a girls' race in Naperville, sparking national outrage and prompting aggressive arguments in the General Assembly. Republican representatives condemned the Democrats' support for gender transitions for minors, while Democrats accused GOP colleagues of being "obsessed with children's genitalia." The debate included warnings of potential federal funding cuts for defying an executive order on trans athletes.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing a bill to invest $1,000 on behalf of every American baby born between January 1, 2025, and January 1, 2029, into accounts initially called "MAGA accounts" but later renamed "Trump accounts." The funds would be invested in financial markets, and proceeds could be withdrawn later for expenses like college or buying a house. Tax experts have raised questions about the accounts, noting that contributions would be made with post-tax income, and gains would also be taxed upon withdrawal, making them similar to typical investment accounts.</p>

Broader macro concerns, including Moody's recent downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, have also contributed to Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against fiat instability.

          <p>Experts are warning of potential tax rises in the UK after government borrowing figures for April were higher than expected, increasing the prospect of Chancellor Rachel Reeves raising taxes in the autumn. Government borrowing reached £20.2bn in April, up £1bn from the same month last year, marking the fourth highest April figure since monthly records began in 1993. Analysts suggest that Reeves may struggle to meet her self-imposed rules on spending and borrowing due to weaker economic growth forecasts and increased spending pressures.</p>

          <p>A former FBI counterintelligence agent turned whistleblower claims he tried to warn Elon Musk in 2022 that he was the target of a covert Russian campaign to infiltrate his inner circle. Johnathan Buma said he sought to "inoculate" Musk against "outreach from the Kremlin," but was unsuccessful. He believed individuals were being "placed" in Musk’s inner circle to gain influence and access to sensitive information. Musk was not under investigation and was not suspected of wrongdoing.</p>

          <p>Nike is set to raise prices on some trainers and clothing from June 1, following a similar warning from Adidas, due to a number of internal and external factors, including U.S. tariffs. The sportswear giant said it regularly makes "price adjustments," but did not explicitly name U.S. tariffs as a reason. Almost all of Nike's goods are made in Asia, a region targeted by President Donald Trump's tariffs.</p>

          <p>Southern California Edison is facing scrutiny and pushback from ratepayers over its plan to seek a 10% increase in electricity rates, particularly after the deadly Eaton fire. The utility's equipment may have played a role in sparking the fire. The proposed rate hike aims to fund wildfire mitigation and cover operational costs. Consumer advocates argue that Edison customers already pay high enough bills, and some have criticized recent bonuses given to Edison executives.</p>
