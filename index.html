          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, is under scrutiny for stating he doesn't need to buy rice due to ample supplies from supporters, amidst soaring rice prices affecting households. Eto made the comments during a fundraising party as his ministry explores measures to lower rice prices, including releasing government stockpiles. The average rice price has roughly doubled since last year due to a poor harvest, leading to public dissatisfaction with the government's handling of the situation. Eto has since expressed regret for his remarks, acknowledging they were excessive, while also vowing to strive for positive results as farm minister.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article argues that China is on the verge of surpassing the United States in global power due to its strategic investments in technology and infrastructure. The author suggests that the Trump administration's focus on tariffs and short-term trade gains is undermining America's long-term competitiveness. China leads in multiple industries and is projected to account for nearly half of global manufacturing by 2030, while the U.S. risks becoming a diminished nation behind tariff walls. The article urges the U.S. to invest in research, innovation, and global economic ties to avoid a Chinese-dominated future.</p>

          <p>Conservationists in Wales are using edible glitter to track endangered water voles, whose numbers have declined by 90% in the past 30 years. The glitter, mixed with apple, is intended to be consumed by the voles and then tracked in their droppings, allowing conservationists to monitor their movements and habitats. This innovative approach aims to provide crucial data for environmental adjustments and interventions to help the species disperse and survive. The team is testing the glitter on captive-bred water voles before wider implementation.</p>

          <p>A mass grave containing thousands of dinosaur bones has been discovered in Pipestone Creek, Canada, offering paleontologists a unique opportunity to study the Pachyrhinosaurus species. The site, nicknamed the "River of Death," is believed to be the result of a catastrophic flash flood that wiped out a migrating herd. Researchers are analyzing the bones to understand the dinosaurs' biology and the ancient ecosystem. The discovery features in a new BBC series, "Walking With Dinosaurs," bringing the prehistoric world to life.</p>

The downgrade, along with concerns about government debt, is threatening to disrupt financial markets. A bill in Congress to make Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent could add trillions to federal debt. The credit rating downgrade could shake the safe-haven status of Treasury bonds, potentially spurring global investors to demand higher premiums for U.S. debt.</p>
