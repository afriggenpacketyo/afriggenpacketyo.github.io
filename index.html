          <p>JPMorgan Chase is reportedly finalizing a deal to take over the Apple Card portfolio, a move that would see Goldman Sachs exit the high-profile partnership. For JPMorgan, the nation's largest credit card issuer, acquiring the business would further solidify its dominance in the financial sector. The transition follows a challenging period for Goldman Sachs, which faced profitability issues and regulatory scrutiny with the Apple Card since its 2019 launch. The deal would provide Apple with a more stable and experienced partner for its popular credit card service. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>PayPal's stock fell over 8% after its second-quarter earnings report, despite surpassing revenue and earnings expectations. Investors were concerned by slowing growth in transaction margin dollars, a crucial profitability metric, which overshadowed the positive results. The company also reported rising operating expenses and a significant drop in adjusted free cash flow compared to the previous quarter. While PayPal raised its full-year earnings forecast, the immediate market reaction focused on the signs of weakening momentum in its core business operations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Procter & Gamble reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that beat analyst expectations for both earnings and revenue. However, the company issued a cautious outlook for its 2026 fiscal year, warning that new tariffs would create a $1 billion pretax headwind. In response, P&G plans to implement mid-single-digit price increases on about a quarter of its products, including brands like Tide and Charmin. The guidance reflects ongoing economic volatility and a more selective, value-seeking consumer, creating uncertainty for the year ahead. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Union Pacific has proposed an $85 billion acquisition of Norfolk Southern, a deal that would create the first single-company transcontinental railroad in United States history. The merger aims to streamline national shipping by eliminating handoff delays between the western-focused Union Pacific and the eastern-based Norfolk Southern networks. While the companies argue this will improve efficiency and delivery times, the proposal faces significant scrutiny from antitrust regulators. The deal could also pressure the remaining major U.S. railroads, BNSF and CSX, to pursue a similar merger to remain competitive.</p>

          <h2>New Analysis Suggests Trump's Tariffs Could Raise U.S. Factory Costs by up to 4.5%</h2>

          <p>A new analysis indicates that President Trump's proposed tariff increases could significantly squeeze U.S. manufacturers by raising factory costs by an estimated 2% to 4.5%. The report from the Washington Center for Equitable Growth warns that for factories with slim profit margins, this cost increase could lead to wage stagnation, layoffs, or even plant closures. The analysis highlights the economic challenges of the tariff policy, particularly for sectors like computer and electronics manufacturing that are heavily dependent on imported components. This potential for domestic economic harm complicates the administration's goal of reviving American manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, is a degenerative brain disease associated with repeated head injuries, which has gained attention following the recent New York City mass shooting. The condition, which can only be definitively diagnosed through a post-mortem autopsy, causes symptoms like memory loss, confusion, and mood changes. It is most commonly found in military veterans and athletes in contact sports like football. The disease is characterized by a buildup of an abnormal protein called tau in the brain, and research on the condition is ongoing at institutions like Boston University's UNITE Brain Bank.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of at-risk Afghans who fled to Pakistan with promises of humanitarian admission to Germany are now living in limbo and fear deportation back to Afghanistan. These individuals, including journalists and activists, were accepted into a German program but have been stranded for up to two years by visa and security check delays. Their situation has become more precarious as Pakistan cracks down on undocumented migrants and Germany's new government reviews its refugee programs. Stranded Afghans report harassment by Pakistani authorities and express terror at the prospect of being forcibly returned to Taliban rule.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have found compelling evidence that the ancient Neolithic settlement of Catalhoyuk in modern-day Turkey was a society centered around women. DNA analysis of skeletons buried under homes revealed that households were formed on a matrilineal basis, with men moving in with the woman's family. This genetic evidence supports earlier archaeological theories based on female figurines found at the site. Further analysis showed that grave goods were found five times more frequently with female bodies than male ones, indicating women held an elevated societal status in the 9,000-year-old community.</p>

          <p>India, home to 75% of the world's wild tigers, has seen its population of the endangered animal rise to over 3,600, according to the latest census. This conservation success is tempered by significant ongoing risks, primarily the fragmentation of tiger habitats due to deforestation, agriculture, and infrastructure projects. These divisions isolate tiger populations, affecting their movement, breeding, and access to prey. While modern monitoring techniques have been adopted, conservationists warn that protecting the quality and connectivity of these habitats is crucial to securing the long-term survival of the species.</p>

          <p>A new report from five United Nations agencies projects that Africa will be home to nearly 60% of the world's hungry people by 2030, with the situation worsening. In 2024, over one in five people on the continent, approximately 307 million, were chronically undernourished. The crisis is being driven by a combination of widespread conflict, the impacts of extreme weather, high inflation, and national debt burdens that limit public spending. The report highlights that the cost of a healthy diet is rising faster in Africa than elsewhere, increasing rates of malnutrition and stunting.</p>

In a letter to Kennedy, the AMA urged him to retain the panel's members to ensure their non-partisan work can continue without interruption.

The birth is a significant event for the species, as fewer than 400 Sumatran tigers are estimated to remain in the wild due to habitat loss and poaching. The cubs were born to an 11-year-old mother, Terima, as part of a carefully managed European endangered species breeding program. The event brings new hope for the genetic diversity and survival of this rare tiger subspecies.</p>
