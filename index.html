          <p>Burberry plans to reduce approximately 1,700 roles globally by 2027 as part of organizational changes amidst a challenging macroeconomic environment. The luxury house's sales experienced a 6% decline in the fiscal fourth quarter, slightly better than analysts' expectations. CEO Joshua Schulman remains optimistic about Burberry's future, despite flagging geopolitical tensions and potential tariff risks. The company's sales fell across all regions, with Asia-Pacific experiencing the most significant weakness, marking a continued effort to turnaround the embattled luxury brand's performance.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump's administration has taken several actions that could hinder the growth of the renewable energy sector in the United States. These actions include pausing wind energy projects, proposing tariffs on imports from Southeast Asia, and attempting to repeal parts of the Inflation Reduction Act. These policies inject uncertainty into the clean energy sector, despite significant growth in recent years, driven by investments through the IRA. Experts believe that while renewable energy will continue to grow, the pace may be slower due to these challenges, potentially impacting the nation's competitiveness in the global clean energy market.</p>

          <p>Sony Group shares experienced a rise of over 2% amidst volatile trading after announcing a share buyback of up to 250 billion yen. The company's operating income for the last three months surpassed analyst estimates, despite a decrease from the previous year. Sony also detailed plans for a partial spinoff of its financial unit, with shareholders receiving the majority of shares through dividends. However, the company's outlook for the current financial year was subdued, forecasting a modest increase in operating profit partly due to the impact of tariffs.</p>

Researchers suggest these findings offer insight into current climate change, noting the ongoing reduction in Arctic and Antarctic ice. They emphasize the transition from a world with perennial glacier ice to one with seasonal ice, potentially shifting from a predominantly white winter planet to a blue one.</p>

          <p>The UK government's plan to tighten immigration rules on foreign workers is raising concerns among businesses about potential labor shortages, particularly in sectors like health and social care. The new proposals include stricter English-language requirements and a longer residency period before migrants can apply to stay indefinitely. While the government aims to prioritize British workers, businesses worry that Brits may not be able or willing to fill the gap, especially in roles traditionally reliant on migrant staff. The care industry, already facing a significant number of vacancies, is particularly vulnerable to the impact of these changes.</p>

Critics argue that the move is based on false narratives and propaganda, and that crime in South Africa affects everyone regardless of race. The decision has strained relations between Pretoria and Washington, and is seen by some as a way for Trump to position himself as a savior of white privilege. South African officials deny any persecution of white Afrikaners and insist the country's laws apply equally to all citizens.</p>

          <p>Iran has proposed a joint nuclear enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washingtonâ€™s demand that it dismantle its nuclear program. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi presented the idea to American special envoy Steve Witkoff during talks in Oman. The proposal entails Iran enriching uranium to a low grade and then shipping it to other Arab countries for civilian use, with the presence of international representatives for oversight.
