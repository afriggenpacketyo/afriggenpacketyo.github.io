          <p>Shares of UnitedHealth Group experienced their largest single-day jump in five years following the disclosure of a new, significant stake by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. The conglomerate purchased 5 million shares, valued at approximately $1.6 billion, providing a major vote of confidence in the insurer, whose stock had fallen nearly 50% this year. The company has been facing a Justice Department investigation and public criticism over rising healthcare costs, which led to a reduced earnings outlook. Analysts believe Buffett's investment could stabilize the stock and signal a turning point for the managed care sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Aviation Administration data, analyzed by CBS News, shows that helicopters frequently violated altitude limits or flew dangerously close to airplanes at Washington's Reagan National Airport in the year preceding a deadly midair collision. Encounters within 1,000 feet occurred multiple times daily, and one in ten helicopters on the specific route exceeded the altitude limit. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating why these near-daily warning signs did not lead to preventative action sooner from the FAA, airlines, or the military. The FAA has since halted mixed air traffic in the D.C. area and is using the data to implement safety changes at other airports nationwide.</p>

          <p>This article explores the financial implications of choosing between a $100,000 home equity loan and a home equity line of credit (HELOC) as the Federal Reserve considers another interest rate cut. With current rates for both products in the 8% range, the variable-rate nature of a HELOC may make it cheaper if rates fall, though this also introduces payment unpredictability. Conversely, a fixed-rate home equity loan offers stable, predictable payments but won't benefit from potential rate reductions. Homeowners are advised to consider not just the interest rates but also their personal financial stability and long-term goals before borrowing against their home's equity.

The potential nominees include former Fed officials, economists, and market strategists, many of whom advocate for lowering the central bank's benchmark interest rate. This article provides a brief overview of the viewpoints of several key candidates, such as Kevin Warsh, who calls for significant change, and James Bullard, who emphasizes Fed independence.

          <p>Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee has voiced a 'note of unease' regarding the prospect of lowering interest rates, citing mixed recent inflation data. While the July consumer price index was largely as expected, a surprisingly high producer price index, which measures wholesale costs, has introduced uncertainty. Goolsbee stated that he needs to see more convincing data to confirm that inflation is securely on a downward path before supporting a rate cut at the upcoming September meeting. The Federal Open Market Committee is closely monitoring these figures, as well as the potential inflationary impact of tariffs, to guide its next monetary policy decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Epping Forest District Council is seeking a High Court injunction to prevent The Bell Hotel from housing asylum seekers, arguing the situation poses an unacceptable risk to public safety. The legal action follows weeks of violent protests and disorder outside the hotel, which were reportedly triggered after a resident was charged with sexual assault. The council claims the protests have created great local anxiety and that the facility is no longer operating as a true hotel. Lawyers for the hotel's owners argue that an injunction would cause hardship for the asylum seekers and set a dangerous precedent.</p>

The country's two main producers, Vivergo Fuels and Ensus, warned that their businesses became commercially unviable after a recent trade deal allowed for tariff-free imports of U.S. ethanol. Associated British Foods, Vivergo's owner, stated the decision throws away a key national asset and will move clean energy jobs overseas. The government responded that direct funding was not in the national interest and would not solve the industry's long-term problems, but pledged to support affected workers.</p>

By securing a high-profile meeting on U.S. soil without making any concessions in the Ukraine war, Putin has been brought back onto the world stage after being treated as a global pariah. The author suggests President Trump's desire for a peacemaking legacy has led him to make concessions, such as dropping ultimatums and excluding Ukraine's president from the initial talks. This dynamic positions Putin to control the narrative and protract the conflict on his own terms.</p>

          <p>King Charles III and Queen Camilla joined 33 World War II veterans at the National Memorial Arboretum to mark the 80th anniversary of Victory over Japan Day. The event honored the service and sacrifice of those who fought in the Far East and Pacific, often referred to as the 'Forgotten Army.' In an audio message, the King paid tribute to their courage and the immense price paid by all involved, including the civilians of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The ceremony included wreath-layings, a two-minute silence, and a flypast by historic aircraft, serving as a solemn reminder of the war's true cost and the importance of remembrance.</p>

          <p>A jury has found Dartford Labour councillor Ricky Jones not guilty of encouraging violent disorder after he made inflammatory remarks at an anti-racism rally in 2024. During the counter-protest, Jones was filmed calling far-right demonstrators 'Nazi fascists' and making a throat-slitting gesture while saying 'we need to get rid of them all.' Jones, who has been suspended by the Labour Party, argued his comments were ill-advised but not intended to incite violence, claiming they referred to a separate incident involving razor blades hidden behind stickers. The verdict, reached in just over half an hour, has drawn criticism from some political figures.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In Bihar, India, where extreme heat and inadequate infrastructure lead to significant crop spoilage, solar-powered cold storage units are emerging as a vital solution for small-scale farmers. These facilities allow producers to store perishable goods like potatoes, fruits, and vegetables for weeks, enabling them to avoid forced sales at low prices and reduce waste. By running on solar power, the units overcome the challenges of unreliable electricity grids and costly diesel generators. While affordability remains a hurdle for individual farmers, proponents believe that community-based models and government subsidies can help scale this technology and improve agricultural resilience.</p>

          <p>The U.S. jewelry market continues to show robust growth, serving as a bright spot for brands like Pandora amid weaker consumer sentiment in Europe and China. Pandora reported an 8% rise in U.S. sales for the second quarter, highlighting the American consumer's continued willingness to spend on discretionary items. This trend contrasts sharply with declining sales in major European markets and challenges in China. However, the industry faces headwinds from potential tariffs, particularly on goods manufactured in Asia, as well as rising prices for precious metals like silver and gold, which could impact future demand.

          <p>Birmingham City Council is taking down numerous England and Union Jack flags that residents have hung on lampposts in what they describe as an act of patriotism. The council states the removal is necessary to carry out an upgrade of streetlights to energy-efficient LEDs and that the attachments must be cleared for the work to proceed safely. Officials also warned that adding unauthorized items to lampposts could compromise their structural integrity, posing a risk to the public. The action has been met with anger and confusion from some residents, who have started a fundraiser to purchase more flags.</p>

          <p>After leaving Texas for a month to block a Republican-led effort to redraw congressional maps, Democratic lawmakers have signaled they will likely return as the first special legislative session concludes. Their departure denied Republicans the quorum needed to pass the new maps, which were requested by Donald Trump and would add five GOP seats. Former President Barack Obama praised the Texas Democrats for their actions, which spurred other states like California to consider their own redistricting to offset the potential changes. Governor Greg Abbott has vowed to immediately call another special session, continuing the contentious political battle over the state's electoral boundaries.</p>

          <p>A new report from the advocacy group Climate Power reveals that Republican lawmakers who voted for a recent Trump-backed bill favoring the fossil fuel industry have accepted over $105 million in career donations from that sector. The legislation provides billions in giveaways to oil and gas companies while rolling back clean energy credits established by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The analysis highlights that many of these Republicans represent districts that have directly benefited from IRA investments in wind, solar, and battery manufacturing. Critics argue this demonstrates a clear conflict of interest, where political donations influence environmental and economic policy.</p>

          <p>A new documentary, 'It’s Never Over, Jeff Buckley,' sheds light on the late singer-songwriter's often-overlooked Latino roots through the perspective of his Panamanian-American mother, Mary Guibert. While much of Buckley's narrative has focused on his estranged and famous father, folk singer Tim Buckley, the film reveals his upbringing in a Latino household where he was affectionately called 'El Viejito.' Guibert shares intimate details of raising her son alone, their strong bond, and her role as the curator of his musical legacy since his tragic death in 1997. The film offers a more complete portrait of the artist whose only studio album, 'Grace,' continues to gain acclaim.</p>

          <p>Severe monsoon rains have triggered devastating flash floods and landslides across northern Pakistan and India-administered Kashmir, resulting in the deaths of more than 170 people. In Pakistan, at least 116 people have died, with the mountainous Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province being the hardest hit, and a rescue helicopter crashed in the adverse weather, killing five crew members. In India, a remote Himalayan village crowded with pilgrims was struck by flooding that killed at least 60 people, with hundreds more missing. Experts attribute the increasing frequency and intensity of these extreme weather events, known as cloudbursts, to the effects of climate change.</p>
