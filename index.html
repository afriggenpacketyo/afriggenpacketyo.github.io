          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is permanently ending the distribution of data from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager Sounder (SSMIS), a critical tool for hurricane forecasting. This system provides essential microwave data that allows meteorologists to see through cloud cover and analyze a storm's internal structure, which is vital for predicting intensity changes, especially overnight. Forecasters and atmospheric scientists have expressed alarm, warning that losing this data, which accounts for nearly half of all microwave instruments, will significantly degrade forecast accuracy and public safety.</p>

          <p>Clashes erupted in Belgrade between riot police and anti-government protesters who are demanding snap parliamentary elections and an end to President Aleksandar Vucic's rule. The demonstrations, which have been ongoing for months, were initially sparked by a deadly train station collapse blamed on government corruption and have since been driven largely by students. Protesters issued an ultimatum for early elections or threatened a campaign of civil disobedience, while Vucic has rejected their demands and accused foreign powers of fueling the unrest.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied another attempt by former President Donald Trump to have a defamation lawsuit filed by the exonerated men formerly known as the Central Park Five dismissed. The lawsuit stems from statements Trump made alleging the men were guilty of a crime for which they were later exonerated. The judge ruled that Pennsylvania's Anti-SLAPP statute, designed to protect against lawsuits targeting free speech, does not apply in federal court, allowing the case against Trump to proceed.</p>

          <p>Hundreds gathered for the funeral of former Minnesota House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, who were killed in a targeted shooting. The service, attended by figures like Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, featured a eulogy from Governor Tim Walz, who remembered Hortman as Minnesota's "most consequential speaker." The attack, which also seriously wounded another state senator and his wife, was allegedly carried out by a man who has since been arrested.</p>
