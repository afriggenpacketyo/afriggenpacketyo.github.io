          <p>China is intensifying its efforts to combat "involution," a term for destructive, low-quality price competition, but the campaign is unlikely to match the scale of the 2015 supply-side reforms. According to analysis from Oxford Economics, investor expectations for a major economic shift are misplaced, as the current environment makes it difficult for Beijing to implement significant production capacity cuts or provide meaningful demand stimulus. This suggests the path to resolving China's supply-demand imbalances will be more complex than in the past, creating uncertainty for future growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla's board of directors has unveiled a new long-term compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk that could potentially make him the world's first trillionaire. The package ties his earnings to achieving aggressive growth targets, including increasing Tesla's market capitalization to at least $8.5 trillion by 2035. This proposal, which requires shareholder approval, is designed to incentivize Musk to remain with the company and steer its focus toward AI and robotics. The plan has drawn criticism for its immense scale and potential implications for corporate governance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A significant fire occurred at the BBC's former Television Centre headquarters in West London, requiring approximately 100 firefighters and 15 engines to control the blaze. The fire started in a restaurant located within the nine-story building, which now also contains apartments and television studios. Residents from an unspecified number of homes were evacuated as a precautionary measure, with a local rest center established to assist them. No casualties have been reported, and the cause of the fire is currently under investigation by the London Fire Brigade.</p>

Manager Steve Clarke praised his team's work rate and resilience in a performance that puts one of their main group rivals on the back foot early in the tournament. Despite several players having limited club game time this season, the team demonstrated significant grit and defensive solidity. This result provides a hopeful foundation for Scotland as they aim to qualify for their first World Cup since 1998.</p>

          <p>Thirty years ago, Colombian goalkeeper Rene Higuita performed the legendary "scorpion kick" save during a friendly match against England at Wembley Stadium. This audacious move, where he cleared the ball by diving forward and kicking it with his heels over his back, cemented his legacy as one of football's most flamboyant and unconventional players. Known as 'El Loco' (The Madman), Higuita was a pioneer of the sweeper-keeper role, famous for his risk-taking style, goal-scoring abilities, and a career that was as controversial as it was brilliant.

          <p>The Durham City Council in North Carolina has unanimously passed a resolution declaring the city a "Fourth Amendment Workplace," aimed at protecting undocumented immigrant workers from federal immigration enforcement. The measure instructs city staff to uphold protections against unreasonable searches and seizures and to report any barriers to doing so. This move is a response to recent U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in the area that has caused fear within the migrant community. The resolution reflects the city's stance of not cooperating with federal immigration raids and arrests.</p>

While crime has decreased significantly over the past two years, overall levels remain high compared to other major U.S. cities, a fact Trump has cited to justify the potential military presence. Local Democratic leaders, including the Illinois Governor, have strongly opposed the move, vowing to resist what they describe as a political stunt.

He then fraudulently claimed over £466,000 from insurance companies, lying about the cause of his condition.

          <p>Yi Huiman, who served as the chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) from 2019 to 2024, is under investigation for "severe breaches of discipline." The probe, announced by the Communist Party's top anti-graft agency, marks a significant development in China's ongoing anti-corruption campaign within its financial sector. Yi is the second head of China's US$12 trillion capital market to be investigated for graft in the last decade. The investigation underscores Beijing's commitment to rooting out corruption at all levels of its financial and regulatory bodies.</p>

          <p>A report that U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to announce a potential link between the use of Tylenol during pregnancy and autism in children has sparked immediate controversy. The Department of Health and Human Services has labeled the report as "speculation," urging the public to wait for the final scientific findings. Medical organizations like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists maintain there is no clear evidence of a direct relationship, emphasizing that acetaminophen remains one of the few safe pain relief options for pregnant people. The speculation has already impacted the stock price of Tylenol-maker Kenvue.</p>

          <p>China is actively engaging in party-to-party diplomacy, a key component of its foreign policy strategy, as demonstrated by President Xi Jinping's recent meetings with leaders from the world's other four ruling communist parties. This outreach is managed by the Communist Party’s International Department, which has established connections with over 600 political parties globally. While distinct from the state-level diplomacy conducted by the foreign ministry, these party-level interactions serve as an important channel for China to strengthen relationships and exert influence, particularly with ideologically aligned nations.</p>

          <p>A large-scale immigration raid at a Hyundai battery plant in Georgia resulted in the arrest of 475 workers, primarily South Korean citizens, for allegedly working illegally in violation of their visitor visas. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) stated the operation was part of an ongoing criminal investigation and necessary to protect American jobs. The raid has prompted a diplomatic response from South Korea, which has called for its citizens' rights to be respected. Hyundai and its partner LG Energy Solution stated that none of the arrested individuals were directly employed by them.</p>

          <p>A brush fire, named the Pyrite fire, ignited near Jurupa Valley in California's Inland Empire, quickly growing to 200 acres and forcing evacuation orders for nearby communities. The fire started in an area with light, easily flammable fuels, and its rapid spread prompted a significant response from nearly 300 firefighting personnel, supported by engines and helicopters. An evacuation center has been established at a local high school for affected residents. The fire burned towards the San Bernardino County line, causing road closures and visible smoke throughout the region.</p>

          <p>Shares of Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, fell sharply after a report suggested that an upcoming U.S. federal health report might link the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy to autism. In response, Kenvue asserted its belief that there is no causal link and that the medication is safe when used as directed, a position supported by the FDA and leading medical groups. The Department of Health and Human Services has called the report's claims "speculation" ahead of its official release. This development occurs amid ongoing lawsuits against the company and inconclusive scientific research on the topic.</p>

          <p>NeueHouse, a members-only co-working club with locations in Los Angeles and New York City, has abruptly ceased operations, citing significant financial challenges and legacy liabilities. The company gave members and employees less than 48 hours' notice before shutting down, leaving many who had recently paid for expensive annual memberships frustrated and staff without severance pay. The closure reflects the broader struggles within the co-working industry, which has faced difficulties maintaining profitability. NeueHouse had aimed to blend shared office space with the exclusive amenities of a private social club.</p>

          <p>For the second time in two days, Venezuelan military aircraft have flown in close proximity to a U.S. Navy destroyer, the USS Jason Dunham, in international waters. Pentagon officials described the actions of the F-16 fighter jets as a "highly provocative move" and a "game of chicken" designed to interfere with U.S. counter-narcotics operations in the region. The U.S. warship did not engage the aircraft, though they were within weapons range. The incident escalates tensions between the two nations, following President Trump's recent comments about potential U.S. responses to such actions.</p>
