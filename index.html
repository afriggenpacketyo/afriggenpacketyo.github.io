          <p>The Supreme Court has rejected conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' appeal, leaving in place the $1.4 billion defamation judgment against him for falsely claiming the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was a hoax. Jones had argued against being found liable without a trial on the merits, but the justices issued their order without comment. Relatives of the victims expressed satisfaction, looking forward to enforcing the verdict as Jones continues to appeal related judgments.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice seized approximately $15 billion in Bitcoin, the largest forfeiture action in its history, and unsealed an indictment against Chen Zhi. Zhi, founder of Cambodia's Prince Holding Group, is accused of masterminding a vast "pig butchering" cryptocurrency fraud operation that involved forced labor compounds. Victims were duped into transferring crypto with false promises of profits, while hundreds were trafficked and forced to work under threat of violence.</p>

          <p>Hamas has returned the remains of four more deceased hostages to Israel, bringing the total to eight, as part of the ongoing ceasefire agreement. This transfer occurred after Israel warned of aid restrictions to Gaza if all 28 deceased hostages were not repatriated, testing the fragile ceasefire. While all living hostages were returned earlier, the delay in locating and returning all bodies has raised concerns among Palestinians about the ceasefire's future and potential renewed conflict.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has revoked the visas of six individuals from various countries for making "incendiary social media comments" celebrating the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The State Department asserted that the U.S. has no obligation to host foreigners who wish death upon Americans, despite legal questions surrounding the government's power to revoke visas based on speech. This action is part of a broader crackdown on posts mocking or praising Kirk's death.</p>

          <p>The UK Labour government is under increasing pressure from Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties to publicly release evidence from the recently collapsed case against two individuals accused of spying for China. Prosecutors dropped the case due to a lack of government evidence regarding China being deemed a national security threat at the time of the alleged offenses. Opposition parties demand transparency, suggesting the government may be "hiding" something or "appeasing China."</p>
