          <p>European Union and Chinese leaders are preparing for a summit in Beijing with minimal expectations for major breakthroughs. Recent friction over trade and China's diplomatic support for Russia have soured relations, leading to the cancellation of the summit's second day. The only anticipated outcome is a joint statement on climate issues, which itself was subject to difficult negotiations. The low bar for success reflects the growing strain and numerous points of contention in the complex relationship between the two global powers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's headline inflation remained steady at a four-year low of 0.8% in June, falling slightly below economists' expectations. This sustained low inflation, along with unchanged core inflation, gives the Monetary Authority of Singapore flexibility to potentially ease its monetary policy. The central bank aims to support economic growth in the face of an uncertain global trade environment and subdued domestic growth forecasts. Analysts note the monetary authority appears concerned about the future impact of global economic softening and trade tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>German High Court Confirms Far-Right AfD's 'Suspected Extremist' Classification</h2>

          <p>Germany's top administrative court has finalized the classification of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party as a "suspected right-wing extremist" group. This ruling allows the country's domestic intelligence agency, the BfV, to continue monitoring the party, which may include the use of undercover informants. The court upheld a previous decision that found sufficient evidence of anti-democratic tendencies within the AfD, particularly regarding the legal status of German citizens with immigrant backgrounds. This decision marks a significant legal setback for the prominent opposition party.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a frustrating 10-7 defeat against the Minnesota Twins, marked by a catastrophic bullpen performance. After a solid start from Yoshinobu Yamamoto, the relief pitchers struggled with command, issuing numerous walks that led to six runs for the Twins in the sixth and seventh innings. The sloppy play, including a costly error on a throw to first, compounded the team's recent slump. The loss highlights the significant challenges facing the Dodgers' injury-plagued bullpen, contributing to one of their most dismal defeats of the season.</p>

          <p>Actor Jeff Daniels has once again spoken out against Donald Trump and his supporters, issuing a pointed message on a recent podcast. Daniels argued that the president's policies, particularly tariffs, will ultimately harm the very people who voted for him, stating, "I hope you’re losing tons of money." He characterized the president as a "snake oil salesman" and suggested that rising costs for everyday goods would eventually turn voters against him. The White House responded by calling Daniels an "out-of-touch left-wing Hollywood clown" and touted the country's economic performance under the administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists analyzing a 13-million-year-old fossil have concluded that a formidable "terror bird" was likely killed or scavenged by an even larger predator. Bite marks on the fossilized leg bone, discovered in Colombia's Tatacoa Desert, were matched to an extinct 5-meter-long caiman species. Terror birds were apex predators themselves, standing taller than humans with powerful beaks. This rare evidence of an interaction between two top predators provides new insight into the ancient ecosystem, revealing that even these fearsome birds were vulnerable in their swampy habitat.</p>

          <p>In a rare move, federal judges in New Jersey voted to sideline interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, a personal attorney to President Trump who was appointed to the role. The judges installed her top assistant, career prosecutor Desiree Leigh Grace, to lead the office. However, just hours later, the Department of Justice ousted Grace, with a top official accusing the "rogue judges" of undermining the president's authority. The rapid sequence of events highlights a significant clash between the judiciary and the executive branch over the leadership of a key federal prosecutor's office.</p>

          <p>Following Bryan Kohberger's guilty plea for the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students, the community is left grappling with unresolved questions, most notably the motive for the crime.

The case attracted intense national media attention and spawned rampant online speculation, leaving a lasting scar on the close-knit college town. While the legal chapter is closing, the mystery of why the criminology student committed the brutal stabbings remains.</p>

          <p>Economic experts are urging Chinese companies to become more deeply integrated with local economies in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). This advice comes as the United States intensifies its crackdown on transshipments, where goods from China are rerouted through other countries to avoid high tariffs. With the US imposing steep levies on such diverted imports, simply using Asean nations as assembly points is becoming riskier. Deeper integration and establishing genuine local operations would offer Chinese businesses more stability and protection from unpredictable US trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>
