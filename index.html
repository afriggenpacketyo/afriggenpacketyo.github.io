          <p>At least 69 people, including many children, have died after catastrophic flash floods struck Texas Hill Country. The Guadalupe River rose with unprecedented speed, devastating communities and a children's summer camp, Camp Mystic, where campers and a counselor remain missing. A major disaster declaration has been signed as extensive search and rescue operations, involving over 160 air rescues, continue for dozens of unaccounted-for individuals. Officials were caught off guard by the flood's intensity, which surpassed forecasts and historical records, leaving a long road to recovery.</p>

          <p>Leaders of the BRICS nations are poised to issue a statement condemning recent military strikes on Iran, expressing "grave concern" and calling for de-escalation in the Middle East. According to a draft of the document, the bloc will avoid directly blaming the United States or Israel for the attacks, opting for broader calls for peace. The statement also reiterates support for a two-state solution for Palestine and criticizes Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory and the Syrian Golan Heights. This reflects a diplomatic balancing act within the expanding international bloc.</p>

          <p>Indirect ceasefire negotiations between Israeli and Hamas representatives are scheduled to restart in Doha, Qatar, even as Israeli airstrikes continue across the Gaza Strip. Recent attacks have resulted in at least 38 Palestinian fatalities, including in areas designated for displaced people. The talks will focus on a U.S.-backed proposal for an initial 60-day truce involving a hostage-for-prisoner exchange and increased humanitarian aid. However, significant obstacles remain, as Hamas seeks a permanent end to the war while Israel insists on retaining the ability to eliminate Hamas's capabilities.</p>

          <p>Military experts writing in the official newspaper of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) have argued for significant structural changes to effectively counter modern drone threats. They suggest that the Chinese military will likely need to establish specialized counter-drone units capable of rapid response, as traditional units are not efficiently equipped for this task. The analysis, which references the crucial role of drones in recent conflicts like the war in Ukraine, proposes upgrading existing electronic warfare units with AI-driven analysis and mobile jamming capabilities to better address the evolving nature of aerial combat.</p>

          <p>Acclaimed documentary filmmaker Ken Burns has described the White House's efforts to eliminate federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting as "shortsighted" and "misguided." In a recent interview, Burns argued that defunding public media entities like PBS and NPR would disproportionately harm rural areas where they may be the only available broadcast signal. He emphasized that PBS provides essential services beyond arts programming, including children's shows, continuing education, and emergency information, and that his own extensive historical films would not have been possible without the public broadcaster's support.</p>

The site, which contains ceremonial temples and residential structures, is seen as important for understanding the societal evolution following the decline of the Caral, the Americas' oldest known civilization.

Phrases like "Why don't you just..." and "To be honest..." can imply criticism or condescension, even when the speaker's intent is to be helpful or transparent. The article suggests alternative phrasing that promotes curiosity and collaboration, such as asking "What have you tried so far?" instead of offering an immediate solution.
