            <p>President Trump has escalated his attacks on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, labeling him a "major loser" and asserting that the U.S. economy risks slowing down if interest rates are not promptly lowered. Trump argues that low inflation justifies preemptive rate cuts, while advisors debate the legality of removing Powell before his term expires. Experts warn that any attempt to undermine Fed independence could trigger significant market instability, including higher yields, a weaker dollar, and equity sell-offs, highlighting the delicate balance between political pressure and economic stability.

The discovery was made using a remotely operated camera as part of a NOAA Ocean Exploration mission in the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument. The vehicle appears to be a 1940-41 Ford Super Deluxe "Woody," and theories suggest it may have been Rear Admiral Frank Fletcher's flag car or brought aboard for repairs. The USS Yorktown, known as the "Fighting Lady," played a significant role in the Pacific campaign during World War II before sinking in 1942.</p>

            <p>President Trump's economic approval rating has fallen to its lowest point amid discontent over tariffs, inflation, and government spending, according to a CNBC survey. The boost in economic optimism following Trump's reelection has waned, with more Americans anticipating a worsening economy and a pessimistic outlook on the stock market. While Trump's Republican base remains supportive, Democrats and independents express increased negativity towards his economic policies. The public disapproves of tariffs and inflation, and a majority believe a recession is imminent, raising concerns about the administration's economic strategies.</p>

The case, *Kennedy v.

Justices Kavanaugh and Barrett seemed inclined to vote against undermining Obamacare, while Justices Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch appeared sympathetic to the challenge.

            <p>Gold prices have surged to a new record, surpassing $3,400, as President Trump's criticism of the Federal Reserve and his tariff policies shake investor confidence. The price of gold futures has increased significantly, driven by investors seeking a safe haven amid economic uncertainty. Trump's pressure on Fed Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates has further fueled concerns, leading to a weaker dollar and increased demand for gold.
