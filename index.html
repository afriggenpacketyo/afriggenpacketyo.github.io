          <p>South Korean memory chipmaker SK Hynix has announced its readiness to mass produce next-generation HBM4 chips, which are critical for advanced artificial intelligence computing, including Nvidia's highly anticipated Rubin architecture. This significant technological advancement positions SK Hynix ahead of its main rivals, Samsung Electronics and Micron Technologies, in the competitive high-bandwidth memory market. The news has propelled the company's stock to an impressive rally, increasing its market capitalization by over $80 billion since the beginning of the year. SK Hynix expects to double its HBM sales for the current year compared to 2024, forecasting continued robust demand from the AI sector well into 2026, underscoring its pivotal role in the global technology landscape.

          <p>Scottish Secretary Douglas Alexander conveyed the despondency among Labour MPs after a tumultuous week marked by Lord Mandelson's dismissal as US ambassador and Angela Rayner's resignation. Mandelson was removed due to new information surfacing about his extensive friendship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, despite his association being publicly known at the time of his appointment. This incident has sparked intense scrutiny over the government's vetting processes and raises serious questions about Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's judgment. The political fallout creates significant challenges for the Labour government, especially with a US presidential visit imminent, as opposition parties demand accountability and procedural reviews.</p>

          <p>Emerging Chinese robotics firms are rapidly expanding their global technological footprint by effectively utilizing mature supply chains and swift product iteration cycles. Shenzhen-based Yarbo exemplifies this trend with its advanced hybrid snow-blowing and lawn-mowing robots, engineered for extreme cold and heavy blizzards. The company has successfully raised over $3.45 million on Kickstarter, a record for consumer robots, and delivered its initial 1,000 units, demonstrating its capability to scale complex consumer-grade products. Innovations like self-heating batteries and wireless charging have secured more than 6,000 presale orders, positioning these firms to compete fiercely on technology and speed in the international market.</p>

Shares of Vestas Wind notably tumbled over 4% after the US Interior Secretary stated that offshore wind would not be a source of electricity under a potential Donald Trump presidency, signaling a policy shift. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank maintained its key interest rate, and the Bank of England is set to update its monetary policy next week amidst the UK's economic stagnation. Investors are also keenly awaiting the US Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, where a 25-basis-point rate cut is widely anticipated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>More than 300 South Korean workers, who were detained in a significant immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia, have arrived back home, an incident that has strained US-South Korea relations. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and Hyundai's chief executive expressed deep concerns about the raid's impact on future US investments, noting that the workers' departure was delayed by a White House directive. South Korea's foreign ministry has called for US Congress to support a new visa category for Korean firms, while Hyundai anticipates a two to three-month delay in the factory's opening due to the need to replace workers. The episode highlights the complexities of international labor and investment policies.</p>

          <p>The UK economy's growth flatlined in July, with production output contracting significantly while services and construction saw only marginal increases, signaling an expected slowdown in the latter half of 2025. This stagnation adds pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead of the Autumn Budget, as she aims to ensure spending is funded by tax receipts and reduce national debt. The Bank of England is simultaneously navigating persistent inflation and fiscal uncertainties, with a rate cut anticipated in November despite a recent hawkish decision. Economists warn that temporary factors boosting earlier growth are fading, making future economic momentum challenging amidst potential tax hikes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks ended their season with a decisive 103-75 blowout loss to the Las Vegas Aces, failing to achieve a winning record and missing the postseason for the first time since 2020. A'ja Wilson, Jewell Loyd, and Chelsea Gray spearheaded the Aces' dominant victory, with the team setting a WNBA regular-season record by hitting 22 three-pointers. Despite the efforts of former Aces players Dearica Hamby and Kelsey Plum, the short-handed Sparks were ultimately overwhelmed by their opponents' offensive power.

          <p>China has emerged as the foremost foreign investor in Thailand's burgeoning Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) industrial cluster, committing a substantial $8.4 billion between 2019 and 2024. This significant investment, which includes Chinese participation in building a 220km high-speed railway line and potential "aerotropolis" development, underscores China's expanding economic influence in Southeast Asia through its Belt and Road Initiative. The EEC, encompassing three provinces south of Bangkok, is a state-fostered hub for industrial growth. While Thailand remains the largest overall investor, China's leading foreign position highlights deepening economic ties and strategic infrastructure development in the region.

          <p>This article critically examines Washington's industrial policy, asserting that attempts to reindustrialize and contain China will ultimately harm the United States and its allies while disrupting global trade. It highlights the inherent contradiction between President Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric and his industrial goals, citing the recent raid on a Hyundai-LG battery plant in Georgia where hundreds of South Korean technicians were detained. Many of these workers reportedly lacked proper work visas, filling roles that American contractors struggled to staff. The piece argues that this incident, combined with previous efforts to reshore manufacturing, exposes the futility of current US industrial policy amidst a broader trade and tech war with China.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has issued a stern warning to Mexico, urging it to "think twice" before implementing planned tariff hikes of up to 50% on Asia-made cars, particularly from China, and threatening countermeasures. Mexico's Secretary of Economy, Marcelo Ebrard, stated the proposed duties require Congressional approval and would take effect 30 days later. China views this move as potentially sacrificing third-party interests amid ongoing trade tensions with the US, advocating for the safeguarding of free trade. The tariffs could impact Mexico's auto industry, which is its largest employer, and come as Chinese auto parts manufacturers have invested billions in the country. (not investment advice)</p>

The legislation, which allows for buildings up to nine stories adjacent to certain transit stops, aims to tackle the state's severe housing affordability crisis. Critics argue that the bill represents an overreach, stripping local authorities of their ability to manage responsible growth and potentially altering single-family communities. However, the bill gained crucial momentum after a powerful labor group reversed its opposition in exchange for amendments ensuring union hiring on specific projects, boosting its prospects of becoming law.</p>
