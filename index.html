          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, facing intense questioning about several high-profile issues. Senators grilled him on the handling of the investigation into Charlie Kirk's assassination, the decision not to release more files related to Jeffrey Epstein, and his overall leadership of the bureau. The hearing was marked by a heated exchange with Senator Cory Booker, who accused Patel of making the country less safe and predicted his tenure would be short. Patel defended his actions, particularly his transparency during the Kirk investigation, which led to a suspect's capture in under 36 hours.</p>

          <p>The UK government has revealed that Peter Mandelson was not subjected to in-depth national security vetting before his appointment as ambassador to the United States was publicly announced. In a letter to MPs, the Foreign Office stated that the Cabinet Office conducted a "due diligence" process, but the full security clearance occurred only after he was already selected for the high-profile diplomatic post. This disclosure has intensified criticism over the selection process, particularly given the subsequent scandal over his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein that led to his dismissal. Critics argue proper scrutiny could have prevented the controversy.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's second official state visit to the United Kingdom is occurring at an awkward political moment for his host, Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The trip is overshadowed by Starmer's recent firing of UK Ambassador Peter Mandelson following revelations about his extensive correspondence and friendship with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The dismissal has brought renewed attention to Epstein's network, including President Trump's own past association with the financier. While the visit includes royal pageantry, it highlights political divisions in both nations and puts both leaders in a diplomatically challenging position.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows Renewable Energy Sources Are Most Cost-Effective Despite Policy Shifts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 13:28:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of energy production costs reveals that renewables like onshore wind and utility-scale solar remain the most affordable options, even before accounting for government subsidies. The Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) benchmark shows these sources are cheaper to generate than coal, natural gas, or nuclear power, primarily due to lower operating expenses after initial capital investment. However, the report notes that recent Trump administration policies, including new tariffs and the phasing out of clean energy tax credits, are set to increase costs for renewable projects.

          <p>A deep-dive article revisits the 1979 disappearance of 6-year-old Etan Patz in New York City, a case that transformed national awareness of missing children. The story recounts the decades of investigation, the initial focus on suspect Jose Ramos, and the emotional toll on the Patz family and law enforcement. A major breakthrough occurred in 2012 when a tip led police to Pedro Hernandez, a former corner store worker who confessed to the crime. Despite challenges to his confession based on his psychiatric condition, Hernandez was ultimately convicted in a second trial, bringing a long-awaited, albeit somber, conclusion to the case.</p>

          <p>House GOP leaders have introduced a plan to fund the government until November 21, aiming to prevent a shutdown at the end of September. The short-term continuing resolution maintains current funding levels and includes an additional $88 million for security for lawmakers and other federal officials, a response to the recent assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The proposal faces a difficult path, as Democrats are demanding the extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies and a reversal of Medicaid cuts. With a slim majority in the House and a 60-vote threshold in the Senate, Republican leaders require near-unanimous party support and some Democratic cooperation.</p>

The Foreign Secretary indicated that her department was not asked to contribute to the initial due diligence process conducted by the Cabinet Office, shifting focus onto the Prime Minister's office.

          <p>For homeowners with a reverse mortgage, a critical but often overlooked guideline is the "6-month rule," which dictates the timeline for heirs after the borrower's death or permanent departure from the home. Once a qualifying event occurs, lenders issue a "Due and Payable" letter, giving the family six months to repay the loan balance, typically by selling the property or refinancing. This rule, applicable to federally insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs), underscores the need for borrowers to engage in careful estate planning to avoid forcing their heirs into a stressful, time-sensitive situation or potential foreclosure.

The survey highlights concerns that pressuring the central bank for short-term political gains could undermine the long-term stability of the U.S. economy.

          <p>Robert Redford, the charismatic actor, Oscar-winning director, and champion of independent film, has died at age 89. Redford became a Hollywood icon with defining roles in "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," "The Way We Were," and "All the President's Men." He later transitioned to directing, winning an Academy Award for "Ordinary People." His most enduring legacy may be the Sundance Institute and its film festival, which he founded to nurture emerging filmmakers and has since become a vital force in the industry. Redford was also a dedicated environmentalist and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016 for his cultural contributions.</p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have launched an intensified ground operation in Gaza City, which an IDF spokesperson estimated could take months to fully control and clear of Hamas infrastructure. The offensive has prompted the Palestinian Authority to call for urgent international intervention to protect civilians, describing the situation as an attempt to turn the city into a "mass grave." Israeli military leaders have called the expansion of the ground operation a move of "decisive importance" in the war. President Trump commented that Hamas would be in "big trouble" if it used hostages as human shields during the conflict.</p>

          <p>An Eritrean man who arrived in the UK via a small boat has launched the first legal challenge against the new "one in, one out" migrant returns deal between the UK and France. His lawyers argued in the High Court that he faces a "real risk of destitution" if deported to France, where he claims there is no support for asylum seekers. The Home Office countered that he could and should have claimed asylum in France. The case represents a significant test for the pilot scheme, which was designed to allow the UK to return certain migrants to France in exchange for accepting vetted refugees.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two years after a historic strike, the actors' union SAG-AFTRA has formally established a fund to distribute streaming revenue to a wider pool of performers. The "Success Distribution Fund," a key negotiation point, will collect 25% of bonuses generated when a high-budget streaming show meets specific viewership thresholds. This creates a secondary income stream for actors on popular shows and, for the first time, will also benefit stunt performers and background actors who meet a work-day minimum. The initiative, championed by outgoing president Fran Drescher, aims to make careers more sustainable in the streaming era where traditional syndication residuals are absent.</p>

A deep-sea diving team retrieved items including the ship's bell, a navigation light, and silver-plated first-class trays from the vessel, which lies nearly 400 feet deep in the Aegean Sea. The Britannic, originally a luxury liner, was serving as a hospital ship in World War I when it struck a mine and sank.

          <p>The recent assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has led to professional repercussions for several individuals who made public comments about his death. A sports reporter, a political analyst, a university employee, and a Secret Service agent are among those who have been fired or placed on leave by their employers for remarks deemed inappropriate or insensitive. Legal experts note that private companies generally have the right to terminate employees for public statements that could harm the business's reputation or violate workplace policies. The incidents highlight the growing scrutiny of employees' off-duty conduct and speech in a politically polarized environment.</p>

          <p>A public inquiry into the Southport attack heard that a teacher expressed frustration over the "frightening red tape" that hindered interventions for the killer, Axel Rudakubana. An email from a school safeguarding lead revealed difficulties in getting police, social services, and mental health agencies to act, despite Rudakubana's history of violence and carrying knives. The inquiry is examining whether various agencies, including the Prevent counter-extremism program and MI5, failed to take ownership of his case. Lead counsel noted the system's failure to assess the overall risk he posed before he murdered three young girls at a dance studio.</p>

          <p>According to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, President Donald Trump's credible willingness to let TikTok "go dark" in the United States was the key factor that motivated China to agree to a deal framework. Bessent stated that the commercial terms had been largely settled for months but were put on hold by China after Trump's tariff announcements. He explained that the President made it clear that national security would not be compromised for a deal, which ultimately "turned the tide" in negotiations. This pressure led to the current framework that aims to resolve the ownership and data security concerns surrounding the popular social media app.</p>

Using his role as Bob Woodward in "All the President's Men" as a prime example, it highlights his ability to convey process and professionalism.
