        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Members of the Texas National Guard have arrived in Illinois, prompting strong condemnation from state and local leaders who view the deployment as an authoritarian move by the Trump administration. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson have criticized the action as unconstitutional and dangerous, filing a lawsuit to block the federalization of the guard. The deployment comes amid a heated debate over the use of military personnel in American cities, with federal officials citing the need to protect federal property while local leaders argue there is no crime emergency to justify such a measure. The conflict highlights the deep political divisions surrounding federal authority and state governance.</p>

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs defensive tackle Chris Jones is facing public scrutiny for his apparent lack of effort during a critical play in a 31-28 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars. On the game-winning touchdown, Jaguars' quarterback Trevor Lawrence stumbled but recovered to score, while footage showed Jones stopping his pursuit of the play. Jones acknowledged postgame that the defense needed to finish the play, but fans and analysts have heavily criticized his on-field actions. The incident compounds a frustrating season for the 2-3 Chiefs, with quarterback Patrick Mahomes lamenting the team's self-inflicted mistakes and penalties that have contributed to their struggles.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has stated that it is crucial for the United States to win the global artificial intelligence race against China to ensure the future is built on an American technology stack. Speaking on CNBC, Huang expressed optimism about resolving trade disputes but stressed the importance of American companies having access to the best technology. He argued that a complete ban on chip exports to China would ultimately harm American companies more in the long term by encouraging China to develop its own alternatives. Huang's comments underscore the strategic importance of AI and the complex balance between national security, economic competition, and global technology leadership.</p>

          <p>Police have arrested a 17-year-old boy and a 22-year-old man in Hertfordshire on suspicion of computer misuse and blackmail following a significant cyber-attack. The breach targeted the Kido chain of nurseries in London, where hackers reportedly stole the personal data of approximately 8,000 children, including photos, names, and addresses. The Metropolitan Police began their investigation after receiving a report of a ransomware attack from the Action Fraud service in late September. Authorities have described the arrests as a significant step forward in the investigation, aiming to bring those responsible to justice and address the concerns of affected parents and carers.</p>

          <p>Professional tennis players are facing grueling conditions at the Shanghai Masters and Wuhan Open, with high temperatures and humidity leading to health issues and calls for new safety rules. Players like Holger Rune and Iga Swiatek have publicly questioned the lack of a heat rule from the men's governing body, the ATP, after multiple athletes required medical attention or retired from matches due to dizziness and heat stroke.

          <h2>Billionaire Investor Orlando Bravo Warns of a Bubble in AI Company Valuations</h2>

          <p>Orlando Bravo, co-founder of private equity firm Thoma Bravo, has stated that valuations for artificial intelligence companies are currently "at a bubble," drawing comparisons to the dot-com era. However, he noted a key difference: today's AI boom is being financed by large, established companies with healthy balance sheets, unlike the speculative venture capital of the late 1990s. Bravo cautioned that valuing a company with $50 million in recurring revenue at $10 billion is unsustainable, as it would require immense future cash flow to justify. His comments serve as a warning about inflated expectations in the AI sector, even as major technology firms continue to pour capital into the space.</p>

          <p>Oracle's stock fell by 3% after a report from The Information raised concerns about the profitability of its cloud business involving Nvidia AI chips. According to internal documents cited in the report, Oracle's gross margins on its Nvidia cloud services were only 14%, significantly lower than the company's overall gross margin of around 70%. The report suggests that the high cost of Nvidia chips and aggressive pricing for cloud rentals could challenge Oracle's ambitious growth forecasts in the AI sector. This news casts doubt on the financial viability of the company's strategy to become a major player in AI infrastructure by renting out high-demand Nvidia hardware.</p>

The launch event featured prominent authors like Roxane Gay and Viet Thanh Nguyen, drawing a large crowd and signaling a strong desire for a revitalized literary community.

          <p>Several U.S. airports, including those in Denver, Newark, and Burbank, experienced significant flight delays due to a shortage of air traffic controllers, a problem exacerbated by the ongoing government shutdown. Federal officials report that staffing levels at control facilities are at their lowest since the post-pandemic travel surge in 2022. As essential workers, air traffic controllers are required to work without pay during the shutdown, and the Transportation Secretary noted a slight increase in sick calls. The situation highlights the fragility of the nation's aviation system and demonstrates the immediate, tangible impacts of the political stalemate in Washington on public services and infrastructure.</p>

The confirmation came as Trump was addressing questions about other potential pardons, stating, "I call him Puff Daddy, he’s asked me for a pardon." Combs was found guilty in July on two charges in a high-profile federal case but was acquitted of more serious racketeering and sex trafficking charges. He was subsequently sentenced to over four years in prison. The request highlights Combs's efforts to use high-level political channels to mitigate the consequences of his criminal conviction.</p>

          <p>A draft White House memo indicates that furloughed federal workers may not be guaranteed back pay once the current government shutdown ends, creating significant financial uncertainty for hundreds of thousands of employees. The position appears to contradict the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019, a law signed by President Trump that was understood to ensure retroactive pay. Federal employee unions have called the administration's interpretation 'frivolous' and legally questionable. The threat of withheld pay adds another layer of hardship for workers already facing missed paychecks, forcing many to seek financial assistance and prepare for potential long-term income loss.</p>

The piece suggests that criticism of Weiss is misplaced and that her goal is to revitalize the storied news organization, not desecrate it.

So far in the current shutdown, the S&P 500 has seen modest gains. An analysis by Morningstar Direct found that in the year following the 2019 shutdown, the S&P 500 surged 36%, although post-shutdown gains are not guaranteed. Financial experts advise that the best response for long-term investors is typically to remain patient and stay invested, as markets tend to look past short-term political turmoil and price in future conditions rather than reacting to current disruptions.

          <p>In an unprecedented joint statement, six former U.S. surgeons general who served under both Republican and Democratic presidents have warned that the policies of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are "endangering the health of the nation." Writing in the Washington Post, they expressed alarm over changes to vaccine policy, cuts to medical research funding, and a shift from science-based decisions to ideology. The former top doctors accused Kennedy of advancing discredited claims about vaccines and undermining the nation's public health system at a critical time. Their warning highlights a deep concern within the medical community about the current direction of U.S. health policy.</p>

          <p>A medical helicopter crashed on Highway 50 in Sacramento, critically injuring the three crew members on board—a pilot, a nurse, and a paramedic. The aircraft, operated by REACH, had just departed from the UC Davis Medical Center when it experienced an in-air emergency and went down in the middle of the freeway. Miraculously, no vehicles on the busy highway were involved in the crash. First responders and bystanders worked to free one crew member who was trapped under the wreckage. The National Transportation Safety Board and the FAA are investigating the cause of the incident, which has left the three crew members hospitalized with critical injuries.</p>

          <p>As the government shutdown continues, moderate Republicans are reportedly exploring proposals to end the stalemate, though a key Democratic demand remains a sticking point. Democrats have largely refused to vote for funding legislation without an extension of Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies set to expire, while Republicans insist that issue should be debated only after the government reopens. Senator Susan Collins is circulating a draft proposal that acknowledges the need for an ACA conversation post-shutdown, but this may not be enough to sway Democrats who fear losing leverage. The gridlock highlights how healthcare policy has become central to the budget negotiations and the ongoing political impasse.</p>

          <p>Even with significant home equity, homeowners may find their applications for home equity loans denied for surprising reasons this fall. Lenders have tightened standards, meaning a debt-to-income ratio that was previously acceptable may now be too high. Other unexpected obstacles include conservative home appraisals that come in lower than expected, having too much available credit on other accounts, or recent changes in employment, even positive ones. Property-specific issues, such as being in a flood zone or having unpermitted additions, can also derail an application. These factors highlight the increased scrutiny borrowers face in the current economic environment, catching some well-qualified applicants off guard.</p>

          <p>A tornado that struck Enderlin, North Dakota, on June 20 has been officially upgraded to an EF-5, the highest possible rating on the Enhanced Fujita scale. This marks the first EF-5 tornado in the United States in 12 years. The storm, which killed three people, produced winds estimated to be over 210 miles per hour (338 km/h). The tornado carved a path of destruction over 12 miles long, destroying farmsteads, toppling rail cars, and uprooting trees. The National Weather Service's reclassification came after a lengthy analysis of the unusual and extreme damage, particularly to heavy rail cars, confirming the storm's devastating and rare intensity.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed a compensation scheme for millions of consumers who were mis-sold car finance deals between 2007 and 2024. The issue centers on undisclosed discretionary commission arrangements, where dealers were incentivized to charge customers higher interest rates. The FCA estimates that 14 million agreements could be affected, with average payouts expected to be around £700 per person, totaling an estimated £8.2 billion in redress. While a recent Supreme Court ruling narrowed the scope of eligible claimants, the scheme aims to provide compensation for those who were overcharged or had unfair contracts due to high, hidden commissions.</p>

Republican candidate Winsome Earle-Sears has seized on the controversy, condemning Spanberger for her continued support of Jones.

The driver, Navjeet Singh, allegedly ran a stop sign in November 2024 and was wanted by authorities for over nine months before being arrested upon his return to Canada. Prosecutors argued he was a flight risk, noting he left the country knowing a warrant was issued for his arrest and that data from his truck's black box was missing. Despite the severity of the charges, the judge granted his release with strict conditions, including surrendering his passport and driver's license.</p>

          <p>According to a recent report from ICE Mortgage Monitor, housing affordability in the U.S. is currently at its best level in more than two and a half years. With average 30-year mortgage rates dipping, the monthly principal and interest payment on an average-priced home now consumes 30% of the median household income, down from a peak of 35% in late 2023. This improvement, combined with the likelihood of further interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, presents a more favorable environment for potential homebuyers. The article suggests that now may be an opportune time for buyers to act, as increased affordability could lead to greater competition in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When deciding between pretax and Roth 401(k) contributions, savers should consider their effective tax rate in retirement, not just their current marginal rate. Your marginal rate is the tax on your last dollar earned, while your effective rate is your total tax paid as a percentage of your total income, which is often much lower. A financial planner explains that because of deductions and the progressive tax system, your effective tax rate during retirement may be lower than anticipated, potentially making traditional pretax contributions more advantageous than commonly thought. This perspective encourages a more nuanced, multi-year approach to tax planning for retirement savings. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates, a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has become a more affordable borrowing option compared to high-interest credit cards. For a $25,000 HELOC, the current monthly payment on a 15-year term is approximately $237, which is lower than it was earlier in the year and significantly cheaper than financing the same amount with a credit card. Because HELOCs have variable rates, costs will fluctuate, but the downward trend in interest rates makes them an attractive tool for homeowners needing access to funds. Borrowers can also make interest-only payments during the initial draw period to further lower their immediate monthly costs. (not investment advice)</p>
