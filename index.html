          <p>China's exports to the U.S. experienced a significant drop of 34.5% year-on-year in May, marking the steepest decline since February 2020, according to Wind Information. This decline occurred despite a temporary trade truce between the two countries, which had paused most tariffs for 90 days. The overall exports from China rose 4.8% last month, falling short of estimates, while imports plunged 3.4% due to sluggish domestic demand. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng is expected to meet with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in London for renewed trade talks, following accusations of violating the Geneva trade agreement.

Demonstrators halted traffic on the 101 Freeway, and Los Angeles police deemed the gathering an unlawful assembly.

          <p>President Trump's new travel ban, restricting citizens from a dozen countries, primarily in Africa and the Middle East, has gone into effect. Unlike the 2017 ban, this one is broader and expected to withstand legal challenges, though it has been met with less public outcry. The ban includes restrictions on citizens from Haiti and Venezuela, with concerns raised about its disproportionate impact on African countries. Critics argue the ban is rooted in racism and bigotry, while the Trump administration claims it addresses terrorism-related and public-safety risks.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has strongly criticized President Donald Trump's decision to deploy 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles, comparing his actions to those of a "dictator." Newsom has demanded Trump rescind the order, accusing him of inciting violence and militarizing cities. National Guard troops have clashed with demonstrators protesting Trump’s anti-immigration program, exacerbating tensions. Newsom shared a rebuke signed by Democratic governors, condemning the deployment as an abuse of power.</p>

          <p>President Trump and California Governor Newsom are in conflict over the deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, with differing interpretations of the Posse Comitatus Act. This 1878 law generally restricts the use of the military for civilian law enforcement, but includes exceptions. Trump deployed the Guard in response to attacks on Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, while Newsom argues the deployment is unlawful and inflames tensions. The dispute centers on the balance of federal and state authority in maintaining order.</p>

          <p>The UK's energy system faces challenges due to grid limitations, leading to situations where renewable energy firms are paid to reduce output while gas-fired plants are paid to increase production. This imbalance has cost the country over £500 million this year, potentially reaching £8 billion by 2030, and is raising energy bills. The government is considering a radical solution: regional electricity markets, which could lower bills in areas with high renewable energy production. However, the proposal has sparked debate, with concerns about its impact on investment and energy prices.</p>
