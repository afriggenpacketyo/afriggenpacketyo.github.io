          <p>President Trump has reiterated his two-week timeline for deciding whether the U.S. will join Israel's strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, framing it as a "maximum" window to pressure Tehran to negotiate. Trump declined Iran's request to urge Israel to halt its air strikes, citing Israel's battlefield advantage. Israel has launched fresh strikes against dozens of targets in Iran, including missile production facilities. Trump stated the U.S. is ready and willing to act, and has been in communication with Iran to observe further developments.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly contradicted his director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, who testified that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon, marking the second time he has dismissed her assessment. The White House asserts that Iran possesses the necessary components to construct a nuclear weapon within weeks, requiring only the supreme leader's authorization. Gabbard has defended her testimony, stating that media outlets have taken her words out of context and that Iran could produce a nuclear weapon within weeks to months if it chooses to do so. The president has been briefed on the risks and benefits of military action against Iran's nuclear facilities, and will decide whether to join Israel's strikes within two weeks.</p>

          <p>A panel of federal appellate judges has ruled that a Louisiana law mandating the posting of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms is unconstitutional, marking a victory for civil liberties groups. The ruling supports the separation of church and state, arguing the displays would isolate non-Christian students. Republicans, including President Trump, supported the law, claiming the Ten Commandments are historical and foundational to U.S. law. Louisiana's Attorney General disagrees with the ruling's scope and plans to appeal, while law experts anticipate the case will reach the Supreme Court, testing its stance on religion and government.</p>

          <p>Iran has stated that it will only consider resuming talks regarding its nuclear program once Israeli actions cease, following warnings from Israel's defense minister about a "prolonged" conflict. This statement came as exchanges of fire continued, with Iran launching missiles at northern Israel and Israel targeting sites in Iran. Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, met with European diplomats in Geneva, who urged him to revive diplomatic efforts with the U.S., but Araghchi insisted that Iran's defense capabilities are non-negotiable and that its nuclear program is peaceful. Meanwhile, President Trump suggested Iran had a limited time frame to avoid potential U.S. air strikes.</p>

González Valencia, along with his brothers, led the "Los Cuinis" group, which financed the CJNG's drug operations, utilizing methods such as semi-submersibles to avoid detection. The U.S. government has been intensifying efforts to dismantle the CJNG, designating it as a Foreign Terrorist Organization and sanctioning its leaders, including "El Mencho," while also seeking increased cooperation from Mexican officials to prosecute cartel members.

          <p>Police are issuing warnings about a growing crime trend known as "jugging," where criminals surveil banks and ATMs to identify victims withdrawing large sums of money. The "juggers" then follow the victims to a secondary location, often robbing them inside their vehicles. This practice has spread from Texas to South and North Carolina, with law enforcement emphasizing the speed and violence of these robberies. Some states are considering making jugging a specific felony with harsher penalties to combat the increasing incidents.</p>

          <p>Tesla is set to launch its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, with the first driverless trip expected on June 28. The initial rollout will involve a limited number of Model Y vehicles, with access by invitation only. The service will operate within a geofenced area of the city, excluding airport trips, and will include a Tesla Safety Monitor in the front passenger seat. While Elon Musk has touted the robotaxi for years, analysts believe it could usher in a "golden era of autonomous" for Tesla, though the company faces competition from Waymo.</p>

          <p>President Trump has a history of setting two-week deadlines for various policy decisions and announcements, often with little or no follow-through.

This pattern has been observed in recent weeks regarding geopolitical conflicts, global tariffs, and the war in Ukraine. Experts suggest that these deadlines are often a tactic to delay or avoid making concrete decisions, hoping that the issues will fade from public attention.</p>
