        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Xpeng's Hong Kong shares are expected to continue their nearly 80% rally this year, driven by new model releases and a move toward profitability. The Chinese electric-vehicle maker's shares surged after upbeat earnings and a strong revenue forecast for the second quarter. First-quarter revenue more than doubled, fueled by robust sales, narrowing the net loss and improving the gross margin. Analysts predict Xpeng will break even in the fourth quarter of 2025, with a strong product cycle driving sales, maintaining a buy rating on the stock with a target price significantly higher than its current trading value.</p>

The government also confirmed it would expand a pilot scheme offering chemical castration to some sexual assault offenders, with a view to making it nationwide and potentially mandatory.

Trump played a video falsely claiming rows of crosses marked graves of murdered white farmers, when the footage was from a protest after a farming couple's murder. Trump's claims of "white genocide" were refuted, citing statistics showing that while South Africa has a high murder rate, figures do not support claims of racial targeting.

          <p>The House passed a provision to raise the federal deduction cap for state and local taxes (SALT) to $40,000 as part of President Trump's tax package. This change, up from the current $10,000 limit, would primarily benefit filers in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey, and California. The SALT cap phases out over $500,000 and increases annually by 1% from 2026 through 2033. However, reduced itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket could offset some of the benefits, and the proposal still faces challenges in the Senate.

          <p>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported a nearly 50% drop in net migration in 2024, with 431,000 more people arriving in the UK than leaving, compared to 860,000 the previous year. This decline was attributed to fewer people coming to work and study following Conservative government changes and the departure of those who arrived on study visas after the pandemic. There was also a large drop in dependents accompanying visa holders. The Home Office reported a decrease in asylum seekers housed in hotels, although the number remains higher than when Labour took power.</p>
