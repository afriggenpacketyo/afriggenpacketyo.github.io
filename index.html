          <p>Marks & Spencer has introduced a limited-edition strawberries and cream sandwich, inspired by the viral Japanese "fruit sando." This unique item, consisting of strawberries, whipped cream cheese, and sweetened bread, became the store's top-selling sandwich shortly after its launch. While new to UK supermarkets, fruit sandwiches are a long-standing snack in Japan, often enjoyed with tea or coffee. The article explores the cultural context of the fruit sando and compares it to other unconventional sandwiches from around the world, questioning the very definition of a sandwich.</p>

          <p>Following a Supreme Court decision limiting the power of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions, immigrant rights groups are adopting a new legal strategy. They have filed a national class-action lawsuit to challenge President Trump's executive order aiming to end birthright citizenship. The article explains that while the Supreme Court did not rule on the legality of the order itself, its decision on injunctions prompted this shift. The lawsuit argues the order violates the 14th Amendment and would create uncertainty for thousands of children born in the U.S.</p>

This century-old concept, known as phage therapy, was largely abandoned after the advent of antibiotics but is seeing renewed interest due to the growing crisis of antibiotic resistance.

He reports having paid over $160,000 in tariffs since the trade war began, which has eroded his slim profit margins. The closure will result in the layoffs of his 10 employees, highlighting the direct impact of national trade policy on small businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

The punitive orders sought to suspend security clearances and end government contracts with the firms.

The proposed cuts were intended to generate savings to meet the Chancellor's self-imposed borrowing rules but were criticized as a short-term cost-cutting measure rather than a long-term reform. The article analyzes the political and fiscal implications of the reversal, suggesting it raises questions about the government's ability to manage its agenda and enact its long-term plans for the country's renewal.</p>

The measure, which invoked the War Powers Act, was defeated in a 53-47 vote, falling short of the simple majority needed. The vote took place in the context of recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and an ongoing, fragile ceasefire. Proponents of the resolution argued for congressional oversight on matters of war, while opponents believed it would unnecessarily constrain the president's ability to respond to threats.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly attacked Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, calling him a "communist." Trump's comments followed Mamdani's primary victory, which has caused concern among some business leaders and conservatives due to his democratic socialist platform. Mamdani's platform includes higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy, a rent freeze, and free buses. In response to Trump's remarks, Mamdani encouraged the president and all New Yorkers to learn about his actual policies, which are aimed at making the city more affordable.</p>

          <p>Following the Supreme Court's decision to limit nationwide injunctions, many practical questions remain about how President Trump's order to end birthright citizenship could be implemented. While the court did not rule on the order's constitutionality, the administration can now plan its execution, which could take effect in 30 days. The article raises questions about the logistical challenges, such as how citizenship status would be verified at birth. Legal challenges to the order's core legality will continue, but the ruling creates a complex and uncertain landscape for a long-guaranteed right.</p>

The defense attorney argued that the government tried to criminalize Combs' lifestyle and recreational drug use, turning it into a conspiracy case. He asserted that the allegations were motivated by money and that Combs is innocent of the charges. The prosecution countered by stating that Combs used his power and influence to create a criminal enterprise that victimized women, and that "no" was never an option in his world.</p>

          <p>Australia claimed a 159-run victory over the West Indies in their first Test match, largely thanks to a dominant bowling performance by Josh Hazlewood. The West Indies team collapsed in the final session of the third day, losing all ten of their wickets and falling short of the 301-run target. Hazlewood was the key architect of the collapse, taking five wickets for 43 runs and dismantling the West Indies' top order. Despite some late resistance, Australia's relentless attack proved too much, allowing them to wrap up the match with two full days to spare.</p>

          <p>The California legislature has passed a measure to increase the state's annual tax credits for film and television production from $330 million to $750 million. The move, supported by Governor Gavin Newsom, is a significant effort to combat the exodus of productions to other states and countries that offer more generous incentives. Industry unions and workers have applauded the decision, arguing it is a crucial step to reverse job losses and bring production back home.

He was placed in a holding room primarily with Latino travelers, leaving him confused and intimidated.

Presented in partnership with the ACLU, the show was intended to address the "dehumanization of how immigrants are being treated in the United States."

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis argues that the Supreme Court's decision to limit nationwide injunctions represents a significant expansion of presidential power. By curbing the ability of lower court judges to block executive actions, the court has given the president greater authority to implement policies, even those of questionable legality, like the order to end birthright citizenship. The author contends that this move creates a chaotic system where constitutional rights may vary by location and are harder to defend. The piece concludes that the ruling is a politically motivated decision that poses a serious threat to the rule of law.</p>
