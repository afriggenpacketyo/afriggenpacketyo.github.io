          <h2>UK Prime Minister Responds to Trump's Tariff Blitz with Economic Reset</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-05 19:39:51 EDT</div>

          <p>Prime Minister Starmer has initiated an "economic reset" following Donald Trump's tariff "blitz," potentially involving tax increases or adjusted fiscal rules to stimulate economic growth amidst a looming recession. The Sunday Telegraph highlights Starmer's commitment to shielding the UK from a "tariffs storm." Meanwhile, Labour MP Dan Norris's arrest on suspicion of serious offenses has shaken the party, leading to his suspension. The Royal Navy has also discovered Russian sensors allegedly gathering intelligence on nuclear submarines in British waters, while the PM is expected to acknowledge the failure of globalization amid the tariff war.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has placed an attorney, Erez Reuveni, on indefinite paid leave after he struggled during a court hearing regarding the deportation of a Maryland man to El Salvador. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that all DOJ attorneys must "zealously advocate" for the administration's interests, implying Reuveni failed to do so. Reuveni faced difficulty answering questions about the legal basis for the man's deportation and the administration's inability to facilitate his return. August Flentje, the deputy director of the Office of Immigration Litigation, was also placed on administrative leave for "failure to supervise a subordinate."</p>

          <p>The Israeli army has admitted its soldiers made mistakes in the killing of 15 emergency workers in southern Gaza on March 23, though it claims some were linked to Hamas. Originally, Israel claimed troops opened fire because the convoy approached "suspiciously" without lights, but video footage showed the vehicles were clearly marked and had lights on. The army now admits this account was inaccurate. The IDF insists at least six of the medics were linked to Hamas, but has provided no evidence, admitting they were unarmed when soldiers opened fire.</p>

          <p>Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner met with Birmingham council leaders to discuss resolving the ongoing bin strike and clearing the resulting waste backlog. Birmingham City Council declared a major incident due to the industrial action by Unite union members over pay.

          <p>Elon Musk, a Trump adviser, stated his hope for a "zero-tariff situation" between the US and Europe, effectively creating a free trade zone. Musk made these comments at a congress in Florence, Italy, via video-link. Under Trump's recently announced plans, Italy, along with other European Union countries, will be subject to a general tariff of 20% due to its trade surplus with the United States.

          <p>Unai Emery's arrival at Aston Villa in 2022 marked a new chapter for the club, bringing with him a new backroom staff and Monchi as president of football operations. Emery has been backed in the transfer market, spending about £295m on 23 signings, but has also been held back by the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules. Emery has stuck rigidly to his recruitment plan, bringing in players that possess the necessary characteristics and shared his vision as to how the game should be played. His attention to detail and tactical brain are also characteristics that are spoken about a lot.</p>
