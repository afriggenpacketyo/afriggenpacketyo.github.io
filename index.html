          <p>Consumers in Hong Kong and mainland China are actively adapting to the significant surge in global gold prices, which have seen an increase of over 48% this year and reached unprecedented local highs. Despite these elevated costs, the cultural demand for gold wedding jewellery remains strong, with many individuals feeling compelled to purchase items for upcoming ceremonies. Major retailers, such as Chow Tai Fook, have observed a gradual acceptance among consumers of this new price environment since March of the previous year. This ongoing trend highlights the deep-rooted cultural importance of gold in the region, coupled with the resilient market dynamics that allow for continued demand even amidst substantial price fluctuations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Actor Raymond Cruz, widely recognized for his antagonist role in 'Breaking Bad,' will not face criminal charges following a recent confrontation at a car wash. Prosecutors in Los Angeles officially declined to file any criminal charges after three women accused Cruz of intentionally spraying them with water while he was washing his vehicle in front of his Silver Lake residence. According to Cruz's agent, Raphael Berko, the actor had initially requested the women to move a safe distance away from his car to prevent them from getting wet. Berko further asserted that any water splashing onto the women was purely incidental, occurring as Cruz turned to ask them to cease recording him. This decision effectively brings the legal aspect of the parking dispute to a close, with no further action against the actor.</p>

          <p>The Israeli navy has intercepted the Global Sumud Flotilla, a convoy carrying humanitarian aid destined for Gaza, leading to the detention of numerous activists, notably Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg. Israel's Foreign Ministry confirmed that several vessels were "safely stopped" due to their approach to an active combat zone and their alleged violation of a lawful naval blockade, with those aboard subsequently transferred to an Israeli port. Conversely, the GSF condemned the interception as "illegal" and an act of "brazen desperation," claiming one vessel was deliberately rammed and others hit with water cannons, while communications were intentionally disrupted. This significant incident has triggered international backlash, including Colombia's expulsion of Israeli diplomats, and underscores the severe humanitarian crisis and ongoing geopolitical tensions in the region.</p>

The DLO, tasked with maintaining a safe space for protesters, attempted to speak with the suspect who allegedly refused detention and fled. This article highlights challenges for DLOs, who are sworn officers but limited in enforcement actions, a role established after 2020 protests. The case has been assigned to a detective, but details of the alleged assault were not released, indicating ongoing public safety and policing challenges.</p>

This significant market movement occurred just one day after both companies announced a strategic partnership with artificial-intelligence giant OpenAI, as part of its ambitious Stargate initiative. The collaboration is specifically designed to boost the supply of advanced memory chips, which are critically essential for powering next-generation AI technologies, and to expand data center capacity within Korea. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman held meetings with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and top executives from both Samsung and SK Hynix to formalize these agreements. This development firmly establishes the South Korean firms as pivotal players in the rapidly expanding and highly competitive AI value chain, signaling strong future growth.</p>

          <p>Maxwell House coffee, a brand with 133 years of history, has launched a highly successful viral marketing campaign, humorously rebranding itself as “Maxwell Apartment Coffee” to directly address the severe and widespread unaffordability of housing in the United States. The campaign features engaging advertisements, such as one asking, "Maxwell House? In this economy?", and offers an "affordable" solution with a year's supply of coffee available for under $40 on Amazon. This article effectively taps into a prevalent national frustration, as evidenced by the median age of first-time homebuyers reaching an all-time high of 38 and a record low proportion of homes being affordable for typical households. The initiative is strategically designed to strengthen the brand's connection with coffee-loving renters, a rapidly expanding demographic across the country.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has achieved an unprecedented financial milestone, becoming the first person in history to see his net worth exceed $500 billion. His fortune briefly touched $500.1 billion on Wednesday afternoon, solidifying his status as the world's richest person, considerably surpassing rivals in the global tech sector. This remarkable wealth accumulation is primarily attributed to the soaring valuations of his various ventures, including the electric car company Tesla, the artificial intelligence startup xAI, and the rocket company SpaceX. Tesla shares alone have risen by over 20% this year, a gain that investors attribute partly to Musk's increased focus on his companies rather than political engagements. Furthermore, Tesla's board has outlined an ambitious pay package for Musk, potentially worth over $1 trillion, contingent on him achieving a series of aggressive growth targets over the next decade.</p>

          <p>An Idaho state judge has issued a ruling blocking the public release of graphic crime scene photographs from the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students, for which Bryan Kohberger was convicted. Second District Judge Megan Marshall determined that disseminating these "incredibly disturbing" images would inflict "extreme emotional distress" upon the victims' families, a concern that she found outweighs the public's interest in scrutinizing the investigation's conduct. The ruling mandates that the city of Moscow must redact any portions of the images that depict the victims' bodies or the immediate blood surrounding them. However, other photos, videos, and documents related to the case, including footage of distraught friends discovered on the morning the bodies were found, are permitted for release. This decision seeks to balance privacy concerns with public transparency in a high-profile criminal case.</p>

          <p>French asset manager Amundi has largely divested from China’s September equity rally, opting to reallocate a greater portion of its holdings to dividend stocks due to persistent doubts about the country’s economic outlook and concerns over "overvalued" shares. The firm, which manages a substantial €2.3 trillion in assets, selectively increased its exposure to onshore Chinese equities while trimming positions in Hong Kong-listed shares, citing a valuation gap between the two markets. Amundi's deputy CIO, Philippe d’Orgeval, stated in an interview that although a market correction could present future opportunities, the current macroeconomic environment, including unresolved tariffs, is perceived as less supportive for equity markets. This cautious strategic adjustment reflects a broader skepticism within the market regarding the sustainability of China’s recent economic rebound. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has signed an executive order committing the United States will use all necessary measures, including potential military action, to defend the energy-rich nation of Qatar. The order, dated Monday but made public Wednesday, appears to be a direct response to Israel’s recent strike on Doha, which targeted Hamas leaders, and aims to provide reassurance to the Qataris. It explicitly states that any armed attack on Qatar’s territory, sovereignty, or critical infrastructure would be considered "a threat to the peace and security of the United States," promising "all lawful and appropriate measures" in response. While the legal enforceability of such an executive order without Senate approval remains a subject of debate, this pledge significantly strengthens the defense partnership between the two nations, especially following Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's expression of deep regret for the strike.</p>

Prior to his nomination, Antoni had been a vocal critic of the BLS, suggesting the agency should suspend its monthly jobs report and publicly calling its health insurance figures "phoney baloney."

The core of the disagreement lies in a Democratic proposal to reverse measures within the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which previously narrowed Medicaid eligibility for noncitizens. Democrats seek to restore coverage for lawfully present immigrants, such as refugees and asylees, who were previously eligible, emphasizing that federal law continues to prohibit Medicaid for those without any legal status.

Additionally, Chery is considering an investment in a plug-in hybrid pickup truck line at Renault’s Córdoba factory in Argentina, where Renault would serve as the general distributor.

Venegas, who is Latino, claims that agents targeted workers based on their appearance, ignoring his Alabama-issued Real ID driver’s license and calling it fake.

In response, the US is providing substantial resources and military support to Ecuador, with plans to establish a military base in the country. This article details how Ecuadorian security forces, in exchange for American assistance, are stepping up their game, conducting more frequent and aggressive raids, such as those witnessed in Guayaquil.

          <p>The federal government initiated a shutdown at midnight on Wednesday after congressional lawmakers failed to reach a consensus on extending government funding. The impasse stems from weeks of intense disagreements between Republicans and Democrats, primarily over the inclusion of health insurance subsidies in a funding measure, which Democrats have made a red line for their support. Without an approved funding bill, spending authority expired, leading to the furlough of hundreds of thousands of federal workers, although essential employees continue to work without immediate pay. This article explains that the funding fight often goes down to the wire due to the minority party's leverage and the Senate's 60-vote threshold for spending bills.

          <p>Huntington Beach, a Southern California city renowned for its sandy shores, has taken a firm stance against California's statewide "sanctuary" policies by officially declaring itself a "non-sanctuary" city. Mayor Pat Burns, an outspoken supporter of President Trump, leads this initiative, asserting that the city's status empowers local police to collaborate with federal immigration enforcement officials in detaining undocumented immigrants, despite state-level restrictions on such cooperation. While the Trump administration has repeatedly threatened to withhold federal grants from sanctuary jurisdictions, these attempts have largely been unsuccessful in court. This article highlights a growing trend among some cities and states to adopt non-sanctuary approaches to immigration, reflecting deep ideological divides and ongoing debates over immigration enforcement strategies across the United States.</p>

          <p>An attorney is alleging that the United States government illegally deported two of his clients to Iran this week without affording them due process, thereby placing them at severe risk of persecution in their home country. Ali Herischi stated that his clients, who had entered the U.S. through the Southern border to seek asylum within the past year, mysteriously "disappeared" from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainee locator system before their unannounced deportation. One of the deportees, a Christian convert, had entered the country with his pregnant wife, who recently gave birth and remains in the U.S. Herischi vehemently condemned the deportations as "unconscionable," arguing that these individuals are opponents of the Iranian regime and are now being returned directly into harm's way.

          <p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan has publicly expressed his profound disgust and dismay over footage revealing severe misconduct by Metropolitan Police officers at Charing Cross police station, as exposed in a BBC Panorama documentary. The undercover report showed officers making deeply offensive racist comments about immigrants and Muslims, engaging in sexualized remarks towards colleagues, celebrating the use of force, and demonstrating dismissive attitudes towards sexual assault claims. In response, Met Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley issued an apology for the "reprehensible and completely unacceptable" behavior, leading to the suspension of eight officers and one staff member, and the removal of two more officers from front-line duties. This incident adds to a series of scandals plaguing the Met, prompting renewed calls for urgent and systemic reform to restore public confidence and address pervasive issues within the force.</p>

          <p>Five years after its initial robotaxi debut on U.S. streets, Waymo's driverless vehicles continue to face significant operational challenges, as highlighted by a recent incident in Atlanta where a Waymo autonomous car was filmed blowing past a school bus with flashing red lights. This event follows a series of other widely publicized driving errors, including an illegal U-turn in the San Francisco Bay Area, where local police were unable to issue a citation due to the absence of a human driver. Waymo, owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, currently offers its fully autonomous service in five cities and plans further expansion, asserting that its internal safety data indicates a lower incidence of serious injury crashes compared to human drivers. However, experts like former National Transportation Safety Board chair Robert Sumwalt emphasize the critical need for autonomous vehicles to be held to a demonstrably higher standard and for their implementation to be thoroughly refined before widespread public adoption.</p>

          <p>A 20-story New York City Housing Authority building in the Bronx experienced a partial collapse on Wednesday morning following a boiler room explosion, which tore a gaping hole in the side of the high-rise and caused extensive damage along Alexander Avenue. Astonishingly, despite the severity of the blast and the raining debris, no injuries were reported. Mayor Eric Adams, who visited the scene, confirmed initial reports suggesting the explosion originated in the boiler room, sending shockwaves up the chimney and triggering the collapse. Officials promptly evacuated 38 apartments as a precautionary measure, and comprehensive inspections are now underway to ascertain the structural integrity of the building, with gas services temporarily shut off for the entire complex. This article highlights a critical urban infrastructure incident, fortunately without loss of life, but raising concerns about building safety and maintenance.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders has devised a uniquely inventive method of responding to reporters' questions by literally muting himself, following the promotion of fellow first-year QB Dillon Gabriel to the team's starting position. When asked about his unchanged No. 3 spot on the depth chart, Sanders, a former college star who played for his father Deion Sanders, smiled broadly and proceeded to offer a voiceless, pantomimed answer. This silent protest comes after critical remarks made by former NFL coach and current analyst Rex Ryan, who had taken issue with Sanders' previous comments about his capabilities relative to other NFL quarterbacks. The incident underscores the intense media scrutiny and pressure faced by young athletes in professional sports, prompting a creative, if unconventional, way to navigate difficult questions without directly engaging.</p>

The Lakers, actively seeking "three-and-D" players to pair with their core, quickly secured LaRavia after his team option was not picked up by the Sacramento Kings. Head coach JJ Redick has expressed high expectations for LaRavia's continued development, praising his commitment and versatility in guarding multiple positions. As a lifelong Lakers fan, LaRavia is now focused on contributing to the organization's relentless pursuit of championships.</p>

          <p>Prudential Hong Kong is strategically expanding its partnerships and accelerating the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) to effectively capture the burgeoning cross-border insurance business, particularly within the dynamic Greater Bay Area. Lawrence Lam, CEO of Prudential Hong Kong, highlighted a significant increase in cross-border hospital claims, which now account for 30% of the total, up from 26% just a year prior. A recent Prudential survey revealed a strong demand from mainland Chinese respondents planning to visit Hong Kong, with 55% intending to purchase critical illness insurance, 40% seeking medical coverage, and 45% interested in savings products. Prudential aims to introduce more medical products to cater to this demand, leveraging AI to enhance service delivery and efficiently penetrate this expanding market, which benefits from the ongoing economic integration efforts across Hong Kong, Macau, and mainland Chinese cities.

Pike was convicted of the exceptionally brutal 1995 murder of 19-year-old Colleen Slemmer, an attack she carried out at the age of 18, which involved severe beating, stabbing, bludgeoning, and carving a pentagram into the victim's chest. Pike later openly bragged about the gruesome crime and even kept a fragment of the victim's skull. Her legal team argues that given her youth and undiagnosed mental health issues at the time of the crime, she should be spared the death penalty and instead receive a life sentence without parole, emphasizing the extreme rarity of female executions in modern U.S. history.</p>

          <p>This article offers comprehensive expert guidance on selecting the appropriate cooking oils and effectively debunks several pervasive myths surrounding fats and their nutritional impact. Professor Nita Forouhi from the University of Cambridge clarifies that commonly maligned sunflower and vegetable oils are, in fact, beneficial due to their low content of unhealthy saturated fats and high levels of healthier mono- and polyunsaturated fats, essential for brain and heart health. Modern margarines are also deemed healthy, containing virtually no harmful trans fats, while butter can be enjoyed in moderation. The article meticulously explains that extra virgin olive oil, rich in antioxidants, is best suited for salad dressings due to its low smoke point, whereas vegetable or sunflower oils are recommended for deep frying as they withstand higher temperatures without releasing potentially toxic compounds, offering clear, actionable advice for consumers.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has dramatically intensified its drone attacks on Russian oil refineries in recent months, leading to significant fuel shortages and noticeable price increases across various parts of Russia. An in-depth analysis conducted by BBC Verify and BBC Russian reveals that 21 out of Russia's 38 large refineries have been successfully targeted since January, marking a 48% increase in successful strikes compared to the entirety of 2024. These strategic attacks, some reaching deep within Russian territory, are a core component of President Volodymyr Zelensky's strategy to cripple Russia's oil industry, thereby aiming to force Moscow to the negotiating table. While the precise extent to which these strikes impact Russia's ability to finance its war in Ukraine remains somewhat unclear, they are undoubtedly causing considerable disruption to civilian fuel supplies and escalating the economic strain of the protracted conflict.</p>

The cybercriminals, operating under the name Radiant, had initially posted profiles of approximately 8,000 children, including private details and pictures, and directly contacted parents with threatening phone calls while demanding a Bitcoin ransom. Kido Schools, the affected nursery chain, confirmed they did not pay the ransom. While there's historical precedent for hackers retaining or selling data despite claims of deletion, Radiant expressed remorse for "hurting kids," suggesting the intense backlash influenced their decision. The breach reportedly originated from access gained through a compromised staff computer, rather than a direct compromise of the Famly education platform, as initially speculated.</p>
