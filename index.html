        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump's administration has formally appealed a federal judge's ruling that blocked him from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The judge had argued that maintaining the independence of the Federal Reserve was in the public's interest and that Cook had a strong case that her removal would violate federal law, which requires legal "cause." Trump sought to remove Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies. The move is seen by some as part of a broader effort by the former president to exert influence over the central bank's interest rate policies, as he aims to appoint a majority to the board.</p>

          <p>Utah Governor Spencer Cox has labeled the fatal shooting of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk at a university event as a "political assassination." Kirk was struck by a single shot from a distance while speaking on campus, and authorities are conducting a manhunt for the shooter. In a press conference, the governor condemned the act as an attack on free speech and democracy, vowing that the perpetrator would be found and held accountable to the fullest extent of the law. This event has heightened concerns over political violence in the United States.</p>

While the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also reached new closing highs, the Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced a slight decline, influenced by a drop in Apple's stock price. (not investment advice)</p>

Authorities state the gunman fired a single shot from approximately 200 yards away, striking Kirk in the neck during a speaking event at Utah Valley University.</p>

          <p>An investigation led by the U.S. Coast Guard is examining how approximately 75 cargo containers fell from a vessel at the Port of Long Beach. The incident occurred while the ship was offloading, causing damage to a smaller barge, resulting in a minor oil spill, and causing one worker to sprain an ankle while fleeing. The containers, filled with consumer goods, fell into the water, prompting a significant response from local fire and police departments to corral the massive crates. While the port remains operational, officials are working to determine the cause of the mishap and manage the cleanup and recovery efforts.</p>

          <p>The killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has drawn widespread condemnation from political figures across the ideological spectrum, uniting them in denouncing political violence. Former Presidents Donald Trump, Joe Biden, and Barack Obama all released statements mourning Kirk's death and calling for an end to such violent acts. Utah Governor Spencer Cox labeled the shooting a tragedy and vowed to bring the person responsible to justice. The bipartisan response highlights a shared concern over the rising political tensions and the use of violence to settle ideological differences in the United States.</p>

          <p>A significant number of residents in rural West Virginia, approximately 250,000 people, do not have reliable access to clean, treated drinking water. Many, like coal miner Roman Patsey, depend on untreated sources such as abandoned coal mines, a legacy of the coal industry's decline which led to the decay of local water infrastructure. Crumbling treatment plants in towns like Kimball and Rhodell underscore the systemic failure, forcing communities to rely on their own makeshift solutions. Non-profit organizations like DigDeep are now working to build new water systems, offering hope to residents who have lived for years with water insecurity.</p>

          <p>Senior cancer specialists in the UK are warning that bureaucratic hurdles are creating a "postcode lottery," preventing some patients in England from accessing the latest cancer treatments. The Royal College of Radiologists states that cumbersome funding application processes are stifling innovation and leading to inequities, where cutting-edge therapies like Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy (SABR) are only available at larger, better-funded centers. This situation persists despite advancements in cancer care, prompting calls for the government to streamline access and ensure treatments are available based on need, not location, in its upcoming national cancer strategy.</p>

          <p>Charlie Kirk, who died at 31 after being shot in Utah, rose to become one of the most influential figures in modern conservative politics. He founded Turning Point USA at age 18, building it into a powerful organization with a massive following on college campuses and online, acting as a conservative counterweight to prevailing liberal campus culture. A staunch ally of Donald Trump, Kirk and his organization played a significant role in mobilizing young voters and grassroots organizing during the 2024 election. His death has been mourned by conservative leaders as the loss of a pivotal voice who energized a new generation of the movement.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has given a positive assessment of the newly public financial technology company Klarna, suggesting it is a worthwhile purchase even after a strong first day of trading. The Swedish "buy now, pay later" firm saw its stock climb 14.55% on its debut. Cramer noted the company's solid growth, improving fundamentals, and strong underwriting standards as reasons for his optimism, despite it currently being unprofitable due to heavy investment in growth since 2019. He views the success of competitors like Affirm as a positive sign for Klarna's potential in the public market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>State lawmakers in California have introduced a bill to significantly reform Measure ULA, the Los Angeles "mansion tax," amid criticism that it has stifled housing development. The proposal, negotiated with Mayor Karen Bass, would reduce the tax rate on sales of recently built apartment buildings and commercial properties. Measure ULA, passed in 2022, levies a tax on property sales over $5.3 million to fund homelessness prevention and affordable housing programs. While supporters say the measure is a crucial revenue source, critics argue it has had a chilling effect on new construction, worsening the city's housing affordability crisis.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Traditional television cooking shows are experiencing a sharp decline in commissions, with new food-related programming on British TV dropping by 44% in a year. This trend is attributed to the massive shift in audience viewing habits towards online platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok, where food content is booming. Unlike heavily regulated and slow-to-produce TV shows, online food influencers can react instantly to trends and connect with audiences through a more authentic, unpolished style. This cultural shift poses a significant challenge to broadcasters, as viewers increasingly prefer the raw, community-driven content of online creators over professionally produced television programs.</p>

Whistleblowers claim that senior positions at SOS Syria were appointed by the Assad palace and that the organization took in children to meet funding targets.

          <p>Reflecting on the 30th anniversary of CNBC's "Squawk Box," Jim Cramer noted a return to the market optimism of the 1990s. He recalled that during the show's early days, there was widespread excitement among individual investors about stock picking, a sentiment that faded after the dot-com bubble burst and many shifted to index funds. Cramer believes that today, investors are once again recognizing the potential for significant returns from individual stocks, pointing to the immense gains in companies like Nvidia and Oracle. He suggests this renewed interest is not about greed but an increased awareness of market opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>

The committee also questioned the product's value for taxpayers, citing its £3 billion five-year cost and research showing most users could have bought a home without it.

Scientists at the Sanger Institute are sequencing the DNA of all known species and cross-referencing it with their unique colors, behaviors, and mating dances. By understanding how this dark DNA influences traits, they hope to unlock general principles of how variation and new species arise in the natural world.</p>
