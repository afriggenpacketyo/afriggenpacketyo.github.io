          <p>Okagi Hayashi, recognized as Japan's oldest person, died at 115 from heart failure in Toki, Gifu Prefecture.

          <p>A new poll indicates that Elon Musk's approval rating is low, with 35% of Americans approving of his work for the Trump administration and 57% disapproving. This aligns with negative views of Trump's cuts to the federal government, which Musk is spearheading. The poll highlights a correlation between opposition to government layoffs and disapproval of Musk's performance. Tesla, where Musk also works, reported a 9% decrease in revenue and a 71% drop in profits this year, possibly impacting public sentiment, although Musk has stated he will reduce his government role in the near future.</p>

Critics, however, are concerned that the department will become less welcoming for women and Latinos, potentially leading to increased lawsuits.

This move aligns with China's commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2060, as nuclear power offers a cleaner alternative to coal.

          <p>California continues to face a shortage of primary care providers, despite various initiatives aimed at closing the gap. Medical students are often deterred by lower pay and prestige, leading to recruitment challenges. Efforts to address the shortage include alternative payment methods, expanded nurse practitioner roles, and increased primary care spending. However, experts believe these efforts have been insufficient, with nearly 15 million Californians living in areas lacking adequate primary care providers.</p>

It notes the increasing concentration of wealth and the active involvement of the super-rich in politics. While democracy and oligarchy can coexist, the tension arises when the majority of voters want a more equal distribution of wealth.

Called the Line of Drones, it doubles down on unmanned systems that are assembled in Ukraine, mostly small exploding drones flown from basement shelters. The program is likely to take on more importance than ever should the peace talks fail, or the United States decide to discontinue arms shipments.</p>

          <p>Gardeners are being encouraged to modify their lawn mowing habits to support struggling butterfly populations, as 2024 was one of the worst years on record for butterflies. Experts recommend leaving mixed lengths of grass and allowing plants like dandelions to flower, providing food and shelter for insects. With over half of British butterfly species in long-term decline, gardens are seen as vital areas for conservation. The decline is attributed to human activity, pesticide use, and climate change.</p>
