          <p>An accident at the Coney Beach Pleasure Park in Porthcawl, Wales, resulted in minor injuries for thirteen children and one adult. The incident occurred on the "Wacky Worm" roller coaster when a cart reportedly derailed, causing a metal railing to fall. Witnesses described hearing a loud bang and children screaming as adults rushed to help. The park, which is slated for closure and redevelopment, will remain shut while authorities and health and safety officials conduct an investigation into the cause of the accident.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn announced a 27% year-over-year increase in its second-quarter operating profit, surpassing market expectations. The growth was primarily driven by its burgeoning artificial intelligence server business, with server product sales accounting for 41% of revenue, overtaking consumer electronics for the first time. The company, a key partner for Nvidia and the primary assembler of Apple's iPhones, projects its AI server business will continue to expand significantly. Foxconn is also diversifying into electric vehicles and semiconductors to sustain its growth momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States has officially designated the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) as a foreign terrorist organization, a move analysts suggest could have positive side effects for China-US cooperation on counterterrorism in Pakistan. The BLA has been responsible for numerous attacks in the region, often targeting Chinese nationals and interests. By adding the group to its FTO list, the Trump administration demonstrates a commitment to countering terrorism in the area. This action may help alleviate some of Beijing's security concerns and create an opportunity for collaborative efforts against regional terror threats.</p>

          <p>Solomon Peña, a defeated Republican candidate for a New Mexico state House seat, has been sentenced to 80 years in prison for organizing a series of drive-by shootings. The attacks targeted the homes of four Democratic officials in Albuquerque following his November 2022 election loss, which he baselessly claimed was fraudulent. Prosecutors stated Peña hired two co-conspirators to carry out the shootings, personally participating in one, as an act of political intimidation. Although no one was injured in the attacks, the sentence reflects the severe nature of using violence to contest election results.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the concept of secondary sanctions, a foreign policy tool frequently employed by the United States to influence third-party nations. Unlike primary sanctions that restrict a country's own citizens, secondary sanctions target foreign entities that do business with a sanctioned state, such as Russia or Iran. Their power stems from the dominance of the US dollar and financial system, as foreign companies often comply to avoid losing access to American markets. However, their effectiveness is debated, as they can be circumvented through alternative currencies or intermediaries and risk alienating allies, pushing targeted nations closer together.</p>

          <p>A recent study found that 60% of workers in Singapore, one of the world's most expensive cities, were living paycheck to paycheck in 2024, a figure higher than many regional peers. Experts attribute this trend to a combination of high living costs, stagnant real wage growth, and a cultural shift towards prioritizing experiences over long-term savings. Factors such as expensive housing, reliance on imports, and aspirational spending fueled by 'buy now, pay later' schemes are straining personal finances. This marks a significant change from previous generations who were known for their financial prudence and high savings rates. (not investment advice)</p>

While the government hailed the figures as positive, critics argue the pace of growth is too slow and that the economy remains in a precarious position.

His mission to establish a clear protocol gained urgency in the years leading up to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The amendment provides a crucial framework for ensuring a stable transfer of power during a presidential crisis, a topic of enduring relevance in American politics.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have dropped out of first place in the National League West for the first time since April after a 6-5 loss to the Los Angeles Angels completed a season series sweep. The defeat followed a familiar pattern for the struggling Dodgers, who failed to extend an early lead before their bullpen faltered in the eighth inning. A go-ahead, two-run single by Angels catcher Logan O’Hoppe sealed the historic result. The Dodgers, now on a four-game losing streak, face a critical upcoming series against the San Diego Padres, who have taken over the division lead.</p>

          <p>A federal trial has concluded over California Governor Gavin Newsom's lawsuit challenging President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles. The lawsuit questions the legality of using the military for domestic law enforcement under the Posse Comitatus Act. During closing arguments, the judge expressed skepticism about the Justice Department's claim that there are no limits to the president's authority to deploy troops for such purposes. The case centers on whether the deployment to protect federal agents during immigration enforcement operations constituted an unlawful military action, with significant implications for presidential power and federalism.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is set to deploy federalized National Guard troops to the National Mall in Washington, D.C., as part of a plan to address crime in the city. According to a source, the intention is for residents and tourists to wake up to a significant military presence in the area known for its monuments and museums. This move follows President Trump's announcement to mobilize 800 troops and take control of the city's police department. While the law allows for such deployments to protect federal property, the use of military force in this manner is considered extraordinary.</p>

          <p>A lawsuit challenging the construction and operation of an immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades, brought by environmental groups and the Miccosukee tribe, has concluded its hearing. A key unresolved question is whether the federal government or the state of Florida is ultimately in control of the facility, dubbed 'Alligator Alcatraz.' The plaintiffs argue the project violates federal environmental law by proceeding without proper impact assessments, a requirement for federal projects. Lawyers for the state and the Trump administration contend the law doesn't apply because it is a state-run facility, leaving its legal status ambiguous.</p>

The messages reportedly expressed glee over the murder, stating it was justified and that Thompson's children also deserved to die.

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at easing the regulatory burden on the commercial spaceflight industry. The order directs the Department of Transportation to streamline or eliminate environmental reviews for rocket launch licenses issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Citing inefficient permitting as a barrier to investment and innovation, the White House stated the goal is to remove outdated and restrictive rules. The move is expected to benefit private space companies like SpaceX by accelerating their launch schedules, though it has drawn criticism from environmental groups concerned about potential risks.</p>

          <p>A new Gallup poll has revealed that the percentage of American adults who consume alcohol has fallen to 54%, a record low since the firm began tracking the data in 1939. This decline coincides with growing public concern about the health risks of drinking, even in moderation, particularly among younger adults. Experts suggest that increased awareness of alcohol's negative effects, combined with social trends like 'Dry January' and the rise of non-alcoholic alternatives, is driving the shift. The poll also highlighted a gender divide, with alcohol consumption dropping more significantly among women than men.</p>

Furthermore, the FDA noted a safety risk, as the products are often packaged in containers resembling whipped cream cans, which could lead to accidental ingestion.
