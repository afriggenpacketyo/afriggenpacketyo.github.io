        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to cease missile and drone attacks on Kyiv, deeming them "unnecessary" and poorly timed, further suggesting that Russia is ready for a peace deal with Ukraine. Trump expressed frustration that securing a deal with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has proven more challenging than anticipated. Zelenskyy, in response to the attacks, cut short a visit to South Africa to address the situation in Ukraine, decrying Russia's continued violence and lack of accountability as rescue operations continue amidst significant destruction. The attacks represent some of the most severe against Kyiv since the start of the conflict. </p>

          <h2>Merck Adjusts Profit Forecast Due to Tariffs and Deal Costs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Merck has revised its full-year profit outlook, anticipating a $200 million impact from tariffs and a charge related to a recent licensing agreement with Hengrui Pharma. The expected tariff costs are primarily due to levies between the U.S. and China, where Merck has a significant presence, though the company's forecast does not include President Trump's planned tariffs on pharmaceutical imports. Despite the profit adjustment, Merck reaffirmed its sales forecast of $64.1 billion to $65.6 billion and reported strong first-quarter results driven by oncology and animal health products, including contributions from newly launched drugs like Winrevair and Capvaxive, which are crucial for offsetting future losses from Keytruda's expiring exclusivity.</p>

          <p>Lebanon's foreign ministry has reprimanded Iran's ambassador to Beirut for publicly stating that plans to disarm Hezbollah were a "conspiracy." The reprimand follows a post on X by the Iranian ambassador criticizing the disarmament efforts. This move is significant as it signals a rare rebuke of Iran by top Lebanese officials, reflecting growing pressure on Hezbollah to relinquish its arsenal following recent conflicts.</p>

          <h2>Bereaved Parents Advocate for Stronger Social Media Protections for Children</h2>

          <p>A group of British parents, who believe social media contributed to their children's deaths, traveled to the US to demand improved online safety measures. They participated in a protest outside Meta's offices in New York, advocating for better protection for children online. This action coincides with Ofcom's announcement that websites in the UK will be legally required to block children's access to harmful content and implement stricter age verification processes, and also that parents have the ability to access their child's social media accounts if the child dies.</p>

          <h2>Bristol Myers Squibb Beats Estimates, Raises Outlook Amid Tariff Concerns</h2>

          <p>Bristol Myers Squibb exceeded first-quarter earnings expectations and increased its revenue and profit guidance for the year, driven by strong performance in its newer drug brands and better-than-expected sales of older medications. The company is also taking action to cut costs, but the new outlook includes the estimated impact of current tariffs on U.S. products shipped to China, a critical market for Bristol Myers. The company is closely monitoring the potential impact of President Trump's planned tariffs on pharmaceutical imports and is implementing mitigation efforts to reduce supply chain risks.</p>
