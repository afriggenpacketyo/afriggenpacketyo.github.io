          <p>Amazon has reportedly expressed interest in acquiring TikTok, submitting a bid to the White House.  This follows a deadline set by the Trump administration for ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, to sell its US operations or face a ban.  The move highlights TikTok's growing influence on e-commerce and Amazon's potential need to compete in this rapidly evolving market.  National security concerns regarding data access by the Chinese government are also a key driver of the situation.</p>
