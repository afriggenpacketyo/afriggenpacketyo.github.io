        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The series finale of "And Just Like That" concludes with protagonist Carrie Bradshaw single once again, an ending the article argues is more authentic to her character than a traditional fairytale romance. After enduring numerous personal indignities and a failed rekindling with a past love, Carrie realizes that a life centered on friendship, rather than a romantic partner, is not a tragedy. This conclusion is presented as a correction to the original "Sex and the City" finale, which prioritized romantic relationships over the powerful female friendships that were the show's true core.</p>

          <p>Mike Castle, who served as Delaware's last Republican governor and U.S. congressman, has passed away at the age of 86. Known as a centrist Republican, he was respected for his fiscal conservatism and social moderation, often challenging his own party's line. During his 18 years in the House, his most notable legislative achievement was creating the 50 State Quarters Program, a popular initiative that featured commemorative coins for each state. Castle's long and successful political career in Delaware included roles as a state lawmaker and lieutenant governor before his tenure as governor.</p>

The company's stock opened at HK$72, a significant increase from its initial public offering price of HK$18.68, reflecting strong investor confidence in China's booming pharmaceutical sector. This successful launch comes as major biotech companies in Hong Kong have seen cumulative returns averaging 137% this year. The company's chairman attributed the success to the high clinical demand for their metabolic drugs and their commitment to scientific innovation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's economy demonstrated surprising strength in the second quarter of 2025, expanding by 0.3% compared to the previous quarter and surpassing economists' forecasts of 0.1% growth. This resilience was largely driven by a rebound in exports, which contributed significantly to the GDP despite new tariff challenges from the United States. On an annualized basis, the economy grew by 1%, also beating expectations. The positive economic data led to a rise in the Nikkei 225 index and a strengthening of the yen against the dollar.

          <p>A 50-year-old man was arrested in a quiet Van Nuys neighborhood for repeatedly disturbing the peace by blaring a loud train horn he had affixed to a tree. For two months, the window-rattling blasts prompted numerous complaints to the police. The man, an unemployed car technician, described his actions as a "cry for help," alluding to personal and legal troubles without providing specifics. Despite promising officers he would stop, he sounded the horn again just hours later, leading to his arrest on suspicion of interfering with a peace officer.</p>

The student, who was set to begin his final year at Reseda Charter High School, allegedly overstayed his visa by more than two years. Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent Alberto Carvalho highlighted the student's poor conditions in custody and called for limits on immigration enforcement near schools. The arrest has intensified existing fears among immigrant families about the safety of students traveling to and from school.</p>

Officials are awaiting test results and have sent the envelopes to FBI headquarters for further analysis. They stated that no current threat remains to employees or the public but have asked people to avoid the area as the investigation continues.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled a new high-speed drone capable of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL), a technological breakthrough that could significantly enhance its naval capabilities. The uncrewed aircraft can be launched from the decks of warships without a runway, even in rough seas, and then transition to fast, long-range flight. According to the project team, this innovation is far superior in speed compared to other mainstream VTOL drones. This development could effectively transform every Chinese destroyer or frigate into a small aircraft carrier, expanding the operational range of its naval forces.</p>

His comments followed Brazil's efforts to coordinate with China on a multilateral response after Washington imposed a 50% tariff on a wide range of Brazilian exports.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom announced a plan to redraw the state's congressional maps, a direct response to a Republican-led effort in Texas to create more GOP-favorable districts. Newsom has called for a special election in November to approve a new map that would override the state's independent commission, vowing to "neuter and neutralize" the Texas proposal. The move, which Newsom framed as a defense of democracy against partisan gerrymandering, would only take effect if Texas or another Republican-led state advances a similar plan.

A significant portion of the secular population, particularly in Tel Aviv, calls for a ceasefire to secure the return of hostages, while a growing minority protests the killing of Palestinian civilians.

          <p>As President Trump and Vladimir Putin prepare for their summit in Alaska, their primary objectives appear to diverge significantly. For Putin, the meeting itself is a victory, demonstrating that Western efforts to isolate him have failed and re-establishing Russia at the top table of global politics. He also seeks to secure territorial gains in Ukraine. For Trump, the goal is to fulfill his campaign promise of being a global peacemaker, potentially enhancing his legacy with a Nobel Peace Prize. However, his vacillating statements on the conflict make his specific aims harder to predict.</p>

          <p>Tennis icon Venus Williams is set to make history at this year's U.S. Open as the oldest woman to compete in the singles tournament since 1981. At 45 years old, she received a wild card invitation for her 25th appearance at the championship. This milestone follows her recent victory at the DC Open, where she became the oldest player to win a WTA singles match since 2004. Williams' longevity highlights a unique aspect of professional tennis, where many athletes have historically achieved significant success well into their 30s and 40s.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance was reportedly turned away from a pub in Oxfordshire, England, after staff members threatened to walk out if his reservation was accepted.

Signs reading "Fascists not welcome here" have appeared in the area. This is not the first time Vance has encountered resistance at a restaurant; a similar situation occurred in Pennsylvania last year, though the establishment later clarified it was due to confusion and not a ban.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is planning to increase its number of data centres by nearly 20%, with almost 100 new facilities set to be built, largely to support the growth of artificial intelligence. However, this expansion has raised significant concerns about the immense energy and water these facilities will consume. Experts warn that the increased demand on the national grid could lead to higher energy bills for consumers. Environmental groups and local residents are also objecting to the construction, citing the strain on water resources and the development of greenbelt land.</p>

          <p>A new AI-driven tool called DeepEditor is transforming the process of dubbing foreign language films by digitally manipulating actors' mouths to perfectly match the new dialogue. This technology aims to overcome the traditional awkwardness of dubbing and make international films more accessible to markets like the U.S., where audiences are often resistant to subtitles. The London-based company Flawless developed the tool, which was recently used on a Swedish sci-fi film for its U.S. theatrical release. The technology promises to help a wider range of international cinema reach global audiences without compromising the original performance.</p>

          <p>The hastily arranged summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska stands in stark contrast to historic Cold War-era meetings, which involved extensive planning and detailed preparation. Unlike the landmark summits between leaders like Nixon and Brezhnev, this meeting has been organized quickly with little clarity on potential outcomes. There is concern among observers that Trump may be outmaneuvered by the experienced Russian leader, recalling the 2018 Helsinki summit where Trump publicly sided with Putin over his own intelligence agencies. European leaders have been advising Trump, but his unpredictable nature makes the results difficult to forecast.</p>

          <p>As the Social Security program marks its 90th anniversary, it faces significant long-term financial problems despite its growing importance to nearly 70 million Americans. The program's trust funds are projected to be depleted by 2034 due to outgoings consistently outpacing income, which could force a 23% cut in benefits if no action is taken. This has led to declining public confidence in the system's future viability. Potential remedies include lifting the cap on income subject to payroll taxes or raising the full retirement age, but political consensus on a solution remains elusive. (not investment advice)</p>

He argued that the current market is fundamentally different from the dot-com bubble, as there are enough rational and strong company performances to balance out irrational exuberance. Cramer pointed to the explosive gains of some recent IPOs as examples of irrationality but highlighted companies like Amazon and Eli Lilly as proof of underlying market health. He believes that the presence of speculation should not deter investors from holding positions in fundamentally sound companies. (not investment advice)</p>

Commissioners cited significant concerns about the environmental impact of sonic booms on people and wildlife, as well as on public access and natural resources. A key point of contention is whether the launches, many of which deploy Starlink satellites, are for commercial purposes or on behalf of the federal government. The commission argues the primary purpose is commercial, while military officials maintain all launches serve national security.</p>

Former officials note Putin's ability to dominate conversations with lengthy monologues, while Trump is known for freewheeling statements that can surprise his own aides. The most controversial meeting was in Helsinki in 2018, where Trump sided with Putin over U.S. intelligence agencies, a moment that drew widespread condemnation.</p>

          <p>Ford's CEO has announced a drastic overhaul of the company's manufacturing process to produce cheaper electric vehicles capable of competing with advanced, low-cost Chinese models. Recognizing the existential threat posed by Chinese automakers, Ford is retooling its Louisville plant to build a new $30,000 electric truck by 2027 using 20% fewer parts. This new "assembly tree" system, designed by former Tesla and Apple engineers, aims to streamline production and cut costs. The move represents a fundamental shift for Ford as it attempts to adapt to a rapidly changing global automotive landscape.</p>
