          <h2>White House Study Predicts Health Insurance Losses if Trump Budget Bill Fails</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-18 07:53:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A White House study warns that if President Trump's budget bill fails, 8.2 to 9.2 million Americans could lose health insurance due to a recession. The memo from the Council of Economic Advisers estimates that the number of uninsured could rise to 36 million, approaching pre-Affordable Care Act levels. The analysis assumes states will cut Medicaid and that the expiration of Trump's 2017 tax cuts would trigger a recession, reducing consumer spending and increasing unemployment. The White House projects a potential 4% GDP contraction and 6.5 million job losses if the bill does not pass. </p>

          <p>European relations minister Nick Thomas-Symonds is advocating for a deal with the EU to allow UK passport holders to use EU e-gates at airports, aiming to reduce border queue times. Negotiations are ongoing ahead of a UK-EU summit in London, with potential agreements also covering trade, security, and youth mobility. Conservative MP Alex Burghart expressed concerns that the deal could lead to the UK becoming a "rule taker" by aligning with EU standards. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage claimed an EU deal that included a youth mobility scheme and extending fishing rights for the EU in British waters would mean that "to a large extent, Starmer will be betraying Brexit".</p>

          <p>A.G. Sulzberger, publisher of The New York Times, discusses the importance of press freedom and the subtle ways it's being undermined in democracies. He notes that while overt censorship and violence against journalists are common in authoritarian societies, democracies face subtler forms of repression, such as selective use of investigatory powers and frivolous lawsuits. Sulzberger emphasizes the Times' commitment to independent journalism, stating their loyalty is to the truth and the public's right to know it. He also expresses concern about the challenges facing the news industry, including the collapse of the business model and growing distrust.</p>

          <p>A fire in a building near the Charminar monument in Hyderabad, India, resulted in the deaths of at least 17 people and several injuries. The fire, believed to have been caused by a short circuit, started in a building with a jewelry store on the ground floor and residential space above. The narrow staircase and single exit made escape difficult for the 21 people inside the three-story building when the fire broke out.

          <p>Experts are weighing in on whether the middle class should be worried about the future of Social Security, which is facing increasing financial strain. The program's trust funds are projected to be depleted by 2035, potentially leading to reduced benefits, delayed retirement ages, or higher taxes. Economist Shawn DuBravac notes that Social Security won't disappear entirely, but benefits could be cut unless action is taken. Middle-class Americans, particularly those without pensions or significant savings, could be most affected by these changes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An expert discusses the potential of vagus nerve stimulation for stress reduction, explaining the vagus nerve's role in regulating bodily processes and initiating the body's "rest and digest" response. While vagus nerve stimulation devices are used to treat conditions like epilepsy and migraines, some promote exercises involving head and neck movements as natural activators. However, current research is limited, and these techniques likely help through various mechanisms, not just increased parasympathetic activity. Proven methods to prompt the body’s relaxation response include slow, diaphragmatic breathing, cold water exposure, and humming.</p>

Compared to pre-pandemic seasons, RSV hospitalizations in babies under seven months dropped by as much as 56%, and in newborns, hospitalizations decreased by as much as 71%. Emergency physician Heather Auerbach noted fewer critically ill children from RSV this year. The study shows that increased use of RSV prevention products can significantly protect young babies from severe illness.</p>

          <p>The pause in Donald Trump's Chinese tariffs is likely to be brief, and small businesses should plan accordingly, according to this article. Existing tariffs remain in place, effectively raising the tariff rate on Chinese goods to around 40%. Trump's past actions suggest he will likely raise trade issues with China again, potentially leading to renewed tariffs. Businesses are advised to seek alternative suppliers, bring manufacturing back to the US, or adjust pricing strategies. The article warns that companies reliant on Chinese suppliers may face trouble and should prepare for further trade war developments.</p>

The survey also revealed that 87.1% of respondents believe the government's efforts to control surging rice prices are insufficient. Furthermore, 81% of people in Japan feel "uneasy" about President Donald Trump's second term, partly due to concerns over the impact of tariffs.</p>

          <p>President Trump's ventures, such as intending to accept a Qatari jet and profiting from a self-referential cryptocurrency, exemplify the concerns the Founding Fathers had about presidential profiteering, according to this article. The Constitution includes provisions to restrict conflicts of interest, including a ban on domestic gifts to the president and requiring congressional consent for foreign gifts. The author argues that Trump's actions disregard these limitations, and the lack of aggressive congressional oversight puts the nation in an uncomfortable position. The article concludes that the carefully crafted restrictions of the Constitution appear to be unenforceable.</p>

          <p>President Trump's frequent use of national emergency declarations is under scrutiny, raising questions about whether these situations meet the legal standard for an "emergency." Since his second term began, Trump has issued eight emergency declarations, unlocking special authorities that bypass congressional action. Experts like Elizabeth Goitein from the Brennan Center for Justice argue that these powers, while sometimes reasonable, can be abused and resemble authoritarian tactics. Congress's ability to terminate these declarations is limited, raising concerns about the potential for abuse of presidential power.</p>

          <p>After a five-year pause, the Trump administration is set to resume wage garnishment for defaulted student loan borrowers, affecting millions of Americans. This action reverses the Biden administration's relief measures and could lead to financial strain for many, particularly those with low incomes. Marceline Paul, a retiree, fears she won't be able to afford a trip back to Trinidad if her Social Security benefits are garnished. The resumption of collection activity comes amid sweeping changes to the lending system and reports of staffing shortages at the Education Department.</p>

          <p>Portugal is holding its third parliamentary election in three years after the previous government collapsed due to a failed confidence vote. Opinion polls suggest that Luis Montenegro's Democratic Alliance (AD) may win the most votes but still lack a parliamentary majority. The election is dominated by issues such as housing and immigration. The far-right Chega party, which Montenegro refuses to deal with, has been polling in third place. Portugal has witnessed a steep rise in immigration and a housing crisis, exacerbating economic challenges for its citizens.</p>

          <p>Haas has requested a review of the decision to disallow Oliver Bearman's final qualifying lap at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, believing the FIA stewards made a mistake. Bearman's lap was fast enough to move beyond the first knock-out session but was deleted due to a red flag caused by a crash. Despite evidence suggesting Bearman crossed the line before the red flag, the FIA upheld its original decision. The team has demanded an explanation and measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.</p>
