          <p>Authorities in Yolo County have confirmed that the remains of all seven workers missing after a July 1 explosion at a fireworks warehouse have been recovered. The coroner's office is now working to formally identify the victims through DNA testing. The fatal blast occurred at a facility operated by Devastating Pyrotechnics, which was not permitted to store fireworks at that location. The property is reportedly owned by a Yolo County sheriff's lieutenant, and federal agencies are now assisting in the investigation into the cause of the explosion.</p>

          <p>During a White House meeting, U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu projected unity, celebrating recent strikes on Iran's nuclear sites as a major victory. However, the meeting occurred as indirect ceasefire negotiations with Hamas in Doha showed little public progress. While Trump expressed optimism about reaching a deal, Netanyahu reiterated his resistance to a two-state solution, stating that Israel must retain overall security control. Analysts suggest the meeting was more of a public relations event than a substantive diplomatic breakthrough.</p>

          <p>Brazilian club Fluminense has unexpectedly reached the Club World Cup final, where they will face Chelsea. The team's success is credited to charismatic manager Renato Gaúcho and the defensive leadership of 40-year-old veteran Thiago Silva. After winning the Copa Libertadores, the team has found surprising defensive solidity in the tournament. The final will be a notable reunion for Silva, who previously played for Chelsea and won the Champions League with the English club.</p>

          <p>Beijing's implementation of export controls on rare earths has triggered a wave of international efforts aimed at diversifying critical mineral supply chains. This global pushback against China's long-standing dominance is exemplified by new international projects seeking to secure alternative sources. For instance, an Australian-listed company has begun identifying mineral zones in Brazil, while U.S. firms are partnering with Kazakhstan's national geological company to explore rare earth deposits. These moves highlight a strategic global response to reduce dependency on China for these essential materials.</p>

          <p>Indonesia's Mount Lewotobi Laki-laki has erupted again, spewing an ash cloud 18 kilometers into the sky and prompting authorities to issue their highest alert level. The powerful eruption forced more than 4,000 people to evacuate the area, with videos showing glowing red lava and residents fleeing in vehicles. The event has also caused significant travel disruptions, including the cancellation of at least 24 flights to the nearby resort island of Bali. This volcano is located on the Pacific "Ring of Fire," a region known for frequent seismic activity.</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods in Texas, which have killed over 100 people, were caused by a confluence of factors including the region's flood-prone geography and a massive, slow-moving weather system. The deluge occurred with little warning in the early morning hours, catching sleeping residents and campers by surprise. Officials are now facing intense scrutiny over the timeliness and adequacy of their emergency alerts and evacuation orders, with many survivors stating they received no warning before the Guadalupe River surged to historic levels.</p>

          <p>During a formal meeting at the White House, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu officially nominated U.S. President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. Netanyahu presented a letter commending Trump's efforts to end conflicts in the Middle East, particularly citing the recent de-escalation with Iran. The high-profile gesture took place as the two leaders also discussed the ongoing war in Gaza and the difficult, indirect ceasefire negotiations with Hamas. Trump called the nomination "very meaningful," especially coming from the Israeli leader.</p>

          <p>Samsung Electronics has projected a significant 56% drop in its second-quarter operating profit, a figure far worse than market expectations. The South Korean tech giant is struggling to keep pace in the lucrative market for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are essential for artificial intelligence technology. Competitors like SK Hynix have secured key supplier positions with AI leader Nvidia, leaving Samsung behind. The disappointing forecast reflects ongoing losses in its foundry business and muted performance in the high-margin HBM sector.</p>

As part of the settlement, which requires court approval, Simplilearn will refund $2.4 million in tuition to 263 students and implement stricter transparency rules.</p>

          <p>A commentary in the Los Angeles Times argues that the Trump administration's priorities, as reflected in a recent policy bill, are dangerously misplaced. The author contends that the government is escalating immigration enforcement, such as the recent raid in L.A.'s MacArthur Park, for political theater while simultaneously making deep cuts to vital scientific and medical research. The piece criticizes the defunding of agencies like the National Institutes of Health and the National Weather Service, framing it as a dire threat to public health and safety.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has canceled its plan for a large-scale reduction-in-force that was scheduled for August and could have affected tens of thousands of employees. The VA stated that the drastic measure is no longer necessary, as its workforce has already been reduced by approximately 30,000 this year through a hiring freeze, retirements, and normal attrition. The original plan, which aimed to cut staff to 2019 levels, had drawn criticism from lawmakers concerned about its potential impact on veteran care.</p>

          <p>China has activated a new flight path, W121, in the Taiwan Strait without consulting Taipei, a move that has raised alarms in Taiwan. The route is a branch of the main M503 flight path and runs close to the unofficial median line that separates the two sides. Beijing claims the activation is a technical adjustment to improve air traffic safety and efficiency. However, Taiwan views it as a unilateral action that compromises regional flight safety and increases potential security risks.</p>
