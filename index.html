          <p>Erik Menendez, 54, was denied parole during his first hearing, 36 years after he and his brother murdered their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez. The parole board cited his continued inappropriate behavior in prison, including drug smuggling and unauthorized cellphone use, and a perceived lack of full insight into his crimes, despite his claims of sexual abuse by his father. This decision follows a resentencing that made both brothers eligible for parole under youth offender laws, overturning their original life sentences without parole. His next parole eligibility is in three years, while his brother Lyle's hearing is scheduled for Friday, leaving their family to express disappointment but maintain hope for Lyle's release and a different outcome.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities have implemented new regulations to combat the proliferation of false and misleading medical information online, specifically targeting "self-media" health accounts. The "Guidelines for Regulating Medical Science Self-Media Behaviour" impose stricter requirements on healthcare practitioners sharing information and demand greater responsibility from platforms to verify account credentials and content authenticity. This initiative aims to clearly differentiate genuine public health education from deceptive commercial advertising, following the recent release of detailed guidelines for recognizing medical advertisements. The government's decisive action underscores a significant effort to enhance the reliability and accuracy of health-related content across digital platforms, ensuring public safety and trust in medical advice.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chocolate prices are projected to continue their upward trend, reflecting the delayed impact of historically high cocoa costs caused by adverse weather conditions and pest outbreaks in West Africa, which supplies most of the world's cocoa. Although cocoa futures have seen a slight decline this year, manufacturers are still contending with the record-high prices from late 2024, passing these increased production costs to consumers. While experts anticipate cocoa prices will remain structurally higher, there's a possibility of some relief by next Easter as industrial demand softens and global supply begins to improve. Nevertheless, additional factors like minimum wage increases in the UK and potential US tariffs could contribute to sustained elevated chocolate prices.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia has reportedly instructed component suppliers to halt production of its H20 AI chips, specifically designed for the Chinese market, following Beijing's crackdown on local tech companies over alleged security concerns. This move significantly jeopardizes the H20's re-entry into China, despite previous U.S. government signals that export licenses would be granted. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang acknowledged the Chinese government's inquiries about potential "backdoors" in the chips, asserting that the company has clarified their non-existence and is in ongoing discussions. This situation underscores the complex challenges Nvidia faces amid escalating trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, potentially putting over $20 billion in annual sales in China at risk.</p>

          <p>Brent Hinds, the 51-year-old co-founder and former lead guitarist of the Grammy-winning heavy metal band Mastodon, tragically died in a motorcycle crash in Atlanta, Georgia. Authorities reported his Harley-Davidson collided with a BMW SUV whose driver did not yield while making a turn. Mastodon expressed "unfathomable sadness and grief" in a social media statement, mourning the loss of a "creative force" with whom they achieved numerous musical triumphs. Hinds, who had recently departed from the band, was renowned for his unique blend of prog-rock, alternative, and grunge influences, having also played in several other musical projects throughout his career.</p>

          <p>Fox News host Sean Hannity publicly declared he would not question Attorney General Pam Bondi or FBI Director Kash Patel about the Jeffrey Epstein case, a promise he demonstrably kept during their subsequent interviews. Instead, Hannity focused primarily on the Trump administration's claims of a "treasonous conspiracy" orchestrated by former President Obama concerning the 2016 Russia investigation. This editorial decision aligns with Fox News's broader shift away from the Epstein story, particularly after a Justice Department memo contradicted conspiracy theories previously promoted by some Trump officials. The article criticizes Hannity's approach, highlighting his role in amplifying administration narratives and deflecting from the ongoing Epstein controversy.</p>

          <p>Europe is currently enduring a prolonged and severe summer heatwave, which has led to a significant nearly 60% surge in Chinese air conditioner exports to the continent in July compared to the previous year. Major cities across the continent, from Madrid to Paris, are under high heat alerts, highlighting Europe's notable unpreparedness for such extreme temperatures despite its generally northern latitude. This escalating demand is proving highly beneficial for Chinese brands, which collectively dominate the global air conditioning market, producing approximately 80% of the world's cooling units.

While Erin is not forecast to make direct U.S. landfall, it caused significant storm surge and life-threatening rip currents in parts of the Outer Banks, leading to evacuations and numerous rescues.

A newly expanded specialist team, building on a successful pilot that recouped £17 million in under a year, will now utilize international travel data to identify and stop payments to ineligible claimants.

          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has urged Pakistan to accelerate the "2.0 upgrade version" of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), emphasizing enhanced cooperation in the crucial areas of agriculture, industry, and mining. Wang reaffirmed China's commitment as Pakistan's "most reliable partner and strongest backer," pledging support to help Islamabad "comprehensively improve self-development ability" and "enhance resilience for external challenges." Pakistani Prime Minister Sharif reciprocated, expressing interest in expanding cooperation to include aerospace, information technology, and infrastructure, while also committing to ensure the safety of Chinese nationals and projects from terrorist attacks. CPEC, a flagship Belt and Road initiative, already involves over $65 billion in Chinese investment.</p>

          <p>Aid workers are accusing international NGOs of "whitewashing" the situation in Gaza by significantly watering down public communications regarding Israel's war, fearing repercussions from a new, restrictive Israeli registration process. Organizations are reportedly restricting their language, avoiding critical terms like "occupation" or "accountability," and even refraining from signing joint statements, despite the escalating humanitarian crisis and severe civilian casualties. The new Israeli regulations, which demand sensitive data on Palestinian staff and threaten to deny permits to groups supporting legal action against Israel, have created a "chilling effect" on advocacy. Workers express a profound "sense of rage" and despair, feeling compelled to compromise their principles to maintain severely limited operational access.</p>

          <p>Kansas health officials are currently monitoring six West Nile virus cases this year, with five of them classified as neuroinvasive, indicating severe involvement of the central nervous system. While these numbers are presently below last year's total of 64 infections and four deaths, health officials are warning of an increased risk as mosquito activity peaks in late summer, typically from August to early September. Neuroinvasive cases present with more severe symptoms such as high fever, disorientation, paralysis, or muscle weakness, often requiring extensive medical intervention and longer recovery times. Unfortunately, there are no specific medicines available to treat West Nile, but most infected individuals are believed to develop lifelong immunity.</p>

Their findings revealed a diet consistent with Welsh Palaeozoic rock regions, specifically where bluestones are sourced, providing the first direct evidence linking cattle remains at Stonehenge to Wales. This study further supports the idea that oxen were utilized as beasts of burden, also prompting new questions about the broader community involvement, including women and children, in the monumental task of moving the stones.</p>
