          <p>Washington, D.C.'s Attorney General has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging the president's executive order that placed the city's Metropolitan Police Department under federal control. The suit argues the action is an unlawful "hostile takeover" that infringes upon the district's right to self-governance and jeopardizes public safety. This legal challenge follows President Trump's declaration of a crime emergency, which he used to justify deploying the National Guard and federalizing the local police force, a move Mayor Muriel Bowser has also decried as illegal. The lawsuit aims to block the administration's unprecedented assertion of federal authority over municipal law enforcement.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates have continued their downward trend, with the average 30-year fixed rate falling to 6.58%, a significant drop from the near 8% peaks seen in late 2023. This decline has spurred an increase in refinance applications, offering potential savings for homeowners with existing mortgage rates above 6%. Experts advise that refinancing can be beneficial if homeowners plan to stay in their property for several more years, as closing costs need to be amortized. The trend is attributed to declining 10-year Treasury yields, which mortgage rates typically follow, rather than the Federal Reserve's steady interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>On the 80th anniversary of its surrender in World War II, Japan continues to face internal divisions over its historical narrative, often referred to as "history wars." While neighboring countries like China and South Korea maintain bitter memories of Japanese occupation, a growing revisionist movement within Japan seeks to downplay or deny the brutalities of the Imperial army. These groups promote a narrative of Japan as a liberator of Asia and a victim of Allied aggression, contesting established facts like the Nanjing Massacre and the forced sexual servitude of "comfort women." This ongoing debate complicates Japan's diplomatic relations and its ability to fully reckon with its wartime past.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has departed for a critical summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, a meeting aimed at exploring possibilities for peace in Ukraine. As the U.S. delegation travels, the Ukrainian Air Force reported that Russia launched a significant overnight assault involving ballistic missiles and nearly 100 drones across 13 locations. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated the administration's goal is to quickly assess if a ceasefire is achievable, which would be the first step toward more complex negotiations involving territorial disputes and security guarantees. The meeting proceeds with urgency, assembled quickly to address the escalating three-and-a-half-year conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an interview ahead of the Trump-Putin summit, Alaska Senator Dan Sullivan framed the meeting as a crucial preliminary step towards peace, where the primary goal is to assess Putin's seriousness about a ceasefire. He commended the Trump administration's efforts to pursue peace and suggested that a successful outcome would be an agreement to halt hostilities, paving the way for more detailed negotiations with Ukraine and NATO allies. Sullivan argued that Alaska is an appropriate venue, as it projects American strength through its significant military presence, energy resources, and international alliances. He believes Putin is only at the negotiating table due to the pressure of severe U.S. sanctions.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin is strengthening in the eastern Atlantic and is forecast to become the season's first hurricane, potentially intensifying into a major hurricane by the weekend. With maximum sustained winds currently at 70 mph, the storm needs to reach 74 mph to be classified as a hurricane. The U.S. National Hurricane Center projects Erin's path will move near or north of the northern Leeward Islands but does not currently pose a direct threat to the United States mainland. The storm has already caused deadly flooding in the Cabo Verde islands, where at least eight fatalities were reported.</p>

          <p>A loud sonic boom was heard across parts of London and southeastern England after the Royal Air Force scrambled three Typhoon fighter jets to intercept a civilian aircraft. The plane, traveling from Nice, had lost communication with air traffic control, prompting the rapid military response from RAF Coningsby. The jets escorted the aircraft safely to Stansted Airport, where Essex Police confirmed there was no cause for concern after re-establishing contact. A sonic boom occurs when an aircraft exceeds the speed of sound, creating shockwaves that result in an explosive noise, which startled residents and caused houses to shake across the region.</p>

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced the opening of a new immigration detention center, named the "Deportation Depot," at a closed state prison in Sanderson. The facility, which can hold up to 2,000 individuals, is part of a broader state-led effort to enforce federal immigration laws and will be staffed by the Florida National Guard. This move follows the establishment of the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" facility and aims to detain and process some of the estimated 50,000 to 100,000 undocumented immigrants in Florida with final removal orders. DeSantis highlighted the site's ready-made infrastructure as a cost-effective way to expand the state's detention capacity.</p>

          <p>In Bihar, India, where extreme heat causes up to a third of harvested produce to spoil, solar-powered cold storage units are emerging as a potential solution for small-scale farmers. These facilities allow farmers to preserve perishable crops like potatoes, fruits, and vegetables for longer, enabling them to sell at more favorable market prices and reduce significant financial losses. While the technology offers a way to bypass unreliable electricity grids and costly diesel generators, challenges remain, including high upfront costs and the need for community-based sharing models to be viable.

          <p>Air Canada has started canceling flights as it faces a potential strike by its 10,000 flight attendants, which could ground the nation's largest airline this weekend. The union issued a 72-hour strike notice after contract negotiations stalled, with key issues being wages and unpaid work time. In response, the airline issued a lockout notice and began a gradual suspension of operations, expecting to be completely grounded by Saturday morning. The disruption is projected to affect approximately 130,000 travelers per day, and the airline is offering full refunds for canceled flights while trying to arrange alternative travel options with other carriers.</p>

          <p>An investigation has debunked widespread social media claims that photos depicting famine in Gaza, including one published by Time Magazine, were staged. Allegations, amplified by an official Israeli government account, suggested photographers orchestrated scenes of people waiting for food with empty pots. However, a detailed analysis of metadata, dates, and visual content confirms the images were taken on different days at a genuine food kitchen, documenting the severe and worsening food crisis. With international reporters barred from Gaza, local journalists provide crucial insights, and this fact-check underscores the reality of the humanitarian situation, which the UN has warned shows mounting evidence of famine.</p>

          <p>On the eve of his summit with Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump stated his belief that the Russian leader is ready to make a deal to end the war in Ukraine, giving the meeting a 75% chance of success. Trump suggested a follow-up meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy could involve deciding how to "divvy things up," a phrase likely to cause concern in Kyiv over potential territorial concessions. European leaders, while reassured that Trump is focused on securing a ceasefire, remain wary of his unpredictable nature. The high-stakes meeting in Alaska is seen by Moscow as an opportunity to not only discuss Ukraine but also restart economic cooperation with the U.S.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's bioethanol industry is facing imminent collapse after the government decided against providing a financial rescue package to its two main producers, Vivergo Fuels and Ensus. The companies had warned that a recent trade deal allowing tariff-free imports of U.S. ethanol had rendered their businesses commercially unviable. The government stated that offering taxpayer funds would not provide value or solve the industry's long-term problems. The decision jeopardizes 270 direct jobs and thousands more in the supply chain, as well as a significant domestic source of bioethanol, a key component in cleaner E10 petrol, and commercial carbon dioxide.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. Social Security program celebrates its 90th anniversary, it faces increasing concerns about its long-term financial stability and operational capacity. The program, which supports nearly 70 million Americans, is projected to see its trust funds depleted by 2034, which could lead to a 23% cut in benefits if no legislative action is taken. Compounding these financial woes are recent staffing cuts under the Trump administration, which critics claim have hampered the agency's ability to serve a growing number of beneficiaries. Despite these challenges and declining public confidence, the program remains a cornerstone of retirement income for a vast majority of Americans.</p>

          <p>The series finale of "And Just Like That" is critiqued for rehashing old patterns and lacking emotional depth, capping a three-season run defined by what the author calls "cringe comedy without comedy." The article argues that while the original "Sex and the City" explored the mortifications of single life with a cynical edge, the sequel became squeamish about sex and fixated on ritualistically shaming its characters for aging. This manifested in storylines centered on physical indignities, from impotence to failed deodorant, reflecting a deeper unease with the messy realities of being human. The finale ultimately reinforces the characters' detachment from reality, making it easier to say goodbye.</p>

          <p>A regulatory filing has revealed that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway acquired a new stake in the beleaguered health insurer UnitedHealth, purchasing over 5 million shares worth approximately $1.6 billion. The investment is notable given UnitedHealth's recent struggles, including a nearly 50% stock decline in 2025 and a Justice Department investigation into its billing practices. However, the move aligns with Buffett's history of value investing in out-of-favor companies. The insurer's stock rose 6% in extended trading following the disclosure, which also showed Berkshire taking new positions in several other companies, including homebuilders Lennar and DR Horton.

In a letter, the institute's chair confirmed the new priority but stated that some work on healthcare and environmental issues would continue.
