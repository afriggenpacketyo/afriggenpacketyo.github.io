          <p>China's customs authority has tightened import rules for Vietnamese durians after detecting unsafe levels of cadmium and alkaline yellow. The new regulations mandate enhanced pre-export safety checks and batch-by-batch testing upon arrival, with non-compliant shipments being returned or destroyed. This has led to a significant 45% year-over-year drop in the value of fresh durian shipments from Vietnam to China in the first half of 2025. The measures are intended to prevent food safety risks for Chinese consumers.</p>

          <p>A Florida jury has found Tesla partially liable for a 2019 crash involving its Autopilot system, resulting in one death and serious injuries. The court ordered the company to pay $243 million in damages, asserting that the driver-assistance technology failed to prevent the collision when the driver was distracted. Plaintiffs' lawyers argued that Tesla irresponsibly marketed the system's capabilities, leading to misuse. Tesla plans to appeal the verdict, maintaining that the driver was solely responsible for the incident.</p>

          <p>President Trump has fired Erika McEntarfer, the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), following a jobs report that was weaker than expected. Trump accused the commissioner of political manipulation without providing evidence, a move that has raised alarms about potential White House interference with non-partisan economic data. The decision came as global stock markets fell in response to the administration's new tariff plans. Economists and former officials have expressed deep concern that questioning the integrity of federal statistics could create significant economic instability. (not investment advice)</p>

This case stems from a yearslong legal battle over the state's congressional map following the 2020 Census.

A specific area known as "ray bay" is a known hotspot due to warmer water from a nearby power plant.

San Pedro and Carson are ranked second and third, respectively, both noted for their offensive talent. The rankings highlight key players to watch, such as Garfield's running back Ceasar Reyes and Palisades' quarterback-receiver duo of Jack Thomas and Demare Dezeurn.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking in connection with Jeffrey Epstein, has been moved from a facility in Florida to a minimum-security prison camp in Texas. The new facility, FPC Bryan, houses inmates in dormitories with a lower staff-to-inmate ratio. The transfer has drawn condemnation from victims' families, who called it "preferential treatment" and a failure of the justice system. The move comes as Maxwell is appealing her conviction and amid speculation about a potential presidential pardon, though the White House has denied any leniency is being discussed.</p>

          <p>A Liberian-born double amputee detained by ICE at the Stewart Detention Center in Georgia was reportedly sent to solitary confinement for three days. The punishment came after he refused to enter his cell area due to flooding, which he feared would damage his electronic prosthetic legs. The man, Rodney Taylor, has faced numerous challenges in detention, illustrating the difficulties disabled detainees face within the immigration system. His case highlights what medical experts describe as mismanagement bordering on neglect for detainees with specialized health needs.</p>

          <p>The UK's plan to recognize a Palestinian state is intended to revive the two-state solution, but it faces deep skepticism on the ground. For many Palestinians in the West Bank, the move is seen as "too little, too late" in the face of ever-expanding Israeli settlements, which now house over 700,000 Israelis and are viewed as a violation of international law. While Palestinian diplomats welcome the recognition as a crucial first step, Israeli officials have condemned it as a "reward for terrorism." The article highlights the immense practical and political obstacles that prevent a viable Palestinian state from emerging.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys superstar Micah Parsons has requested a trade, stating on social media, "I no longer want to play for the Dallas Cowboys." The two-time All-Pro pass rusher has been sitting out of on-field activities during training camp while seeking a new long-term contract. Parsons expressed frustration with the team, claiming they have not engaged in negotiations with his agent and have spread negative narratives about him to the media. The 26-year-old is in the final year of his rookie contract and is looking for a deal that would make him one of the highest-paid defensive players in the NFL.</p>

          <p>A North Korean defector has provided a rare account of being part of a state-run scheme that sends thousands of IT workers abroad to earn foreign currency. The man, using the pseudonym Jin-su, explained how he used fake identities to get remote work with Western companies, earning thousands of dollars a month, with up to 85% of his income sent back to the regime. This undercover operation, which generates hundreds of millions of dollars annually for North Korea, boomed during the pandemic. The testimony reveals the daily life and methods of these workers, who are closely monitored and operate under immense pressure.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 16 states and the District of Columbia is suing the Trump administration, alleging an "unconstitutional pressure campaign" to stop hospitals from providing gender-affirming care to minors. The lawsuit argues the White House and DOJ are intimidating providers with subpoenas and threats of criminal prosecution to create a de facto national ban on such care. This federal pressure has led to the closure of several prominent gender clinics, even in states where the care is legal. The administration maintains it has the authority to stop treatments it describes as harmful.</p>

          <p>The UK's Supreme Court has issued a ruling that closes off a major path for millions of motorists to claim compensation for hidden commissions in car finance deals. The court did not uphold a finding that the practice was inherently unlawful, but it did leave open the possibility of claims based on unfairness, awarding one claimant over £1,650 on those grounds. The decision significantly reduces the potential liability for lenders, which was estimated to be as high as £30 billion. The ruling was described as a "bitter pill to swallow" for many consumers who were hoping for redress. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner is part of a long-standing "war with numbers." The author satirically suggests that Trump prefers to shape reality through feelings and loyalty rather than objective data, from his personal weight to national economic figures. The piece contends that by attacking and attempting to control sources of unbiased information, the administration is creating a "fog of vibes and misinformation." This approach, the author warns, will leave everyone unable to understand or address real-world problems, from the economy to public health.</p>

While not top-of-the-market acquisitions, manager Dave Roberts stated the moves "raise the floor for our ballclub." Stewart, a former Dodger, has reinvented himself as a high-leverage reliever, while Call provides a right-handed bat and solid defense. The front office hopes these additions will complement the existing roster, which they believe needs to perform more consistently to make a deep playoff run.</p>

          <p>Gillie Jenkinson, a psychotherapist who spent seven years in a religious cult, explains how to recognize these coercive groups. Key red flags include "love bombing," where affection is used for control; providing simple answers to complex life problems; and creating a high barrier to exit. Cults, which are not always religious, often use specific language and an "us-versus-them" mentality to isolate followers. The article emphasizes the need for more specialized mental health support for survivors and legal changes to address coercive control within groups.</p>

          <p>TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, revealed at an internal meeting that the median service length for its current 120,000 employees is 2.9 years. The average tenure is slightly higher at three years. This disclosure appears to counter online speculation that the company had a much higher turnover rate. The figures suggest that ByteDance is a relatively attractive employer within China's competitive tech industry, which is known for its demanding "996" work culture. ByteDance officially abandoned that schedule in late 2021 for a more standard work week.</p>
