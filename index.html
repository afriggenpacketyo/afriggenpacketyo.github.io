          <p>Heavy rainfall has caused devastating floods across Arizona, leading to the confirmed deaths of at least three people and prompting a large-scale search and rescue operation for others reported missing. In the town of Globe, the situation is compounded by a hazardous materials threat after floodwaters dislodged hundreds of residential propane tanks from a distributor, scattering them throughout the downtown area. Officials have declared an emergency, describing the flooding as unprecedented due to the extreme amount of rain that fell in a very short period, causing significant damage to buildings and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Moldova's pro-EU ruling party, led by President Maia Sandu, is set to win a clear majority in parliamentary elections, a result seen as critical for the nation's path toward joining the European Union. The election was conducted amid high tensions and warnings from Sandu about “massive Russian interference,” including disinformation campaigns and alleged plots to incite unrest. Despite these pressures and claims of victory from a pro-Russian opposition leader, the Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) secured approximately 50% of the vote, ensuring it can form a government without needing a coalition.</p>

          <h2>Guardian Columnist Critiques Kamala Harris's Election Memoir as Lacking Self-Awareness</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a critical review of Kamala Harris's election memoir, "107 Days," a columnist for The Guardian argues the book reveals a politician who is overly focused on the spectacle and machinery of politics rather than substantive policy or conviction. The author suggests the memoir portrays a candidate with a significant lack of self-awareness, who valued celebrity endorsements and media praise over connecting with voters on key issues. The review concludes that the book, rather than showing a muzzled politician, confirms that her campaign's perceived vagueness was a true reflection of her political approach.</p>

          <p>According to Goldman Sachs, China's central bank is increasingly likely to implement monetary easing measures in the fourth quarter to support slowing economic growth. The forecast includes a potential 10-basis-point policy rate cut and a 50-basis-point reduction in the reserve requirement ratio for banks. This analysis follows a central bank meeting where officials maintained a dovish stance, and analysts noted a subtle shift in official language from “positive momentum” to a more cautious tone, suggesting a growing concern over the economic outlook.

Adams's name will remain on the ballot, but his withdrawal marks a tumultuous end to his bid for a second term.</p>

          <p>JuJu Watkins, the standout star of USC women's basketball, has announced she will not play in the upcoming 2025-26 season in order to focus on recovering from a serious knee injury she sustained during the NCAA tournament in March. Her decision is a major blow to the Trojans' title hopes, but the program has expressed full support for her focus on a complete recovery. In her first two seasons, Watkins has become a national phenomenon, winning numerous player of the year awards and elevating USC into a top contender.</p>

          <p>In what is being described as the largest mass resignation in U.S. history, over 100,000 federal government employees are scheduled to formally resign on Tuesday. This mass departure is a direct result of a Trump administration program designed to implement sweeping cuts across the federal workforce. The resignations come as a government shutdown looms, with the White House also directing agencies to prepare large-scale firing plans should Congress fail to pass a new funding deal by the deadline.</p>

          <p>For Hong Kong to achieve its goals for green marine fuels, it must establish a reliable and tax-free supply chain for green methanol, according to the president of CM Energy. While the city has already implemented LNG and biodiesel fueling, progress on methanol is needed to support the shipping industry's transition to cleaner energy. The statement was made at a ceremony for the world's first large vehicle carrier capable of operating on methanol, which is seen as a key step toward decarbonizing the maritime sector in response to Europe's carbon tariffs.</p>

          <p>A BBC News investigation into the Schoen Clinic's specialist eating disorder unit in York has uncovered multiple allegations of unsafe practices and staff negligence from former patients and whistleblowers. The reports include staff members sleeping while they were supposed to be monitoring vulnerable patients, failing to intervene during acts of self-harm, and serving unhygienic food. Many patients claimed their conditions worsened during their stay at the facility, which was funded by the NHS and has since been closed due to low referral numbers.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formally requested that the U.S. Supreme Court provide an expedited review of its executive order aiming to end birthright citizenship for children of non-citizens. After two lower federal courts blocked the order, the administration is seeking a definitive judgment that would reinterpret the 14th Amendment, challenging over a century of established legal precedent. The government's filing argues for the necessity of a final decision by next summer, citing a compelling interest in ensuring citizenship is granted only to those lawfully entitled.</p>

          <p>Federal authorities have concluded that the gunman who attacked a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Dallas acted alone and was specifically targeting ICE personnel. An investigation revealed that the suspect, Joshua Jahn, had written notes expressing animus toward the agency and had been planning the assault for some time. The attack, carried out from a nearby rooftop, resulted in the death of one detainee and left two others in critical condition after Jahn fired on transport vans.</p>

          <p>Team Europe has won the 45th Ryder Cup, defeating the United States in a tense final day at Bethpage Black in New York.

Despite a late surge from the American team that narrowed the score, Europe held on to win 15-13, securing the trophy on away soil for the first time since 2012.</p>

          <p>The state of Oregon has filed a federal lawsuit to block the Trump administration's plan to deploy 200 National Guard troops to Portland, arguing the action is unlawful and based on false pretenses. Governor Tina Kotek stated she informed the president there is no insurrection or public safety threat justifying military intervention, calling his characterization of the city as "war ravaged" a work of "pure fiction." The state's attorney general asserts the move is an abuse of power, intended as a political display rather than a genuine public safety measure.</p>

With an October 1 funding deadline approaching, the president stated he doesn't see a path to resolving the issue and expressed confidence that the American public will blame Democrats for any shutdown. The statement sets a confrontational tone ahead of a critical meeting between Trump and congressional leaders aimed at averting a lapse in government funding and services.</p>
