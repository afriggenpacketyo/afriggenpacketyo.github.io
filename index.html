          <p>A 3.0 magnitude earthquake occurred near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, causing tremors felt across the New York City area. While the quake was minor, it startled residents, with some reporting it felt like a car hitting their house. Officials confirmed there were no reports of significant damage or injuries. The U.S. Geological Survey noted that while earthquakes are rare on the East Coast, this event was not considered significant and caused little reason for alarm, referencing a larger 4.8 magnitude quake from April 2024.</p>

          <p>Democratic legislators have fled Texas to deny Republicans the necessary quorum to vote on a new congressional map. The proposed map, backed by former President Trump, aims to create five new GOP-leaning districts, solidifying the party's majority in the U.S. House. At least 51 Democrats have traveled to Chicago, stating they are fighting for the democratic process against a "rigged system." This action mirrors past quorum breaks in Texas, though lawmakers now face potential fines and threats of arrest from state officials.</p>

          <p>Economist Jeffrey Sachs expressed concern that the United States' confrontational trade policies toward China could escalate into a self-fulfilling prophecy of war. He argued that the U.S. initiated the trade war and that continued friction will persist, even if a temporary agreement is reached. Sachs advised China to diversify its export markets away from the U.S. and Europe, focusing instead on developing regions like Africa and Southeast Asia. He emphasized that rationality is needed to manage the tensions, as both nations gain from continued trade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Rescuers at the El Teniente copper mine in Chile have recovered the body of the final trapped worker, bringing the total number of miners killed in the incident to five. The collapse, which trapped the workers deep underground, was triggered by a 4.2 magnitude tremor. State-owned mining company Codelco expressed its condolences as the search operation concluded. Authorities have now shifted their focus to a criminal investigation to determine whether the cause was natural tectonic activity or related to mining operations.</p>

          <p>Russia's Krasheninnikov Volcano, located on the Kamchatka Peninsula, has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, sending an ash cloud nearly 27,000 feet into the air. The eruption occurred just days after a powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake struck the region. While the event prompted an aviation alert, the area is sparsely populated and poses no immediate threat to local communities. Seismologists speculate the earthquake's seismic waves may have triggered the eruption in the geologically active region, shaking loose the magma system.</p>

The individual who fell into the water was reportedly unharmed. The incident occurred in Barnegat Bay, and the whale was later found deceased in shallow water. The Marine Mammal Stranding Center is coordinating the removal of the carcass for a necropsy to investigate the incident further. Authorities have warned other boaters to maintain a safe distance from the whale's remains for their own safety.</p>

          <p>American sprinter Sha'Carri Richardson narrowly missed qualifying for the 200m final at the U.S. Track and Field Championships, finishing just one-hundredth of a second too slow.

The disappointing performance concludes a difficult week for the athlete, who was arrested days earlier following an alleged domestic violence incident involving her boyfriend and fellow sprinter, Christian Coleman.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced plans to impose harsher penalties, including up to five years in prison, for people smugglers who use social media to advertise illegal immigration services. The move aims to combat criminal gangs that promote dangerous crossings of the English Channel online, which a majority of migrants have reportedly used to arrange their journeys. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper condemned the "immoral" practice of selling false promises of a safe journey. The plan is part of the Labour government's broader strategy to address the "small boats" crisis.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, announced that applications for a new $50 billion rural hospital stabilization fund will be available in early September. The fund was created as part of President Trump's recent legislative package to offset the impact of Medicaid cuts on rural healthcare providers. Dr. Oz stated the money is intended to support workforce development, system right-sizing, and the adoption of technology like telehealth. The new law also introduces work requirements for some Medicaid recipients, a change the administration believes will promote self-sufficiency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Tampa Bay Rays 3-0, relying on manufactured runs and solid pitching rather than power hitting. Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered 5 ⅔ scoreless innings, and the bullpen closed out the game despite a tense ninth inning. The Dodgers' runs came from aggressive baserunning, a swinging-bunt single, a double-steal, and a sacrifice fly, highlighting a shift to situational hitting amid a team-wide slump. The victory gave the Dodgers a winning 5-4 record on their nine-game road trip, providing some needed momentum.</p>

          <p>A number of former career attorneys from the U.S. Department of Justice are running for public office for the first time, motivated by what they describe as the politicization of the agency under President Trump. These former prosecutors, who resigned in protest of various administration policies, are now seeking positions from the U.S. House to local city attorney. They are campaigning on their public service backgrounds and a pledge to restore the rule of law, which they argue has been undermined. This trend marks a notable shift for typically non-partisan career officials into the political arena.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is proposing a compensation scheme for victims of car finance mis-selling, with potential payouts likely to be less than £950 per deal. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while not finding hidden commissions unlawful, did deem excessively high commissions to be unfair. The FCA will consult on a formal scheme, estimated to cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion, with the first payments expected next year.
