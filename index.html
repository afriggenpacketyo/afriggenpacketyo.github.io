        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hungary's ruling Fidesz party, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orban, has introduced a bill that could significantly curtail freedom of expression by monitoring, restricting, and potentially banning organizations deemed threats to national sovereignty. The proposed law targets entities receiving foreign funding and those critical of Hungary's constitutional values, which include Christian culture and traditional family structures. Critics argue the law mirrors tactics used in Russia to suppress dissent, potentially criminalizing and banning websites, political parties, and other groups that challenge Orban's regime. The bill is seen as a move to consolidate power ahead of upcoming elections and silence opposition voices under the guise of protecting national sovereignty.</p>

          <p>A Russian drone attack struck a civilian bus in the Sumy region of northeastern Ukraine, resulting in nine deaths and seven injuries, according to Ukrainian officials. The strike occurred shortly after unsuccessful peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv in Istanbul, which aimed to establish a ceasefire. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attack as a deliberate act against civilians, emphasizing the need for a full and unconditional ceasefire to save lives. Despite the failed talks, both sides have agreed to a large-scale prisoner exchange and are considering further negotiations.</p>

Interviews with 11 Russian soldiers reveal deep skepticism toward diplomatic efforts and a desire to conquer all four southern and eastern Ukrainian regions claimed by the Kremlin. The soldiers expressed bitterness towards officials and civilians, accusing them of benefiting from the war while ignoring frontline hardships, raising concerns about integrating servicemen back into civilian life after any peace deal.</p>

          <p>Financial advisors are cautioning that many American households are unprepared for the high costs associated with long-term care, which can easily exceed $100,000. Experts highlight that over half of Americans turning 65 today will likely require long-term care, with average future costs estimated at $122,400, potentially reaching hundreds of thousands of dollars for extended care periods. Many are unaware of these potential expenses, and traditional health insurance and Medicare often do not cover such costs, leaving individuals to rely on out-of-pocket funds or Medicaid, which requires significant depletion of assets to qualify.</p>

          <p>A key Los Angeles City Council committee has voted to significantly reduce the number of city employees facing layoffs, bringing the total down to approximately 650 from the originally proposed 1,600. The committee achieved this by implementing cost-cutting measures, such as slowing down police hiring and decreasing funding for Mayor Bass' Inside Safe program. These actions aim to protect essential city services, including sanitation, street repairs, and tree trimming. The committee's recommendations now proceed to the full council for consideration.</p>

          <h2>Lakers Should Prioritize Drafting Experienced, Mature Players, Columnist Argues</h2>

          <p>As the NBA draft combine concludes, a columnist argues that the Los Angeles Lakers should focus on drafting a mature, experienced player who has demonstrated the ability to handle money and fame during their college career. The piece highlights how recent economic shifts in college sports, particularly the introduction of "name, image, likeness" (NIL) policies, have allowed players to monetize their college careers, providing opportunities to learn from mistakes before entering the higher-stakes world of professional sports. The columnist suggests the Lakers should consider drafting a 24-year-old college graduate with NIL money in the bank and a good head on their shoulders.</p>

          <p>Violeta, an 18-month-old spider monkey, was rescued from a Vallejo home during a methamphetamine bust and is now receiving care at the Oakland Zoo.

Spider monkeys are endangered, and it is illegal to own them as pets in California, as they require specialized care. Zoo staff are providing Violeta with medical treatment, proper nutrition, and socialization to prepare her for a permanent home in an accredited zoo or sanctuary with a troop of spider monkeys.</p>

Moodyâ€™s Ratings also downgraded the U.S. government's credit rating, potentially increasing yields on Treasury bonds.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from swiftly deporting Venezuelan detainees accused of gang membership, sending the case back to a lower court to examine the legality of using the Alien Enemies Act. The court's decision underscores concerns about due process protections for the migrants, citing a case where a Maryland man was wrongly deported to a dangerous prison in El Salvador. President Trump expressed his frustration with the ruling, while lawyers for the migrants welcomed the decision, emphasizing the far-reaching implications of using wartime law without due process.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Starmer has signaled that a youth mobility scheme could be part of a new agreement with the EU, allowing young people to work abroad for up to two years. The scheme, intended to be reciprocal, aims to facilitate travel and study between the UK and EU countries without reinstating full freedom of movement. While details are still under discussion, the proposal seeks to improve business opportunities and living standards by easing post-Brexit restrictions, though some critics express concerns about uncapped migration.</p>

Despite these plans, no widespread ground invasion has yet occurred, though some ground troops have reportedly begun to advance. The escalation comes as mediators seek to broker a new truce, and the United Nations warns of a growing risk of famine in Gaza due to an Israeli blockade on humanitarian aid, prompting President Trump to acknowledge the suffering in the region.</p>
