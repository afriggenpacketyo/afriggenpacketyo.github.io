          <p>The head of Gaza City's Al-Shifa hospital reported that 21 children have died from malnutrition and starvation across the territory in just three days, with new cases arriving constantly. The UN human rights office stated these deaths result from Israel's interference with aid, and that over 1,000 Palestinians have been killed trying to get food since late May. The article details the dire humanitarian crisis, the depletion of food stocks, and the controversy surrounding the new aid distribution system.</p>

The first is a standard grace period on new purchases, which allows users to avoid interest if the balance is paid in full each month. However, there is generally no official grace period for late payments; missing a due date can result in immediate fees, penalty APRs, and potential damage to one's credit score, though some issuers may offer informal leeway.

          <p>The British Medical Association (BMA) has confirmed that a five-day strike by resident doctors in England will go ahead as planned, starting this Friday. This decision follows a week of negotiations with the government that failed to produce a resolution. The BMA stated that while talks on non-pay issues were constructive, the government did not provide a credible offer to address the core dispute, which remains the restoration of pay levels to what they were in 2008.</p>

          <p>Despite appearing functional to the public, U.S. national parks are being "hollowed out" by severe budget and staffing cuts under the Trump administration, according to former Glacier National Park superintendent Jeff Mow. While basic visitor services like cleaning toilets are prioritized, essential background work is being critically neglected. This includes resource preservation, invasive species removal, scientific monitoring, and trail maintenance, which threatens the long-term ecological health and purpose of these national treasures.</p>

          <p>UK government borrowing reached £20.7 billion in June, a figure significantly higher than expected and £6.6 billion more than the same month last year. The increase was driven by higher public service spending and soaring debt interest payments, which have been pushed up by inflation. These figures intensify the fiscal pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves, with economists warning that tax increases or spending cuts may now be required in the autumn budget.

          <p>This article argues that Donald Trump's persistent hostility towards Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stems from a fundamental disagreement with the Fed's apolitical mission. Trump's public commentary over the years reveals a belief that monetary policy should be a partisan tool used to boost the economy under Republican presidents and slow it under Democrats. He appears to view the Fed's stated goal of balancing inflation and unemployment for long-term stability as a facade for political maneuvering, rather than genuine economic stewardship.</p>
