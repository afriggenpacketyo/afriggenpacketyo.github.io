          <p>Former county cricketer Arul Suppiah discusses his struggles with anorexia, a serious mental health condition often associated with young women. Suppiah's health kick in 2017 spiraled into excessive exercise and restricted eating, leading to social isolation. After nearly fainting at work and a doctor's warning about potential hospitalization under the Mental Health Act, Suppiah began his recovery. He emphasizes that anorexia can affect anyone, regardless of age or gender, and that seeking help is crucial. </p>

Internal affairs minister Seiichiro Murakami stressed the importance of verifying information before sharing it, as a significant portion of those surveyed spread the misinformation further. </p>

The judge clarified that the IRS must adhere to strict limitations and can only share taxpayer identity information like name and address, not data exclusively from tax returns. </p>

          <p>Following a surprise trade agreement between the U.S. and China, investment banks are revising their economic forecasts for China. The agreement involves temporarily halting the majority of tariffs on each other's products, reducing them from 125% to 10% for 90 days. UBS now projects China's GDP growth in 2025 could reach between 3.7% and 4%, up from 3.4%. Morgan Stanley anticipates companies may expedite exports to leverage lower tariffs, potentially boosting China's second-quarter GDP above the current estimate of 4.5%. ANZ Bank also sees potential for China's GDP to exceed 4.2% this year. </p>

          <p>Following trade talks between the U.S. and China, tariff rates have been reduced, though not eliminated. Chinese goods shipped to the U.S. now face a baseline tariff rate of about 50%, combining previous tariffs with new duties still in force. This reduction addresses concerns about potential product shortages for the U.S. Christmas season. However, the duties imposed earlier this year, citing China's alleged role in the U.S. fentanyl crisis, remain in place.

However, as interest rates broadly decline, these fintechs, especially digital banks, face a critical test regarding the sustainability of their business models.

          <p>The Trump administration has requested the Supreme Court's permission to deport nearly 200 Venezuelan migrants detained in Texas, citing the Alien Enemies Act. The administration argues that the alleged members of Tren de Aragua "have proven to be especially dangerous to maintain in prolonged detention." ICE officials claim a group of migrants threatened to take hostages and injure staff. The Solicitor General argues that SCOTUS should not block the removal of detainees "who have been endangering others while in detention." </p>

          <p>Avelo Airlines, a budget carrier, has commenced deportation flights for ICE from Arizona, sparking a boycott petition and criticism from its flight attendants union. Avelo signed an agreement with the Department of Homeland Security to operate charter deportation flights from Mesa Gateway Airport. The airline's decision has faced backlash due to safety concerns and ethical considerations. Protests have been held outside airports in Arizona and Connecticut, urging travelers to boycott Avelo. Mesa is one of five hubs for ICE Air, the immigration agency's air transport operation for deportations. </p>

          <p>A new study suggests that liquid water may be present in the Martian crust, just a few kilometers beneath the surface. Researchers analyzed seismic waves from "marsquakes" recorded by NASA's InSight lander. The findings indicate a zone in the planet's crust that is best explained by a layer of water-saturated rock. This underground layer could contain as much water as a global layer up to 780 meters thick, potentially resolving the mystery of Mars' missing water. </p>

          <p>This article from the New York Times discusses how German companies, which invest heavily in the United States, are rethinking their strategies due to trade tensions. While German companies have long had factories in the U.S., recent surveys indicate a pullback in investment and a more pessimistic outlook. President Trump's tariffs are cited as a key factor, leading German manufacturers to keep investments at home. The article also notes the potential for increased domestic investment in Germany due to a new government focused on reducing bureaucracy and investing in infrastructure. </p>

          <p>This New York Times article analyzes how the second Trump administration is pushing the boundaries of ethical conduct by blending public office with personal benefits. The plan to accept a luxury jet from Qatar and the cryptocurrency meme coin contest are cited as examples of this trend. The article also discusses the disbanding of a Justice Department unit focused on cryptocurrency crimes and the narrowing of enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The author contrasts these actions with past instances of ethical lapses by politicians from both parties, arguing that the current moment is unique due to the openness with which the president and his family are leveraging his position for personal gain. </p>
