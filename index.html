          <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated that the U.S. is prepared to "fight and win" against China if deterrence fails, during the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore. Hegseth emphasized the U.S.'s commitment to the Indo-Pacific region and urged allies to increase military coordination and defense spending to counter China's growing military pressure. He criticized China's activities in the South China Sea and near Taiwan, asserting the U.S. will prevent China from controlling the Panama Canal, highlighting its importance as key terrain. Hegseth's statements come amid increasing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Optimism remains somewhat low given the potential for military conflict and increasing tensions. </p>

          <p>An inquiry is underway in Australia to investigate how Joel Cauchi, a man with a history of mental illness, was able to carry out a mass stabbing at the Westfield Bondi Junction shopping center in Sydney. The inquest is focusing on Cauchi's interactions with police and mental health professionals in the years leading up to the attack, scrutinizing whether there were missed opportunities for intervention. The inquiry heard emotional testimonies from victims' families, who described the horror of learning about the tragedy through media reports. The coroner aims to identify potential reforms to prevent similar events in the future, emphasizing that the hearings are not about assigning blame but rather about learning from the tragedy.

          <p>President Donald Trump lauded Nippon Steel as a "great partner" for U.S. Steel, suggesting a positive outlook on the Japanese company's investment into the American producer. Trump emphasized that U.S. Steel will remain under U.S. control, despite Nippon Steel's desired takeover, and announced plans to raise tariffs on steel imports to 50% from 25%. Nippon Steel's investment is considered the largest in Pennsylvania's history, promising to secure jobs and facilities for U.S. Steel workers. This statement comes after previous opposition from both Trump and then President Biden to the acquisition due to national security concerns. The combination of economic investment and protectionist measures gives a moderately optimistic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

Vice President JD Vance is tasked with overseeing efforts to remove what Trump considers "improper ideology" from the institution.

          <p>President Donald Trump touted an agreement between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, claiming it would keep the steelmaker in Pittsburgh and under U.S. control, though he offered few specifics. Trump announced Nippon would invest $14 billion, promising job security and a $5,000 bonus for U.S. Steel workers. Despite hailing the deal, Trump admitted he hasn't seen the final details yet. He also announced a plan to double tariffs on steel imports to 50%. The combination of economic investment and protectionist measures gives a moderately optimistic outlook.
