        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The People's Daily, the official newspaper of China's Communist Party, has issued a warning about the potential "addiction" and "out-of-control consumption" of blind boxes and blind card packs among young people in China, especially as the summer holiday approaches. The article emphasizes the allure of "unknown surprises" that can lead to impulsive spending and commercial traps. This caution mirrors previous regulations aimed at preventing online gaming addiction among teenagers, reflecting growing concerns about the impact of the "guzi economy" on the younger generation as the blind box purchases carry an element of gambling, augmented by the varied designs and rarity levels used by merchants to attract consumers. The article suggests strict identity verification to curb excessive spending by minors. </p>

          <p>The UK is experiencing an early summer heatwave, with temperatures expected to reach as high as 32C, and potentially 34C on Saturday. The UK Health Security Agency has issued an amber heat-health alert for all regions in England, warning of likely significant pressures across health and social care services, including a potential rise in deaths, particularly among those aged 65 and over or people with health conditions. The Met Office forecasts that many regions will meet the criteria for a heatwave, and a yellow weather warning for storms has been issued for parts of northern England, the Midlands, and Wales from Saturday afternoon into Sunday morning. While the current heat is record-breaking for 2025, it remains below the June peak of 35.6C recorded in 1976, and scientists say that climate change is making heatwaves hotter and longer.</p>

          <p>Taichi Kokubun, a member of the Japanese pop group Tokio, has been removed from the TV program "The Tetsuwan Dash" due to past conduct that breached compliance rules on multiple occasions. The decision was approved at an extraordinary board meeting following a third-party probe, and Kokubun has accepted the decision, with the network citing privacy concerns for not elaborating on the breaches. Kokubun has indefinitely suspended his activities, apologizing for his lack of awareness, naivety, arrogance, and inappropriate behavior, and his removal comes amid increased scrutiny of Japan's entertainment industry following other sexual misconduct scandals. Fukuda, the network's president, declined to elaborate further on the cases, citing a need to "protect privacy." </p>

          <p>Pro-Palestinian activists from Palestine Action broke into RAF Brize Norton, a UK airbase, and sprayed two military planes with red paint, claiming to have put the air-to-air refuelling tankers "out of service". The Ministry of Defence condemned the action and is conducting a security review, while Thames Valley Police are leading the investigation, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer denouncing the act as "disgraceful". The activists posted footage online showing them inside the base spraying paint into a jet engine, stating their actions were in response to Britain's continued military support for Israel. The incident raises serious questions about security at the airbase, which serves as a hub for UK strategic air transport and refuelling.</p>

          <p>Eutelsat shares experienced a significant surge after the European satellite operator announced a 1.35-billion-euro capital raise led by the French state. The capital increase, along with a debt refinancing plan, will support Eutelsat's investment in its Low Earth Orbit (LEO) capabilities, focused on business-to-business and business-to-government operations. Following the move, the French state will become Eutelsat's biggest shareholder, holding 29.99% of capital and voting rights, with India's Bharti Space Limited holding 18.7%. The company's shares have been volatile this year, with a spike in March based on expectations that it could be a European alternative to Elon Musk's Starlink. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail sales in the UK experienced a significant decline in May, with sales volumes dropping 2.7%, the largest monthly fall since December 2023, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The decline was primarily driven by a "dismal" month for supermarkets, which saw reduced sales of alcohol and tobacco, while clothing and household goods stores also reported "slow trading". Separate figures revealed that government borrowing hit the second-highest level for May since monthly records began in 1993, reflecting a rise in spending partly due to inflation-linked uplifts to many benefits. While sales volumes in the three months to May were up by 0.8% compared to the previous three months, economists suggest that the burst of economic growth earlier in the year may be over.

Brown was arrested in Manchester last month but released after paying a Â£5 million security fee, and has been appearing in concerts as part of his tour. He has had multiple run-ins with law enforcement over the years, including a felony assault conviction of his then-girlfriend, Rihanna, in 2009. Brown's probation in that case lasted until 2015.</p>

The article argues that even if Iran were developing nuclear weapons, military intervention is not the answer, and that diplomacy should be pursued. The author suggests that Israel's recent attack on Iran was aimed at preempting a potential diplomatic deal that would have stabilized the region. The author concludes that war with Iran would be a catastrophic mistake, and that the U.S. should step back from the brink and pursue a path of peace and diplomacy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese engineers have successfully developed and tested an artillery-launched drone system capable of withstanding the extreme forces of a 155mm cannon. The advance centers on a pyrotechnic ejection mechanism co-developed by the Shaanxi Applied Physics and Chemistry Research Institute, the Chinese air force, and defence contractor Norinco. The drones can reach distances exceeding 10 kilometers in seconds, multiply flight range, significantly save power consumption and extend loiter time, according to the team led by senior engineer Huang Yunluan. The system orchestrates a sequence of precisely timed detonations to separate the drone from its artillery shell mid-flight while shielding it from aerodynamic damage â€“ all without electronic controls.</p>

          <p>Arab and Gulf nations are expressing concerns that a potential U.S. attack on Iran would destabilize the region, with leaders scrambling for a diplomatic resolution. While many Arab governments have concerns about Iran's nuclear program and its allies in the region, they have also been normalizing relations with Iran in recent years, prioritizing regional stability. The article notes that if the U.S. were to enter the conflict, Iran or its allied militias would likely retaliate against American personnel and interests in the region, and that some fear the disintegration of the Iranian state. The article also notes the growing conviction that Israel, rather than Iran, is the biggest threat to instability in the region.</p>

          <p>An independent commission is urging the California Legislature to establish a new local authority to oversee and coordinate rebuilding efforts after the destructive fires in Los Angeles County. The proposed Resilient Rebuilding Authority would streamline recovery efforts, prioritize the return of residents and businesses, and use tax-increment financing to buy fire-razed lots and guide the rebuilding process. The commission also proposes a ballot measure to create a new Los Angeles County Fire Control District, funded through a property tax, to focus on wildfire prevention and vegetation management. The commission also recommends fast-tracking permitting for all-electric homes and providing incentives for electrification and solar power.</p>

          <p>The city of Los Angeles is facing a budget crisis, exacerbated by a significant increase in legal payouts for police misconduct, trip and falls, and other lawsuits, rising from $64 million a decade ago to $289 million this fiscal year. The reasons include aging infrastructure, larger jury awards, and an increase in the number of lawsuits filed against the city, with the largest portion of payouts related to "dangerous conditions" and civil rights violations. City officials have cited the legal payouts as a major factor in a nearly $1-billion budget shortfall, with some attorneys arguing that the City Attorney's legal strategies are contributing to the rising costs.</p>

The number of detainees has surged from around 300 in April to over 1,200, with reports of detainees sleeping on floors without blankets, being denied clean clothes, and lacking access to medication and legal counsel. Members of Congress who toured the facility expressed shock at the inhumane conditions, with the ACLU of Southern California noting that most detainees have no prior criminal record. The facility has been operating at reduced capacity since 2020 due to a COVID-19 lawsuit, but recent court orders have allowed it to fully reopen, exacerbating the overcrowding issue.</p>

The Attorney General's office has sent out hundreds of warning letters and is investigating fraud, scams, and low-ball offers on burned properties. A motion has been introduced to require the City Attorney to produce monthly reports detailing price-gouging complaints and enforcement actions, and the price-gouging rules are set to expire in July.</p>

          <p>A 69-year-old woman, Nancy Pexton, has been charged with the murder of Jennifer Abbott, also known as Sarah Steinberg, who was found fatally stabbed in her home in Camden, north London. The police believe the death may be linked to a missing diamond-encrusted Rolex watch from the victim's address, and a post-mortem examination concluded Ms Abbott died as a result of sharp force trauma. Ms Abbott was a popular member of the community, often seen walking her corgi dog in the Camden area, and was described by a neighbor as "mysterious, and very smart and intelligent". One of her neighbors, who did not want to be named, said Ms Abbott was "mysterious, and very smart and intelligent".</p>
