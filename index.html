        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. consumer price index increased by 0.4% in August, bringing the annual inflation rate to 2.9%, slightly hotter than economists' expectations. This rise in consumer costs was accompanied by an unexpected jump in weekly jobless claims, which reached their highest point since October 2021. These conflicting economic signals present a complex challenge for the Federal Reserve, which is widely expected to cut interest rates at its upcoming meeting despite the persistent inflation. The data reinforces market expectations for a rate cut to support a weakening labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield briefly dropped to 4% before rebounding as investors processed conflicting economic reports. The data showed that consumer prices in August were higher than anticipated, while weekly jobless claims also saw a significant increase, signaling potential weakness in the labor market. This combination of stubborn inflation and rising unemployment claims has complicated the outlook for the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision. Analysts suggest the concerning labor market data will likely ensure the Fed proceeds with a rate cut next week. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gold is widely regarded as a safe-haven asset and an inflation hedge, with its price influenced by a variety of complex factors. Key drivers include basic supply and demand, global economic conditions, and inflation rates, as investors often turn to gold during periods of uncertainty. Interest rates have an inverse relationship with gold prices, as lower rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding the non-yielding asset. Geopolitical turmoil, currency fluctuations, and central bank policies also play significant roles in the constant movement of gold's market value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Peter Mandelson has been dismissed as the UK's ambassador to the US following revelations about his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Known as a key architect of the "New Labour" movement and a political fixer nicknamed the "Prince of Darkness," Mandelson's career has been marked by multiple resignations and comebacks. He served in Tony Blair's cabinet, as an EU commissioner, and later returned to government under Gordon Brown. His appointment as ambassador was intended to build ties with the Trump administration, but his connection to Epstein ultimately proved to be his downfall.</p>

          <p>Liu Jun, a prominent mathematician from Harvard University, has explained that his decision to leave the United States for a position in China was driven by personal and family reasons. In an email to the South China Morning Post, Liu clarified that his move was not a form of political protest or a reflection of professional dissatisfaction with the U.S. Instead, he cited a deep, lifelong connection to the Tsinghua University campus where he was born and the desire to be with his family.

          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has decided to hold its key interest rates steady, maintaining the deposit facility rate at 2%. This decision comes as the Eurozone economy grapples with persistent uncertainty, largely stemming from the aggressive tariff policies implemented by the U.S. While inflation in the region is hovering around the ECB's 2% target, concerns remain about the impact of tariffs on economic growth, which was sluggish in the second quarter. The central bank stated it will continue a data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting approach, leaving the door open for potential rate cuts later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. inflation rate accelerated to 2.9% year-over-year in August, driven by rising costs for housing, food, and energy. This uptick in consumer prices comes as President Donald Trump's tariff policies are believed to be contributing to the increase. The report lands just before a Federal Reserve meeting where an interest rate cut is widely expected to address a slowing labor market. The economic data has been released amid political controversy, following Trump's recent firing of Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, a move that drew condemnation for undermining the agency's independence.

          <p>Nigel Farage, leader of Reform UK, is under pressure to clarify the financing of an £885,000 home in his Clacton constituency, which was purchased in his partner's name. Farage has denied avoiding stamp duty by structuring the purchase this way, claiming his partner, Laure Ferrari, bought it with her own funds from a wealthy family. However, a BBC investigation into French property and company records has found little evidence to support the claim of significant family wealth. The situation has opened Farage to accusations of hypocrisy, especially after his recent criticism of other politicians over their tax affairs.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Defines Trumponomics Not as Coherent Ideology but as a Formula for Personal Control</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article posits that President Donald Trump's economic policy, or "Trumponomics," lacks a consistent ideology and is instead a formula for exerting personal control. This formula consists of three parts: declaring an emergency to justify intervention, making threats to coerce private actors, and demanding tribute in the form of financial or political concessions. Examples include using emergency powers to impose tariffs and then reducing them after securing investment deals, or threatening companies and their leaders until they offer the government a stake. The approach is described as more about vanquishing opponents and creating leverage for personal gain than achieving specific, long-term economic goals for the country.</p>

          <p>Over 300 South Korean workers are being sent home from the U.S. following an immigration raid at an electric vehicle battery plant they were helping construct in Georgia. The workers, detained for allegedly working illegally, were skilled technicians crucial for the South Korean-invested project, a key part of President Trump's manufacturing revival plans. The incident has caused diplomatic friction, with South Korean officials calling it a "stab in the back." The issue highlights a clash between U.S. demand for foreign investment and its strict immigration enforcement, particularly as South Korea lacks a specific visa quota for its skilled workers.</p>

However, he is also a polarizing figure, often criticized for his lack of defensive effort and his frequent complaints to referees.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The tradition of teenage babysitting, once a common rite of passage, has largely been replaced by a professionalized industry of adult caregivers found through apps. This shift is attributed to factors like increased safety concerns, busier teen schedules with more extracurriculars, and higher parental expectations. The article argues that this trend represents a loss for both teenagers and younger children. Teens miss out on a valuable opportunity to develop responsibility, confidence, and critical thinking skills, while young kids lose the unique, playful mentorship that an older, but not-quite-adult, caregiver can provide, potentially weakening community ties between families.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has sacked its ambassador to the U.S., Peter Mandelson, after newly released documents revealed a deeper relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein than was previously known. A statement from the Foreign Office noted that emails showing Mandelson calling Epstein his "best pal" and suggesting his first conviction was wrongful constituted new information.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that the rampant use of AI for cheating is fundamentally undermining the liberal-arts tradition, necessitating a radical "de-teching" of college campuses. The author contends that when students use chatbots to complete assignments, they fail to learn critical thinking skills, and the integrity of the educational institution is compromised. The proposed solution is for colleges to take extreme measures, such as eliminating Wi-Fi, banning laptops and smartphones in favor of digital typewriters, and requiring internet-based work to be done in monitored labs. These steps, though seemingly draconian, are presented as necessary to preserve the core mission of higher education.</p>

The landmark decision was a victory for two couples who had challenged the law as archaic and patriarchal.

          <p>A new study published in the journal Nature has connected more than 200 severe global heat waves to the greenhouse gas pollution from major fossil fuel producers. The research found that the emissions from these "carbon majors," including companies like ExxonMobil, Chevron, and BP, made these deadly events substantially more likely and intense. Some of the most extreme heat waves, such as the 2021 Pacific Northwest heat dome, were deemed "virtually impossible" without the climate pollution from these specific entities.

          <p>The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has issued a warning about a rising trend of students hacking into their own schools' and colleges' IT systems. The agency states that a majority of "insider" cyber breaches in educational settings are carried out by pupils, often as a dare or for fun. These actions can involve guessing or stealing teacher passwords to access and alter sensitive databases containing personal information on thousands of students and staff. The ICO is urging educators to better recognize the "insider threat" posed by students, as these early hacking activities can sometimes escalate into more serious cybercrime.</p>
