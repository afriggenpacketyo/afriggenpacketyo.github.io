          <h2>PLA Study Warns Chinese Nuclear Reactors Vulnerable in Wartime</h2>

          <p>A new study by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) warns that China's rapidly expanding nuclear power infrastructure, with over 100 reactors mostly along the coast, is vulnerable to wartime attacks. The study emphasizes that these reactors could become high-value targets, potentially leading to catastrophic consequences if defenses are not adequate. Inspired by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Chinese military researchers are re-evaluating the security risks and proposing enhanced defense and emergency response strategies for these facilities. The project, initiated in 2023, highlights the evolving risks to critical infrastructure amid complex international and domestic environments.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams met with President Trump in Washington, D.C., to discuss city priorities, including infrastructure needs, coinciding with the release of documents related to Adams' previously dropped federal corruption case. Trump suggested Adams came to thank him for past support, while Adams initially focused on a wind farm project canceled by the Trump administration, later acknowledging gratitude for Trump's earlier support during the investigation. The released documents revealed that the F.B.I. investigated Adams for witness tampering, though no charges were filed on that matter, and the dismissal of the case has caused controversy within the Justice Department. The article highlights the sensitive timing of the visit given ongoing issues between New York City and the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Pakistan has accused India of firing missiles at its air bases, with retaliatory attacks reportedly underway, marking a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict between the two nations, which began after a tourist site attack in Kashmir. According to Pakistan, most of the missiles were intercepted, but some hit Nur Khan air base near Islamabad, Murid air base, and Rafiqui air base, and they also claim that retaliatory attacks are targeting missile storage facilities and airbases in Pathankot and Udhampur. India said it thwarted Pakistani drone and missile attacks, while Pakistan denied these claims. The escalating tensions have raised concerns about a broader conflict between the nuclear-armed rivals.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan are engaged in their most expansive military conflict in decades, marked by missile strikes and the use of drones for attacks and surveillance, following a militant attack in India-controlled Kashmir.

Both sides have been developing drone capabilities, marking the first instance of unmanned aerial vehicles being used in their conflict, reshaping the nature of hostilities.

Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested at the Delaney Hall detention center, an ICE facility, during a visit with members of New Jersey's congressional delegation, and charged with trespassing. Baraka, a Democrat running for governor, has protested the facility's opening, arguing it is dangerous and illegal, as it allegedly lacks proper permits. Government officials say Baraka ignored warnings to leave the premises, while members of Congress claim the arrest was an act of intimidation. The Department of Homeland Security stated that members of Congress "stormed the gate" at the ICE facility.</p>

          <p>Asfandyar Mir argues that the current military conflict between India and Pakistan marks a dangerous shift in their rivalry, eliminating diplomatic space and increasing the risk of escalation. The immediate trigger was a terrorist attack in Kashmir, leading to armed hostilities and a breakdown of traditional restraint. India's rise as a geopolitical power and Pakistan's internal struggles have fueled an uncompromising mindset, with the United States stepping back from its role as a crisis manager. The author emphasizes the need for international intervention to restore equilibrium and prevent a potentially catastrophic nuclear conflict.</p>

          <p>President Trump suggested that the U.S. may be open to lowering tariffs on China, proposing an 80% tariff rate ahead of trade negotiations in Switzerland. This conciliatory tone comes after months of tense trade relations, with the U.S. imposing tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese imports, prompting retaliatory levies from China. Analysts suggest that investors are interpreting Trump's statement as part of the negotiation process, with expectations that tariffs could be further reduced. A deal would be welcomed by businesses and consumers affected by price hikes due to the trade war.</p>

The artists are calling for support for an amendment proposed by Baroness Beeban Kidron that would allow for licensing agreements between creators and companies.

The spacecraft, weighing roughly 1,050 pounds and cloaked in a protective heat shield, was designed to survive a plunge through Venusâ€™s toxic atmosphere, which means thereâ€™s a good chance it will survive its dive through Earth's atmosphere. Experts estimate the re-entry will occur on Friday or Saturday, but the exact location of impact remains unknown.

          <p>Rich Trumka Jr., a former commissioner of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), said his dismissal by President Trump is illegal and that he plans to challenge the action in court. Trumka said his firing occurred after he and two other commissioners voted against allowing members of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to work at the agency. Consumer Reports and Democratic senators have condemned the CPSC firings, arguing that the commissioners should be reinstated immediately. Trumka contends that his firing would enable the administration to cripple the agency's lifesaving functions.</p>

          <p>As trade tensions escalate between the U.S. and China, analysts are exploring China's potential "nuclear option" involving its substantial holdings of U.S. mortgage-backed securities (MBS). China possesses over $1.2 trillion in MBS, accounting for 15% of the outstanding mortgage balances in the U.S., and flooding the market with these securities could devastate the American housing market. Additionally, China's significant holdings of U.S. debt in treasury bonds could further amplify its economic leverage. While extreme measures are unlikely, the potential impact on mortgage rates and the broader economy is a concern, especially given existing economic vulnerabilities.</p>

          <p>White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said the Trump administration is "actively looking at" suspending habeas corpus, the right to challenge detention in court, for migrants. Miller justified this potential suspension by arguing that the United States faces a national security threat from undocumented migrants "invading" the country. Legal experts argue that a president cannot suspend habeas corpus without authorization from Congress, citing historical examples and constitutional provisions.

          <p>President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods have significantly impacted the port of Long Beach, the busiest port in the western hemisphere, with traffic down by nearly a third. The decline translates to fewer ships, containers, and jobs, affecting lorry drivers and other port-related industries. Shortages of certain imported items and price hikes are taking hold, particularly in areas like downtown LA's toy district. The trade tensions have led to empty shelves and uncertainty among business owners, highlighting the far-reaching consequences of the trade war.</p>

The investigation, conducted under the Trade Expansion Act, seeks industry input on demand, foreign suppliers, and government favoritism. Tariffs could harm the aerospace industry, which relies heavily on specialized global suppliers, though it has produced one of the largest trade surpluses of any industry for years. Companies like Boeing, RTX, and GE Aerospace have already experienced tariff-related costs, and the industry is engaging with the Commerce Department to address concerns.</p>
