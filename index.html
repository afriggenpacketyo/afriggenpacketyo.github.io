          <p>The Trump administration dismissed General Timothy Haugh, head of the National Security Agency and US Cyber Command.  This action followed reports of a broader purge of top security officials, sparking concern among Democrats who voiced fears for national security.

          <p>The US and UK have been awarded unopposed bids to host the 2031 and 2035 Women's World Cups, respectively. While celebrating established fanbases and infrastructure, the lack of competition raises concerns about the global development of women's football.

          <p>House Republicans introduced a resolution to repeal a 2024 rule that closed a loophole allowing small-quantity production of PFAS chemicals without regulatory review.  This move has drawn criticism from environmental groups, who highlight the severe health risks associated with PFAS, even at low exposure levels.  The proposal aims to re-open a pathway for these dangerous chemicals to enter the market with minimal scrutiny.</p>

          <p>The 10-year Treasury yield dropped below 4%, driven by investor anxieties over a potential global recession triggered by escalating trade tensions.  China's retaliatory tariffs further fueled the flight to safety, pushing yields to their lowest point since October.  This reflects growing concerns that the tariff war could negatively impact economic growth and increase inflation.</p>
