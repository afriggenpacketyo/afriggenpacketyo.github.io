          <p>Multiple NFL teams, including the Tennessee Titans and Dallas Cowboys, conducted pregame moments of silence to honor conservative activist Charlie Kirk following his assassination. The league coordinated an initial tribute but left the decision for Sunday's games up to individual teams, resulting in varied participation across the league. The article notes that the tributes in stadiums were generally well-received by fans, highlighting the New York Jets' decision to hold one as particularly noteworthy given the region's political landscape.

          <p>A long-simmering feud between country music stars Zach Bryan and Gavin Adcock escalated into a face-to-face confrontation at the Born & Raised Festival in Oklahoma. Video footage shows the two artists yelling at each other through a chain-link fence before Bryan climbed over it, requiring security to intervene. The dispute reportedly began in July after Adcock criticized Bryan for not meeting with fans and being thin-skinned. Adcock shared clips of the incident on social media, alleging that Bryan made threats during the altercation.</p>

          <p>The fatal shooting of activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University has brought renewed attention to a recent state law permitting open carry of firearms on college campuses. The legislation, HB 128, added to Utah's already permissive gun laws, which include permitless carry and a lack of red-flag laws. While the suspect's legal right to possess the weapon on campus is unclear, the timing of the law's passage has intensified the debate over campus safety measures. The article explores the context of Utah's "school hardening" approach versus gun control policies.</p>

          <p>Romania has reported that a Russian drone breached its airspace, making it the second NATO member, after Poland, to confirm such an incident recently.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the incursion an "obvious expansion of the war," while Moscow has not commented. The event has heightened security concerns along NATO's eastern flank, prompting Poland to increase its air defense readiness and the Czech Republic to deploy helicopters.</p>

          <p>The family of the late Virginia Giuffre has publicly stated that Prince Andrew should be fully investigated regarding allegations that he sexually abused her when she was 17. In an interview with the BBC, Giuffre's brother, Sky Roberts, expressed that the prince has not faced sufficient consequences despite being stripped of royal duties. He argued that the out-of-court settlement reached in 2022 was not enough and called for legal accountability. Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein, died in April after years of campaigning for survivors.</p>

          <p>In municipal elections in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, Chancellor Friedrich Merz's center-right CDU is projected to finish first. However, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) saw a significant surge, tripling its share of the vote from 5.1% in 2020 to a projected 16.5%. The results are viewed as a key test for Merz's federal coalition government. While the CDU maintained its lead, the strong performance of the AfD in a major western German state highlights the party's growing influence beyond its traditional eastern strongholds.</p>

          <p>The increasing popularity of "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services like Affirm and Klarna is posing a significant challenge to traditional banks and credit card companies. These services, which allow consumers to make interest-free installment payments, are diverting transactions that would have otherwise gone through credit cards, thus reducing revenue for financial institutions. A major concern for banks is that BNPL usage is often not reported to credit bureaus, creating a "giant black hole" in their understanding of a consumer's overall debt and credit risk.
