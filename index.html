          <p>A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order, halting the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelans without hearings.  The judge questioned the legality of the administration's action and ordered any deported Venezuelans to be returned to the United States. The order's immediate impact remains unclear.</p>
