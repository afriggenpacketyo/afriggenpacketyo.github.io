          <p>China's foreign ministry has issued a stern warning to the Philippines, urging Manila to "stop playing with fire" regarding its stance on Taiwan. The statement came after Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. remarked that his country could not avoid being involved in a potential US-China conflict over Taiwan due to its geographic proximity. Beijing, which considers Taiwan a renegade province, accused the Philippines of reneging on its one-China principle commitments and undermining regional stability. This exchange highlights the escalating diplomatic tensions in the South China Sea region.</p>

          <p>Israel's Security Cabinet has approved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plan to expand military operations with a full takeover of Gaza City, marking a major escalation in the 22-month conflict. The plan reportedly involves evacuating civilians to central areas by October 7, followed by a siege and ground offensive against remaining Hamas militants. The decision has drawn criticism from families of Israeli hostages, who fear for their safety, and condemnation from aid groups like MSF and the WHO, which report unprecedented levels of malnutrition and systemic violence against civilians at aid distribution centers.</p>

          <p>An article in the People's Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, has detailed China's ambition to build a "world-class" military by the middle of the century. The piece explicitly names the United States military as the benchmark for this goal, stating that China's armed forces must be able to "stand on equal footing with global powers." The criteria for a world-class military were defined as matching China's global status, ensuring national security, and possessing strong international influence. This involves achieving top-tier standards in weaponry, military theory, and personnel.</p>

          <p>Shares in Japan's SoftBank Group surged by 13%, marking their best performance in five years and reaching a new record high. This follows the company's fiscal first-quarter profit of 421.8 billion yen, which significantly exceeded market expectations and marked a second consecutive profitable quarter. The gains were largely driven by a $4.8 billion increase in the value of its Vision Funds, buoyed by strong performances from portfolio companies like Grab and Swiggy. Several other portfolio companies, including Lenskart and PayPay, are also expected to go public soon. (not investment advice)</p>

The suspect, identified as 61-year-old Carmine Faino, first shot and killed his neighbor before ambushing the responding officers with a rifle from a tactical position. The two troopers, Joseph Perechinsky and William Jenkins, were both shot multiple times but are in stable condition after being airlifted to hospitals. The suspect, who also shot down a police drone, was later killed by law enforcement, ending the public threat.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has increased the reward for information leading to the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to $50 million. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the increase, accusing Maduro of being a major narco-trafficker who works with cartels to bring fentanyl-laced cocaine into the United States. This move doubles the previous $25 million bounty and escalates pressure on the Venezuelan leader, who was indicted on narco-terrorism charges in the U.S. in 2020. Venezuela's foreign minister dismissed the new reward as a "pathetic" political propaganda operation.</p>

This represents the stock's worst single-day drop in almost 15 years, bringing it to a three-year low.

This marks the fourth court decision to halt the policy, which aims to deny automatic citizenship to children born in the U.S. to parents who are not citizens or are in the country on temporary visas. The judge certified the case as a class action, a legal pathway left open by a recent Supreme Court ruling that had otherwise limited nationwide injunctions.

          <p>A new study published in Science Advances quantifies how climate change has altered California's fire season, finding that it now starts significantly earlier than it did three decades ago. Across the state, the season begins an average of six weeks sooner, with some regions like the Cascade Range seeing it start 46 days earlier. Researchers attribute this shift primarily to climate-related factors, including earlier snowmelt and the increased drying of vegetation due to rising temperatures, rather than human-caused ignitions. The findings provide a scientific basis for the anecdotal sense among residents that wildfire risk is a near-constant threat.</p>

          <p>The bodies of a man and a woman were discovered fatally shot inside a car along the Pacific Coast Highway near Point Mugu State Park. A passerby found the vehicle on Wednesday evening, and responding deputies from the Ventura County Sheriff's Office confirmed the deaths. Investigators determined the 45-year-old man and 46-year-old woman had been shot and were likely deceased for several days before being found. The Sheriff's Office is treating it as an isolated incident and has stated there is no immediate threat to the public while the investigation continues.</p>

          <p>A growing number of people, particularly millennials, are reportedly moving away from dating apps and returning to old-fashioned, in-person singles events. Organizers of such events, like Date Cincy in Cincinnati, are seeing a surge in popularity as individuals seek more genuine face-to-face connections. This trend coincides with a significant drop in the stock value of dating app Bumble and data from Eventbrite showing a 42% rise in attendance at dating events from 2022 to 2023. Participants cite frustration with the superficiality of online profiles and a desire for the authentic chemistry that can only be found in person.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reveals that Americans get an average of 55% of their daily calories from ultra-processed foods. The consumption is even higher among young people aged 1 to 18, who derive nearly 62% of their calories from these products. The report defines ultra-processed foods as those high in salt, sweeteners, and unhealthy fats, with little to no whole-food content, such as sandwiches, sweet bakery products, and savory snacks. This data comes as previous research increasingly links high consumption of these foods to numerous negative health outcomes.</p>

          <p>Tonia Haddix, an exotic animal broker featured in the HBO docuseries "Chimp Crazy," has been sentenced to 46 months in federal prison. Haddix pleaded guilty to perjury and obstruction of justice for lying to a judge about the death of a chimpanzee named Tonka, whom she was hiding in her basement. The celebrity chimp was later discovered by animal rights group PETA in a small cage and relocated to a sanctuary. Haddix's sentencing is seen as a victory for animal welfare advocates who have long campaigned against the private ownership and trade of primates.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has enacted a new wave of broad tariffs on imported goods, pushing the average rate to 18.3%, the highest level seen in the United States since 1934. The move has prompted international concern, with nations like Brazil and Switzerland planning responses to mitigate the economic impact on their industries. The White House maintains that the tariffs are necessary to rebalance the U.S. economy and encourage domestic manufacturing and investment. However, the policy has created significant uncertainty in global markets and is expected to increase costs for American consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Instagram's launch of a new "Map" feature has triggered a significant backlash from users concerned about privacy. The tool, similar to Snapchat's Snap Map, can share a user's "last active location" with their followers to help them "stay up-to-date with friends." Although Meta, Instagram's parent company, insists the feature is opt-in by default, many users reported confusion and fear that their location was being shared without their explicit consent. Instagram's head, Adam Mosseri, responded to the complaints, stating the company was investigating but believes the feature is working as designed.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning legislation to impose stricter geographical restrictions on serious violent and sexual offenders after their release from prison. The new system would confine offenders to specific, tailored zones rather than just excluding them from certain areas, such as a victim's home. Monitored by enhanced electronic tagging, these "confinement zones" are intended to give victims greater peace of mind and freedom of movement. While the government says the plan will be supported by new technology and staff, critics have raised concerns about placing additional pressure on an already strained probation service.</p>
