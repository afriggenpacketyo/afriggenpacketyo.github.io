        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Intense flash flooding in the Ruidoso area of southern New Mexico has resulted in at least three fatalities and prompted dozens of swift-water rescues. The flooding was so severe that it swept an entire house downstream, an event captured on video. Officials noted that the Rio Ruidoso's water levels rose dramatically in minutes, hitting a record height. The region's vulnerability to such events has been heightened by burn scars from wildfires last summer, which have destabilized the soil and increased the risk of rapid runoff.</p>

          <p>Former MasterChef presenter Gregg Wallace is facing new allegations of misconduct from an additional 50 individuals, which he denies. The claims, which follow his sacking from the show, primarily involve inappropriate sexual comments, with 11 women accusing him of physical acts like groping. A prominent legal watchdog has publicly advised Wallace not to dismiss the women's claims as fabrications if he hopes for a potential career comeback. An independent inquiry into the initial allegations is expected to release its findings shortly.</p>

          <p>G8 Education, a major Australian childcare operator, will accelerate the installation of CCTV in its 400-plus centers after an employee was charged with over 70 offenses, including the sexual assault of eight children. The company apologized for the pain caused and will also allow parents to choose which staff members can handle toileting and nappy changes. While the move is a response to the deeply disturbing allegations, child safety experts have raised concerns that cameras are not a complete solution and could create a false sense of security.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy shift, President Trump announced plans to send more defensive weapons to Ukraine, criticizing Vladimir Putin's actions just a week after a freeze on such shipments. The administration is also engaging in discussions with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu regarding the release of hostages in Gaza, with officials expressing hope for a ceasefire deal by the end of the week. Additionally, during a cabinet meeting, Trump floated the idea of the federal government assuming direct control over Washington, D.C., to address crime rates.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has issued a security warning to its diplomats about a campaign using artificial intelligence to impersonate Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other high-level officials. An impostor reportedly attempted to contact foreign ministers and U.S. politicians via text, Signal, and voicemail. While these initial attempts were described as unsophisticated and unsuccessful, the incident highlights the growing national security threat posed by increasingly realistic and accessible deepfake technology, which the FBI has also warned about.</p>

The article points to recent polling data showing historic support for Trump among this demographic, which it attributes to dissatisfaction with Democratic policies on issues beyond immigration. However, the widespread and indiscriminate nature of recent ICE raids in communities like Los Angeles is now generating fear and backlash, potentially radicalizing a new generation and reversing the Republican party's progress.</p>

These private companies, which compete with state-run franchises and assume all revenue risk, are credited with improving service and lowering fares on routes like the East Coast Main Line. However, the transport secretary has signaled a more rigorous approach to their applications, raising concerns that the government may be seeking to protect state-run entities from competition.

          <p>Milwaukee Brewers' rookie pitcher Jacob Misiorowski delivered a stunning performance, striking out 12 batters over six innings to lead his team to a 3-1 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers. Despite an early leadoff home run by Shohei Ohtani, the Dodgers' lineup was overwhelmed by the 23-year-old's high-velocity pitching, which frequently exceeded 100 mph. The loss marked the fifth consecutive defeat for the struggling Dodgers. Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw praised his young counterpart's 'unbelievable' and 'special' performance on the mound.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formally announced its intent to impose additional tariffs on Japan and South Korea, two key export-dependent allies already facing economic headwinds. The new duties, set at 25%, target major exports like automobiles and steel, raising fears of pushing Japan into a technical recession and further slowing South Korea's growth. Both economies, which rely heavily on exports to the U.S., saw their GDP contract in the first quarter of the year, and analysts predict the tariffs will further dampen their economic outlooks.

The BRICS group, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, and several other nations, seeks to increase the influence of the Global South and reform Western-dominated international institutions, and has not officially responded to Trump's posture.</p>

In contrast, China is taking a more proactive role, exemplified by the launch of the China-initiated International Organisation for Mediation (IOMed) in Hong Kong, creating an opportunity for the city to enhance its global influence.
