          <p>UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy met with Syria's interim government, urging transparency and inclusivity following the ousting of the Assad regime. Despite the new leadership's ties to a UK-proscribed terror group, Lammy stated the UK is looking "to the future" and engaging with the new administration. The visit occurs amid international concerns over violent attacks on minority groups, restrictions on social freedoms, and fears of a new dictatorship. The UK has lifted sanctions and committed humanitarian aid to support a peaceful transition.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods in Texas Hill Country have led to a "mass casualty event," with at least 32 people, including 14 children, confirmed dead. The Guadalupe River rose approximately 26 feet in just 45 minutes, catching communities and a children's summer camp by surprise. Over two dozen people, primarily from Camp Mystic, remain missing as extensive air and ground rescue operations continue. Officials described the event as unforeseen and devastating, with Governor Greg Abbott signing a federal disaster declaration.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced the creation of a new political party, the "America Party," following a poll he conducted on his social media platform, X. He suggested the party could gain significant influence by targeting a small number of key congressional seats, acting as a deciding vote on contentious legislation. The move follows a public falling out with Donald Trump and Musk's vocal opposition to a recent government spending bill. Musk stated the party would caucus independently and engage with both Democrats and Republicans.</p>

          <p>Hamas has formally submitted a "positive response" to the latest proposal for a 60-day ceasefire and hostage exchange, indicating readiness for further negotiations on implementation details. The proposed deal involves the release of 10 living hostages and 15 bodies in exchange for a yet-to-be-determined number of Palestinian prisoners. However, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's office stated that the changes Hamas requested are "unacceptable," though a negotiating team will still travel to Qatar to continue talks.</p>

          <p>The UK's Charity Commission has issued a formal warning to the Nottingham Islam Information Point after one of its trustees delivered an "inflammatory and divisive" sermon shortly after the October 7 Hamas attacks.

          <p>The Madre fire, burning in a rural area of San Luis Obispo County, has grown to nearly 80,000 acres, making it the largest wildfire in California this year. The blaze, which is approximately 10% contained, has forced over 200 people to evacuate and threatens about 50 structures. A key concern is the fire's proximity to the Carrizo Plain National Monument, a habitat for several endangered species. Over 600 firefighters are battling the fire, which has been fueled by heat and wind, with a new heat wave expected to raise fire risk further.</p>

          <p>A new mural in Roubaix, France, titled "The Statue of Liberty's Silent Protest," has gone viral for its commentary on recent U.S. immigration policies. The painting by Dutch artist Judith de Leeuw shows Lady Liberty covering her face with her hands in an apparent expression of shame. The artist chose the location due to its large migrant population and stated that the values the statue once represented have been lost for many. The mural's unveiling on July 4th, the anniversary of France gifting the statue to the U.S., has sparked widespread online discussion.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has drawn sharp criticism from Jewish anti-discrimination groups after using the antisemitic term "Shylock" during a rally in Iowa. The term, which originates from a ruthless Jewish moneylender character in Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice," is considered an offensive slur. The Anti-Defamation League called the president's use of the term "very troubling and irresponsible." When questioned, Trump claimed he was unaware the term was considered offensive and that he simply meant a moneylender who charges high rates.</p>

          <p>A mysterious figure dressed in a black suit and cat mask, dubbed "panther man" by locals, has been sighted prowling near a pub in Wallasey, Merseyside. The individual has been filmed wriggling under fences and reportedly making "growling" noises, leading to comparisons with the "Somerset Gimp," who menaced residents in another part of England. While some residents find the behavior amusing and harmless, others express concern that it could be frightening or escalate.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An inquiry into the fairness of the U.S. tax system reveals that the core issue is not tax rates, but how different types of income are treated. While the wealthiest Americans pay an average federal income tax rate comparable to some middle-class brackets, they benefit from a system that taxes wealth less than labor. Billionaires utilize strategies like "buy-borrow-die," where they live off loans taken against their appreciating assets, which are not taxed as income. This allows wealth to grow and be passed on largely untaxed, a privilege unavailable to wage earners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is facing criticism for sending an email claiming a new bill signed by President Trump eliminates federal income taxes on benefits for most recipients. Critics, including former SSA officials, have labeled the message as "blatant misinformation" and a "lie." The bill does not eliminate the tax but instead provides a temporary deduction that phases out for higher-income seniors. The email's partisan tone was seen as a departure from the agency's typically apolitical communications, raising concerns about its politicization. (not investment advice)</p>

Many felt that the party had not delivered on its promises, particularly concerning immigration, and some even felt "lied to." While some participants were more forgiving, acknowledging the difficulty of "steadying the ship," others were critical of the government's frequent U-turns. The discussion also revealed that some of these former Labour voters are now considering supporting Reform UK in a future election.</p>

McMurdock has denied any wrongdoing but stated he requested the suspension as a "precautionary measure" to protect the party. Reform UK will conduct its own internal investigation into the matter, and McMurdock will now sit as an independent MP.</p>
