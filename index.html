        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government in England has announced that free school meals will be extended to an additional 500,000 pupils by September 2026, benefiting children whose parents receive Universal Credit, regardless of their income. This measure aims to save parents £500 annually and lift 100,000 children out of poverty. While Labour supports the expansion, they also face calls to address child poverty by scrapping the two-child benefit cap. Critics claim the policy could reduce school funding, but the government has allocated £1 billion to fund the change, with details to be outlined in the upcoming spending review. The move has been welcomed by celebrities and organizations focused on child poverty. The optimism score of this article is relatively high, as it reflects a positive step towards addressing child poverty and improving educational outcomes for vulnerable children.</p>

          <p>A public disagreement has erupted between President Trump and Elon Musk regarding the president's proposed megabill, with Trump expressing disappointment in Musk's criticism. Musk, in turn, accused Trump of ingratitude, claiming he was instrumental in Trump's election victory. The bill, which passed the House, faces opposition in the Senate, with Musk arguing it would increase the deficit. Trump contends that Musk's opposition stems from the removal of tax credits for electric vehicles, but Musk denies ever seeing the bill before its passage. The tone of the article is more neutral, simply reporting the facts of the disagreement between two prominent figures.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected a lawsuit filed by Mexico that sought to hold American gun manufacturers accountable for their role in the country's struggle with drug cartels. The court unanimously upheld a 2005 law shielding gun manufacturers from liability when their products are misused. Mexico argued that U.S. firms deliberately appealed to cartel members through their products and practices. The court found that Mexico's complaint failed to plausibly allege that manufacturers aided and abetted unlawful sales to Mexican traffickers. The decision reflects a legal interpretation, but the outcome has serious implications for efforts to curb gun violence across borders.</p>

If passed, the legislation would mandate an intelligence assessment of risks posed by Chinese bases overseas and instruct the State and Defense departments to identify high-risk locations.
