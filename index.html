          <p>A persistent heat dome is shifting eastward across the United States, placing over 100 million Americans under heat alerts. Forecasters predict temperatures 10 to 15 degrees above average, with feels-like temperatures exceeding 100 degrees in many areas along the East Coast and Mississippi Valley. The extreme conditions are exacerbated in the Midwest by a phenomenon known as "corn sweat," where millions of acres of corn release vast amounts of water vapor, significantly increasing humidity and the heat index. Authorities are warning of a heightened risk of heat-related illnesses during this prolonged event.</p>

          <p>As tourism booms in Las Vegas, the city's famous buffets are experiencing overwhelming crowds and long lines. Visitors are packing iconic spots like the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars Palace and the Buffet at Wynn, making it difficult to secure a table without significant waiting. To combat this, local experts and chefs advise planning ahead by making online reservations, arriving during off-peak hours, or trying less crowded weekday lunch buffets. Utilizing hotel loyalty programs for priority access is another recommended strategy for a better dining experience.</p>

          <p>Ahead of President Trump's visit to Scotland to open a new golf course, local residents near his Aberdeenshire property hold divided opinions. Some neighbors remain resentful over the development's impact on the natural landscape and Trump's past treatment of property owners who refused to sell. Activists are planning protests, citing a clash between his policies and Scottish values. However, others in the community acknowledge the positive economic impact and employment the golf course has brought to the area, suggesting that politics should be kept separate from the sport.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new Arctic strategy, which includes a nearly $9 billion investment in icebreakers, is intensifying the geopolitical debate over the region's future. The move is seen as a direct effort to reassert American dominance in the Arctic and counter China's growing influence. Chinese scholars argue that as climate change opens the Northern Sea Route, it offers a strategic new shipping pathway that could help Beijing bypass U.S. geopolitical containment. This highlights the increasing competition between the two powers for control over the resource-rich and strategically vital polar region.</p>

The inquest heard that Slater had become lost while attempting a long walk back to his accommodation and died instantly from non-survivable skull fractures.

          <p>An Argentine court has ordered Google to pay the equivalent of $12,500 in compensation to a man who was photographed naked in his yard by a Street View camera. The man, a policeman, argued that his dignity was violated when the image, showing him from behind, was published online and widely circulated. An appeals court overturned a lower court's decision, ruling that Google committed a "blatant" invasion of privacy by capturing an image within the confines of his home, behind a tall wall. The judges stated that the company should have prevented the publication of the man's entire naked body.</p>

          <p>As concerns about sunscreen safety circulate online, health experts are emphasizing the importance of using these products to prevent skin cancer while clarifying the science behind them. Ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun damages skin and can lead to cancer, making protection essential. While some long-approved chemical ingredients have been detected in the bloodstream, scientists note that the dose matters and current evidence does not prove they are dangerous at typical exposure levels. Researchers also warn against do-it-yourself sunscreens, which offer negligible protection, and are exploring new, plant-based compounds for future products.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has approved the $8 billion merger between Skydance Media and entertainment giant Paramount Global. The decision allows for the transfer of broadcast licenses for 28 CBS television stations to the new entity. The approval follows several controversial moves, including a $16 million settlement paid by Paramount to Donald Trump and the cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert." As part of the deal, Skydance has made commitments to the FCC to ensure unbiased journalism and end certain diversity and inclusion initiatives.</p>

          <p>In an effort to address a severe housing shortage exacerbated by last year's wildfire, the Maui County Council has passed a bill to phase out a large number of short-term vacation rentals. The legislation closes a loophole that allowed condos in apartment-zoned areas to be rented to tourists for short stays. By converting these units to long-term housing, officials hope to add over 6,000 units to the local housing stock. While proponents see it as a critical step for residents, opponents argue it will harm the local tourism economy and small businesses.</p>

Son's future at Spurs is currently in doubt, as he has one year left on his contract and the new manager has not guaranteed he will retain the captaincy. This potential move would see another high-profile Spurs player, following Hugo Lloris, make the switch to the Los Angeles-based team.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to keep its benchmark interest rate steady, despite growing pressure from President Donald Trump for significant cuts. Trump has argued that high rates are hurting American families and businesses, while Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has indicated that cuts have been delayed due to inflation risks posed by the administration's tariff policies. This standoff highlights the tension between the White House's desire for economic stimulus and the central bank's mandate to control inflation, leaving consumers to navigate continued high borrowing costs for credit cards and loans.

This shift from a nearly 60% win rate to the mid-40s signals the league's growing maturity. Analysts attribute the change to several factors, including the adoption of charter flights, improved travel and recovery science to combat fatigue, more consistent refereeing with VAR, and the evolution of more sophisticated away-game tactics.
