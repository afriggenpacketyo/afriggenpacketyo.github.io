          <p>A former student at the Switzer Learning Center in Torrance, California, was arrested after allegedly stabbing three staff members and attempting to attack a fourth. The suspect then informed police he had planted two pipe bombs nearby, which were located and safely neutralized by a bomb squad. Two of the victims were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries, while a third was treated at the scene. The police have not released the suspect's name or a potential motive for the attack, and the investigation remains ongoing.</p>

          <p>Indonesian authorities have discovered traces of radioactivity at a clove farm on Sumatra island, prompting an investigation after the U.S. FDA found Cesium-137 in Indonesian spices and shrimp. The contaminated farm has been barred from selling its products as officials work to determine the source of the radiation. This discovery follows the detection of the same radioactive isotope at an industrial estate near Jakarta, leading the government to suspend scrap metal imports. The FDA has banned products from the implicated Indonesian companies until the safety issues are resolved.</p>

          <p>Shares of U.S. rare earth mining companies, including Critical Metals and MP Materials, experienced a significant rally in premarket trading. This surge follows President Trump's threat to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese imports and Beijing's announcement of a new framework to restrict its own rare earth exports. China currently dominates the global supply chain, producing nearly 70% of the world's rare earths and processing almost 90%. The market volatility reflects investor concerns over a potential escalation in the trade dispute between the two economic powers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Commission has fined luxury fashion brands Gucci, Chloe, and Loewe a total of over €157 million for violating EU competition laws. The investigation found that the companies illegally restricted independent retailers from setting their own online and offline prices, effectively dictating minimum sales prices and discount rates. This anti-competitive behavior resulted in artificially higher prices and reduced choices for consumers across the European Union. The parent companies involved are Kering, Richemont, and LVMH, some of the largest conglomerates in the luxury goods sector.</p>

          <p>Meta has updated its content guidelines for Instagram, limiting what teenage users can see to a standard comparable to a PG-13 movie rating. The new policy will hide accounts and posts that feature sexualized content, profanity, or references to drugs and alcohol from teen feeds. This change is a response to long-standing criticism from lawmakers and parents regarding child safety and mental health on the platform. The company stated the goal is to align its policies with a standard that parents can more easily understand and trust.</p>

          <p>As part of a new ceasefire agreement, Hamas has released the final 20 surviving Israeli hostages, while Israel has freed nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The truce brings a pause to a conflict that has left Gaza devastated, though the long-term stability of the peace remains uncertain as key issues like Hamas's disarmament are unresolved. Some of the returning Palestinian detainees showed signs of severe mistreatment and malnutrition, and many are returning to destroyed homes. The deal, brokered with President Trump's involvement, represents the first phase of a broader peace plan.</p>

He pointed to question marks over the Australian team's consistency and the fitness of their captain, Pat Cummins. Broad believes that while Australia remains the favorite at home, the current English squad is the strongest since 2010, setting the stage for a competitive series.</p>

          <p>China has implemented sweeping new restrictions on rare earth exports, specifically targeting materials intended for use by foreign militaries, a move that could severely disrupt the U.S. defense industry.

With China controlling over 90% of global refining, the restrictions provide Beijing with powerful leverage in trade negotiations and could reignite a trade war with Washington.

These findings align with previous studies showing that private equity takeovers in healthcare often lead to worse patient outcomes, including increased infections and post-operative complications, as cost-cutting measures impact the quality of care.</p>

          <p>China's military is training soldiers to become "human abacuses" by using an ancient mental calculation technique to ensure operational capability during electronic failures. State media highlighted a drill where a soldier mentally calculated the trajectories of multiple targets in seconds after a simulated radar failure, enabling a successful counterattack. This emphasis on analog and mental skills is part of a strategy to build resilience and counter potential vulnerabilities in high-tech warfare scenarios. The training showcases a unique blend of ancient methods and modern military preparedness.</p>

          <p>American education has experienced a significant decline over the past decade, with student reading and math scores regressing to levels not seen in 25 years. This trend, which began before the pandemic, is attributed not just to smartphones but also to a systemic lowering of academic expectations and standards in schools. Data shows that while spending per student has increased, grade inflation is rampant and graduation rates have risen despite falling achievement. The article points to the success of states like Mississippi, which have improved literacy by implementing higher standards and evidence-based teaching methods.</p>

          <p>Consumers are facing significantly higher coffee prices, which have risen nearly 40% in the U.S. over the past year due to a combination of factors. New U.S. tariffs on major producers Brazil and Vietnam have destabilized an already volatile market grappling with climate change-related events like droughts and floods. Coffee is a labor-intensive crop that doesn't grow in the continental U.S., making the market entirely dependent on a complex international supply chain. The price hikes highlight the beverage's unique position as a cultural and economic staple that is vulnerable to global pressures.</p>

          <p>A new drug named lenacapavir is being hailed as a potential game-changer for HIV prevention, offering nearly 100% protection through a simple injection administered just twice a year. This breakthrough could overcome major hurdles associated with daily PrEP pills, such as adherence issues and stigma. Clinical trials were so successful that they were ended early to offer the drug to all participants. The Trump administration plans to roll out the drug in several low-income countries, though debates continue over politics, pricing, and ensuring equitable access for all at-risk populations.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the official report on the January Los Angeles wildfires reveals a dangerously broken and outdated public alert system, not just locally but across the nation. The author highlights the primitive communication chain—from field commanders to scribbled notes to manual data entry—that caused life-threatening delays in issuing evacuation orders. The article criticizes the chronic underfunding of emergency management offices and the lack of a unified, technology-based national framework for alerts. It calls for urgent, systemic reform to prevent future tragedies, stating that the current doctrine is inadequate.</p>

Mokyr's work focuses on how the Enlightenment in Britain created a skilled class that translated scientific breakthroughs into practical applications, sparking the Industrial Revolution. Aghion and Howitt developed a mathematical model centered on "creative destruction," the process where new technologies replace outdated ones, which they argue is essential for progress.

          <p>The UK government is facing scrutiny after the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) unexpectedly dropped charges against two men accused of spying for China. The Director of Public Prosecutions stated the case collapsed because the government failed to provide evidence officially labeling China a "national security threat" at the time of the alleged offenses. This has sparked a political dispute, with the current Labour government blaming the previous Conservative administration's stance on China. The Conservatives, in turn, accuse the government of deliberately withholding evidence to improve relations with Beijing.</p>
