          <p>Tennessee Rep. Andy Ogles is requesting a federal investigation into Nashville Mayor Freddie O'Connellâ€™s ICE policies, claiming they amount to "aiding and abetting illegal immigration." Ogles seeks documents related to Oâ€™Connellâ€™s executive order requiring Nashville employees to report communication with federal immigration authorities to the mayor. This announcement follows ICE arrests of nearly 200 illegal immigrants in Nashville, after which O'Connell criticized the federal actions. DHS has responded by posting criminal records of those arrested and accusing O'Connell of prioritizing the safety of dangerous criminals over the safety of the community.</p>

          <p>A Canadian man, Jeffrey Wood, has been sentenced to nearly two years in prison for stealing a famous photograph of Sir Winston Churchill, known as "The Roaring Lion," from Ottawa's ChÃ¢teau Laurier hotel. Wood pleaded guilty to the theft, which occurred between Christmas 2021 and early January 2022, and admitted to forgery. The image, taken by Yousuf Karsh in 1941, is featured on the UK Â£5 note, and Wood claimed he stole the photo to find money for his brother's mental health issues. The judge emphasized the breach of trust in stealing such a culturally significant item.</p>

          <p>China's industrial profits saw a 3% increase in April, marking the second consecutive month of growth despite ongoing tariffs imposed by the United States. This growth reverses a trend of declines observed since the third quarter of the previous year, with cumulative profits for major industrial firms rising 1.4% year-on-year in the first four months of 2025. While exports to the U.S. experienced a sharp decline, overall exports surged due to increased shipments to Southeast Asian nations. The manufacturing activity in China experienced an unexpected contraction in April, Retail sales growth slowed to 5.1% from a year earlier while industrial output expanded 6.1% on year (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A House bill proposes cutting in half a tax write-off for professional sports team owners, potentially affecting the high prices paid for teams in recent years. The legislation would allow owners to deduct only half the value of intangible assets, such as player contracts and media rights, over 15 years. While the provision would only affect future owners, it could cool demand for teams, potentially impacting current owners' investments. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the change would raise $991 million over 10 years, though team owners argue the number is far higher (not investment advice).</p>

Saporito notes that Walmart and Target have warned of potential price increases, while Home Depot's response is viewed as partly political.

          <p>Japan has lost its position as the world's top creditor to Germany for the first time in 34 years, despite its net external assets rising to a record high. Japan's gross external assets increased to 533.05 trillion yen, but Germany's total was higher at 569.65 trillion yen. The yen's depreciation boosted the value of Japan's foreign-currency assets, while Germany benefited from a large current account surplus. The United States, in contrast, had a net external liability, meaning its foreign debts far exceeded its overseas assets (not investment advice).</p>
