        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that leprosy, long believed to have been introduced to the Americas by European colonizers, was already present on the continent for thousands of years. Researchers analyzed over 800 ancient remains from Canada and Argentina, discovering a different species of leprosy-causing bacteria, Mycobacterium lepromatosis, was circulating among indigenous populations. This finding challenges previous assumptions about the origins of leprosy in the Americas and highlights the complex history of pathogens and their interactions with humans. The study also suggests that monitoring disease reservoirs in animals is crucial for preventing future spillovers to humans.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has unveiled a Â£15 billion investment plan targeting transport infrastructure across England, with a focus on mayoral authorities in the Midlands, the North, and the West Country. The funding will support tram, train, and bus projects, including extensions to the Greater Manchester tram network, the West Midlands metro, and the commencement of the West Yorkshire Mass Transit programme. This initiative signals a shift from stringent Treasury rules that have historically favored London and the south-east, aiming to address regional economic disparities. The announcement has been met with mixed reactions, with some welcoming the investment while others caution about ensuring the long-term sustainability of the new transport networks.

          <p>According to a new estimate by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the policy bill proposed by Republicans to advance President Trump's second-term agenda would increase the deficit by $2.4 trillion over the next decade. The CBO also projects that 10.9 million more people would lack health insurance by 2034 due to changes to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act included in the bill. House Republican leadership has dismissed the CBO's findings, asserting that the bill will reduce the deficit by stimulating economic growth. The bill is currently under consideration in the Senate and is expected to undergo revisions.</p>

This trend highlights the growing divide between what men consider admirable on other men and what women find attractive.

          <p>The European Commission has given its approval for Bulgaria to adopt the euro, paving the way for the country to join the eurozone on January 1, 2026. The decision comes after Bulgaria successfully reduced inflation, meeting the necessary economic criteria. While the move is expected to provide economic benefits such as access to the European Central Bank's monetary policy and reduced interest rates, it has also sparked protests and concerns among some Bulgarians who fear it could erode national sovereignty and economic stability. Fellow EU countries and the European Parliament must still approve Bulgaria's accession. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. services sector experienced an unexpected contraction in May, marking the first decline in nearly a year, according to the Institute for Supply Management (ISM). The nonmanufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) fell to 49.9, signaling a contraction in the sector that accounts for over two-thirds of the economy. Simultaneously, businesses reported paying higher prices for inputs, indicating a potential period of slow growth coupled with high inflation. Economists suggest that President Trump's import duties and the resulting uncertainty are contributing to the challenging economic conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A tomato recall affecting Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina has been elevated to a Class I recall by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), representing the most severe warning level. The recall, initiated in May, is due to potential salmonella contamination in tomatoes from Williams Farms Repack, LLC. The FDA is advising consumers to avoid consuming the recalled tomatoes, which are packaged in various sizes, and to either return them for a refund or discard them. Salmonella infections can cause serious and potentially fatal illnesses, particularly in vulnerable populations such as young children, the elderly, and individuals with weakened immune systems.</p>

          <p>According to his biographer, Stephen Witt, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, despite leading a highly successful company valued at nearly $3.4 trillion, is primarily driven by negative emotions, particularly fear of failure, paranoia about competition, and guilt about letting people down. Witt, who interviewed Huang for six hours, noted that this anxiety serves as his primary motivator, pushing him to work relentlessly. This revelation contrasts with the typical upbeat and optimistic persona often associated with successful CEOs. Huang's discomfort when things are going well underscores the extent to which his drive stems from a constant need to prove himself.</p>

          <p>The German Cabinet has approved a series of measures aimed at tightening the country's asylum laws, including a plan to simplify the process of designating "safe countries of origin." This move, led by Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt, seeks to expedite deportations of rejected asylum-seekers. The decision follows a recent court ruling that deemed the government's policy of pushing back asylum-seekers at the border unlawful. The proposed reforms have faced criticism from legal experts and human rights groups, who argue that they could complicate asylum regulations and undermine the rights of vulnerable individuals. The government's efforts are part of a broader strategy to curb irregular migration and reduce support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.</p>
