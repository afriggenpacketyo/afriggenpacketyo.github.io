          <p>The Japanese fruit sandwich, or "furutsu sando," is making its debut on UK supermarket shelves, with Marks & Spencer launching a limited-edition strawberries and cream version. This viral sensation, popular in Japan as a snack or dessert, features fruit and whipped cream between slices of soft, sweet bread. While the combination might seem unusual to some, it follows a tradition of fruit in sandwiches, like the classic banana or jam sandwich. The article explores the cultural context of the fruit sando and discusses other unique sandwich varieties from around the world.</p>

          <p>Following a Supreme Court decision that limited the use of nationwide injunctions, the ACLU has filed a new class-action lawsuit against President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship. The lawsuit argues that the order, which aims to deny citizenship to U.S.-born children of non-citizen parents, violates the 14th Amendment. While the Supreme Court's ruling allows the executive order to take effect in some regions, it did not address the policy's constitutionality. The new legal challenge seeks to protect all children who would be affected by the order across the country.</p>

          <p>Sisters Kat Sadler and Lizzie Davidson, the writer and star of the BAFTA-winning BBC comedy "Such Brave Girls," are preparing for a new series that delves into taboo subjects with dark humor. The show, which follows two sisters and their mother navigating financial and romantic struggles, draws inspiration from their own upbringing in an all-woman household. Sadler says the new season will be even more daring, fueled by observations of the "bleak" modern dating scene and a desire to satirize societal pressures. The series is celebrated for its unflinching take on topics like mental health and family dysfunction.</p>

The goal is to block President Trump's executive order attempting to end birthright citizenship for children of non-citizens. The original legal challenges were successful in obtaining injunctions, but the Supreme Court's decision narrowed their scope, not ruling on the constitutionality of the order itself.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has filed a defamation lawsuit against Fox News, seeking at least $787 million in damages. The suit alleges that the network, particularly anchor Jesse Watters, falsely claimed Newsom lied about a phone call with President Donald Trump. The complaint accuses Fox News of willfully distorting facts to support the president and harboring ill will toward the governor. Newsom's legal team has offered to dismiss the suit if Fox News retracts the claim and issues a formal on-air apology, while the network has called the lawsuit a "frivolous publicity stunt."</p>

          <p>Researchers are reviving a century-old medical concept known as phage therapy as a potential weapon against antibiotic-resistant superbugs. This method uses bacteriophages, which are viruses that specifically target and destroy bacteria, to treat infections. The University of Southampton's Phage Collection Project is actively searching for these beneficial viruses in everyday environments, like toilet water, and has already found phages capable of killing bacteria from persistent patient infections. As the threat of the "silent pandemic" of antimicrobial resistance grows, phage therapy offers a promising alternative to failing antibiotics.</p>

She then gifted the paintings to each student, an act that was met with amazement and some regret from classmates who wished they had reached out to her sooner.

He reports having paid over $162,000 in tariffs, which he could not absorb due to slim profit margins. The closure will result in the liquidation of all inventory and the layoff of his 10 employees.

The proposed changes, which aimed to save Â£5 billion annually by tightening eligibility for Personal Independence Payments (Pip), were criticized as a short-term cost-cutting measure rather than a long-term reform to help people back into work. The reversal raises questions about the government's stability and its ability to manage its fiscal strategy, potentially requiring tax increases or other spending cuts to meet its borrowing rules.

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly criticized Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic candidate for New York City mayor, labeling him a "communist" whose election would be detrimental to the city and the country. Mamdani, a democratic socialist, recently won the first round of the Democratic primary, defeating former Governor Andrew Cuomo. His platform, which includes higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy, has caused concern among some business leaders. Mamdani responded by encouraging the president and all New Yorkers to learn about his actual policies for making the city more affordable.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has made a bullish prediction for the cryptocurrency market, suggesting a massive influx of capital is forthcoming and warning traders to pay attention. His comments align with other optimistic analysts who foresee the total crypto market capitalization potentially reaching $100 trillion within the next decade, a significant increase from its current level of around $3.26 trillion. This growth is anticipated to be driven by widespread adoption from institutions, sovereign entities, and individual investors accumulating assets like Bitcoin. (not investment advice)</p>

The ruling specifically concerned his executive order to end birthright citizenship, which can now proceed in some parts of the country while legal challenges continue. While the court did not rule on the order's constitutionality, Trump framed the decision as a victory against "radical left judges" and a restoration of executive power.

This emerging faction is creating internal conflict, pitting fiscally hardline members against the party leadership and a president who has historically expanded the deficit.
