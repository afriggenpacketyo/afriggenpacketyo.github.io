          <p>Tens of thousands of people marched across the Sydney Harbour Bridge in a pro-Palestinian demonstration, calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. The protest, which included notable figures like Julian Assange, proceeded peacefully despite initial opposition from police and the NSW Premier after being authorized by the Supreme Court. The event caused significant traffic disruptions but highlighted growing public pressure on the Australian government regarding its stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the potential recognition of a Palestinian state.</p>

          <p>Russian authorities have reported a significant fire at an oil depot near the Black Sea resort of Sochi, attributing the blaze to a Ukrainian drone attack. The incident prompted the temporary suspension of flights at the nearby airport as 127 firefighters were dispatched to manage the fire. This attack is part of a broader exchange of strikes, with Russia's defense ministry claiming to have intercepted 93 Ukrainian drones overnight, while Ukraine reported downing 61 of 83 Russian projectiles targeting its territory.</p>

          <p>The UK government is introducing a new offense targeting individuals who advertise illegal Channel crossings on social media, with potential penalties of up to five years in prison. This measure is part of the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill, aimed at disrupting people-smuggling gangs who use online platforms to promote their services. The move comes as the number of migrants arriving via small boats reaches a record high for the year, prompting intense debate over the effectiveness of the government's current immigration policies.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England is widely anticipated to cut interest rates this week, likely reducing the headline rate by 0.25 percentage points to 4%. This move is seen as a measure to counteract rising unemployment and the economic impact of new US import tariffs, as the UK economy has shown recent signs of shrinking. While the reduction in borrowing costs would be welcomed by homeowners and businesses, it highlights concerns about potential stagflation, with economic growth slowing while inflation remains above the 2% target.

          <p>A couple in Guernsey discovered a World War II German bunker hidden beneath their driveway after receiving a tip from a former resident of the house. The structure, believed to have been sealed in the 1960s, contains two main rooms with original features like German writing on the walls. The homeowners plan to convert the space into a games room and gym while preserving its historical elements, reflecting on the island's history under Nazi occupation from 1940 to 1945.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new climate study suggests that significant reductions in air pollution in East Asia over the past decade may have inadvertently accelerated global warming. The successful cleanup efforts, particularly in China, greatly reduced aerosols that reflect sunlight, which previously had a cooling effect that may have masked the full impact of greenhouse gases. Researchers estimate that the removal of pollutants like sulphur dioxide could have contributed up to 0.05 degrees Celsius to the global surface warming observed since 2010.</p>

The piece suggests the strikes have undermined international law, deepened geopolitical divisions, and paradoxically increased the likelihood of Iran pursuing a nuclear bomb for self-defense.</p>
