          <p>British Labour MP Diane Abbott stated in a BBC interview that she stands by her 2023 comments suggesting that Jewish people, Irish people, and Travellers experience a different form of racism than Black people. Her original remarks, published in a letter to the Observer, led to a year-long suspension from the party. Despite apologizing at the time, Abbott now says she does not regret the incident, arguing that racism based on skin color is inherently different because it is immediately visible. She maintains she has a long history of fighting all forms of racism, including antisemitism, and felt the Labour leadership was trying to force her out of her position before she was ultimately reinstated.</p>

          <p>The Indiana Fever suffered a significant 98-77 loss to the New York Liberty after star player Caitlin Clark was sidelined with a groin injury just before the game. This marks Clark's third absence this season due to injury, raising concerns about her availability for the upcoming WNBA All-Star weekend, where she is a team captain. Coach Stephanie White expressed frustration with the team's lack of consistency and resilience in the face of adversity. Without Clark, the Fever's record has fallen to 4-6, highlighting her critical role on the team as they head into the mid-season break.</p>

          <p>Israel has conducted a series of airstrikes against Syrian government targets in Damascus, including the defense ministry, amid escalating sectarian violence in the southern Suweida province. The conflict, primarily between Druze militias and government-backed Bedouin tribes, has reportedly resulted in over 350 deaths. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated the strikes were intended to protect the Druze minority, while Syria's interim government accused Israel of a major escalation. Following the attacks, the United States announced that it had agreed upon 'specific steps' with relevant parties to end the violence, and the Syrian military reportedly began withdrawing from the embattled province.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced his intention to sell more technologically advanced chips to China, going beyond the recently reinstated H20 AI processor. Speaking in Beijing, Huang argued that as technology evolves, the products available to the Chinese market should also improve, despite ongoing U.S. export controls. The company has been navigating geopolitical tensions, developing compliant chips like the H20 to maintain access to China's significant AI market, which Huang estimates could be worth $50 billion. The comments come as U.S. officials suggest a strategy of allowing sales to ensure Chinese firms remain dependent on American technology. (not investment advice)</p>

They fear the uncertainty could lead to layoffs and program shutdowns, as they cannot operate on verbal commitments alone. While the administration insists the program is not threatened, critics point to a loss of trust after previous funding clawbacks and a lack of clarity on the new payment timeline.</p>

However, the farm's owners have launched a legal battle, arguing the birds should be studied for potential antibodies and treatments. Kennedy, in a letter to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, supported this view, stating that significant scientific knowledge could be gained by observing the ostriches in a controlled environment rather than eradicating them.</p>

Despite recent congressional funding for technological upgrades, many controllers feel their core concerns about stagnating pay and mandatory six-day workweeks are being ignored. The national shortage of controllers, currently over 3,000 below the FAA's target, forces many to work under fatiguing conditions, which they argue poses a risk to air travel safety. They contend that without addressing these fundamental quality-of-life and staffing problems, simply upgrading technology will not fix the strained air traffic system.</p>

          <p>Police in Arcadia, California, have taken 21 children into custody from a couple amid an investigation into a potential surrogacy scam and child abuse. The children, aged two months to 13 years, are all believed to be the legal children of Silvia Zhang and Guojun Xuan. The investigation began after their infant was hospitalized with a traumatic head injury, allegedly inflicted by a nanny. Subsequent review of home surveillance footage revealed emotional and physical abuse of the children by multiple nannies. Authorities are now working with the FBI to determine if the couple misled surrogate mothers across the United States as part of a scheme.</p>

          <p>A tsunami advisory for Alaska's southern peninsula has been canceled following a powerful 7.3 magnitude earthquake that struck off the coast. The quake, which occurred about 50 miles south of Sand Point, initially triggered a more severe tsunami warning, prompting some coastal communities to evacuate to higher ground. However, officials later downgraded the alert to an advisory, as the shallow depth of the earthquake meant that large, widespread waves were not expected. The U.S. Coast Guard stood down its evacuation response after the threat passed, and no major damage or injuries have been reported from the seismic event.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Army veteran is calling for a full investigation after he was detained for three days by federal agents during a large-scale immigration raid in Ventura County, California. George Retes, a 25-year-old security guard, said he was driving to work when he was caught in the melee, had his car window smashed, and was arrested at gunpoint despite identifying himself as a U.S. citizen. He was held at a federal detention center without access to a lawyer and was even placed on suicide watch due to distress. Retes, who has since been released without charges, alleges a violation of his civil rights and plans to file a lawsuit.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially canceled $4 billion in federal funding for California's high-speed rail project, a move state leaders have denounced as illegal. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) pulled the funding, citing mismanagement, budget overruns, and a lack of a viable path forward for the beleaguered project. Governor Gavin Newsom vowed to fight the decision, stating that California is putting all options on the table. The project, intended to connect Los Angeles and San Francisco, is decades behind schedule and its cost has ballooned from an initial $33 billion to over $128 billion, making it a frequent target of criticism from the president.</p>

A new study has identified five specific volatile components in the plant's pollen that trigger allergies, which have worsened for many residents since 2018.

          <p>A coalition of immigrant advocacy groups has filed a class-action lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that federal agencies have colluded to unlawfully arrest and deport immigrants attending their own court hearings. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of twelve plaintiffs, claims that the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice have weaponized immigration courts, turning them into traps. This practice, they argue, violates due process rights and a longstanding policy of limiting courthouse arrests. The plaintiffs, many of whom were seeking asylum from persecution, assert this coordinated effort is designed to instill fear and deter people from seeking legal protection.</p>

In Nevada, AI cloud platform Crusoe is powering two data centers using solar panels paired with used EV batteries supplied by Redwood Materials. This approach provides a reliable, renewable power source that can be deployed quickly, offering an alternative to building new gas-fired plants. As millions of EVs reach the end of their road life, their batteries, which still retain significant capacity, can be repurposed for this kind of large-scale energy storage, creating a scalable and more sustainable way to fuel AI's growth.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has sharply criticized President Trump's immigration policies, labeling them a "rule of cruelty" designed to terrorize families rather than target violent criminals. His comments followed the Pentagon's decision to withdraw half of the National Guard troops deployed in Los Angeles, a deployment Newsom called a waste of hundreds of millions of dollars. The governor argued the crackdown harms communities and businesses by creating fear. Separately, Newsom repeated his threat to pursue a Democratic-favoring redistricting effort in California if Republicans proceed with similar plans in states like Texas, citing the need to counter what he called existential threats.</p>

          <p>Recent federal immigration raids on businesses have exposed significant flaws in the E-Verify system, which is intended to confirm employment eligibility. The system vets documents, not people, making it easy to fool with stolen identities and leaving compliant employers vulnerable. An investigation into a raid at a Nebraska meat processing facility revealed it was a criminal probe into identity theft, with the business owner considered a victim. Experts argue that E-Verify is a broken, "wink-and-nod" system that allows politicians to appear tough on illegal immigration without imposing major economic costs, while increasing the risk of identity theft for citizens.</p>

The new law will establish a program allowing veterans to move their delinquent payments to the end of their loan term, making their mortgages current.
