          <p>The New York Times examines how Dartmouth College has avoided the scrutiny and funding threats faced by other Ivy League institutions under the Trump administration. The article suggests that Dartmouth's president, Sian Beilock, a moderate Democrat, has adopted a strategy of engaging with conservatives and emphasizing free expression, which has helped to keep the college off the administration's radar. However, this approach has drawn criticism from some students and faculty who view it as an attempt to appease conservatives and compromise the college's values.</p>
