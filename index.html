          <h2>UK Government to Publicize Nationalities of Foreign Criminals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 00:29:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to release data on the nationalities of foreign criminals, a move Conservatives claim is a result of their pressure on Labour. Official data indicates an increase in foreign offenders awaiting deportation, rising from almost 18,000 to over 19,000 since the Conservatives left office. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has instructed officials to compile and publish the data, including nationalities and crimes, by year-end. Government sources state that the change is due to ministers addressing an issue previously ignored by their Conservative predecessors, aiming to better inform the public about foreign criminals awaiting deportation.  Welcoming the news, shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick said: "We will finally see the hard reality that mass migration is fuelling crime across our country. Frankly, the public deserved to know this long ago."</p>

          <p>Approximately 70 Japanese lawmakers from various parties visited the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo for its spring festival, a site viewed by neighboring Asian countries as a symbol of Japan's past militarism. Ichiro Aisawa, a member of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, emphasized the importance of remembering the history of fallen heroes who contributed to Japan's peaceful and prosperous postwar era. The shrine has been a source of diplomatic tension with China and South Korea because it honors wartime leaders convicted as war criminals, along with millions of war dead. The visit occurred after Prime Minister Ishigeru Ishiba sent a ritual offering to the shrine, though he is not expected to visit in person.</p>

          <p>The declining value of the U.S. dollar is creating both opportunities and challenges for central banks worldwide. While a weaker dollar can ease the debt burden for emerging markets and potentially lower inflation, it also complicates export competitiveness and could lead to capital flight. Central banks are treading carefully to avoid currency wars and maintain economic stability, considering factors like foreign exchange reserves and exposure to foreign debt. Some central banks, like the European Central Bank, have used the opportunity to cut rates, while others are hesitant due to inflation and debt concerns.</p>

The request was denied by ICE, prompting Dr. Abdalla to release a statement criticizing the agency for stealing precious moments from their family and attempting to silence Khalil's support for Palestinian freedom.

          <p>Over 100 U.S. university presidents have jointly denounced the Trump administration's "unprecedented government overreach and political interference" in higher education. This unified front follows mounting pressure from the administration, including funding cuts and demands for institutional autonomy, particularly in response to pro-Palestinian protests. Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the government, challenging the freeze of federal funds and defending academic freedom. The university presidents emphasize their commitment to open inquiry and the exchange of ideas without fear of retribution, censorship, or deportation, signaling a strong resistance to government intrusion.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge in Georgia has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate the legal statuses of 133 international students, granting a temporary restraining order in response to claims that their student statuses were unlawfully revoked. The lawsuit, filed by the ACLU and other groups, alleges that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) terminated records on the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), effectively ending students' statuses and making them deportable. The judge also prohibited the government from using the plaintiffs' identities outside of the lawsuit. Some students faced minor charges which were dropped, and some had no criminal record.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods, now cumulatively at 145%, are severely impacting dropshipping businesses that rely on trade between China and the U.S. The elimination of the de minimis exemption, which previously allowed duty-free entry for shipments valued at $800 or less, further exacerbates the challenges. Many dropshippers are experiencing revenue declines and increased border inspections, leading them to shift focus to European markets. Industry insiders emphasize the importance of diversifying markets to mitigate the effects of the trade environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. stocks and the dollar experienced a sharp decline after President Donald Trump intensified his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, labeling him a "major loser" for not lowering interest rates. Trump's attacks on Powell, whom he appointed, exacerbated market turmoil already fueled by concerns over tariffs and economic recession. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq all fell significantly, while the dollar index reached its lowest level since 2022. Gold prices hit a new record high as investors sought safe-haven assets.</p>

          <p>China's private sector shows resilience with nearly 2 million new private firms registered in the first quarter, a 7.1% increase year-on-year, despite the US-China trade war. The growth reflects the strong resilience of China's private economy, according to the State Administration for Market Regulation. Private businesses are expected to be heavily impacted by U.S. tariffs, contributing to over half of China's exports. Despite the challenges, these firms reported an increase in export and import value and accounted for a larger share of the total trade value.</p>

The map details connections between nerve cells in the macaque claustrum and the rest of the brain, potentially aiding understanding of cognitive functions like memory integration and abstract thinking. The team also found differences in the structure and cell types of macaque and rodent claustrums, offering clues to the evolutionary mechanisms behind consciousness. This research contributes to the ongoing scientific effort to understand how consciousness is generated and why human awareness differs from other animals.</p>
