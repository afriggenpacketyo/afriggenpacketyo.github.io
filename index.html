            <p>Trump administration border czar Tom Homan defended the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, alleged to be an MS-13 gang member, despite concerns raised about due process. Homan argued the administration acted lawfully under the Alien Enemies Act, which he claims limits due process rights. Senator Chris Van Hollen criticized the deportation, asserting it violates Abrego Garcia's constitutional rights and sets a dangerous precedent. The Supreme Court has temporarily halted deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, adding to the legal complexities of the case.</p>

            <p>The CEO of Back Market reports a threefold increase in sales following President Trump's tariff announcements, suggesting consumers are anticipating price increases on new electronics. The tariffs, which primarily affect goods manufactured in China, have prompted "panic-buying" and a potential shift towards used or refurbished devices. Analysts predict a significant increase in short-term sales of used tech, especially smartphones, as consumers seek to avoid higher prices. However, the long-term impact remains uncertain, as consumer preferences may revert to new devices once prices stabilize. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the deportation of Venezuelans held in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act, responding to an emergency appeal from the ACLU. The court's order prevents removals until further notice, ensuring detainees have the opportunity to argue their case in court. Justices Thomas and Alito dissented, arguing the court's intervention was premature. The Trump administration maintains the detainees are "foreign terrorists," while the ACLU argues for their due process rights.</p>

            <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s statements about autism, which include claims that it is an "epidemic" and a "preventable disease" caused by "environmental toxins", are raising concerns for the autistic community. His views, combined with Trump's policies, are seen as a war on science and knowledge, potentially impacting funding for research and support services. Kennedy's past comments about autistic people, describing them as unable to contribute to society, have drawn criticism for perpetuating harmful stereotypes. This article emphasizes the need to combat these misconceptions and advocate for better understanding and support for autistic individuals.</p>

            <p>The article questions the reliability of common recession indicators, such as spending on haircuts or men's underwear sales, and argues that even traditional metrics like consumer sentiment can be misleading. It suggests focusing on data from companies driving the economy's three key components: consumers, capital, and labor. Recent reports from retailers like Walmart and Amazon, banks like Citibank and JPMorgan, and payroll companies like Paychex indicate a fundamentally healthy economy with no current signs of a recession. Relying on these sources offers a more accurate assessment than manufactured panic or government surveys.</p>
