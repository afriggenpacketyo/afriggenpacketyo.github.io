          <p>Following a deadly terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that killed 26 people, India launched strikes on what it claimed were terrorist infrastructure sites within Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. The Indian government asserted that the strikes were focused and non-escalatory, targeting nine sites allegedly used for planning attacks against India. Pakistan condemned the strikes as an unprovoked act of aggression, reporting civilian casualties and promising a response. The strikes have heightened tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbors, with global leaders urging restraint and de-escalation. The conflict stems from long-standing disputes over the Kashmir region, claimed by both countries. Optimism Score: 30</p>
