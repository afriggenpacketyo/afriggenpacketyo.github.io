          <p>Reports indicate that Attorney General Pam Bondi has terminated more than 20 prosecutors and support staff who were involved in the Jack Smith investigations concerning former President Donald Trump. Sources suggest these firings, which include support personnel and U.S. marshals identified by a 'weaponization working group,' have created a tense atmosphere within the Justice Department. The move follows earlier removals of most senior prosecutors associated with the probes, raising concerns among the department's career employees about potential purges similar to those in Trump's first term.</p>

          <p>Center Myles Turner has finalized a four-year, $107 million deal with the Milwaukee Bucks, leaving the Indiana Pacers after a decade.

While acknowledging the difficulty of leaving the team that drafted him, Turner expressed excitement about the opportunity with the Bucks, stating it was the best fit for his career and personal goals moving forward.</p>

          <p>The UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting is scheduled to meet with the British Medical Association (BMA) next week to negotiate and potentially prevent a planned five-day strike by resident doctors in England. The dispute centers on pay, with the BMA arguing that the government's 5.4% pay rise offer is insufficient to restore real-term wages to 2008 levels. While the government states it cannot improve the offer, it is reportedly open to discussing better working conditions, but the BMA insists the strike will proceed without a credible pay proposal.</p>

          <p>A major excavation is set to begin in Tuam, Ireland, at the site of the former St Mary's mother-and-baby home, where a mass grave is believed to contain the remains of nearly 800 children. The investigation, spurred by the work of amateur historian Catherine Corliss, follows a 2017 government inquiry that found 'significant quantities of human remains' from infants and toddlers. The home, run by the Bon Secours Sisters from 1925 to 1961, housed unmarried mothers and their children, and the excavation aims to identify the remains and bring closure to a dark chapter in Irish history.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, prohibiting immigration officials from making 'indiscriminate' arrests and denying individuals access to legal counsel. The ruling came in a lawsuit filed after several individuals, including U.S. citizens, were arrested at a Pasadena bus stop. Judge Maame Frimpong stated there was a 'mountain of evidence' of unconstitutional 'roving patrols' and barred arrests based solely on factors like race, language, or location, a move the Department of Homeland Security criticized as undermining the public's will.</p>
