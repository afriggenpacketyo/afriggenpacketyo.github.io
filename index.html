          <h2>Judge Blocks Trump Administration from Detaining Palestinian Activist</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New Jersey federal judge issued a preliminary injunction preventing the Trump administration from deporting Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University pro-Palestinian activist. Judge Michael Farbiarz barred the administration from removing Khalil based on Secretary of State Marco Rubio's determination that his presence poses a risk to foreign policy. The judge is temporarily staying the injunction to allow the Department of Homeland Security time to appeal the decision. Khalil, a green card holder married to an American citizen, has been detained in Louisiana since March, with officials claiming he supports Hamas, an allegation his legal team denies. The administration's accusations have made Khalil a target, and he fears torture and death if deported. The judge's ruling stated that lawful permanent residents accused of misrepresentations are virtually never detained pending removal.

          <p>Oil prices experienced a significant surge, rising more than 4% due to escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran. President Trump expressed diminished confidence in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran, contributing to market uncertainty.

Meanwhile, the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations warned of increased regional tensions that could lead to military escalation.

          <p>The White House maintains that its actions in Los Angeles align with President Trump's campaign promises on immigration. Recent polls indicate that a majority of Americans trust the Republican Party more to handle immigration issues. However, California Governor Gavin Newsom highlighted instances where U.S. citizens and young children were affected by workplace raids. The Trump administration insists its immigration efforts target criminals, but critics argue that the policy is overly broad and inhumane. Trump is betting heavily that Americans support his aggressive approach to immigration enforcement. The optimism score is not directly reflected in the summary of this article.</p>

          <p>During a raid at a meat-producing plant in Omaha, Nebraska, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers and federal partners were allegedly assaulted by an illegal immigrant. ICE detained over 70 illegal immigrants, some with local warrants or prior deportations. ICE's acting Director condemned the incident, emphasizing the threat posed by those who break the law by entering the country illegally and then assault federal officers. The operation involved multiple agencies, and many of those detained may face additional federal charges. The plant's president expressed surprise, stating that the company uses E-Verify to confirm workers' immigration status, but ICE apparently told him the E-Verify system is broken.

          <p>Los Angeles District Attorney Nathan Hochman announced criminal charges against several individuals involved in ongoing immigration protests. The charges include assault on a peace officer, resisting arrest, burglary, grand theft, and vandalism. One individual faces up to 25 years to life due to the three-strike rule, related to reckless driving and firearm possession. The District Attorney's office emphasized that violence will not be tolerated and that peaceful protests have largely outweighed instances of violence. The charges stem from incidents including throwing fireworks at police officers, driving motorcycles into officers, robbing a Nike store, and vandalizing property.

The LAPD and L.A. County Sheriff's Department are facing criticism and lawsuits over their treatment of the media.

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has ruled that social media companies can be held accountable for certain types of content posted by users on their platforms. The decision may lead to potential fines for companies that fail to remove illegal content.

Current law only holds social media companies responsible for third-party content if they fail to remove it after a court order.

          <p>The Trump administration is moving to repeal a pair of environmental regulations concerning coal and natural gas power plants. The EPA head stated that the agency would begin the process of repealing climate regulations on power plants' carbon emissions, effectively leaving them unregulated. The second rule tightened regulations on mercury and other toxins hazardous to human health. Environmental groups are expected to sue to block the rule changes, arguing they violate environmental laws and disregard scientific evidence. The administration's actions are seen as a move to stimulate the fossil fuel industry at the expense of the environment.

          <p>Federal immigration agents have targeted car washes in Los Angeles and Orange counties, detaining workers and causing disruption. At least five car washes have been raided, with at least 26 people taken into custody.

One business was forced to close after being raided twice in two days, losing a significant portion of its workforce.
