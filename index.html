          <p>NYC Mayor Eric Adams announced he will run for reelection as an independent, bypassing the Democratic primary. This decision follows the dismissal of his federal corruption case.  His rationale centers on a belief that New York City's problems transcend partisan politics, and that his experience as mayor provides the best path forward.  Critics argue this move is a strategic maneuver to avoid scrutiny within the Democratic party.</p>
