          <p>The FBI is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to the identification and arrest of the gunman who fatally shot conservative influencer Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. Investigators have released security camera images of a "person of interest," described as a slim, young man appearing to be of "college age." The suspected weapon, a high-powered rifle, was recovered in a wooded area near the scene, along with a palm print and a footwear impression. Authorities believe the gunman acted alone, and the motive for the shooting is still unknown, though Utah's governor called it a "political assassination." The investigation is ongoing as officials track the suspect's movements on campus before and after the shooting. This article details the ongoing search for the suspect and the evidence collected thus far. </p>

          <p>Bridget Phillipson and Lucy Powell are set to compete for Labour's deputy leadership after Bell Riberio-Addy failed to secure enough MP nominations. Phillipson, the Education Secretary, is considered an early frontrunner, while Powell, recently sacked from her cabinet role, may appeal to MPs dissatisfied with the current leadership. The winner will serve as a link between the Labour membership and the party leadership, playing a key role in election campaigns. This contest offers an opportunity for MPs and party members to express discontent with the leadership, potentially overshadowing ministerial speeches. </p>

          <p>Nadine Menendez, the wife of former New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez, has been sentenced to 54 months in prison for her role in a federal bribery case. She was convicted of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and gold bars in exchange for political favors. Prosecutors sought a longer sentence, but the defense cited her ongoing breast cancer treatments. Nadine Menendez tearfully addressed the court, blaming her husband and claiming she was manipulated into illegal activities. The judge considered factors including her childhood trauma and charitable work when determining the sentence. </p>

          <p>Mortgage rates are experiencing their largest weekly drop in a year, with the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage falling to 6.35%. This decrease has led to a surge in borrower demand, with both purchase and refinance applications increasing. Refinances account for nearly half of the applications, as homeowners seek to lower their monthly payments. The drop in rates is attributed to weakening labor market data and lower Treasury yields. This article explores the impact of falling mortgage rates on the housing market. </p>

          <p>A judge has declined to block the Trump administration from cutting over $1 billion in National Science Foundation (NSF) grants. The ruling allows the administration to proceed with terminating more than 1,600 research grants. A coalition of organizations representing scientists filed a legal challenge, arguing that the cuts were arbitrary and violated the Administrative Procedure Act. The NSF has contributed to major breakthroughs in various fields. The groups are disappointed in the court's decision but remain committed to winning the case. </p>

          <p>Kim Dotcom has lost his latest bid to avoid extradition to the U.S. on Megaupload charges. A New Zealand court rejected his appeal, paving the way for his deportation to face trial on copyright infringement, money laundering, and racketeering charges. The saga stretches back to 2012 when Dotcom was arrested in New Zealand at the request of the FBI. He maintains that users of the site, not its founders, were responsible for pirating material. </p>
