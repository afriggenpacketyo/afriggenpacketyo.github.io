          <p>The U.S. Department of Education had planned to involve the Treasury Department in managing the $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio, according to recent court documents. The agreement would have moved nine Education Department employees to Treasury to handle collections activities. However, these plans are now on hold after a U.S. District Judge blocked the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle the Education Department. Experts suggest this move indicates the administration's desire to reduce the department's role in managing student debt.</p>

          <p>Kilauea volcano on Hawaii's Big Island has erupted for the 25th time since December, sending lava fountains over 330 feet into the air. The eruption began from the north vent and has been characterized by gas-pistoning, a process where gas accumulates at the top of a lava column before erupting. The U.S. Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory is monitoring the activity and has warned of potential hazards, including high levels of volcanic gas and falling volcanic fragments. This latest event continues the cycle of eruptive episodes and pauses that have marked Kilauea's activity in recent months.</p>

          <p>Certificates of deposit (CDs) offer an opportunity to earn higher returns than traditional savings accounts, providing a way to combat inflation. Current national average CD yields vary by term, with one-year CDs at 2.00% APY and five-year CDs at 1.71% APY, though top CDs offer significantly higher rates. Online banks often provide the most competitive rates due to lower overhead costs. Strategies for securing good CD rates include considering short-term CDs and laddering CDs to take advantage of the inverted yield curve, ensuring savings keep pace with economic changes.

          <p>The unrest in Los Angeles, sparked by citywide ICE raids, has prompted Chinese analysts to suggest Beijing may need to recalibrate its approach to U.S. ties. The domestic turmoil in the U.S. could divert the White House's attention from its China policies, potentially creating an opportunity for eased tensions. One expert urged Beijing to adopt a more pragmatic approach and adapt to the conservative turn in American politics. The protests, which have spread across the U.S., have highlighted domestic tensions that could momentarily shift President Trump's focus.</p>

          <p>Controversial changes to the statutes of Formula 1's governing body, the FIA, have been approved despite warnings about democratic backsliding. The OAMTC, Austria's national motoring club, criticized FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem's leadership and the proposed changes. The concerns included potential erosion of the FIA's reputation for competent governance and weakening of oversight bodies. Despite some opposition, the amendments were passed with a significant majority, leading to potential legal challenges and ongoing governance debates within the FIA.</p>

Opening a high-yield savings account with an online bank can maximize savings potential and provide a financial safety net for unexpected expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

Currency movements, market sentiment, and central bank policies also play a significant role in determining gold prices.

Critics argue the amendment would stifle the AI industry, while supporters believe it would protect artists' rights and prevent theft.
