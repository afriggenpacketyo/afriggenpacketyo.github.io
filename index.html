          <p>Former Emperor Akihito of Japan, aged 91, was discharged from a Tokyo hospital after undergoing medical tests for myocardial ischemia, a condition involving reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. While he exhibited no symptoms, the Imperial Household Agency indicated that careful follow-up care will be necessary. Akihito was admitted to the hospital after an earlier checkup revealed signs of the heart condition, and he had previously received treatment for heart failure in 2022. Akihito abdicated the Chrysanthemum Throne in April 2019, marking the first abdication by a Japanese monarch in approximately two centuries.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft launched towards Venus in March 1972, is expected to re-enter Earthâ€™s atmosphere after a rocket malfunction left it stranded in orbit. Experts predict the re-entry will occur soon, but the exact location remains unknown. The spacecraft, designed with a heat shield to withstand Venus' atmosphere, has a chance of surviving its descent through Earth's atmosphere, with potential debris reaching the surface. While the risk of injuries on the ground is considered low, the event is drawing attention as a forgotten piece of space history makes its return.</p>

          <p>Tensions between India and Pakistan have sharply escalated, with both sides exchanging missile strikes targeting air bases and military installations, each blaming the other for initiating the attacks. Pakistan reported that India targeted three of its air bases, including Nur Khan near Islamabad, prompting a retaliatory missile strike on Indian air bases and a missile storage facility. India claimed it targeted Pakistani military sites in response to drone attacks and other strikes. The intensified fighting has raised international alarm, with diplomatic efforts underway to de-escalate the conflict. Both countries maintain that their actions are proportionate and aimed at de-escalation, but the situation remains highly volatile.</p>

          <p>Cerys Vaughan, an 18-year-old amateur footballer, is seeking an apology from the Football Association (FA) after a case against her was dropped.

An FA appeal board later found that Vaughan had received an "unfair" hearing and quashed the original ruling, but the case was ultimately dropped after the complainant withdrew. Vaughan says the experience was stressful and impacted her life, and believes the FA should not have pursued the matter.</p>

Additionally, migrants already in the UK may face a longer wait before they can apply for permanent residency.

          <p>Families of Israeli hostages held by Hamas are voicing increasing anxiety over their loved ones' well-being, as uncertainty grows regarding the number still alive. Prime Minister Netanyahu acknowledged "uncertainty" about the condition of some hostages, and the approval of an expanded offensive in Gaza has heightened fears. Some families hope the troops will be used to pressure Hamas to negotiate rather than for revenge. The families emphasize the need for increased pressure on Hamas to secure the hostages' release, citing concerns about their physical and mental health after prolonged captivity.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed the Department of Homeland Security to increase the deportation force by 20,000 officers, potentially leading to a significant expansion of immigration enforcement. The plan involves deputizing state and local law enforcement officers, former federal officers, and other individuals. Funding for this expansion remains unclear, and logistical hurdles persist. The administration also aims to encourage migrants to self-deport through "Project Homecoming," offering financial assistance for voluntary departure while warning of potential fines, wage garnishment, and property confiscation for those who remain.</p>
