          <p>Reports indicate that Ukraine and Russia are in talks for a significant prisoner swap, potentially the largest since the 2022 invasion. While details remain scarce and unconfirmed by either side, sources suggest an exchange of 1,000 prisoners of war each. U.S. President Donald Trump has claimed the swap is complete and could lead to broader de-escalation, but Ukrainian officials state the process is ongoing. This development occurs amidst otherwise stalled peace negotiations and accusations from Ukraine that Russia is stalling for time. Relevant context: The swap was reportedly agreed upon during recent talks in Turkey, marking a rare face-to-face meeting between delegations since March 2022.</p>

          <p>Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) can be a useful tool this summer, but only with careful consideration. Experts recommend using HELOCs to take advantage of potentially falling interest rates, consolidate credit card debt, or fund home improvements. Conversely, they advise against using them for non-essential expenses like vacations or building a pool, as these uses carry significant financial risk. HELOCs use your home as collateral, so it's crucial to have a solid repayment plan and understand the potential consequences of default. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite comparisons to right-wing populist leaders globally, President Trump's foreign policy decisions suggest a focus on transactional deals rather than ideological alignment. Examples include direct negotiations with entities like Hamas, the Houthis, and Iran, and criticism of Apple's move to India despite it aligning with "friendshoring" principles. Even leaders like Hungary's Viktor OrbÃ¡n, a Trump ally, have diverged by maintaining close economic ties with China. These actions indicate that Trump's approach is driven more by securing quick wins and financial benefits than by supporting politicians who share his views on issues like migration and wokeness.</p>

          <p>A recent study has found that clownfish shrank during a severe ocean heat wave in Papua New Guinea in 2023. Scientists measured the length of 134 clownfish monthly and observed that most of them got shorter, potentially as an adaptation to survive hotter ocean temperatures. The fish that shrank had a higher chance of survival, suggesting that being small can be advantageous in a hot climate. This discovery adds complexity to understanding how marine life adapts to climate change.</p>

This self-reflexiveness, however, encumbers the film, leaving less time for the balletic set pieces that propelled the franchise to its peaks.

          <p>Democrats are criticizing the Republican-backed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which passed the House, for allegedly benefiting the wealthy while harming low-income individuals. The bill extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts, increases military and border security spending, and cuts Medicaid and SNAP. The CBO estimates that the bill will add trillions to the national debt and negatively impact lower-income Americans. Democrats argue that the bill strips away healthcare and food assistance, while Republicans defend it as eliminating waste and fraud.</p>
