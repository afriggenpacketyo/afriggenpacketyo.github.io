        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Labour government plans to scrap 201 National Health Service oversight bodies, including patient advocate Healthwatch England and the office supporting whistleblowers. Health Secretary Wes Streeting argued the current system is overly complex and requires "more doers and fewer checkers" to improve efficiency. This move aims to streamline the NHS and bring it under closer government control, though some critics worry about losing vital functions like patient feedback and staff protection. A new trial will also link hospital funding directly to patient satisfaction ratings.</p>

According to the analysis, this platform-based digital money is an extension of legal tender with strong safeguards, giving China a head start. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The entire village of Littlebredy in Dorset, England, is facing eviction after the 800-hectare Bridehead Estate was sold to an anonymous buyer for approximately Â£30 million. Residents of the 32 homes, all owned by the estate, have reportedly been ordered to leave, and public access to the grounds has been terminated. The situation highlights the immense power of concentrated private land ownership in rural England and has sparked a planned protest to draw attention to the community's powerlessness.</p>
