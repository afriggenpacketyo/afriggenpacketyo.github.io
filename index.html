          <h2>Denmark Lowers 2025 Economic Growth Outlook Due to Pharmaceutical Sector Slowdown</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denmark has substantially lowered its 2025 economic growth forecast to 1.4% from an earlier 3%, largely due to a slowdown in the pharmaceutical sector, particularly concerning Novo Nordisk. The economy ministry highlighted increased competition in the weight loss drug market, a significant drop in U.S. exports after a late 2024 surge, and the lingering uncertainty from U.S. tariffs as primary contributors to this revised outlook. Despite the downward adjustment, the ministry maintains that Denmark's economy remains robust, characterized by high employment rates and an inflation forecast below 2%. This re-evaluation underscores the profound impact of global market dynamics and trade policies on national economic projections, especially for export-dependent sectors like pharmaceuticals.

          <p>The UK Home Office has ordered its contractor, Mitie, to remove job advertisements for craft tutors, including balloon-craft and cake decorating, at a Heathrow immigration removal center. This directive came after significant public and political backlash, with Conservative figures criticizing these roles as unnecessary "perks" that misallocate taxpayer funds away from deportation priorities. While a health minister suggested an "excessive interpretation" of existing contractual obligations to support detainee well-being, an asylum seekers' rights charity emphasized the government's duty to provide activities that foster mental health for individuals held in detention. The incident underscores the contentious nature of asylum policies and the public's scrutiny over spending in immigration facilities.</p>

          <p>Mass protests across Indonesia have intensified following the death of Affan Kurniawan, a 21-year-old motorcycle taxi driver, who was fatally struck by an armored police vehicle during clashes near the Jakarta parliament. The incident occurred amidst ongoing demonstrations protesting lawmakers' substantial new housing allowances and inadequate education funding, sparking widespread national outrage. Both President Prabowo Subianto and National Police Chief Listyo Sigit Prabowo have publicly apologized, promising a thorough and transparent investigation into the "excessive actions" of the officers involved, with a commitment to holding them accountable. This tragic event underscores the escalating public discontent over economic disparities and perceived government extravagance in a nation grappling with rising living costs and significant layoffs.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur is reportedly close to securing a 60 million euro (£51.8 million) deal for RB Leipzig attacker Xavi Simons, with the Netherlands international having already completed his medical in England. The 22-year-old, a product of Barcelona's La Masia academy, is expected to finalize the transfer within 24 hours, adding to Spurs' summer acquisitions. Simons previously impressed during loan spells at PSV and Leipzig, where he scored 22 goals and provided 24 assists in 78 games. This move highlights the continued high demand for young talent in European football, with Spurs aiming to bolster their attacking options.</p>

While the UK has lagged behind other countries in offering this jab, experts now dismiss previous concerns about increased shingles cases.

          <p>Cambricon, often dubbed China's "little Nvidia," has issued a warning to investors about potential risks, despite its Shanghai-listed stock surging 533% in the past year. The company cautioned that its stock price might be deviating from current fundamentals, urging investors to be aware of substantial risks. This surge is fueled by China's supportive policies for local artificial intelligence chips and new AI models tailored for domestic hardware. Cambricon also highlighted its vulnerability to supply chain risks due to ongoing U.S. export restrictions, as it and some subsidiaries are on the U.S. Commerce Department's Entity List.

          <p>Former world number one Naomi Osaka has strongly condemned Jelena Ostapenko's comments to Taylor Townsend, calling them "one of the worst things you could say to a black tennis player." Ostapenko reportedly told Townsend she had "no class" and "no education" after their US Open match. While Townsend stated she didn't perceive a racial undertone, she acknowledged the historical stigma against the Black community regarding education. Osaka emphasized the "ill timing" and "terrible" nature of the remarks within a predominantly white sport, asserting that Ostapenko would never repeat such comments. Ostapenko later denied any racist intent in an Instagram post.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit marks his first in seven years, signaling a potential thaw in relations strained by past border clashes and economic imbalances. Despite deep-seated suspicion in India, economic challenges like U.S. tariffs are pushing both nations towards reluctant cooperation. India faces a widening trade deficit with China and relies heavily on Chinese raw materials and components for key industries, including EVs. While the summit might not resolve long-standing disputes or China's close ties with Pakistan, Modi's presence suggests a willingness to find common ground amidst shifting global supply chains and a need for market access.</p>

The endeavor comes as Roscosmos faces significant funding shortages and has lost 180 billion rubles since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, leading to severed ties with the European Space Agency.

A six-month transition period allows foreign postal agencies to opt for flat duties ranging from $80 to $200 per package, based on the country's existing tariff rates, before a mandatory shift to full "ad valorem" duty collection by February 28, 2026. Since the exemption's earlier removal for China and Hong Kong, over $492 million in additional duties have been collected. (not investment advice)</p>
