          <h2>Alibaba.com Sees Surge in US Buyer Activity After Tariff Pause</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US buyer activity on Alibaba Group Holding’s wholesale marketplace surged by over 40% the week after the US and China agreed to a 90-day pause on new tariffs. This spike indicates that US businesses are quickly trying to stockpile goods to mitigate the impact of potential high tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Some buyers are also looking to secure inventory for the holiday season, with inquiries related to Christmas products climbing more than 20% during the week. The increased interest from US users highlights the impact of the ongoing trade war on e-commerce platforms.</p>

          <p>Following a phone call between Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, Russia launched over 100 drones into Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian Air Force. Ukrainian forces claim to have shot down 35 drones and neutralized 58 others, reporting damage in four regions. Trump expressed optimism about peace talks, stating that he believes Putin wants to end the conflict, while Putin's statement showed no signs of concessions, emphasizing the elimination of the root causes of the crisis. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy confirmed Ukraine's readiness for a complete ceasefire, urging stronger sanctions if Russia is unwilling to stop the attacks, highlighting the need for continued U.S. involvement in negotiations, as the country seeks to protect its sovereignty.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Wu Hailong, president of the China Public Diplomacy Association, Donald Trump’s aggressive trade policies have fractured Western unity and potentially reshaped the global order. Wu stated that the US leader's global tariff war has worsened conflicts with allies, shaking the foundation of transatlantic ties. These fault lines were created by Trump’s accusations that allies were exploiting US economic and military advantages, his pledges to annex Canada and buy Greenland, and his sidelining of Europe in talks with Russia over the Ukraine war. This could lead US allies to consider fresh options in international relations.</p>

          <p>A new report from Silicon Valley Bank indicates that venture capital firms focused on artificial intelligence are driving much of the growth in the startup market, while companies in other areas are struggling to raise cash. About 40% of the total amount raised by U.S. venture funds last year was from funds that "list AI as a focus," up from 10% in 2021. Many investors were bullish that President Donald Trump's return to the White House would reinvigorate the startup economy due to the prospect of lower taxes and less regulation, but the aggressive tariff policy announced in early April led several companies to delay planned IPOs.</p>

The case has divided her family, with some children believing in her guilt and others defending her innocence.
