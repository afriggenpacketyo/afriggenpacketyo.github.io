          <p>With the Hamilton, Larkhall, and Stonehouse by-election approaching, political parties are intensely campaigning to fill the seat left vacant after Christina McKelvie's death. The election is seen as a crucial test of voter sentiment since the UK general election, and Reform UK aims to demonstrate its growing influence in Scotland. Labour hopes to regain power after nearly two decades, focusing on the SNP's governmental record, while the SNP acknowledges Reform UK's potential impact. Many locals express frustration with politicians, citing concerns about the cost of living, healthcare access, and small business taxes, creating an opportunity for Reform UK to capitalize on public discontent.</p>

          <p>A recent YouGov survey indicates that 45% of 18 to 24-year-olds in the UK believe in God or Gods. A BBC News documentary series explores how religion impacts relationships and sex, featuring diverse individuals including an interfaith couple, a gay Muslim, and a former Jehovah's Witness. The interfaith couple, Adarsh and Nav, navigate disapproval from their communities due to Adarsh being Hindu and Nav being Sikh, while Junaid, a gay Muslim, was disowned by his family for his sexual orientation. Martin Riley, formerly a Jehovah's Witness, was expelled from his religion and ostracized by his family, ultimately leading him to reconsider his faith and become an atheist.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly criticized Senator Rand Paul for opposing his 'Big, Beautiful Bill,' warning that Paul's vote against it would align him with Democrats and lead to a tax increase and potential U.S. debt default. Paul expressed concerns about the bill's potential to increase the national debt, despite supporting its tax and spending cuts. The bill, which narrowly passed the House, includes tax cuts, stricter Medicaid requirements, and changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Democrats have criticized the Medicaid reforms, while the Congressional Budget Office estimates millions could lose health insurance by 2034 if the bill passes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Due to nearly two dozen active wildfires, approximately 17,000 residents in Manitoba, Canada, have been evacuated, including over 5,000 from Flin Flon, with concerns that changing winds could bring the fire into the city.

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has cautioned that the UK government faces tough decisions as it finalizes spending plans for essential sectors like healthcare, defense, education, and criminal justice. The IFS suggests that the level of funding allocated to the NHS will significantly influence potential cuts in other 'unprotected' areas. The government's commitment to reducing patient waiting times and improving dental care may strain funding for other departments. With the Chancellor ruling out increased borrowing or tax hikes, spending cuts are anticipated, raising concerns about adequately funding plans such as increasing police numbers and capping bus fares.

While some businesses continue travel unabated, others, particularly in politically sensitive fields, are issuing new guidance such as advising employees to use wiped electronic devices or enter via Canada. Rising anxiety stems from increased visa scrutiny, social media monitoring, and the 'Catch and Revoke' policy, which revokes visas for any violation of U.S. law. Business travel is a significant revenue source for the U.S. economy, but a recent survey indicates that some companies anticipate a decline in travel volume due to U.S. policies.</p>

Migraines are complex neurological conditions that cannot be cured by a fast-food meal, and excessive caffeine or ultra-processed foods may even trigger migraines in some individuals.

          <p>An opinion piece discusses how Donald Trump's willingness to swerve, backpedal, and contradict himself contributes to his political resilience. The acronym 'TACO' (Trump Always Chickens Out) reflects Trump's strategy of testing limits but also being willing to pull back, reassuring swing voters. By recalibrating his positions on issues like China tariffs and relationships with figures like Elon Musk and Vladimir Putin, Trump has managed to maintain a normal level of approval in a polarized country. This ability to check himself and be checked by others is what a significant group of voters expect from his presidency.</p>

          <p>The Mississippi town of Clarksdale is experiencing a moment in the spotlight due to the box office success of Ryan Coogler's film *Sinners*. The film, set in 1932 Clarksdale, tells the story of twin brothers who return home after World War One, blending musical, horror, and period drama elements. Coogler brought the film to Clarksdale for free screenings, acknowledging the town's rich history and cultural significance. Residents appreciate the film's careful detail and representation of their community, which has faced struggles but maintains its musical roots.</p>
