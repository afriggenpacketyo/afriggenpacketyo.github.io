          <p>President Donald Trump is engaged in high-stakes diplomacy, preparing to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss a proposed 21-point plan aimed at ending the Gaza conflict and securing hostage releases. Domestically, his administration is intensely lobbying Congress for a clean continuing resolution to avert an impending government shutdown, stressing the lack of justification for opposition. Additionally, Trump announced a 100% tariff on movies produced outside the United States, asserting that the American film industry has been negatively impacted by foreign competition. These actions underscore the administration's multifaceted approach to pressing international and domestic challenges, from peace initiatives to economic protectionism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Canada has officially designated India's Bishnoi gang as a terrorist entity, empowering the federal government to seize property and freeze funds associated with the group. Public Safety Minister Gary Anandasangaree stated the gang fostered a climate of fear and intimidation within Canadian diaspora communities. This action provides law enforcement with stronger tools to prosecute terrorist offenses like financing and recruitment, aiming to curb its influence in the country. Last year, Canadian police alleged the Indian government used Bishnoi members for violence against pro-Khalistan supporters, an accusation India has consistently denied. The listing reflects growing pressure from opposition parties and provincial leaders to address the gang's activities.</p>

          <p>New York Giants rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart made a remarkable debut, leading his team to their first win of the season against the Los Angeles Chargers. Dart achieved a rare statistical milestone, joining Tim Tebow as only the second quarterback since 2000 to record a passing touchdown, a rushing touchdown, and over 50 rushing yards in his inaugural start. He completed 13 of 20 passes for 111 yards and ran for 54 yards, demonstrating his dual-threat capabilities. This performance also marked him as the first quarterback to win his first career start against a team that was at least 3-0 in the last 23 years, highlighting his immediate impact.</p>

This engagement included a new economic deal and Munir crediting Trump for brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan, a claim India denies. Conversely, US-India relations are strained, particularly due to a 50% US tariff on India's continued imports of Russian oil. This geopolitical shift is causing concern in Indian policy circles, leading to doubts about the US's reliability as a strategic partner and potentially reshaping India's approach to the Indo-Pacific and its balancing act against rising Chinese influence.</p>

          <p>International sanctions against Iran, encompassing weapons trade, oil exports, and banking, have been fully reinstated under the 2015 nuclear deal's snapback mechanism. This follows the UK, France, and Germany triggering the clause due to Iran's continued non-compliance with its nuclear program commitments. Experts warn of a "suffocating embargo" that will inflict significant economic hardship on ordinary Iranians, causing currency devaluation and rampant inflation. The article highlights concerns that the hardline Iranian regime is unlikely to engage in meaningful diplomacy, potentially escalating regional tensions. Furthermore, Iran's designation under Chapter VII of the UN Charter frames it as a threat to international peace, opening possibilities for further non-military or even military measures.</p>

          <p>Lorenz Kraus, 53, delivered a stunning on-camera confession to a CBS affiliate, admitting to killing his parents, Franz and Theresia Kraus, eight years ago and burying them in their Albany backyard. He characterized the deaths as mercy killings, citing his aging parents' increasing frailty, though he did not mention any terminal illnesses. The investigation initially focused on financial fraud, as the parents were still receiving Social Security payments despite not being seen for years. Kraus was arrested immediately upon leaving the television studio, charged with two counts of murder and two counts of concealment of a human corpse, and pleaded not guilty during his brief court appearance.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has warned of impending "harder choices" for the government, strongly hinting at potential tax increases in the upcoming November Budget. Speaking at Labour's annual conference, she committed to fiscal prudence, aiming for low taxes, inflation, and interest rates, but acknowledged that global events and past economic damage have complicated the situation. Economists suggest tax rises or spending cuts are necessary for her to adhere to borrowing rules. Reeves also criticized Reform UK and other voices advocating for less economic responsibility, asserting that such approaches are "dangerously wrong." This sets the stage for a challenging fiscal period for the UK.</p>

It outlines the duration, presidential administrations, and congressional control during each funding lapse, revealing patterns in legislative gridlock. Notably, President Ronald Reagan presided over eight shutdowns, though most were short-lived. The piece emphasizes how the threat of shutdowns has become more frequent in the past decade, often resolved by large spending packages. The most recent major shutdown in 2018, for instance, resulted in an estimated $3 billion in permanent economic losses, illustrating the significant financial repercussions of such events.</p>

          <p>The U.S. electric vehicle market faces significant uncertainty as federal incentives, offering up to $7,500 for EV purchases, are discontinued this week. This policy shift, enacted under the Trump administration's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," is projected to cause a notable decline in EV demand, posing challenges for automakers who have invested billions in development. Industry leaders, including CEOs from General Motors and Tesla, anticipate a "boom-and-bust" cycle before the market stabilizes to a new normal. Companies are already responding by adjusting production plans, implementing layoffs, or discontinuing certain EV models, as the market now seeks to determine its "natural demand" without government subsidies.

          <p>Oregon has initiated a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging the President's directive to deploy 200 members of the Oregon National Guard to Portland. State Attorney General Dan Rayfield contends that President Trump lacks the authority to federalize the Guard, especially when local officials assert they have sufficient capacity to manage public safety. Governor Tina Kotek and Portland Mayor Keith Wilson have strongly pushed back against the plan, dismissing it as an "abuse of power" and a politically motivated action, rather than a genuine response to an insurrection or public safety threat. This legal challenge underscores a significant dispute over federal intervention in state matters.</p>

Instead, she advocates for "stress springboarding," a method of channeling stress energy outward by actively helping others. This perspective posits that stress is inherently a social experience, designed to trigger oxytocin release and foster connection.
