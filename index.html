            <p>Millions are traveling for the Easter bank holiday weekend, with potential disruptions from rail works, airport strikes, and heavy traffic. Network Rail is carrying out maintenance, impacting London Euston and London Victoria. The RAC warns of significant traffic jams due to wet weather. Gatwick Airport anticipates strikes affecting some airlines, primarily concerning baggage handling for certain carriers. Travelers are advised to plan ahead and check for delays, as weather warnings for rain have been issued for parts of the UK. The vast majority of the rail network, over 95%, remains open for business as usual, however, there are pockets of major work.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration announced fees on Chinese-built vessels docking at U.S. ports following a U.S. Trade Representative investigation. The fees aim to address China's dominance in shipbuilding, which the USTR deems unreasonable and restrictive to U.S. commerce. The fees will be phased in over several years, starting at $0 per net ton and increasing to $140 per net ton by 2028. China has criticized the move, while the World Shipping Council expressed concerns. Vessel owners can get fee remissions by ordering U.S.-built ships. (not investment advice)</p>

Animal welfare advocates have expressed alarm, arguing that rescue should be the first option. Experts say climate change is a major factor, making wildfires more frequent and damaging, and forcing difficult choices in wildlife management.</p>

Some FDA employees have been working on a possible shift of the agency's routine food efforts to states for years, one current and one former official said, which could free up resources to focus on higher priority and foreign inspections. States often conduct inspections at a lower cost, while meeting the same standards.</p>

            <p>A coroner is urging for stricter eyesight rules for motorists after inquests into the deaths of four people killed by drivers with failing vision. The coroner labeled the current licensing system as "ineffective and unsafe," noting the UK's reliance on self-reporting of visual conditions. The report has been sent to the Transport Secretary, who said the government accepted the rules "need to be reassessed". The inquests revealed drivers who were aware of their vision problems failed to declare them to the DVLA.</p>

Diane DiMassa's Hothead Paisan: Homicidal Lesbian Terrorist offers a world of unrestrained havoc from a different perspective, rejecting societal stereotypes of women.
