        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that a government shutdown would result in the furlough of approximately 750,000 federal employees, costing about $400 million per day in compensation. The looming funding lapse is driven by a political stalemate, with Republican leaders like House Speaker Mike Johnson urging Democrats to pass a "clean" funding bill. Democrats, however, are insisting that any agreement must include an extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits to protect health insurance costs for millions of Americans.</p>

          <p>President Trump has unveiled a 20-point proposal aimed at ending the conflict in Gaza, which includes ending the war, returning hostages, and establishing a pathway toward Palestinian self-government. The plan has garnered support from the EU, key Arab states, and the Palestinian Authority, with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu also offering qualified praise. However, its success faces significant hurdles, primarily securing Hamas's agreement to demilitarize and ensuring Netanyahu adheres to the deal amid pressure from his far-right coalition, requiring sustained diplomatic pressure from the U.S.</p>

          <p>This article provides context on the impending government shutdown, detailing the annual congressional process required to fund federal agencies. The current stalemate stems from Democrats' refusal to support a funding extension without addressing expiring Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies, which they consider a red line. Republicans, who hold majorities in both chambers, argue these issues should be negotiated separately and are pushing for a temporary "clean" funding bill, but they lack the necessary Democratic support in the Senate to overcome the 60-vote threshold.</p>

          <p>Following the disruption of a massive telecommunications network that posed a threat to the UN General Assembly, federal agents have found an additional 200,000 SIM cards at a location in New Jersey. This discovery brings the total to over 300,000 cards, part of a sophisticated system capable of sending 30 million texts per minute. Officials believe the network, which has links to Chinese actors, was used for encrypted communications by organized crime, drug cartels, and foreign governments, though no arrests have yet been made.</p>

          <p>In a speech to top military commanders, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced a major policy overhaul to eliminate what he termed "woke" culture from the armed forces. His new directives include raising physical fitness requirements to a single "male level," ending racial quotas, lifting restrictions on hazing in boot camp, and enforcing stricter grooming standards. Hegseth asserted that these changes are necessary to restore a "warrior ethos" and combat readiness, justifying the recent firing of senior leaders as essential for implementing the new standards.</p>

          <p>A Metropolitan Police constable is now the subject of a criminal investigation on suspicion of perverting the course of justice, the UK's police watchdog has announced. The probe was launched after a BBC investigation uncovered serious allegations of misconduct at a central London police station, including excessive force and discriminatory comments. The Independent Office for Police Conduct is investigating a total of ten individuals for potential gross misconduct and is reviewing a significant amount of CCTV footage from the station's troubled custody suite.</p>

          <p>While the broader stock market traded lower on Tuesday amid concerns over consumer confidence and a potential government shutdown, the tech and healthcare sectors showed resilience. A key tech development was Amazon's announcement of new hardware, including an upgraded Echo smart speaker integrated with Alexa+, a more capable generative AI assistant. Amazon's CEO noted the new Alexa can take more direct actions for users, unlike other chatbots, which could help drive more sales on the company's marketplace and further integrate its ecosystem of services.

          <p>President Trump has announced an agreement with Pfizer aimed at reducing U.S. drug prices and boosting domestic manufacturing. Under the deal, Pfizer will sell many drugs to Medicaid at the lowest price offered in other developed nations and offer significant discounts for consumers on a new government website. In exchange for these price reductions and a $70 billion investment in U.S. facilities, Pfizer's products will be exempt from potential pharmaceutical-specific tariffs for three years, a model the administration hopes to replicate with other drugmakers.</p>

          <p>This reflective article examines the tragic shooting at a Latter-day Saint church in Michigan, which occurred the same day the faith's leader, Russell M. Nelson, passed away at age 101. The author, a member of the church, contrasts the horrific, politically charged violence with Nelson's final years of ministry, during which he urgently called on members to be "peacemakers" and reject modern society's "venomous contention." The piece suggests Nelson's response would have been to emphasize Christ's teaching to love one's enemies, a radical message in the face of such hatred.</p>

Outdoor memorials will likely remain physically accessible, but tours of federal buildings like the U.S. Capitol will be suspended, while privately funded institutions are expected to remain open.</p>
