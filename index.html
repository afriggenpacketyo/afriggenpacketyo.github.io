          <p>A Mexican Navy training vessel, the Cuauhtemoc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City on Saturday evening, resulting in two deaths and nineteen injuries among the 277 people on board.

The NTSB is investigating the incident, but preliminary findings suggest a mechanical issue. Mayor Eric Adams confirmed that the bridge sustained no structural damage and has since reopened to traffic, with officials expressing gratitude to first responders for their swift action. </p>

          <p>Harvard University has confirmed that a document in its archives is an original copy of King Edward I’s reaffirmation of the Magna Carta, dating to 1300. The discovery comes at a time when Harvard is in conflict with the Trump administration, which has frozen federal grants to the university. The article suggests that the Magna Carta, with its emphasis on limiting power and upholding rights, serves as a reminder of the importance of checks and balances, especially during periods of political tension. It further suggests the need to push back against what the article describes as autocracy. </p>

          <p>The Guardian reports on concerns that the Trump administration could pressure government statisticians to manipulate economic data to align with the president's agenda. Proposed changes to civil service rules could make it easier to fire employees deemed to be "intentionally subverting presidential directives," raising fears of political interference in agencies like the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Experts warn that diluting the impartiality of data agencies could damage the US's reputation as a stable economic power and reliable partner. </p>
