          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 10:12:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple has entered into a $500 million agreement with MP Materials to procure rare earth magnets produced in the United States, significantly boosting its domestic supply chain. The deal involves magnets from a new facility in Texas and the development of a recycling line in California, with shipments expected to begin in 2027. This partnership aims to reduce US reliance on China for these critical components, which are essential for electronics, and follows a recent Department of Defense investment in MP Materials. The announcement caused MP Materials' stock to surge by 17%.</p>

          <p>The Environment Agency has officially declared a drought in the East and West Midlands regions of England, following the country's driest start to the year since 1976. This declaration signals that water companies may implement restrictions, such as hosepipe bans, which are already in effect for millions in Yorkshire. The prolonged dry spell, exacerbated by record-breaking warm temperatures, has led to extremely low river levels, impacting agriculture and ecosystems. While natural weather patterns are the primary cause, officials note that climate change and increased water usage are heightening the risk of future shortages.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicated a 2.7% annual increase in inflation for June, the highest rate since February and aligning with economists' forecasts. On a monthly basis, prices rose by 0.3%, driven by increases in food, energy, and other categories like apparel and household furnishings. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, rose by 2.9% over the past year. Experts suggest that recently imposed tariffs may be contributing to the price hikes, a trend that could continue through the summer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Current national average interest rates for mortgages and refinancing remain high, posing challenges for homebuyers and homeowners. As of mid-July, the average 30-year mortgage rate stands at 6.70%, while a 15-year loan is at 5.88%; refinance rates are slightly higher. Experts suggest that while the Federal Reserve's potential pause on rate hikes could bring relief, borrowers should focus on strengthening their credit profiles to secure better rates. Financial advisors recommend shopping around and comparing lenders, as rates can vary significantly based on individual financial situations and location. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senators Tammy Baldwin and Joni Ernst are leading a bipartisan effort to reauthorize and increase funding for the Farm and Ranch Assistance Network, a mental health and suicide prevention program for agricultural workers. Their proposed Farmers First Act of 2025 would allocate an additional $75 million over five years to support the program's network of regional hubs. This initiative addresses the high suicide rate among farmers, which is reportedly three and a half times the national average.

          <p>In the current interest rate environment, money market accounts are offering slightly higher returns than long-term certificates of deposit (CDs), a reversal of historical trends. For a $5,000 deposit, a money market account at a 4.32% rate would nominally outperform a 5-year CD at a 4.20% rate. However, the key difference lies in rate stability; a CD locks in its rate for the entire term, protecting against future rate drops. In contrast, money market account rates are variable and could decrease if the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates, making the choice dependent on an individual's risk tolerance.

For individual donors, the bill limits deductions for the wealthy by making the first 0.5% of their adjusted gross income non-deductible.

          <h2>Trump Administration's Tax Bill Projected to Add $3.4 Trillion to Federal Deficit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 09:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's recently signed tax-and-spending bill is projected by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to increase federal deficits by at least $3.4 trillion over the next decade. This adds to a national debt that has already surged past $36 trillion. As the debt grows, so do the interest payments required to service it, which now consume over 13% of all federal spending and could rise to nearly 17% by 2035. Economists warn that persistent deficit spending risks higher inflation and increased interest rates for consumers on products like mortgages and credit cards. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase announced second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, driven by robust performance in its trading and investment banking divisions. The bank reported earnings of $5.24 per share on revenue of $45.68 billion, beating estimates despite a 17% decline in net income compared to the prior year, which had included a significant gain from Visa shares. Fixed income trading revenue jumped 14% and investment banking fees rose 7%, benefiting from market volatility. CEO Jamie Dimon praised the results but reiterated warnings about risks from trade uncertainty and geopolitical conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester United's new head coach, Ruben Amorim, faces significant challenges in reshaping his squad, with several high-profile players like Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho still at the club despite being deemed surplus to requirements. The club's ability to fund new signings, such as the completed deal for Matheus Cunha, largely depends on offloading these unwanted players to free up funds and wages. However, a lack of concrete offers for the exiled players is complicating transfer plans. This situation creates uncertainty about whether United can acquire the necessary talent before the season begins.</p>

          <p>This opinion article critically and satirically examines the leadership of FBI Director Kash Patel, a Donald Trump appointee with no prior FBI experience. The author highlights Patel's children's book series, which frames Trump as a king battling political enemies, as an example of his unusual profile for the role. The piece focuses on recent reports that the FBI under Patel has increased its use of polygraph tests to screen employees for loyalty, questioning their reliability and the director's apparent insecurity. The author humorously suggests Patel's own writings on how incompetence leads to promotion in Washington may be self-referential.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that President Donald Trump's recent statements on Ukraine and Russia indicate a policy evolution toward a more conventional, confrontational stance. Despite past admiration for Vladimir Putin, Trump has recently affirmed continued weapons shipments to Ukraine and threatened significant tariffs on Russia if a peace deal is not reached. This shift mirrors the more hawkish positions held by officials in his first administration. The analysis suggests that the realities of geopolitical rivalry are pushing Trump's team to treat Russia as a strategic competitor, much like China, challenging the narrative of his alignment with Putin's goals.</p>

          <p>Israel has conducted airstrikes on Syrian government forces near the predominantly Druze city of Suweida after they deployed to the area following deadly sectarian violence. The clashes between Druze militias and Bedouin tribes reportedly killed nearly 100 people before a ceasefire was announced. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated the strikes were ordered to prevent Syrian government weapons from being used against the Druze community, citing deep ties between Israeli Druze and those in Syria. This marks the first deployment of Syrian government forces to Suweida since the overthrow of President Bashar al-Assad.</p>

Despite concerns about managing his workload, especially with back-to-back matches, Archer bowled 39.2 overs at high pace and expressed his determination to help England win the series.

This practice is intended to allow BBC Studios to compete on a level playing field with other commercial entities.

          <p>A senior UN official has warned that the rapid and large-scale return of Afghans from Iran is overwhelming humanitarian support systems in Afghanistan. Over one million people have returned from Iran this year, many involuntarily, arriving exhausted and traumatized at border crossings like Islam Qala. The UN special representative, Roza Otunbayeva, stated the sheer volume should be an alarm for the global community, as aid agencies are already facing deep funding cuts. Without immediate international intervention, the influx could further destabilize the region and lead to renewed displacement and suffering.</p>
