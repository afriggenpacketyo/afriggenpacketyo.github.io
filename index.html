            <p>A Vox analysis argues that Silicon Valley's support for Donald Trump, driven by hopes of deregulation and tax cuts, has backfired, undermining American economic growth, scientific prowess, and geopolitical influence. Trump's trade war has damaged manufacturing, eroded faith in the dollar, and alienated allies, pushing some towards China. Furthermore, cuts to federal science funding and restrictions on high-skilled immigration are stifling innovation. The article suggests that Trump's policies are antithetical to the long-term interests of the tech industry and the nation.</p>

            <p>The US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, has warned that the US will cease brokering peace talks between Russia and Ukraine within days if no progress is evident. This announcement coincides with ongoing Russian strikes in Ukraine and a newly signed memorandum of intent between the US and Ukraine to establish an investment fund for reconstruction. The deal, aimed to be finalized by April 26, seeks to involve American investment in a "free, sovereign, and secure Ukraine," though details remain unclear and subject to parliamentary approval in Ukraine.</p>

            <p>Drake has expanded his lawsuit against Universal Music Group (UMG), alleging defamation stemming from Kendrick Lamarâ€™s Super Bowl halftime performance of the diss track "Not Like Us." Drake claims the performance, with lyrics suggesting he is interested in young women, amplified the song's defamatory message and increased threats against him. While Lamar is not being sued, Drake argues UMG profited from a campaign to portray him as a paedophile. UMG maintains the lawsuit is without merit, and Drake will now be subject to discovery as the case proceeds.</p>

            <p>Marvin Roberts, an Alaska Native man, has settled with the city of Fairbanks for $11.5 million after spending nearly two decades in prison for a murder he maintained he did not commit. Roberts was one of the "Fairbanks Four," Indigenous men whose convictions were vacated in 2015 amid allegations of racial bias in the investigation. The settlement, while not an admission of liability by the city, is seen as a vindication of Roberts' innocence and will provide him with financial security and time with his family.</p>

            <p>Soaring gold prices are prompting jewelry collectors to melt down old pieces for cash, creating a boom for independent jewelers. The price of gold has reached an all-time high, driven by geopolitical tensions and increased demand. While some jewelers advise caution, urging clients to preserve antique pieces, many are taking advantage of the lucrative opportunity to sell their unwanted gold. The influx of customers has also raised security concerns in the Jewelry District.</p>

            <p>This Vox article argues that the Trump administration is undermining trust in the federal government by punishing immigrants who follow the rules. The administration is targeting immigrants with all types of status, from undocumented immigrants to naturalized citizens. Examples include sharing IRS data with DHS, terminating legal status for migrants who used government-issued apps, and threatening foreign students' visas. The author claims that these actions are part of a push to create a second-class citizenry.</p>
