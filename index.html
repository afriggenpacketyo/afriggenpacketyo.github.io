          <p>Ukraine reported that Russia launched its largest drone attack since the full-scale invasion began, targeting several regions including Kyiv, killing one person and injuring others. The attack involved an estimated 273 drones, some of which were intercepted. This barrage occurred just before a scheduled call between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, during which Trump is expected to push for a ceasefire. The article notes this is part of an escalating pattern of aerial bombardments by Russia, with increasing drone swarm sizes. </p>

          <p>President Trump's recent diplomatic moves in the Middle East, including engaging with Syria and pursuing deals with Gulf states, suggest a shift away from prioritizing Israel, traditionally a key U.S. ally in the region, according to this New York Times article. Trump's efforts to negotiate peace deals in Iran and Yemen, along with forging business agreements with Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE, occurred without a stop in Israel, raising questions about the country's role in American foreign policy. While the U.S. denies abandoning its ties with Israel, the change in diplomatic focus has stirred concern among Israeli officials who fear being sidelined. </p>
