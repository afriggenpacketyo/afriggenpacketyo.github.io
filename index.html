          <p>Japan's exports fell for the second straight month in June, contracting by 0.5% year-over-year and missing economists' expectations for a rise. The decline is driven by falling shipments to major partners like China and the U.S., with automobile exports to America dropping significantly by over 26%. This downturn, exacerbated by the prospect of a 25% U.S. tariff and stalled trade negotiations, is heightening fears that Japan's export-reliant economy could soon enter a technical recession.

          <p>A class-action lawsuit initiated by investors has commenced against Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other company leaders regarding the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal. The lawsuit alleges that Meta failed to disclose the risks of user data misuse, violating a 2012 FTC consent order and causing significant financial damage to the company. Shareholders are seeking to have executives reimburse Meta for over $8 billion in fines and legal costs. The trial is expected to feature testimony from Zuckerberg and former COO Sheryl Sandberg.</p>

          <p>Vital companionship programs that support socially isolated older adults, like the Senior Companion Program, are at risk due to potential federal funding cuts from a new domestic policy bill. Health experts warn that social isolation significantly increases risks for dementia, heart disease, and premature death, making these services critical. Program directors express deep concern that losing federal funds could force them to shut down, which would lead to increased institutionalization and higher mortality rates among the elderly population they serve.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence has called for the Trump administration to release all government files related to Jeffrey Epstein, emphasizing the need for transparency while protecting victim identities. Pence's stance directly contrasts with President Trump, who has dismissed the growing scrutiny as a politically motivated "hoax" started by Democrats. Pushing back, Pence noted that the Epstein investigation spanned multiple administrations and asserted that the American people deserve to see the facts, regardless of political affiliation.</p>

However, former and current officials, including the fired USAID Inspector General, state the administration has provided little evidence for these claims, suggesting the cuts are politically motivated. Critics allege that programs were targeted based on keywords like "gender" or "climate" rather than effectiveness, and that the dismantling of USAID has undermined oversight and put life-saving humanitarian aid at risk.</p>

          <p>A massive data breach that exposed the personal details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had applied for UK relocation was revealed after a High Court ruling. The leak, which occurred in 2022 when a UK official accidentally emailed a sensitive spreadsheet, only came to light publicly after some names appeared on Facebook. The government responded by covertly creating a secret relocation route for those affected, fearing the data could fall into Taliban hands, and has since relocated thousands of individuals at high risk.</p>

          <p>A group of Liberal Democrat MPs, including party leader Sir Ed Davey, has asked the UK government to intervene after UEFA demoted the Crystal Palace football club from the Europa League. The club was relegated to the lower-tier Conference League for breaching multi-club ownership rules, as its part-owner also controls French club Lyon, which also qualified. The lawmakers called the punishment "disgraceful" and "disproportionately punitive," arguing it undermines the club's historic FA Cup win and raises questions about fairness in football governance.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes how President Trump's recent dismissal of the Jeffrey Epstein affair as a "hoax" has put him at odds with his own base, which he had previously encouraged to embrace conspiracy theories. After years of suggesting a cover-up, Trump's administration now states no "client list" exists, a reversal that has enraged many loyal supporters. The Epstein story has become a rare issue that Trump cannot control, as it taps into a deep-seated distrust of elites that he himself cultivated, creating an uncharacteristic and unpredictable political challenge.</p>

The new law will make it illegal in Germany to facilitate migration to a non-EU country, closing a loophole that has allowed smugglers to operate. This commitment is part of a broader UK-Germany agreement on migration and defense, aimed at disrupting the supply lines for small boats used in the dangerous crossings.</p>

          <p>An attempt by Nebraska lawmakers to lift a decades-old ban that prevents individuals with drug convictions from receiving federal food assistance has narrowly failed. The policy, a remnant of the "war on drugs" era, remains in effect in a handful of states, creating significant barriers for people re-entering society after incarceration. The failure of the reform effort means that this restriction on accessing the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) will continue in Nebraska, impacting former offenders and their families.</p>

The positive outlook comes after a rocky start to the year for the industry, where weaker-than-expected domestic travel demand had led to lower airfares. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans finalizes a plan to settle 633 clergy abuse claims, church investors are arguing that nearly half of them could be dismissed. The claims in question were filed past a court deadline, were duplicates, or involved abusers not under the archdiocese's direct authority. If these claims are thrown out, it could jeopardize the entire settlement, as a bloc of survivors already opposing the deal would have enough votes to reject it, potentially sending the cases to civil court.</p>
