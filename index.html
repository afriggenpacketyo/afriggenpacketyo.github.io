          <p>Eleven Syracuse high school students face potential charges, including kidnapping, for an alleged hazing incident involving younger lacrosse team members. The incident reportedly involved blindfolding, tying up, and placing a pillowcase over a victim's head in a remote location, with other students dressed in black and armed with weapons pretending to be kidnappers. A former teammate described the accused students as "good people that made bad decisions" and expressed concern over the negative perception the incident could create for the community. The school has canceled the remainder of the varsity boys lacrosse season in response to the incident, aiming to address the program's culture.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that any country or person purchasing oil or petrochemicals from Iran will face immediate secondary sanctions, barring them from doing business with the United States. This action is part of Trump's "maximum pressure" campaign against Iran, intended to halt the country's oil exports and prevent the financing of militant groups. The move led to a rise in U.S. crude oil futures and global benchmark Brent prices, given Iran's status as a major oil producer within OPEC. Trump has also sought negotiations with Iran regarding its nuclear program, asserting that Tehran is attempting to develop nuclear weapons, an allegation Iran denies.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced his intention to nominate Mike Waltz, the current national security advisor, as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, confirming reports of Waltz's departure from his current role. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as interim national security advisor until a permanent replacement is found. Waltz's exit follows controversy surrounding his creation of a Signal messaging app chat thread, which was used to share U.S. military plans with other administration officials, including an editor from The Atlantic magazine who was inadvertently added to the chat. Trump praised Waltz's dedication to national interests and his experience in the military, Congress, and as his National Security Advisor.</p>

          <p>McDonald's reported weaker-than-expected quarterly earnings, citing a decline in U.S. same-store sales, which CEO Chris Kempczinski attributed to "heightened anxiety" among consumers regarding potential price increases due to President Donald Trump's tariffs. Kempczinski expressed caution about the overall health of the consumer, suggesting a possible softening in spending. This report could impact other portfolio stocks like Texas Roadhouse and Starbucks, as consumers may increasingly opt to prepare meals at home. The article mentions that Starbucks is still considered a buy, and Texas Roadhouse has some protection from tariffs due to its domestic revenue streams (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing significant changes to the federal student loan repayment system, consolidating the current 12 options into just two. The GOP's "Student Success and Taxpayer Savings Plan" would offer borrowers a choice between fixed payments over 10 to 25 years or an income-driven repayment plan called the "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP). Under the RAP, monthly bills would be a percentage of a borrower's income, starting at 1% and rising to 10% as income increases. The plan aims to generate savings to offset President Donald Trump's planned tax cuts, overhauling the student loan and financial aid system.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With borrowing costs rising and financial struggles increasing, settling debt for less than the full amount owed is a strategy worth considering. Most successful debt settlements involve paying between 30% and 50% less than the original balance, typically in a lump sum. While negotiating settlements independently is possible, working with a debt relief expert can offer advantages, including professional negotiation skills and established relationships with creditors. Debt relief companies charge fees, so individuals should weigh the potential cost savings against the added expense before deciding on a course of action.</p>

          <p>Federal forest officials began clearing a large homeless encampment in the Deschutes National Forest near Bend, Oregon, affecting over 100 residents living in RVs and cars. The U.S. Forest Service issued warnings weeks in advance, citing fire mitigation measures as the reason for the closure, which spans nearly 35,000 acres. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling upholding bans on sleeping outdoors, leading to concerns about where the displaced individuals will go, as shelters are already at capacity. Volunteers and aid groups have been assisting residents with repairs and relocation efforts, but many face challenges due to vehicle breakdowns and limited resources.</p>

          <p>Savers with CD accounts maturing in May 2025 should actively research their options, considering the current interest rate environment and recent stock market volatility. While high-rate CD options may be less abundant, savers can still secure rates of 4% or more on short-term CDs or high-yield savings accounts. Long-term CDs offer potential for greater interest earnings but require sacrificing access to funds for a longer period. It is critical to reach out to the bank before the CD formally matures to discuss intentions and avoid automatic rollover into a potentially lower-rate CD.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Texas has permanently blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans deemed criminals from the Southern District of Texas, ruling that the White House's use of the statute was illegal.

The ruling, while limited to the Southern District of Texas, could influence other cases involving the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act.

          <p>Kohl's Corporation has terminated CEO Ashley Buchanan for cause following an external investigation that revealed violations of the company's conflict-of-interest policies. The investigation found that Buchanan directed the company to engage in transactions involving undisclosed conflicts of interest, including conducting business with a vendor with whom he had a personal relationship. As a result of his dismissal, Buchanan must forfeit his equity awards and repay a portion of his signing bonus. The company has appointed Michael Bender, its board chair, as interim CEO, emphasizing that the termination was unrelated to the company's performance.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has halted $1 billion in funding for mental health services for children, citing concerns about potential violations of federal civil rights law. The funding was authorized under the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, enacted after the Uvalde school shooting, to improve mental health support for students. The Education Department claimed that grant recipients were using the funding to implement race-based actions, such as diversity quotas. Critics argue that this decision equates mental health services with the radicalization of children, jeopardizing support for vulnerable students.</p>
