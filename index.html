          <p>This collection of articles examines the evolving nature of China's soft power, noting a decline in Western interest in learning Mandarin amid geopolitical tensions. Conversely, China is intensifying efforts to control its global narrative through state-backed think tanks and media. The piece also highlights cultural exports, like "ugly-cute" Labubu dolls and streaming shows, as new avenues for influencing international opinion, alongside Chinese brands expanding into the U.S. market despite bilateral friction. The overall analysis points to a multifaceted and sometimes contradictory approach to building global influence.</p>

The New York City Police Department is searching for up to four gunmen believed to be involved in what they suspect is gang-related violence. Authorities recovered 42 shell casings from the scene and are appealing to the public for information. Despite this tragic event, officials noted that overall gun violence has decreased in the city this year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ahead of a critical meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders, Donald Trump stated that a peace deal would require Ukraine to forgo NATO membership. He also remarked that the return of Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014, is not negotiable. These comments follow a summit with Vladimir Putin, where a U.S. envoy claimed Putin agreed to a possible NATO-like security pact for Ukraine as an alternative to full membership. The upcoming talks in Washington are seen as pivotal for Ukraine's future security arrangements.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, Russian President Vladimir Putin has conceded to allowing the U.S. and its allies to offer Ukraine security protections similar to NATO's Article 5. This potential breakthrough, described as "game-changing," emerged from the recent Trump-Putin summit in Alaska. The arrangement could serve as an alternative to Ukraine's full NATO membership, a long-standing point of contention for Moscow. European leaders have welcomed the development, though Ukrainian President Zelenskyy noted that specific details on how such guarantees would function remain unclear.</p>

          <p>Preliminary results from Bolivia's presidential election indicate a significant political shift, with the country likely to elect its first non-left-wing president in nearly two decades. Candidates Rodrigo Paz Pereira and former president Jorge Quiroga are headed for a run-off after securing the top two spots. This turn to the right follows a period of economic crisis and deep divisions within the ruling socialist party, MAS. The outcome could reshape Bolivia's foreign policy, potentially leading to closer ties with the U.S. and increased foreign investment in its lithium reserves. The article also notes an arrest warrant for former president Evo Morales over an alleged sexual assault of a minor.</p>

          <p>In its latest annual report on the subject, China has accused the United States of using human rights as a "bargaining chip" and a tool for political maneuvering. The document criticizes the U.S. for what it describes as a hypocritical political system plagued by moneyed interests and social inequality. The report specifically points to widespread racism and the politicization of immigration as key failures. This official statement reflects ongoing diplomatic tensions and a broader battle over global narratives between the two countries.</p>

          <p>The federal anti-crime initiative in Washington D.C. is escalating, with West Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio set to deploy hundreds of National Guard troops to the capital. This move follows an initial deployment ordered by the Trump administration to address crime rates. However, some crime prevention experts argue the military presence will be ineffective in addressing the systemic causes of violence. The policy has drawn criticism from Democratic mayors in other cities, who are preparing for potential legal challenges if the crackdown expands further.</p>

The presence of a united European front is intended to impress upon Trump that any peace deal must directly involve Ukraine and include robust security guarantees. European leaders are concerned that Trump's personal rapport with Putin could lead him to accept a deal unfavorable to Kyiv. The central challenge involves reconciling Ukraine's constitutional refusal to cede territory with Russia's demands for the Donbas region.</p>

          <p>Mookie Betts hit a go-ahead solo home run in the eighth inning to lead the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 5-4 victory over the San Diego Padres, completing a crucial weekend series sweep. The dramatic hit provided a much-needed moment for Betts, who has struggled at the plate for much of the season. The win extends the Dodgers' lead in the National League West to two games over the Padres. The game had been tied after the Dodgers bullpen relinquished an early four-run lead built on home runs by Freddie Freeman and Andy Pages.</p>

          <p>The Green Party's leadership election highlights a fundamental debate over its future direction, pitting a "bolder," more populist approach against a more moderate, established strategy. Deputy leader Zack Polanski is advocating for an "eco-populist" message to connect with voter anger, using blunt, anti-elite language. His opponents, co-leader Adrian Ramsay and new MP Ellie Chowns, argue for continuing the current strategy of broad appeal and local campaigning that recently quadrupled their parliamentary seats. The outcome will determine whether the party embraces a more radical style or sticks with the formula that has delivered its greatest electoral success.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States is experiencing a historically low birth rate, with the total fertility rate falling below the level needed for natural population replacement. This trend is driven by a significant decline in births among women under 30, including a continued drop in teenage pregnancies. Experts point to multiple factors, including the increased use of effective contraception, delays in marriage, and a societal shift in values regarding family and personal fulfillment. The demographic shift raises long-term concerns about economic decline, the solvency of Social Security, and the capacity to care for a larger elderly population.</p>

          <p>A massive concert by ultra-nationalist singer Thompson in Zagreb has exposed deep divisions within Croatian society over its history and national identity. The event, attended by hundreds of thousands, featured the controversial chant "Za dom, spremni" ("For homeland, ready!"), which is associated with the World War Two-era Nazi-allied Ustasha regime. While supporters, including some government officials, defend the chant as a patriotic symbol from the 1990s war of independence, human rights groups condemn it as a neo-fascist salute. The debate reveals a polarized nation grappling with conflicting interpretations of its past.</p>

          <p>Japan is facing a severe demographic crisis, with its population shrinking for 15 consecutive years and on track to halve by the end of the century. The country's low birth rate, where deaths now outpace births by more than two to one, is straining its economy, military, and social systems. In response, the government has launched initiatives like a city-run dating app and shortened workweeks to encourage family formation. Some politicians advocate for revitalizing rural areas to create more family-friendly living environments, arguing that a sweeping cultural mindset change is needed to reverse the decline.</p>

          <p>The New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner continues its mission to identify victims of the September 11th attacks, recently naming three more individuals using new DNA technology. This ongoing effort, nearly a quarter-century after the tragedy, provides long-awaited answers to families, though about 40% of the victims remain unidentified. The process involves sophisticated techniques to extract usable DNA from bone fragments that were degraded by extreme conditions at Ground Zero. For families receiving notification, the news brings a mix of shock, grief, and gratitude that the promise to "never forget" is still being honored.</p>

          <p>A 35-year-old man was arrested at the Otay Mesa Port of Entry after U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers discovered 14 live toucans hidden inside the dashboard of his vehicle. The young, sedated birds, a protected species, had suffered injuries including broken tails and a broken leg. This incident marks the fourth recent case of exotic bird smuggling in the San Diego area. Officials warn that such trafficking is not only cruel to the animals but also poses a public health risk by bypassing mandatory quarantine and disease testing protocols.</p>
