          <p>A 16-year-old in Maryland was arrested for allegedly breaking into 121 cars in one night but was released within five hours, sparking outrage from local police. Laurel Police Chief Russ Hamill expressed his frustration, citing the state's classification of these crimes as "lower level" offenses. Authorities found nearly 20 sets of car keys and other evidence at the teen's home, linking him to the break-ins. Hamill noted that the teen's release occurred despite reports of 17 car break-ins the following night, raising concerns about public safety and accountability. The police chief also mentioned that two other teens have been identified as accomplices and are expected to be arrested soon, but the system's leniency remains a major point of contention. Optimism about the situation is low given the perceived lack of consequences for the suspect.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that trade talks between the U.S. and China have stalled, requiring direct engagement from President Trump and President Xi Jinping. Despite a recent agreement in Switzerland to roll back tariff increases, disagreements persist over tech restrictions and rare earth regulations. Bessent remains optimistic that the Chinese will come to the table once President Trump makes his preferences known. The last conversation between Trump and Xi was in January before Trump's second term began, and analysts believe China will only agree to another call if there is assurance of no surprises from the U.S. side. The situation underscores the complexity and magnitude of the ongoing trade negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nathan Laatsch, an IT specialist with the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), has been charged with attempting to provide classified information to a friendly foreign government. The FBI began investigating Laatsch after receiving a tip that he was willing to share intelligence products and classified documentation because he disagreed with the current administration's values. Laatsch allegedly communicated with an undercover FBI agent, transcribed classified information, and hid it in his socks and lunchbox. He also expressed interest in obtaining citizenship in the unnamed foreign country, citing concerns about the long-term prospects of the U.S. The arrest highlights broader concerns about individuals with access to classified information potentially selling it for profit.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily suspended a lower court's order that deemed many of President Trump's global tariffs illegal, allowing the tariffs to remain in place for now. The White House argued that the lower court's decision improperly second-guessed the president and threatened to unravel trade negotiations. Small businesses and states had challenged the tariffs, which are central to Trump's agenda. The appeals court's decision allows the tariffs to be used while the case is litigated, with the next hearing scheduled for June 5. The administration is expected to continue challenging the court rulings, potentially leading to a Supreme Court decision.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's time in the Trump administration as part of the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) has concluded after 129 days, marked by significant spending cuts and controversies. Musk aimed to cut trillions in government spending, ultimately claiming to have saved $175 billion through various measures, though these figures have been disputed. His tenure was characterized by mass firings, data access controversies, and accusations of conflicts of interest due to his companies' dealings with the government. Musk's work also led to significant cuts in international aid programs, reflecting the administration's "America First" approach, and he faced criticism for spreading misinformation.

          <p>A 43-year-old cancer patient, Natalie Phelps, reports that her life-saving treatment has been delayed due to Trump administration cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Phelps, who has stage 4 colorectal cancer, was set to begin a cell-based immunotherapy trial but was informed that the start date would be pushed back by several weeks because of staffing reductions. Her story has gained attention, sparking a dispute between a Democratic senator and the U.S. health secretary regarding the impact of the cuts. The delay has caused significant stress and uncertainty for Phelps, as her cancer has progressed, affecting her eligibility for the trial.

The administration aims to increase arrests to a minimum of 3,000 per day, a target described as an unprecedented expansion of immigration enforcement.

City officials are evaluating whether the device complies with local noise ordinances, as it is not in line with the city's outreach-based approach to homelessness.

          <p>Major USDA cuts implemented by the Trump administration are severely impacting food banks and school food programs in North Carolina. The cuts, totaling over $1 billion annually, include $660 million from the Local Food for Schools program and $420 million from the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement. Local growers, like Pine Knot Farms, are experiencing devastating revenue losses, potentially leading to layoffs. Food banks, such as the Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina, face significant reductions in aid, exacerbating hunger crises and forcing individuals to choose between essential needs like medicine and food.</p>

          <p>A senior Hamas official told the BBC that the organization rejects the latest U.S. proposal for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal. The White House claimed Israel has "signed off" on the plan, but Hamas states that the proposal does not satisfy its core demands, including an end to the war. The Hamas official noted that the offer lacked guarantees of a permanent ceasefire and a return to previous humanitarian protocols. Despite this rejection, Hamas remains in contact with mediators and will submit a written response, signaling continued engagement in negotiations.</p>
