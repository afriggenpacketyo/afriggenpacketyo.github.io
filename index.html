          <p>Russia was notably excluded from President Trump's latest round of tariffs, possibly due to ongoing negotiations between the two countries.  A visit by a senior Kremlin envoy to the White House suggests efforts to improve relations and potentially secure trade deals.  The exclusion contrasts with Trump's previous threats of tariffs on Russia if no peace deal on Ukraine was reached.  The situation underscores the complex interplay between geopolitical tensions and economic policy.</p>

          <p>Analysts predict that President Trump's new tariffs will raise the average U.S. tariff rate to its highest level in over a century, exceeding even the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act levels of the Great Depression era.  The effective tariff rate is estimated to be above 20%, potentially reaching 27% with additional tariffs.  This raises concerns about the potential negative impact on the U.S. and global economy.  Experts warn of increased inflation and slower economic growth.</p>
