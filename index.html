            <p>The White House announced that President Trump is exploring the legality of deporting U.S. citizens to prisons in Central American countries.

            <p>A new study suggests that grizzly bears, extinct in California for 100 years, could thrive if reintroduced to the state. The study identifies three potential regions for grizzly bear habitats: the Transverse Ranges, the Sierra Nevada, and the Northwest Forest. Researchers estimate that California could house around 1,183 grizzlies, but the reintroduction would require significant investment and management. While the statistical risk to humans is considered small, wildlife officials express concerns about increased human-wildlife conflict.</p>

            <p>Harvard University has rejected demands from the Trump administration for sweeping reforms, including changes to faculty and DEI programs, in exchange for continued federal funding. Harvard's president, Alan Garber, expressed concerns that the administration's demands were aimed at controlling intellectual conditions at the university. The university's lawyers argued that the demands violated the First Amendment. In response, the administration froze $2.2 billion in grants and a $60 million contract, but Harvard's stance may embolden other institutions to resist similar pressures.</p>

            <p>Labor groups have filed a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's termination of international labor rights programs aimed at ending child labor and other abuses. The lawsuit argues that the cuts, enacted by Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), were unauthorized by Congress. Critics argue that the decision “puts American workers and American businesses last” by enabling the degradation of labor and business standards abroad. The cuts affect programs related to worker empowerment, agricultural supply chains, and assistance to migrant workers.</p>

            <p>Steve Witkoff, Trump's special envoy, has stated that Iran must completely eliminate its nuclear program, seemingly reversing a previous position that would have allowed low-level uranium enrichment for civilian purposes. This policy shift is likely to complicate negotiations with Tehran and raise the threat of military action. In another change, the next round of US-Iran talks will remain in Oman rather than moving to Italy as proposed. The change comes as the envoy with no diplomatic experience has had a hard time finding consensus.</p>

Some sellers plan to maintain prices to remain competitive, but the added cost of tariffs could potentially force them out of business.</p>

For dedicated music fans, the payment plan offers a way to reserve and pay for a ticket without immediate financial strain.</p>
