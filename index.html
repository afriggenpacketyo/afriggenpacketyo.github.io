          <p>President Trump is scheduled to deliver remarks after the White House revealed Saudi Arabia's commitment to invest $600 billion in various deals with the United States. This announcement follows Trump's visit with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh. A significant part of the agreement includes a nearly $142 billion defense sales deal, providing Saudi Arabia with advanced warfighting equipment and services from over a dozen U.S. defense firms. The White House indicated that this commitment is almost double Saudi Arabia's 2025 defense budget, marking a substantial deepening of U.S.-Saudi economic ties.</p>

          <p>Microsoft announced it is laying off 3% of its employees across all levels, teams, and geographies as part of organizational changes to better position the company in a dynamic marketplace. Despite reporting better-than-expected quarterly results with $25.8 billion in net income and a positive forecast in late April, the company is making these cuts. The move will affect thousands of employees out of Microsoft's 228,000 worldwide workforce. This round of layoffs is likely the largest since the elimination of 10,000 roles in 2023, but unlike previous performance-based cuts, these new job cuts are not related to employee performance.</p>

Donaldson presented a law enforcement report suggesting Phillip's recollection of Combs's words differed from his initial statement to authorities.

Negotiations are ongoing with the National Mediation Board, but a strike could commence as early as May 16, prompting NJ Transit to encourage telecommuting and develop limited alternative bus services.

          <p>A federal court is hearing arguments in a case challenging President Trump's tariffs, marking the first legal test of a key component of his economic agenda. The U.S. Court of International Trade will consider whether Trump exceeded his authority when he imposed steep tariffs on over 180 countries and territories. Five domestic businesses argue that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president the power to issue such sweeping duties. The Department of Justice contends that IEEPA clearly authorizes the president to impose tariffs under specified circumstances.</p>

After Trump's 2016 victory, many Democrats blamed neoliberal economic policies for his win, leading to the adoption of "Bidenomics," which emphasized government intervention. However, working-class voters abandoned Democrats in 2024, prompting economists to question the success of Biden's approach.

          <p>A resentencing hearing for Erik and Lyle Menendez, who were convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, has commenced after months of delays. The hearing will determine whether the brothers, who have served nearly 30 years in prison, should be eligible for parole under California‚Äôs youthful offender law. Defense attorneys argue the brothers acted in self-defense after years of sexual abuse, while prosecutors maintain they killed their parents for financial gain. The current district attorney opposes resentencing, arguing the brothers have not taken full responsibility for the crime.</p>

          <p>General Motors (GM) announced a new "groundbreaking" EV battery technology aimed at reducing costs and boosting the profitability of its largest electric SUVs and trucks. GM plans to use lithium manganese-rich (LMR) prismatic battery cells in full-size electric vehicles like the Chevrolet Silverado and Escalade IQ, starting in 2028. These batteries utilize more prevalent and less expensive minerals, such as manganese, instead of larger amounts of cobalt and nickel. GM anticipates being the first to market with this technology, following Ford's earlier announcement of its own LMR battery plans.</p>

Witty is stepping down immediately for "personal reasons" and will be succeeded by Stephen Hemsley, who previously served as CEO. The company's decision to pull its guidance is partly due to higher medical costs, particularly for new enrollees in private Medicare plans. Witty's tenure included challenges such as government investigations, a cyberattack, higher-than-expected medical costs, and public scrutiny following the murder of a company executive.</p>
