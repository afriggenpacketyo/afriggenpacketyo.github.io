          <p>A wildfire in New Jersey, having burned over 13,000 acres and currently 50% contained, is causing air quality alerts in the New York City region. The Jones Road Fire in Ocean County is expected to grow due to dry conditions and winds, with smoke reaching New York City and Long Island. While not expected to be as intense as the wildfire smoke from Canada in 2023, it can still be dangerous for sensitive groups. Winds are predicted to shift, potentially bringing the smoke back to the region on Friday.</p>

          <p>PepsiCo has revised its earnings forecast due to anticipated volatility from global trade developments and cautious consumer spending. Despite reporting mixed quarterly results with international sales offsetting weaker North American demand, the company is preparing for increased supply chain costs. Volume declines in North American foods and beverages reflect consumers' value-consciousness amid inflationary pressures. PepsiCo plans to address this through multicultural products and improved in-store strategies, while still expecting organic revenue to increase slightly. (not investment advice)</p>

The fire has consumed over 20 square miles and is approximately 50% contained, with evacuations lifted for 5,000 residents. The cause of the fire is under investigation, with dry conditions and low humidity contributing to the blaze. The wildfire is the second-worst in the last two decades for the region, and it has led to a state of emergency declaration.</p>

          <p>Following two U.S. court rulings that Google illegally maintained monopolies in search and digital advertising, experts are urging regulators to break up the company. They argue that Google's dominance stifles competition, undermines journalism, and distorts the digital economy. Meaningful remedies require structural separation, interoperability, and global coordination to prevent future anticompetitive behaviors. The U.S. Justice Department is urging a judge to break up the company to transform the business model and incentives that underpin Google's illegal dominance.</p>

          <p>Ofcom has finalized rules requiring tech firms to enhance protections for children online, including overhauling algorithms and age checks.
