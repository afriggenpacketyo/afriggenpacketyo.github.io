          <p>Wang Xiongfei, a leading European power systems expert, has returned to China to take on a prominent academic role at Tsinghua University. He brings extensive experience, having led over 40 research projects funded by the EU and various corporations, and collaborated with major grid and energy companies. Wang is also involved in designing one of the world's first offshore energy hub islands in Denmark, providing grid protection for European offshore wind farms. His developed software, which automatically measures impedance profiles for energy grid stability, is widely adopted globally. This article highlights his significant contributions to power system technology and his new role in advancing China's grid stability research.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>PBS is cutting approximately 15% of its workforce, totaling over 100 positions, in response to federal funding cuts proposed by Republicans in Congress. CEO Paula Kerger stated the organization faces a 21% revenue hit, forcing difficult choices across all facets of PBS operations, including prior cuts to travel and merit pay. The federal rescission of $1.1 billion over two years for public media and the elimination of a major U.S. Education Department grant are cited as primary causes. This article also notes that other public media stations, like KQED and GBH, have also implemented layoffs, highlighting a broader impact on public broadcasting.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron announced that 26 nations have committed to providing postwar security guarantees for Ukraine, including an international force on land, sea, and air. This pledge aims to prevent future aggression, though troops would not be on the frontline, with some countries offering support externally through training and equipment. The announcement followed a summit where European leaders pressed U.S. President Donald Trump for clarity on American support. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailed the move as a significant step, while Russia's Kremlin rejected the notion of such guarantees, intensifying the ongoing geopolitical tensions surrounding the conflict.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. endured a contentious Senate Finance Committee hearing, clashing with both Democratic and Republican senators over his recent actions. Lawmakers grilled Kennedy on his decision to fire CDC Director Susan Monarez and his controversial new COVID-19 booster eligibility guidelines. Senators accused him of ignorance regarding COVID-19 deaths and of putting public health at risk, while Kennedy defended his decisions by alleging Monarez was untrustworthy. The hearing underscored deep partisan divisions and significant concerns about the leadership and scientific integrity of the CDC under Kennedy's tenure, with some senators calling for his resignation.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom's office reported that President Donald Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, in response to immigration raid protests, cost taxpayers nearly $120 million. The deployment involved over 4,200 National Guard soldiers and 700 Marines, with significant costs for food, pay, and travel. This article highlights Newsom's criticism of the move as 'waste, fraud and abuse,' and references a judge's ruling that the deployment violated federal law. The governor's office emphasized the financial and societal costs, including hardships for soldiers, in an effort to shed light on the impact of such politically motivated deployments.</p>

          <p>The United States has imposed sanctions on three Palestinian human rights organizations—the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, and Al-Haq—for requesting an International Criminal Court (ICC) investigation into Israel's actions in Gaza. These groups had asked the ICC to investigate allegations of genocide, airstrikes on civilian areas, and displacement of the population. This article notes that the ICC later issued arrest warrants for Israeli and Hamas leaders for alleged war crimes. The U.S. sanctions underscore a contentious stance against the ICC's jurisdiction, particularly regarding cases involving Israel and past U.S. military actions.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) Metropolitan Division officers are now providing security for former Vice President Kamala Harris, following President Trump's revocation of her Secret Service protection. This temporary arrangement, which will be city-funded, involves the LAPD assisting the California Highway Patrol until Harris establishes her own security. The move has drawn criticism from the LAPD union, arguing that city resources should not be used for a wealthy individual who can afford private security. This article highlights the political controversy surrounding the decision, with California officials condemning Trump's action as politically motivated and vindictive.</p>

          <p>Nikesh Arora, CEO of Palo Alto Networks, expressed skepticism about the widespread adoption of agentic AI browsers in enterprise settings without robust security controls.

Arora predicted that major tech companies would develop these browsers but warned that their inherent autonomy conflicts with enterprise security requirements. This article highlights the cybersecurity industry's focus on managing access to sensitive information, especially as AI tools become more prevalent and potentially increase credential theft risks.</p>

          <p>Sam Mihara, a 92-year-old survivor, returned to the Heart Mountain Relocation Center in Wyoming to reflect on the painful history of Japanese American internment during World War II. At age nine, Mihara and his family were among over 120,000 Japanese Americans forcibly removed from their homes and imprisoned, losing property and suffering immense anguish. Retired Judge Lance Ito, whose parents met at Heart Mountain, also shared the lasting impact of this 'racist' government action, which he described as an 'American concentration camp.'
