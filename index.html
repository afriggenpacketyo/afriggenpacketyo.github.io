        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is deploying 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to protests over federal immigration enforcement operations. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that President Trump signed a memorandum to address the "lawlessness" in California. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the move as "purposefully inflammatory" and stated that it would only escalate tensions. The deployment follows clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement, raising concerns about the handling of immigration issues and federal-state relations in California. Optimism remains low given the escalation and potential for further conflict.</p>

          <p>An advice columnist addresses a reader's dilemma regarding her husband's interest in ethical non-monogamy. The columnist emphasizes open communication and understanding one's own needs and boundaries within a relationship. Drawing on philosopher Erich Fromm, the advice highlights the importance of freedom and personal growth in love, while cautioning against masochistic self-sacrifice. It's suggested that the couple focus on strengthening their current relationship and addressing any insecurities before considering opening it up, ensuring both partners feel secure and respected. This will allow for a more fulfilling marriage for both partners involved.</p>

          <p>An American Airlines flight from Philadelphia to Naples, Italy, was diverted to Rome after it was determined that the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner was too large to land at Naples Airport. Passengers were then transported by bus from Rome to Naples, a journey of approximately three hours. The airline cited "operational limitations" as the reason for the diversion, with historical flight data showing that a smaller Boeing 787-8 is typically used for this route. American Airlines apologized for the disruption to passengers' travel plans, and the incident has highlighted logistical challenges in air travel.</p>

          <p>This article explores the history of golf's role in the White House, particularly focusing on Donald Trump's approach to the game. Unlike some predecessors who separated official duties from leisure, Trump mixes business with golf, as illustrated by Senator Lindsey Graham's account of Trump's golf days. The article contrasts Trump's style with presidents like Woodrow Wilson, who avoided business talk on the course, and Dwight Eisenhower, who enjoyed golfing with friends but kept it separate from his work. The piece also touches on how public perception of presidential golfing has evolved over time, with some presidents facing criticism for their time spent on the links, while others were praised for maintaining a healthy work-life balance.</p>

It also touches on Gingrich's history of political clashes and unpaid debts, as well as his tendency to take credit for Trump's policies.

          <p>Despite President Trump's goal to revive manufacturing jobs, the aviation industry is struggling to find skilled workers to build and maintain airplanes. The average age of aircraft mechanics is high, with a significant portion nearing retirement, leading to projected shortages. Airlines and manufacturers are trying to attract younger talent by highlighting competitive wages and offering on-the-job training to obtain FAA licenses. While manufacturing jobs are seen as politically important, geographical immobility and competition from other sectors pose challenges in filling the growing demand for skilled aviation technicians.</p>

          <p>The UK's science and technology secretary, Peter Kyle, has called on the police to "embrace change" as the Home Office and Treasury negotiate the upcoming Spending Review. Kyle indicated that while spending on schools and scientific research would increase, police funding might face a squeeze, despite the government having already provided an additional Â£1 billion. Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp expressed concern over potential police number cuts and urged the government to protect their budget. The debate underscores the broader challenges of balancing public service funding with fiscal constraints in the UK.</p>

The article notes that Pell Grants are crucial for financial support and that the cuts would disproportionately affect the lowest-income families. Experts warn that these reductions could force students to drop out or take on more debt, further exacerbating the rising cost of a four-year degree. While the Pell program has faced shortfalls in the past, slashing the award amount is considered an extreme measure, and Congress has typically provided additional funding to address such deficits.</p>

The article contends that these attacks, along with historical events like the Holocaust and persecution in Arab and Muslim countries, have led Jews to seek refuge and self-determination in Israel. It suggests that a rational anti-Zionist movement would focus on making Jews feel welcome outside of Israel, but that current anti-Zionist actions often have the opposite effect.</p>

          <p>A provision in President Trump's spending bill, known as Section 899, is causing concern on Wall Street due to its potential impact on foreign investors. This "revenge tax" would allow the U.S. to impose a tax of up to 20% on foreigners with U.S. investments if their home country levies "unfair foreign taxes" on U.S. companies. Experts warn that this could lead to higher withholding taxes on passive investment income and potentially limit foreign investment in the U.S. The Investment Company Institute has expressed concerns that the provision could deter foreign investment.</p>

          <h2>Chile's Salmon Industry Threatens Indigenous Way of Life, Fishermen Say</h2>

          <p>Indigenous fishermen in Chile are protesting the salmon industry's impact on their traditional way of life. They claim the industry is polluting the fjords and damaging ecosystems, threatening the KawÃ©sqar people's ancestral home. The salmon farming industry, while a major export for Chile, is criticized for using non-native fish and introducing chemicals into the water. Legislation is pending to deem salmon farming incompatible with the KawÃ©sqar way of life, but the economic dependence on the industry complicates the issue.</p>
