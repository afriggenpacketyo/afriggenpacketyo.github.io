          <p>Disorder erupted in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, following a protest regarding an alleged sexual assault. Masked individuals hurled masonry and other projectiles at police, while houses were set ablaze. Jim Allister, a North Antrim MP, characterized the violence as "very distressing," citing "significant demographic change in the area" due to "unfettered immigration" as the context for the demonstration. Two teenage boys, speaking through a Romanian interpreter, appeared in court earlier that day, accused of sexually assaulting a teenage girl, and they are denying the charges. The unrest followed a peaceful march involving hundreds of people earlier in the day.</p>

          <p>American fund managers are lobbying Congress regarding a provision in President Donald Trump's tax bill, known as Section 899, which they fear could prompt foreign investors to withdraw investments from the U.S. The Investment Company Institute (ICI) warns that the bill, intended to penalize foreign-owned firms from countries with "unfair foreign taxes," could inadvertently impact most foreign investments in U.S. stock markets. The ICI argues that foreign investors may retreat from U.S. equities to avoid the tax, leading to capital outflows and harming both U.S. companies and investors. The tax would start at 5% and escalate to a maximum of 20% on top of existing taxes, potentially denting returns for foreign investors in U.S. equities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article discusses how restrictions on international students in the U.S. could compromise its human capital. With two-thirds of tech workers in Silicon Valley being foreign-born and a significant percentage of STEM PhDs being conferred on international students, limiting access to U.S. graduate schools could hamper the talent pool. While overseas applications from China and Europe are decreasing, more American students are exploring academic options abroad. The article suggests that if the intention is to slow China’s technological progress, it may be too late, as many Chinese students who studied abroad have returned to teach at universities in mainland China or Hong Kong.</p>

Bianco stated that the agitators are trying to violently influence political action, which he argues goes against the Constitution.

China, the leader in the critical minerals supply chain, produces roughly 60% of the world's supply of rare earths and processes almost 90%. A British Chambers of Commerce head of trade policy noted that a critical mineral like samarium, essential for F-35 fighter jet construction in the U.S., is affected by the restrictions. Shares of some European defense giants were trading lower ahead of U.S.-China trade negotiations, as rare earth elements play an integral role in modern defense technologies.</p>

Farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi expects the 2020 rice to be sold in stores at 1,700 yen per 5 kilograms. The move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, prompting concerns about emergency preparedness, leading Koizumi to express interest in increasing rice imports. Rice has been in short supply at stores in Japan since last summer, leading to prices doubling compared to the previous year, prompting suspicions of hoarding among wholesalers and farmers.</p>

          <p>Enterprise Products Partners and Enbridge are presented as attractive high-yield energy stocks for conservative dividend investors. Both companies operate in the midstream sector, which involves transporting oil, natural gas, and related products, generating reliable cash flows through a toll-taker model. Enterprise has increased its distribution for 26 consecutive years, while Enbridge has increased its dividend annually for three decades. These market-proven histories indicate their reliability as dividend stocks, even amidst energy sector downturns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent government report indicates that Japan continues to lag behind many other countries in addressing gender inequality, particularly in increasing the representation of women in leadership positions. The report, reviewed by a task force led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, acknowledges that efforts to close the gaps by 2030 remain insufficient. The government set a goal in 2003 to raise the share of women in leadership positions to about 30 percent by 2020, but it has been delayed due to slow progress. The government plans to step up efforts to advance gender equality by ensuring women have more opportunities to participate in decision-making.</p>

          <p>UK companies are holding back on hiring or not replacing departing workers, leading to a decline in job vacancies, according to official figures. The number of available jobs fell by 63,000 between March and May, while the unemployment rate increased. The Office for National Statistics noted a weakening in the labor market and a drop in payroll numbers. Businesses may be reducing headcount and slowing hiring activity to offset rising employment costs, including increased National Insurance Contributions and a rise in the minimum wage.</p>
