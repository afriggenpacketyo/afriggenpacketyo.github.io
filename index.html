          <p>Seventeen police officers were injured during a second night of unrest in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, following a peaceful protest regarding an alleged sexual assault. Protesters threw petrol bombs, bricks, and fireworks at police, resulting in five arrests and a total of 32 officers injured over two nights. Riot officers used baton rounds and a water cannon to disperse the crowds as cars were set on fire and homes damaged. A mother-of-two from Bulgaria stated she was fleeing her home due to the violence and considering moving back to Bulgaria to protect her children, and stickers indicating residents' nationalities have appeared on some homes in the area.</p>

          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials have reached an agreement on a trade framework after high-level talks in London, which now awaits approval from President Trump and President Xi. The agreement aims to implement the Geneva consensus and follows a phone call between the two presidents last week, seeking to stabilize strained relations. If both leaders approve, the framework will be implemented, signaling a commitment to de-escalate trade tensions and continue dialogue. The fact that the two sides will now brief their leaders "is a clear sign that some disagreements or unresolved details still require internal discussion," said Jianwei Xu, senior economist at Natixis.</p>

          <p>An appellate court has ruled that President Trump's wide-reaching tariffs can remain in place until at least the end of July, pending appeal. The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals granted the Trump administration's request to pause a lower court ruling that had blocked the tariffs. The U.S. Court of International Trade previously ruled that many of Trump's tariffs are illegal, leading to the current legal battle. Trump has defended the tariffs as necessary to protect the U.S. against unfair trade practices, but the trade war has faced criticism and rocked markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Downtown Los Angeles remains under curfew for the first time since anti-ICE protests began, prompted by vandalism and looting despite largely peaceful demonstrations. The Trump administration has proceeded with deploying Marines and National Guard troops, asserting their mission is to protect federal facilities and employees, despite objections from state and city officials. The National Guard's role in protecting ICE agents raises concerns about violating Posse Comitatus, which restricts the military from acting as police within the U.S. In related news, an appeal hearing is scheduled for Trump's criminal conviction involving hush money payments made before the 2016 election, though legal experts consider his team's chances of success to be slim.</p>

          <p>Europe's electric vehicle (EV) market is experiencing a recovery in 2025, with registrations of electrified vehicles increasing by 20% from January to April. The rebound is largely attributed to a new EU mandate requiring automakers to cut fleet-wide CO2 emissions by 15% from 2021 levels, spurring corporate sales to avoid hefty fines. Despite this growth, consumer skepticism remains, with interest in EVs stagnant and hybrids favored due to charging concerns. Chinese automakers are also gaining ground, with BYD surpassing Tesla in European sales in April, highlighting the fast-changing dynamics of the European auto market.</p>

The study, presented at the NUTRITION 2025 conference, found that participants who ate chickpeas for 12 weeks experienced a significant reduction in elevated cholesterol. Dr. William W. Li explained that chickpeas improve lipid metabolism and lower inflammation through the gut biome. He suggested various ways to incorporate chickpeas into one's diet, such as roasting them as a snack or stewing them with vegetables, while advising against excessive oil or deep frying to maintain their nutritional benefits.</p>

          <p>Two years after the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam, the landscape in southern Ukraine is undergoing a natural transformation, with lush vegetation and diverse wildlife returning to the exposed basin. The Dnipro River has reformed vast floodplains, resembling the area's pre-dam state from the 1950s, with ecologists noting a significant increase in plant and animal species. However, the future of this ecosystem is uncertain, as Ukraine considers rebuilding the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant, a decision opposed by ecologists who fear it would destroy the newly formed landscape. Engineers argue that rebuilding the plant is vital for supplying water to the region and ensuring the safe operation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.</p>

          <p>UniCredit CEO Andrea Orcel stated that Commerzbank's current share price is too high for a potential takeover offer. UniCredit has built a 28% stake in Commerzbank through derivatives and has the ECB's authorization to hold up to 29.9% in the lender. Orcel indicated that UniCredit would not proceed with an acquisition offer at a premium to Commerzbank's current share value, citing a lack of value for UniCredit's investors. Orcel stressed that UniCredit is presently "far away" from a merger bid with Commerzbank and would first seek a "constructive solution" to opposition from the German government.</p>
