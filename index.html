          <p>Syria's presidency has announced an immediate ceasefire in the southern city of Suweida, aiming to halt a week of violent sectarian clashes between local Bedouin tribesmen and the Druze community. The conflict has resulted in over 700 deaths and drawn in Syrian government forces. The move, supported by the U.S. and neighboring countries, follows an intervention by Israel, which declared its support for the Druze minority and conducted strikes in Damascus.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary is being hailed as a landmark moment for Muslim and South Asian Americans. His campaign successfully built a diverse coalition by focusing on affordability, community organizing, and advocacy for Palestinian rights. Mamdani's rise is seen by many as a sign of growing political power and a challenge to long-standing assumptions about who can represent a major American city, despite facing Islamophobic attacks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has issued a statement cautioning that media reports on the cause of the Air India crash that killed 270 people are "premature and speculative." The warning comes after a preliminary report from India's investigative body raised questions about the plane's engine fuel cutoff switches. This led to widespread but unconfirmed media theories about pilot error or intentional action, which the NTSB says are not yet supported by the ongoing investigation.</p>
