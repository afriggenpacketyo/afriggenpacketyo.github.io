          <p>President Trump continued his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling him a "numbskull" for keeping interest rates high but also indicating he would not attempt to fire him. Trump suggested Powell's term would be over soon, although it officially ends in May 2026. The comments come amid ongoing speculation about Powell's job security and legal questions surrounding the president's authority to remove the central bank leader. The administration is also scrutinizing a multi-billion dollar renovation project at the Fed's Washington buildings, adding another layer of pressure.</p>

          <p>A BBC Verify report examines the extent of the UK's military assistance to Israel amid the conflict in Gaza, noting that while the UK is not a primary arms supplier, it provides key components for F-35 fighter jets used in the conflict. Following the Labour party's rise to power, some arms export licenses were suspended, but parts for the F-35 program were exempted due to their integration into a global supply chain. The article also explores the UK's intelligence sharing, confirming surveillance flights over Gaza for hostage location purposes, and the training of a small number of IDF personnel in the UK on non-combat academic courses.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence stocks, including major players like Nvidia and Broadcom, experienced a downturn following reports that the Stargate AI project between Softbank and OpenAI is facing difficulties. The initial $100 billion investment plan has reportedly been scaled back, raising concerns about the pace of AI capital expenditure. Despite the market dip, Morgan Stanley has identified Eaton, Eli Lilly, and Nvidia as companies they are confident in ahead of their earnings reports. Analysts cite strong demand for AI chips and pricing power as key strengths for these firms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has moved to start the August recess early, a decision aimed at preventing votes on Democratic-supported motions to release Department of Justice files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Johnson accused Democrats of playing "political games" and argued that forcing a quick release could harm victims, stating the DOJ is already handling the matter. The move sidelines several legislative items and comes amid increasing public and political pressure for transparency in the Epstein case. A bipartisan effort to force a vote on the files is expected to resume when Congress returns in September.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK High Court has ruled that the estate of deceased tech tycoon Mike Lynch and his former business partner, Sushovan Hussain, owe Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) £700 million. The ruling stems from HPE's 2011 acquisition of Lynch's firm, Autonomy, with the court finding that the company's finances were misrepresented, causing HPE to overpay. Lynch, who died in a yachting accident last year after being acquitted of separate fraud charges in the US, had prepared a statement calling HPE's claim a "wild overstatement." A further hearing will determine the final damages and consider a potential appeal from Lynch's estate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article explores the nature of comedy and censorship in the current political climate, arguing that the concept of what is funny has become deeply intertwined with political power. The author posits that under the Trump administration, "comedy is legal again" has come to mean that humor is sanctioned only when it aligns with the president's views, while criticism is met with hostility. Using the cancellation of Stephen Colbert's show and commentary from Greg Gutfeld as examples, the piece suggests that today's permissible comedy often relies on punching down. It concludes that laughter can be a tool of either recognition or coercion, with the latter defining an era where humor's punchline is something people are afraid to become.</p>

          <p>Louisville's Democratic Mayor, Craig Greenberg, has altered the city's policy on federal immigration detainers after the Department of Justice threatened legal action. The city's previous practice did not honor the 48-hour hold requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), leading to its potential designation as a "sanctuary jurisdiction." To avoid litigation and the potential loss of federal funding, Greenberg announced Louisville will now comply with the 48-hour detainers. Attorney General Pam Bondi highlighted the move as an example for other cities, stating the DOJ will sue non-compliant jurisdictions to enforce federal immigration laws.</p>

          <p>An ER doctor argues in this opinion piece that the projected $1 trillion cut to Medicaid over the next decade will destabilize the entire U.S. emergency medicine system, impacting both uninsured and insured patients. The 1986 law mandating emergency care for all, regardless of ability to pay, is an unfunded mandate, and a surge in uninsured patients will increase uncompensated care costs for hospitals. This financial burden is expected to lead to more service reductions and hospital closures, particularly in rural areas where institutions are heavily reliant on Medicaid reimbursement. The author contends that the cuts will ultimately result in sicker patients and higher systemic costs.</p>

This analysis explores the potential consequences, predicting that over 3 million Americans could lose their benefits as states, many with balanced budget requirements, struggle to absorb the new costs. The bill also tightens eligibility requirements, such as raising the working age for recipients.

Officials emphasized that such attacks are extremely rare, with only two recorded fatalities from mountain lions in Washington over the past century, and commended the father's heroic intervention.</p>

          <p>The head of Gaza City's Al-Shifa hospital reported that 21 children have died from malnutrition and starvation across the territory in the last 72 hours, a stark indicator of the deepening humanitarian crisis. This comes as the UN warns that Gaza's "last lifelines are collapsing," with hospitals overwhelmed and unable to treat the growing number of malnutrition cases. The UN human rights office stated these deaths are a direct result of Israel's interference with humanitarian assistance. The report highlights the severe conditions as food stocks deplete following a breakdown in ceasefire talks and continued restrictions on aid delivery.</p>

          <p>The United States has announced its intention to withdraw from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), effective December 2026. The State Department cited the organization's support for "woke, divisive cultural and social causes" and its "anti-Israel rhetoric" as reasons for the departure. UNESCO's Director General, Audrey Azoulay, called the decision "regrettable" but noted it was anticipated, and stated the agency has been diversifying its funding sources. This marks the second time the U.S. has left UNESCO, having previously withdrawn under President Trump's first term before rejoining under the Biden administration.</p>

The move has angered Welsh Conservatives, with their Senedd leader saying voters will feel "very let down." This follows a trend of growing support for Reform in polls and the recent defection of a former Conservative Welsh Secretary, signaling a significant political shift in the region ahead of the next Senedd election.</p>

          <p>This opinion column analyzes the cancellation of "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert," arguing it signifies a larger shift in media consumption rather than just a political or financial decision. While the right celebrates and the left laments the show's end as a political act, the author suggests the underlying cause is the death of mass-market, monolithic media. In an era of streaming, podcasts, and niche platforms, the traditional late-night model, built for a time with fewer viewing options, is no longer financially viable. The piece concludes that media is now an a la carte experience, making it impossible for any single host to capture the broad, cross-political audience of past television titans.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article clarifies the concept of grace periods for credit card payments, noting a common misunderstanding among consumers. Most credit cards offer a grace period on new purchases, which is the time between the end of a billing cycle and the due date, during which no interest is charged if the balance is paid in full. However, this does not typically extend to late payments; once a due date is missed, fees and penalty APRs can be applied immediately. While some issuers may offer a brief, informal window before applying penalties, it is not guaranteed. The article advises consumers to contact their issuer immediately if they anticipate being late.</p>

The talks include proposals for repatriation centers outside the EU and more rigorous deportations to countries with fragile security situations.

CEO Mary Barra stated the company is working to "greatly reduce" its tariff exposure through manufacturing adjustments and cost initiatives.
