          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James received a standing ovation at a rally for NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, her first public appearance since her federal indictment on bank fraud charges. James remained defiant in her remarks, stating she would not capitulate and that her campaign has raised significant funds since the charges were announced. The charges stem from a house purchase in Virginia, which she has dismissed as "baseless," with her first court appearance scheduled for late October.</p>

          <p>Swiss author Dorothee Elmiger has been awarded the prestigious 2025 German Book Prize for her novel "Die Holländerinnen" ("The Dutch Women"). The novel follows a theater group's journey into the South American rainforest, which descends into disorientation and chaos, exploring themes of violence and fear. The jury praised the work as a "fascinating journey into the heart of darkness." The prize, endowed with €25,000, is one of the most significant literary awards for German-language authors.</p>

          <p>The UK government is under pressure after prosecutors dropped charges against two men accused of spying for China just weeks before their trial. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) stated the case collapsed because it could not obtain necessary evidence from the government officially designating China as a national security threat at the time of the alleged offenses. The decision has sparked a political dispute, with the Conservative opposition accusing the Labour government of withholding evidence, a claim the government denies.</p>

          <p>Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) has initiated a new investigation into exiled Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky, accusing him of creating a "terrorist organization." The charges are linked to his support for the Anti-War Committee of Russia, a group banned by the Kremlin. More than 20 other prominent dissidents, including Garry Kasparov and Vladimir Kara-Murza, are also being investigated, a move Khodorkovsky claims is retaliation for a new dialogue platform with European lawmakers.</p>

One study of historical data found that 90% of such U-turns result in restored or improved democracy. However, a second study focusing on more recent cases found that nearly 90% of these recoveries are short-lived, with countries often backsliding again within five years, suggesting a pattern of "democratic careening" that could define America's future.</p>

          <p>While President Trump has declared peace in the Middle East following the signing of a Gaza ceasefire agreement, analysts caution that the path to lasting stability is fragile. The 20-point plan, which secured the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, is seen as a significant achievement but lacks crucial details on long-term issues. Key challenges include the demilitarization of Hamas, the withdrawal of Israeli forces, and the unresolved question of a two-state solution, leading experts to view it more as a "survival pact" for leaders than a comprehensive peace deal.</p>

          <p>A nonpartisan watchdog group, led by former federal ethics officials from both Democratic and Republican administrations, is calling for a Justice Department investigation into the prosecutions of James Comey and Letitia James. In a letter to the DOJ's inspector general, the group alleges that the indictments were pursued to fulfill President Trump's "longstanding personal vendetta" against his political critics. They argue the cases represent "egregious examples of vindictive and meritless prosecution," pointing to the timing of the charges and the replacement of the U.S. attorney who initially declined to prosecute.</p>

          <p>As Disney prepares to name a successor to CEO Bob Iger, the board has reportedly considered a co-CEO structure, potentially elevating both Dana Walden and Josh D'Amaro. While this model has been successful at companies like Netflix, experts and insiders warn it could be problematic for Disney due to its famously political corporate culture and recent history of a fraught power-sharing arrangement between Iger and his previous successor, Bob Chapek. The lack of a controlling shareholder to act as a tiebreaker and Iger's own reputation for being reluctant to cede control present significant challenges.</p>

          <p>This analysis argues that the Western narrative portraying Vladimir Putin as an omniscient and perpetually winning leader is a dangerous myth that overestimates his strength. Despite recent provocations like drone incursions into NATO airspace, Putin's regime is facing significant challenges, including a stalled war in Ukraine, a loss of influence in neighboring countries, and a domestic economy showing clear signs of strain. The article contends that by amplifying Putin's threats and posturing, the West does his propaganda work for him, ignoring the reality of his strategic failures.</p>

          <p>This article revisits the 1929 stock market crash through the experience of Charles Mitchell, chairman of National City Bank, highlighting the era's parallels with today. The 1920s saw the birth of a modern consumer economy fueled by credit, creating a collective delusion of endless optimism and wealth that masked deep economic imbalances. The story of Mitchell's desperate, secret efforts to save his bank during the crash serves as a cautionary tale about how debt, unchecked speculation, and the flawed decisions of powerful individuals can lead to catastrophic financial crises.</p>
