          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 08:47:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>JPMorgan Chase announced second-quarter financial results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, driven by strong performance in fixed income trading and investment banking. The bank reported earnings of $5.24 per share on $45.68 billion in revenue, topping estimates despite a 17% decline in net income compared to the previous year, which had been inflated by a gain on Visa shares. CEO Jamie Dimon highlighted the U.S. economy's resilience but also reiterated warnings about risks from trade policy, geopolitical conditions, and high fiscal deficits. The bank's trading operations capitalized on market turbulence, with fixed income trading revenue jumping 14%.</p>

          <p>Citigroup reported stronger-than-expected second-quarter earnings, with revenue from its markets and banking divisions showing significant growth. The bank posted earnings of $1.96 per share on $21.67 billion in revenue, surpassing analyst forecasts and reflecting a 25% increase in net income from the same period last year. CEO Jane Fraser highlighted that the markets division had its best second quarter since 2020, while banking revenues rose 18%. However, the bank also increased its allowance for credit losses, citing a deterioration in the economic outlook compared to the previous year.</p>

          <p>The annual inflation rate in the United States rose to 2.7% in June, an increase from May's 2.4%, as the effects of President Trump's tariffs began to influence consumer prices. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) report indicated that core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, also saw a slight uptick to 2.9%. While inflation remains significantly lower than its peak three years ago, the recent price increases appear to have halted its previous downward trend. Economists note that Americans now face the highest average tariff rate since 1933, creating ongoing economic pressure.</p>

Key players like Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho are still with the team, limiting the funds available for new signings and creating uncertainty around the club's transfer strategy. So far, the only major addition has been Matheus Cunha from Wolves. The article analyzes the difficulties in selling high-earning players and explores whether United might need to consider selling other assets to finance further deals before the transfer window closes.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has issued a temporary block on the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of people from Afghanistan. The administration had intended to end the deportation protections and work permits, arguing that the security situation in Afghanistan had improved. However, advocacy groups sued, contending that the country remains unsafe and that the decision was part of a broader anti-immigrant agenda. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling provides a one-week pause, giving both sides time to file briefs on the case, which affects approximately 11,700 Afghans currently enrolled in the program.</p>

The author, Arwa Mahdawi, satirically questions Patel's qualifications, which include writing a children's book trilogy portraying Trump as a king battling political enemies.

          <p>Recent statements and actions from President Trump indicate a significant shift in his approach to Russia, moving closer to the more confrontational stance of his predecessor. After expressing frustration with Vladimir Putin, Trump has now threatened 100% tariffs on Russia and its trading partners and has pledged to continue weapon shipments to ensure Ukraine can defend itself. This evolution is notable, as critics have long suggested Trump was sympathetic to Russian aims. However, this analysis points out that even his first administration was often at odds with Moscow on key geopolitical issues, despite the president's public expressions of admiration for Putin.</p>

In response, the government initiated a covert evacuation program, codenamed Operation Rubific, and obtained an unprecedented superinjunction to prevent the media from reporting on it.

The fire, ignited by lightning, was initially allowed to burn for days under a "confine and contain" strategy before hot, windy conditions caused it to grow explosively. Arizona's governor has called for a federal investigation into the decision-making process, questioning why the fire was managed as a controlled burn during the hottest part of summer.

          <p>To encourage the transition away from petrol and diesel vehicles, the UK government is introducing a grant scheme that will offer discounts of up to £3,750 on new electric cars. The grants, funded by a £650 million scheme available for three years, will apply to eligible vehicles costing up to £37,000. Carmakers can apply for funding, and the discount will be applied directly at the dealership, simplifying the process for consumers. This initiative is part of the government's push to meet its 2030 ban on the sale of new fossil fuel-powered cars, though some critics argue the country still lacks sufficient charging infrastructure.</p>

          <h2>Review Explores How Linn Ullmann's Novel 'Girl, 1983' Embraces Memory and Forgetting</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A review in The Atlantic explores Norwegian author Linn Ullmann's latest novel, "Girl, 1983," which challenges traditional memoir conventions by centering on the act of forgetting. The book's narrator attempts to reconstruct a painful adolescent memory of a relationship with an older photographer, but finds the story is composed more of absences than clear recollections. The article notes the novel's strong autobiographical parallels to Ullmann's own life as the daughter of Ingmar Bergman and Liv Ullmann. By labeling the deeply personal work a novel, Ullmann subverts genre expectations and suggests that all autobiography is a form of fiction shaped by the unreliable nature of memory.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy reversal, the Trump administration has granted Nvidia approval to sell its advanced H20 computer chips to China, which are crucial for developing artificial intelligence. CEO Jensen Huang confirmed the decision, stating that licenses will be granted and shipments could begin soon, a move seen as vital for American companies to compete in the dynamic Chinese market. This decision comes after a previous ban on such sales announced in April and follows lobbying efforts by tech leaders who argued the restrictions hindered U.S. competitiveness. The news, which is expected to provide a substantial revenue boost for Nvidia, caused the company's shares to rise.</p>

          <p>A beach restaurant on the Greek island of Mykonos, DK Oyster, is once again facing backlash from tourists over claims of exorbitant pricing. A recent reviewer alleged they were charged €1,000 for just three dishes, while another claimed their party was billed nearly €400 for a handful of drinks after being lured in with an offer of free sunbeds. TripAdvisor has placed a safety alert on the restaurant's page due to numerous media reports and complaints. The owner has dismissed the claims as false, suggesting they are part of a pressure campaign by "notorious 'influencers'" seeking free meals.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent wave of tariff threats against dozens of countries, including major trading partners like the EU and Mexico, has created significant uncertainty for U.S. businesses and consumers. Economists note that with an August 1st deadline looming, the ambiguity of whether these threats will become policy leaves companies in a "dense fog," unable to plan effectively. The administration defends the tariffs as a tool for ensuring fair trade and advancing other policy goals, pointing to a recent increase in customs revenue. However, experts argue that few comprehensive trade deals have been secured, leaving the economy in a prolonged state of unpredictability. (not investment advice)</p>

This decision allows for massive cuts to proceed, which could result in the loss of approximately 1,400 jobs and disrupt services that support students with disabilities and those in poverty. Opponents had sued to block the move, arguing that the department was created by law and cannot be shut down by the president without congressional action.

          <p>An analytical article from The Atlantic argues that the Trump administration's overhaul of FEMA is violating fundamental principles of emergency management, as demonstrated by the response to recent Texas flash floods. The administration's push to create a "lean, deployable disaster force" has resulted in a delayed and smaller-than-expected federal response, with critical rescue teams not authorized for over 72 hours. Critics note that an active disaster is not the time for experimental changes to established protocols. With a quarter of FEMA's staff having left since January, the agency is described as starved and hobbled rather than lean and effective.</p>

The threats, which include 100% tariffs on countries trading with Russia if a ceasefire isn't reached in 50 days, came as Trump expressed frustration with Vladimir Putin's continued aggression.
