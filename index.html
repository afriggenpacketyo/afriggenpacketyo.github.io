          <p>Cava, a Mediterranean restaurant chain, announced strong fiscal quarter sales, surpassing expectations with a 10.8% increase in same-store sales, driven by higher traffic and premium item purchases. This performance contrasts with other fast-casual chains like Chipotle and Sweetgreen, which have reported declines in transactions and same-store sales, indicating a shift in consumer dining habits. Cava's CFO noted that diners are trading up from fast food and down from casual dining, benefiting the chain. Despite the positive results, Cava maintained its conservative same-store sales forecast of a 6% to 8% increase for the fiscal year, causing its stock to dip slightly in extended trading.

          <p>Alibaba's shares experienced a significant drop of over 7% after the company reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that fell short of analyst expectations for both revenue and net income. While revenue increased by 7% year-on-year, the net income, though 279% higher year-on-year, did not meet the anticipated targets, partly due to losses from subsidiary disposals. The company faces macroeconomic volatility in China, influenced by trade tensions with the U.S., which has affected consumer sentiment. Despite efforts to boost sales through partnerships and investments in instant commerce, Alibaba is navigating an intense price war with competitors in the Chinese e-commerce market.

          <p>House Republicans are proposing a bill to make the $2,000 child tax credit permanent and increase it to $2,500 from 2025 through 2028. However, the plan faces criticism for not addressing the needs of the 17 million children currently excluded from the credit and for requiring both parents to have Social Security numbers, potentially impacting 4.5 million children. The current child tax credit provides up to $2,000 per child under 17, with a portion being refundable for low-income families, and phases out for higher-income earners. Middle-income families are expected to benefit most from the proposed changes.</p>

Rubio indicated that the administration would initially issue temporary waivers on some sanctions, allowing American dollars to flow into the country and enabling neighboring countries to fund reconstruction.

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson is working to unify House Republicans on a bill encompassing President Trump's legislative agenda, addressing key sticking points related to Medicaid and tax reform. Johnson aims to reach a consensus on the SALT caps, with moderates opposing the proposed $30,000 limit on state and local tax deductions. Despite the challenges, Johnson remains committed to passing the bill by Memorial Day. The effort is a crucial test of Johnson's leadership as he navigates divisions within his conference.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments regarding President Trump's request to roll back nationwide injunctions blocking his executive order to end birthright citizenship. The court is set to decide whether Trump can limit U.S. citizenship to children born on American soil to lawful permanent residents. The case also addresses the legality of individual judges blocking presidential policies nationwide. Justices expressed concerns about the impact of eliminating nationwide injunctions, with some suggesting it could lead to prolonged enforcement of unlawful orders before the Supreme Court can intervene.</p>
