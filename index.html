          <p>Stock trading app eToro experienced a significant surge in its Nasdaq debut, with shares popping 30% after pricing its IPO above the expected range, raising nearly $310 million. The Israel-based company sold almost six million shares at $52 each, valuing the company at roughly $4.2 billion. This IPO is being closely watched as a sign of renewed interest in IPOs after a period of market correction due to tariff concerns. EToro's CEO, Yoni Assia, expressed optimism about the market stabilizing and the company's growing business in cryptocurrencies, with crypto assets contributing a significant portion of its trading revenue.

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a lawsuit against Capital One, alleging that the bank misled customers by failing to inform them about higher interest rates available in its "360 Performance Savings" product while freezing the rates of its existing "360 Savings" accounts. The suit claims that Capital One's actions resulted in New York customers missing out on millions of dollars in interest payments as interest rates rose in 2022. This legal action mirrors a similar suit dropped by the CFPB under the Trump administration, and Capital One has stated it will vigorously defend itself against the claims.</p>

          <p>Joseph Nye, the influential international affairs scholar who coined the term "soft power," has passed away at the age of 88. Nye's concept of soft power, which emphasizes influence through culture, aid, and diplomacy rather than military force, gained prominence in foreign policy circles worldwide. Throughout his career, Nye served in various government roles under Presidents Carter and Clinton, and was a vocal critic of Donald Trump's approach to foreign policy, which he believed undermined essential institutions of soft power. His work has had a lasting impact on how international relations are understood and practiced.</p>

The company has been increasingly relying on advertising to boost the profitability of its streaming products, since the ad-supported plan was first introduced in November 2022. Netflix's ad-supported plan costs $7.99 per month, a steep discount from its least expensive ad-free plan, at $17.99 per month. The company also reported that its cheapest tier reaches more 18- to 34-year-olds than any U.S. broadcast or cable network.</p>

Offenders serving one to four years who are recalled to prison for breaching their licenses, will be released after 28 days. The Justice Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, said a Â£4.7bn investment would fund more prisons, but said it would not be possible to "build our way out of this crisis".

She testified that Combs allegedly provided stimulant drugs, like cocaine, to keep participants awake for the length of his "freak offs," and she also testified about a time when she requested ketamine, an anesthetic that has been used recreationally for its hallucinogenic and dissociative effects. Ventura recounted a 2016 hotel altercation where Combs allegedly attacked her, and described feeling disgusted and humiliated by the "freak offs," but fearing the consequences of disobeying Combs.</p>

Despite claims that these requirements promote fairness and incentivize employment, studies have shown that they fail to increase employment and instead create complex reporting demands that lead eligible recipients to lose their healthcare. The article argues that the true goal of these requirements is to reduce Medicaid spending by denying coverage to eligible individuals, rather than helping people find employment.</p>

          <p>The head of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and several teams at the agency have had their layoff notices rescinded, and some worker safety programs are being restored. The reinstatements came a day before Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was scheduled to testify before Congress about the layoffs. While some NIOSH programs may resume, many workers remain effectively laid-off, and other parts of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also remain off the job.</p>
