          <p>Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo conceded to Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist state assemblyman, in the New York City mayoral Democratic primary, marking a significant upset.

In his concession speech, Cuomo acknowledged Mamdani's victory and indicated he would consider his next steps. If elected, Mamdani would be the first Muslim and Indian American mayor of New York City, a city that is known as the nation's largest.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang called for international collaboration on trade, cautioning against turning trade into political or security issues. Speaking at the World Economic Forum's annual "Summer Davos" event in Dalian, China, Li emphasized that globalization is irreversible and that engaging in the international economy is a way of reshaping the rules and order. He did not specifically address U.S. tensions or the Israel-Iran conflict during his address.

          <p>A controversial Republican plan to sell off millions of acres of public lands in Western states, including California, was removed from a tax and spending bill due to Senate rules violations. Senator Mike Lee's proposal aimed to sell up to 3.3 million acres of U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management land to address housing needs. The Senate parliamentarian determined the proposal violated the Byrd Rule, which prevents extraneous budget provisions in reconciliation bills. Environmentalists and public land advocates celebrated the decision, though Senator Lee indicated he would continue to pursue the plan with revisions.</p>

          <p>Satellite imagery from Maxar Technologies reveals significant damage at Iran's key nuclear sites, including Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan, following U.S. airstrikes. The images show craters at the entrances to tunnel complexes and destruction of perimeter buildings at Fordow, while the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center also shows signs of damage. At Natanz, craters believed to be caused by U.S. ordnance are visible, targeting underground centrifuge halls. IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi confirmed that key buildings and underground systems at all three sites were hit, and American officials claim the strikes have severely set back Iran’s nuclear program.</p>

          <p>The New York City Democratic mayoral primary features a battle between left-wing outsider Zohran Mamdani and former Governor Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani, a democratic socialist, has gained support with a platform focused on affordability, including free public buses and universal childcare. Cuomo, seeking a political comeback after a sexual harassment scandal, emphasizes his experience and moderate stance. The race is seen as a proxy war between the left-wing and moderate factions of the Democratic Party, with implications for the party nationally as it tries to take on Trump, who has made inroads in the city.</p>

          <p>An initial classified assessment indicates that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities have set back Tehran's nuclear program by several months, but did not completely destroy it. The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) found that the entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities, including Fordow, were sealed off, but the underground enrichment infrastructure remains largely intact. The assessment suggests it could take Iran a few months to less than a year to regain access to the facilities. The White House has disputed the findings, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt calling the assessment "flat-out wrong."</p>

The bears were continuously monitored and successfully returned to their enclosure by keepers using recall training.

          <p>The FBI is sharpening its focus on counter-terrorism efforts following U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. In the wake of the strikes, US immigration officials arrested 11 Iranian citizens in the US, including men with alleged ties to Iran's military and paramilitary proxy groups. The FBI has also shifted some of its agents, who have been helping on immigration-related cases, back to counter-terrorism efforts. While authorities have not suggested any of those arrested were involved or linked to a specific plot in the US, officials across the US are on heightened alert.</p>

          <p>Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff condemned the leak of an initial intelligence assessment regarding the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, calling it "treasonous." The assessment, which concluded that the strikes did not completely destroy Iran's nuclear program, was leaked to the press. Witkoff also assured that the ceasefire between Israel and Iran is holding and dismissed concerns that Iran could resume its nuclear enrichment program within months, saying it's "not even conceivable."</p>

          <p>Chinese astronomers have used the slowing spin of stars nearing the end of their lives to look into the Milky Way’s past and find that stars born today spin much faster than those formed billions of years ago. Researchers studied thousands of stars and found that as the Milky Way evolved, newly formed stars began spinning up to 10 times faster than their older counterparts. That extra spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to take shape. The study presents the first direct evidence that the galaxy’s star-forming clouds have grown more turbulent over time.</p>
