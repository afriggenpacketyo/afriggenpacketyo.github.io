Former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton was sworn in as the new interim top prosecutor for the New York office after several other prosecutors resigned after Sassoon, who accused the department of a 'quid pro quo'.</p>

          <p>The FDA announced plans to phase out eight synthetic food dyes from the U.S. food supply by the end of next year, following pressure from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. This decision follows growing concerns about the adverse neurobehavioral effects of these dyes, particularly in children. The FDA aims to collaborate with food companies to transition to natural alternatives, though the specifics of enforcement remain unclear. The Consumer Brands Association indicated its members would cooperate, citing the difficulty of adhering to differing state laws regarding food dyes.</p>

Some offices on the chopping block include those focused on energy resources, conflict stabilization, international religious freedoms, and global women’s issues.
