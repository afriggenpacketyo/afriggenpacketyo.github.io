          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 13:26:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the complexities of deciding when to claim Social Security benefits, weighing the pros and cons of different ages. Claiming at 62 results in a permanently reduced monthly payment, while waiting until full retirement age (66-67) provides the standard benefit. Delaying until age 70 can significantly boost payments by about 8% annually, offering a larger guaranteed income for those who can afford to wait. The best choice ultimately depends on individual financial needs, health, and other retirement income sources, with strategies like using annuities or 401(k) funds to bridge the gap.

          <p>Danish renewable energy company Ørsted has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration following an abrupt order to halt construction on its nearly completed Revolution Wind farm. The project, located off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut, was 80% finished and expected to power over 350,000 homes. Ørsted's lawsuit claims the stop-work order is unlawful and arbitrary, suggesting it is a pretext for President Trump's known hostility towards wind power. The administration cited national security concerns, but the project had already passed extensive environmental and safety reviews over a decade.</p>

          <p>Chelsea has secured a club-record deal, valued at just under £1 million, to sign 20-year-old American forward Alyssa Thompson from Angel City. Thompson, a highly-regarded talent on the global stage, has completed her medical and is set to sign a five-year contract. This transfer surpasses Chelsea's previous record for signing defender Naomi Girma but does not break the Women's Super League record. The signing is a significant boost for Chelsea's attack, which has recently been weakened by injuries to key players Mayra Ramirez and Lauren James.</p>

Health officials have reported 28 suspected cases and 15 deaths, with the first case identified as a pregnant woman hospitalized on August 20. The World Health Organization (WHO) is deploying an expert response team and delivering two metric tons of medical supplies, including personal protective equipment. The WHO has warned that case numbers are likely to rise, though the country has experience and a stockpile of 2,000 vaccine doses to combat the virus.</p>

          <p>The European Union's move to ratify a free-trade agreement with the Mercosur bloc (Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay) is drawing criticism from both agricultural groups and climate activists. The deal, negotiated over 25 years, aims to create a massive trade zone by lifting over 90% of tariffs, but farmers fear unfair competition from South American imports like beef and poultry. Environmental groups warn it could accelerate deforestation in the Amazon. To speed up ratification, the European Commission has structured it as a 'split agreement,' which some critics argue bypasses democratic oversight at the national level.</p>

The alliance plans to issue coordinated health recommendations based on guidance from established medical groups, potentially creating state policies that conflict with federal ones.

          <p>Aid organizations are sounding the alarm over a deepening humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza as Israel escalates its military offensive and tightens restrictions on aid delivery. With the health system collapsed and famine conditions declared in northern Gaza, Israel has halted all aid to Gaza City and is implementing new registration rules that could shut down non-compliant NGOs. These rules require personal data on all staff, a demand most groups have rejected over safety concerns. The World Health Organization warns that if these NGOs, which form the 'backbone' of healthcare, are forced to cease operations, the system will be severely compromised, putting countless more lives at risk.</p>

The administration federalized the D.C. police and sent troops as part of a nationwide crime crackdown, a move the lawsuit calls an unprecedented violation of democratic principles.

          <p>The case of Linda Stermer, a Michigan woman convicted in 2010 for the murder of her husband, Todd Stermer, continues its complex legal journey. In 2007, Todd died from severe burns after a house fire, and Linda, who escaped, ran him over with a van, an act she claims was an accident. Her sons testified against her, believing she intentionally set the fire and ran him down. After serving nearly nine years of a life sentence, a federal judge overturned her conviction in 2018 due to prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective counsel. The state has refiled murder charges, and Stermer is now facing a second trial.</p>

          <p>In his 'Morning Meeting,' Jim Cramer analyzed the market's positive reaction to a weaker-than-expected private sector jobs report, which has increased expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut. He also addressed an analyst downgrade of Texas Roadhouse, which was moved to a hold rating due to concerns over rising beef prices. Cramer advised against the restaurant raising menu prices to offset costs, suggesting they could profit significantly if commodity prices fall. He stated he would only consider buying back shares of the Club-held stock if the price drops below the $168 per share mark. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Texas is poised to sign a new law that empowers private citizens to sue out-of-state manufacturers or distributors of abortion medication supplied to Texas residents. Under the legislation, successful plaintiffs, including the pregnant woman's relatives, can receive at least $100,000 in damages. This law is seen by opponents as an attempt to intimidate providers in other states, especially those with 'shield laws' designed to protect them from out-of-state prosecution. With medication abortions accounting for nearly two-thirds of all abortions in the U.S., the Texas law is expected to face significant legal challenges and could escalate interstate conflicts over abortion access.</p>

          <p>Jessie Lovette, a 78-year-old resident of Miami Gardens, has finally received her birth certificate for the first time in her life. Born at home in Georgia during the segregation era, she was never issued official documentation, which became a significant problem with the implementation of the federal Real ID law. Without a birth certificate, she could not prove her citizenship or obtain a compliant ID. After a lengthy legal process initiated by her son, Derrick, and aided by local media attention, the family successfully secured the vital document, allowing Lovette to obtain her Real ID.</p>

The average rate on a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage also decreased, falling to 5.6%.

The issue began with her 2025 purchase of a flat in Hove, East Sussex, for which she was advised she only needed to pay the standard rate of stamp duty. Following media reports questioning her tax payment, Rayner commissioned a legal review, which concluded she should have paid the higher rate applicable to additional properties. She has since admitted the error, attributing it to faulty initial legal advice, and referred herself for an investigation by the prime minister's ethics adviser.</p>
