          <h2>Federal Reserve Lowers Economic Growth Forecast, Raises Inflation Projection</h2>

          <p>The Federal Reserve reduced its economic growth outlook to 1.7% for 2025, down from 2.1% in December, while simultaneously increasing its inflation projection to 2.8%.  This suggests a potential stagflation scenario, with the Fed maintaining its expectation of two rate cuts this year despite the heightened inflation concerns.  The increased uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook is attributed to President Trump's trade policies.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's decision to maintain interest rates at 4.25%-4.5% will likely keep borrowing costs high, impacting credit cards, loans, and auto financing.
