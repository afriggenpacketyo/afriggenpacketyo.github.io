The company reiterated its full-year guidance, projecting at least 5% revenue growth at constant currency and $13.5 billion in free cash flow. CEO Arvind Krishna emphasized the importance of economic growth and rational regulation. The stock initially slipped in extended trading due to near-term economic uncertainty, as clients are prioritizing efficient spending and the preservation of cash. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly considering exemptions for automakers from some tariffs imposed by his administration, including those on auto parts from China and levies on steel and aluminum. This potential move follows lobbying efforts from automakers and auto policy groups seeking relief from the accumulating tariffs. While autos were previously exempted from reciprocal geographical tariffs, the industry still faces levies on steel, aluminum, and imported vehicles. The decision comes as the automotive industry navigates increasing cost pressures from the existing tariffs.</p>
