          <p>The United States and Iran have commenced in-depth negotiations in Oman regarding Iran's rapidly advancing nuclear program, with the focus likely centering on uranium enrichment. These talks, mediated by Omani officials, aim to limit Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. President Trump, who is in Rome for Pope Francis's funeral, has repeatedly threatened military action if a deal isn't reached, while Iranian officials have warned they could pursue nuclear weapons. Experts from both sides will be involved in negotiating the details of a potential agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that he would not reduce tariffs on China unless the country provides something "substantial" in return. Speaking on Air Force One, Trump indicated his desire for China to be more open to U.S. businesses and products. He emphasized that he wants the ability for the U.S. to sell its goods in China, which he believes would be a significant win. Trump's stance suggests continued pressure on China to address trade imbalances and open its markets further.</p>

          <p>The funeral of Pope Francis is expected to be a significant gathering of world leaders, creating opportunities for informal diplomatic discussions. While formal meetings are unlikely due to the solemn nature of the event, diplomats anticipate "brush-by" conversations among leaders. Attention will be focused on whether Presidents Trump and Zelensky will use the occasion to discuss the conflict in Ukraine, though seating arrangements may keep them apart. The presence of leaders subject to European travel sanctions is also noted, as Vatican City is considered neutral territory.</p>

          <p>President Trump's attacks on the media, including barring reporters and attempting to defund publicly funded outlets, are testing the limits of press freedom in the U.S. While some outlets have fought back and won legal battles, free speech advocates warn that the First Amendment requires active defense. Trump's actions are seen as part of a wider strategy to control the public narrative, which critics argue is at odds with democratic principles. The situation has raised concerns about the rise of misinformation and threats to democratic stability.</p>

It also addresses single-sex associations and schools, emphasizing the need to provide alternative facilities for transgender individuals.

          <p>A seven-year-old boy named Elliott discovered Jurassic-era fossils in his garden in Matlock, Derbyshire. Elliott unearthed limestone rocks containing the fossils while working in the front garden of his new home. Experts believe the fossils, dating back 140 to 180 million years, were likely brought to the garden from Dorset by collectors or builders. The fossils include ammonites, which are spiral-shelled molluscs that lived during the time of the dinosaurs. The discovery has inspired Elliott to pursue his interest in paleontology.</p>

          <p>Mona Eltahawy, an Egyptian-American writer, draws parallels between the United States and authoritarian states she has experienced, citing increasing state power and religious influence. She criticizes the lack of outrage among white Americans regarding the erosion of rights, attributing it to a belief in American exceptionalism. Eltahawy expresses concern over the politicization of Christianity in the US and the impact on women's rights. She concludes that living in the US has radicalized her, leading her to embrace anarcho-feminism.</p>

          <h2>James's Historic Performance Not Enough in Game 3 Loss</h2>

          <p>Despite a historic performance by LeBron James, the Los Angeles Lakers lost Game 3 to the Minnesota Timberwolves 116-104. Luka Doncic played while sick and wasn't himself, and the Lakers committed too many turnovers and gave up offensive rebounds. James scored 38 points, the most in a playoff game by a player over 40, but the team's mistakes proved too costly. The Lakers now need to steal a win in Game 4 to avoid facing elimination.</p>

          <p>Luigi Mangione, charged with the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, pleaded not guilty in a New York City court. Supporters gathered outside the courthouse, with some viewing Mangione as a "political prisoner" due to the alleged actions of Thompson and UnitedHealthcare. Chelsea Manning was present, advocating for a fair justice system. The case has drawn attention due to the high-profile nature of the victim and the defendant's background. The trial date is set for December 5, with the trial expected to take place in 2026.</p>
