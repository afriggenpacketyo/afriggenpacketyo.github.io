          <p>Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz expressed strong support for current CEO Brian Niccol's "back to Starbucks" strategy, saying he "did a cartwheel" upon hearing it. Schultz, who made a surprise appearance at the company's Leadership Experience in Las Vegas, endorsed Niccol's plans to revitalize the company's sales and culture. Niccol's strategy includes refocusing on coffee quality and customer experience, shifting away from discounts and promotions. Schultz had previously criticized the company's performance under the interim leadership, emphasizing the need to value and understand Starbucks' unique culture.</p>

          <p>Oil prices have surged due to geopolitical concerns as President Trump has taken a more negative tone regarding nuclear talks with Iran and announced the withdrawal of some American personnel from the Middle East. Trump accused Tehran of "delaying" and expressed less confidence in reaching a deal, while Iran accused Washington of not respecting its right to enrich uranium. The IAEA Board of Governors has declared Iran in non-compliance with its nuclear safeguards obligations, increasing the risk of military action by Israel. Despite ongoing talks, analysts suggest a military confrontation is still likely to be averted, with evacuation orders seen as pressure tactics ahead of negotiations.</p>

          <p>A data bill, opposed by prominent UK artists like Sir Elton John and Dua Lipa, has been passed despite concerns about copyright infringement. The bill sparked a dispute over the use of copyrighted material by tech companies for training AI tools. Artists argued that without an amendment requiring companies to declare their use of copyrighted content, tech firms would exploit UK content without compensation. The government, however, refused the amendment, citing ongoing consultations and plans for a separate AI bill, leading to criticism that the UK is falling behind in the AI sector.</p>

          <p>A man trapped inside Larne Leisure Centre during rioting in Northern Ireland recounted the fear felt by customers and staff as youths attacked the building. The center, providing emergency shelter for families fleeing violence in Ballymena, was targeted with bricks and fire. Staff and customers, including children, had to flee for safety as windows were smashed and paint was thrown on fire doors. Olympic swimmer Danielle Hill condemned the disorder as "racism in its rawest," highlighting the community's distress and the harm caused by the violence.</p>
