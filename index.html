          <div class="timestamp">2025-03-24 13:32:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New regulations for inherited IRAs mandate annual required minimum distributions (RMDs) for most non-spouse heirs starting in 2025, or they face a 25% tax penalty.  This impacts beneficiaries, often adult children, who must deplete the IRA over 10 years.  Experts advise beneficiaries to consider strategic withdrawals based on their tax bracket.</p>
