        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Philippines Defense Secretary, Gilberto Teodoro, has publicly stated that the prospect of war in Asia is "not imminent," considering it remote despite China's sustained aggressive actions in the region. Teodoro clarified that China's expansionist designs are predetermined by its leadership, independent of who holds office in the United States. He reiterated the Philippines' constitutional mandate against war as a national policy instrument, emphasizing their strategy of developing credible deterrence alongside diplomatic efforts. This approach is aimed at curbing China's illegal incursions in the South China Sea, where Beijing's extensive claims are not recognized under international law, setting the Philippines apart from some more reserved neighboring nations in the ongoing dispute.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's producer prices experienced their largest decline in nearly two years, falling 3.6% in June, indicating deepening deflation exacerbated by a price war and weak consumer demand. While the consumer price index saw a slight 0.1% increase, economists warn that the end of deflation is not yet in sight due to a weakening property sector and ongoing "anti-involution" campaigns addressing excessive price competition. Policymakers are tightening regulations to curb aggressive price-cutting that harms business profitability, as oversupply continues to outpace demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has completed a significant 1,856-kilometer "green belt" across the Badain Jaran, Tengger, and Ulan Buh deserts in Inner Mongolia, utilizing the "straw checkerboard" method to stabilize shifting sands. This extensive environmental project aims to build an effective sand prevention and control system by first locking the sand and then planting drought-resistant trees like sacsaoul. The initiative strengthens the ecological barrier in the region, which covers a vast area of 94,700 square kilometers, demonstrating a long-term commitment to ecological restoration and sustainability in its westernmost part.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has signaled a notable shift in his foreign policy by expressing dissatisfaction with Vladimir Putin and, crucially, approving the dispatch of defensive weapons to Ukraine, a reversal from his prior stance. This article explores the underlying reasons for this change, questioning whether it indicates a strain in his relationship with the Russian leader. Additionally, the article places this development within the broader context of Trump's recent diplomatic activities, including his engagements with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu concerning Gaza ceasefire negotiations and his reintroduction of tariffs. This comprehensive overview highlights the complex and evolving nature of his administration's international agenda.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration the authority to pursue substantial federal job cuts, potentially impacting hundreds of thousands of employees. This decision overrides lower court injunctions that had previously halted the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) efforts. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, warning of significant implications for federal programs and the dismantling of government structures as Congress created them. The ruling allows these firings to proceed while lower court proceedings continue, following a trend of the Supreme Court backing the administration's policies on immigration and other executive actions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned Song Kum Hyok, a North Korean cyber operative from Kim Jong Un's military intelligence agency, for facilitating an IT worker scheme. Song allegedly recruited North Koreans to pose as remote American workers, stealing U.S. citizens' personal information to create aliases and funneling the illicit earnings, worth hundreds of millions, back to the regime's weapons programs. This action, part of a broader crackdown on North Korea's illicit financing, also targets four Russia-based entities involved in funneling money to North Korea through similar schemes, aiming to disrupt its unlawful weapons development.</p>

          <p>As the Atlantic hurricane season intensifies, a growing number of coastal homeowners are adopting climate-resilient designs to protect their properties from stronger storms. The article highlights examples like round homes built to withstand 190-mph winds, featuring aerodynamic shapes, reinforced trusses, and flood vents to relieve water pressure. These designs, while costing about 10% more upfront than traditional construction, prove highly successful in past storms and can lead to significant long-term savings, such as reduced insurance premiums. This proactive approach reflects a shift towards sustainable building practices in vulnerable regions, offering increased safety and financial benefits.</p>

The lawsuit aims for a temporary restraining order to prevent further "unlawful detentions," highlighting the tension between federal immigration enforcement and local sanctuary policies.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. will raise tariffs on imported copper to 50%, a decision stemming from an investigation into the metal's impact on national security. This move aligns with Trump's broader protectionist trade policy, which aims to boost American industry and is expected to take effect by the end of the month. Copper prices in the U.S. jumped following the announcement. While some industry players await final details, critics argue the measure will help U.S. producers but harm firms reliant on copper inputs, potentially leading to higher costs and trade disputes.

Campaigners and insiders point to a culture of silence, where powerful predators are shielded by non-disclosure agreements and victims risk blacklisting. This is exacerbated by a "black protectionism" phenomenon, where successful Black figures are seen as racial pioneers, making it harder for Black women to speak out without fear of reinforcing negative stereotypes about their community.

          <p>An Instagram post by TV personality Gemma Collins, advertising a weight-loss drug and app, has been banned by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) for illegally promoting prescription-only medication. Collins had stated she was "two sizes down" thanks to the Yazen service. The ASA, advised by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, found the advert implicitly promoted prescription weight-loss drugs to the public, breaching regulations. Eight other similar adverts from various health brands were also banned in this crackdown, reinforcing rules against such endorsements and highlighting the importance of adherence to advertising standards for regulated products.</p>
