        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's decision to begin firing furloughed federal workers has prompted strong backlash from both political parties and labor unions. Republican Senator Susan Collins criticized the move as unnecessary and harmful, while the American Federation of Government Employees labeled the firings "disgraceful" and "illegal." The Office of Management and Budget confirmed that mass firings have started, with the Department of Health and Human Services being one of the affected agencies. This escalation in the shutdown standoff intensifies the pressure on Congress to negotiate a funding resolution.</p>

          <p>A proposed class-action lawsuit claims that Amazon engaged in deceptive practices during its Prime Day sales event by advertising discounts based on inflated or "fictional" list prices. The plaintiffs allege that this tactic made deals appear more significant than they were, luring customers into making purchases under false pretenses. The suit provides examples where items were sold during Prime Day for prices similar to or even higher than their regular price in the preceding months. This legal challenge questions the transparency of the retail giant's promotional strategies and the actual value offered to consumers.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has halted a massive proposed solar power project in Nevada, signaling a broader policy move against renewable energy development. The Bureau of Land Management canceled the environmental review for the Esmeralda 7 project, which would have been one of the world's largest solar installations, capable of powering nearly two million homes. This action follows a series of executive orders by President Trump aimed at pausing or reviewing new wind and solar projects on federal lands. While developers remain committed to their proposals, the cancellation represents a significant setback for the renewable energy sector.</p>

          <p>Declassified documents reveal that former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair met with Jeffrey Epstein in Downing Street in 2002, a meeting lobbied for by Lord Peter Mandelson. A memo from a senior civil servant briefed Blair on the "super-rich" financier, noting his connections to Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew. The meeting occurred six years before Epstein's first conviction for sex crimes involving a minor. A spokesperson for Blair confirmed the brief meeting took place long before Epstein's crimes were known and stated there was no subsequent contact between them.</p>

          <p>Paul Ingrassia, President Trump's nominee to lead the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, was reportedly investigated for sexual harassment earlier this year. The allegation stemmed from an incident where he allegedly arranged for a junior female colleague to share a hotel room with him on a business trip by having her separate reservation canceled. While Ingrassia's lawyer denies the accusation and a DHS investigation cleared him, the report has cast a shadow over his nomination. The Office of Special Counsel is an independent agency responsible for protecting federal whistleblowers and investigating misconduct.</p>

          <p>As economic uncertainty drives more investors toward gold, experts are highlighting the importance of secure storage for physical assets like coins and bars. The primary risks for home storage are theft and natural disasters, making off-site options like professional depositories or bank safety deposit boxes preferable for many. When using a third-party facility, it is crucial to ensure the gold is fully allocated in the owner's name and insured to protect against institutional failure. These storage methods come with annual fees, typically a small percentage of the gold's total value. (not investment advice)</p>

Transportation officials report that controller shortages are now responsible for over half of all flight delays, a substantial increase from the typical rate.

The music became an anthem for marginalized Andean migrants in Lima, with artists like Chacalón and the band Los Shapis rising to superstar status.

Gold is often seen as a stable store of value during economic turmoil but does not generate income like dividends or interest, which can be a drawback for those needing regular cash flow. Furthermore, physical gold incurs storage and insurance costs and is subject to a higher capital gains tax rate than stocks in the U.S. Financial planners typically suggest allocating a modest portion, around 5% to 10%, of a retirement portfolio to precious metals.

          <p>With interest rates showing signs of softening, individuals with certificates of deposit (CDs) maturing soon are advised to plan their next steps proactively. It is important to review the bank's maturity notice to understand the grace period and automatic renewal terms, as rolling over could result in a lower yield. Savers should shop around for the best available rates on new CDs or consider high-yield savings accounts, which currently offer competitive returns with greater liquidity. Acting before the maturity date allows investors to lock in a favorable rate before potential further declines. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent cut in the Federal Reserve's benchmark rate, homeowners with high mortgage rates are exploring refinancing options to lower their monthly payments. A "good" refinance rate is subjective, but experts suggest that even a half-percentage point reduction can provide significant savings over the life of a loan. Current average rates for 30-year and 15-year fixed mortgages have fallen, and options like adjustable-rate mortgages or buying mortgage points can secure even lower initial rates. With more Fed rate cuts anticipated, the refinancing landscape may become even more favorable for homeowners in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted New York Attorney General Letitia James on charges of bank fraud and making false statements, in a move her office calls blatant political retribution. The charges, presented by a U.S. Attorney recently installed by the Trump administration, relate to a mortgage James obtained for a property. This indictment follows James's successful civil fraud case against the Trump Organization and is seen by critics as part of a pattern of the president weaponizing the Department of Justice to target political rivals. James has forcefully denied the charges, which she described as baseless.</p>

Some comedians have criticized their peers for accepting large paydays to perform in a country with severe restrictions on free speech.

          <p>Gregg Wallace, the former presenter of the UK cooking show 'MasterChef', is suing the BBC for up to £10,000 in damages. He claims the broadcaster caused him "distress and harassment" by failing to provide him with his personal data following a subject access request. Wallace was dismissed from the show in July after an internal report upheld numerous allegations of misconduct against him. In court documents, he alleges the BBC and its production arm have unlawfully withheld or redacted information related to his employment and conduct over his 21-year tenure.</p>
