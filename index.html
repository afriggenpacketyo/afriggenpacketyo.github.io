          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is suing President Trump over the deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles, arguing it is an unlawful federalization without the state's consent or request. Newsom contends the move is politically motivated, intended to stoke chaos, and an overreach of presidential authority, marking the first time since 1965 that a president has activated a state's National Guard without the governor's approval. The lawsuit alleges that Trump's actions violate the U.S. Constitution and infringe on Newsom's role as commander-in-chief of the California National Guard, with Newsom emphasizing the situation is escalating towards authoritarianism. The legal action coincides with protests against federal immigration enforcement actions in Los Angeles, where the deployment of Marines is also occurring.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has removed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP), asserting that the committee has become a "rubber stamp for any vaccine." Kennedy stated that a clean sweep is needed to restore public confidence in vaccine science, a move that has been met with strong criticism from medical groups. The American Medical Association condemned the action, stating that it upends a transparent process that has saved countless lives, while the American Academy of Pediatrics called it an effort to silence independent medical expertise. The committee's decisions are closely watched by experts and health authorities, as their recommendations are tied to federal policies including insurance coverage and liability protections.</p>

          <p>The state of California is suing the Trump administration over the president's order to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles, arguing that local law enforcement is capable of managing the situation. California's Attorney General contends that federalizing the National Guard is an abuse of presidential authority, asserting that there is no invasion or rebellion warranting such action. The lawsuit claims that Trump is attempting to manufacture chaos for political gain, infringing on the governor's role as commander-in-chief of the California National Guard. The state maintains that local authorities could have requested support from state partners if necessary, highlighting the unwarranted nature of the federal intervention.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has activated approximately 700 Marines for potential deployment to Los Angeles, joining National Guard troops already sent to the city in response to protests over Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) actions. The Marines, based in Twentynine Palms, California, are expected to integrate with the National Guard to protect federal personnel and property, having received training in de-escalation and crowd control. Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDowell expressed concern about the arrival of federal military forces without clear coordination, emphasizing the logistical and operational challenges it poses. California Governor Gavin Newsom's office initially stated that the Marines were simply being moved from one base to another, but the situation remains tense amid ongoing protests and legal challenges to the National Guard deployment.</p>

Some countries, like Lesotho, have granted licenses to Starlink while seeking trade deals with the U.S., suggesting that the State Department has tied tariff negotiations to specific companies. Experts warn that Musk's strained relationship with Trump could make him a global liability for the company, potentially leading to obstacles in approvals or reduced influence on federal policy. In the long term, this feud may encourage other countries to invest in their own satellite systems, as seen with the European Parliament's call for increased space funding.</p>

          <p>Dr. Phil's presence at ICE raids in Los Angeles alongside Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, has sparked controversy and questions about the administration's approach to immigration policy. McGraw, neither a journalist nor an immigration expert, was there to get a "first-hand look" and an "exclusive" interview with Homan for his new media venture. Critics argue that McGraw's presence normalizes the rounding up of people and the deployment of the National Guard, while providing a platform for Homan to defend Trump's divisive immigration policies. The incident underscores concerns that the administration is conducting these raids with maximum spectacle awareness, further blurring the lines between reality TV and governance.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is in recovery mode after a weekend of protests against Trump's immigration roundups and National Guard deployment, with cleanup crews addressing graffiti and damage. A series of demonstrations were marred by vandalism and violence, including rocks thrown from freeway overpasses and Waymo vehicles set on fire. The National Guard was largely absent from policing the protests, while city officials and union leaders gathered to demand the release of arrested union leader David Huerta. The city is grappling with the aftermath of the protests and the implications of the federal government's actions.</p>

The project faces opposition due to concerns about costs and potential environmental impact, despite the government's insistence that nuclear power is crucial for the UK's energy security.

          <p>President Trump and California Governor Gavin Newsom are in a heated dispute over the handling of protests in Los Angeles, with Trump suggesting Newsom should be arrested.

The conflict highlights the ongoing tension between the Trump administration and California, with both sides framing the confrontation in political terms.

          <p>Chinese electric car manufacturers, like BYD, are expanding aggressively into European markets with cheaper and technologically advanced models, posing a significant challenge to established automakers. The rise of Chinese EVs is attributed to state funding, low labor costs, and a well-established supply chain, prompting concerns about security risks and unfair competition. While consumers may benefit from more affordable electric cars, some experts fear that Chinese vehicles could represent a security risk and that European manufacturers could be wiped out if they don't catch up. The US and EU have taken different approaches to address these concerns, with the US imposing high import tariffs and the EU implementing extra tariffs.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent actions toward California, including cutting federal funding and deploying the National Guard, highlight the fraying relationship between the federal government and the states. These actions are seen as an abuse of presidential power and a departure from traditional conservative defenses of states' rights. The author argues that Trump's vision of federalism is a one-way street, where states are on their own if they need help but must comply with federal intervention even if they believe it is unnecessary or harmful. This approach has led to increased tensions between Washington and the states, raising questions about the future of federalism in the United States.</p>
