          <p>Singapore's economy demonstrated robust growth in the second quarter, expanding by 4.3% year-over-year and beating economists' predictions. This acceleration was primarily driven by a strong 5.5% expansion in the manufacturing sector. Despite the positive performance, the Ministry of Trade and Industry remains cautious, highlighting significant uncertainties and downside risks from global trade tensions, particularly U.S. tariff policies. The country's central bank had previously loosened monetary policy due to these external risks, but the strong GDP figures present a complex picture for future decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new bill backed by President Trump threatens to rescind $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides crucial funding for public radio and TV stations. While proponents criticize outlets like NPR and PBS for alleged bias, opponents argue the cuts would disproportionately harm rural areas, where local stations are often the only source of news and vital emergency information. Senators from rural states, including Alaska's Lisa Murkowski, have expressed opposition, warning that defunding these stations could eliminate life-saving resources for their constituents and deepen the problem of news deserts across the country.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department is searching for a Colt M4 assault rifle that went missing from a patrol car's trunk in South L.A. The weapon, stored in a hard case along with five fully loaded magazines, is believed to have potentially fallen out of the vehicle. Authorities have released the deputies' four-mile travel route and are asking the public for any information or surveillance footage that could help locate the high-powered weapon. An internal investigation is also underway to determine if proper procedures for securing the firearm were followed by the deputies involved.</p>

          <p>In a New York Times interview, former President Joe Biden defended his use of an autopen to sign a historic number of clemency grants at the end of his term. He asserted that he personally "made every decision" regarding the criteria for the pardons, which applied to large categories of individuals, rather than approving each name individually. The practice has drawn sharp criticism from Republicans and President Trump, who has directed the Department of Justice to investigate the matter, suggesting it was used to conceal a potential cognitive decline and represented an abuse of executive power.</p>

Analysts noted that investors are bracing for the upcoming U.S. earnings season with lowered expectations, as corporate profits are forecast to slow.

          <p>A severe, multi-year drought in northern Mexico is escalating a water-sharing dispute with the United States, centered on an 81-year-old treaty. Mexico is in arrears on its water deliveries from the Rio Grande to Texas, prompting the Trump administration to threaten retaliatory measures, including potentially withholding water from the Colorado River. Farmers in Chihuahua, Mexico, argue they cannot give water they don't have, while Texan farmers contend Mexico is hoarding the resource. The conflict highlights the growing strain that climate change and resource scarcity are placing on international agreements and regional stability.</p>

National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett acknowledged the president's authority to impose such tariffs, though critics question the rationale, noting the U.S. actually has a trade surplus with Brazil. The move has also been linked to the ongoing criminal case against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a political ally of Trump. (not investment advice)</p>
