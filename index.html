        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Zhao Xintong delivered a stunning performance, establishing a commanding 12-4 lead against Ronnie O'Sullivan in their World Championship semi-final. Zhao won all eight frames in the Friday morning session, becoming only the fourth player to achieve an 8-0 session against O'Sullivan at the Crucible. Despite O'Sullivan's attempt to improve his game with a new cue tip, Zhao capitalized on his opponent's misses, compiling breaks of 112 and 115. Zhao's clinical performance suggests he could become the first Chinese player to win the title in Sheffield, needing just five more frames to reach the final.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Angels outfielder Mike Trout has been placed on the 10-day injured list due to a bone bruise in his left knee, which was surgically repaired previously. Trout sustained the injury during a game against the Seattle Mariners while trying to leg out an infield single. While the injury is not considered significant, manager Ron Washington indicated that Trout needs rest, hoping for a swift recovery. Trout, who transitioned to right field to maintain his health, has played in all 29 of the Angels' games this season, hitting nine home runs but with a batting average of .179.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The expiration of the de minimis tariff exemption on May 2 is set to make cheaper goods from China more expensive for U.S. consumers. Retailers like Shein and Temu, which relied on the loophole to ship low-value parcels duty-free, are expected to raise prices. The end of the exemption, which previously allowed packages worth $800 to enter the U.S. without import levies, presents administrative challenges for importers and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, potentially causing shipment delays. While U.S.-based companies may benefit from reduced competition, consumers are likely to see higher prices and reduced variety of goods.</p>

          <p>Reform UK has made significant gains in recent local elections, tapping into widespread dissatisfaction with the Conservative and Labour parties. The party performed well in areas that heavily voted to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum, winning control of seven councils, including Durham, Kent, and Lancashire. Reform's success indicates a potential shift in British politics, challenging the traditional dominance of the Conservative and Labour parties. The party's projected vote share surpasses Ukip's peak popularity in 2013, marking the first time a party other than Conservative or Labour has been placed first in a nationwide projection.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has enlisted a team of lawyers with ties to conservative Supreme Court justices and President Trump to defend itself against government actions. This move marks a shift from Harvard's previous approach, where it relied on firms traditionally associated with the university. The decision to hire Republican-aligned lawyers is seen as a strategic effort to appeal to a court with a conservative majority. Harvard's legal challenge argues that the Trump administration's orders violate the First Amendment and the Administrative Procedure Act, with billions of dollars in federal funds at stake.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department is pushing for a breakup of Google's advertising technology empire, marking the second request to force the company to divest parts of its business within a year.

Google's lawyers countered that a breakup would contradict legal precedent and compromise privacy and security. This action follows a separate hearing addressing Google's search monopoly, potentially leading to a significant reshaping of the tech giant.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's proposed budget for the 2026 fiscal year calls for $163 billion in cuts to federal spending, primarily impacting the Department of Education, Health and Human Services, USAID, and the EPA. While proposing cuts to various departments, the budget includes a 13% increase in defense spending, bringing it to $1.01 trillion. The proposal also allocates $175 billion towards the southern border. Democrats have criticized the budget for prioritizing tax breaks for the wealthy while slashing programs that benefit working Americans.</p>
