          <p>Elon Musk has intensified his criticism of President Trump's major tax and spending bill, asserting it will "destroy millions of jobs" and harm future industries. The Tesla CEO, who previously served in the Trump administration, argues the legislation favors outdated sectors while damaging emerging ones. This public condemnation renews a contentious relationship between Musk and Trump, adding another layer of complexity for Republican leaders attempting to pass the bill before the July 4th deadline.

          <h2>"Urban Heat Island" Effect Explains Why UK Cities Experience Intense Heatwaves</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a heatwave impacts the UK, this article explains the "urban heat island" phenomenon, which causes cities to be significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas. Dark surfaces like roads and buildings absorb and retain the sun's heat, while a lack of vegetation reduces natural cooling effects, leading to temperature differences of up to 10Â°C. This effect exacerbates the dangers of heatwaves, such as heat stroke and poor air quality, making urban populations particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.</p>

          <p>A new pilot program in UK primary schools is teaching children as young as five about sun safety to reduce future rates of melanoma, the most serious skin cancer. The initiative, which is being trialed in Kent, educates pupils on reading UV indexes and applying sunscreen, aiming to instill lifelong protective habits. Experts emphasize that sunburn in childhood significantly increases adult cancer risk, and this preventative education is seen as crucial as melanoma diagnoses are projected to rise.</p>
