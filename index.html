          <p>This article analyzes Donald Trump's efforts to dismantle core principles of American democracy, arguing that he is reverse-engineering liberal institutions to undermine them. It posits that Trump's actions are not random but part of a deliberate strategy to turn institutions designed to restrain executive power into tools for authoritarianism. The article draws parallels with other autocrats but emphasizes the unique challenge Trump faces in dismantling the robust democratic infrastructure of the U.S., which requires a sophisticated approach of using laws against laws and polarizing institutions from within.
