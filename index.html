          <p>Chelsea attacker Lauren James has made a significant return to the England women's football team after a three-month injury layoff, providing a crucial boost ahead of Euro 2025. In a friendly match against Jamaica, she made an immediate impact with an assist just eight minutes after coming on as a substitute. Her performance in the number 10 role has been widely praised, earning comparisons to England legend Kelly Smith and creating a selection dilemma for manager Sarina Wiegman. While she is still building match fitness, her creative talent is seen as a key asset for the Lionesses' title defense.</p>

          <p>North Carolina Republican Senator Thom Tillis has announced he will not seek re-election in 2026, citing a political environment where independent thinking has become an "endangered species." His decision came a day after he voted against President Trump's major budget package due to concerns about its deep cuts to Medicaid funding for his state. Trump responded with public attacks, calling Tillis a "complainer" and threatening to support a primary challenger, with speculation now centering on his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, potentially running for the open seat.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that President Trump's proposed budget bill could cause nearly 12 million Americans to lose their health insurance coverage. The report also projects the legislation would add almost $3.3 trillion to the national debt, complicating its path through the Senate. These figures are central to the debate, with critics highlighting the deep cuts to healthcare funding, particularly Medicaid. Supporters of the bill argue the changes are necessary to reform the system and eliminate waste. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is engaged in a weekend debate over President Trump's major tax and spending bill, with Democrats employing procedural tactics to delay a final vote. After narrowly advancing the bill, the Senate clerk was forced to read the nearly 1,000-page legislation aloud, a process that took almost 16 hours. Following the reading, a 20-hour debate period began, which will be followed by a "vote-a-rama" where senators can propose unlimited amendments. The bill's passage remains uncertain, as Republican leaders can only afford to lose three votes from their narrow majority. (not investment advice)</p>

He also denied any threats against IAEA inspectors, who are currently in Iran but have had their access to nuclear sites suspended by the Iranian parliament, a move he said was a response to the agency's perceived failures.</p>

          <p>Norway's state-owned lottery company, Norsk Tipping, has apologized after mistakenly informing thousands of Eurojackpot players they had won millions more than their actual prizes. The error occurred due to a technical glitch that multiplied winnings by 100 instead of correctly converting them from Euros to Norwegian kroner. While no incorrect payments were made, the incident caused significant anger and disappointment among those who briefly believed they were millionaires. In the aftermath of the mistake, Norsk Tipping CEO Tonje Sagstuen announced her resignation from the company.</p>

Ryan, who had championed diversity policies opposed by the administration, stepped down on Friday to avoid these repercussions. According to Warner, the threat included withholding research funding, financial aid, and student visas, an action he described as the "most outrageous" the administration has taken on education. This event is seen as part of a broader pattern of targeting universities over their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.</p>

          <p>D. Wayne Lukas, a transformative figure in horse racing and a member of two halls of fame, has passed away at the age of 89. Known as "The Coach," Lukas won 15 Triple Crown races and trained 24 world champion quarter horses before switching to thoroughbreds, where his horses earned over $300 million. His career, which began in 1968, was marked by innovation and a dominant run in the sport, including winning all three Triple Crown races in 1995 with two different horses. Lukas was also renowned for his mentorship, with many of his assistants, like Todd Pletcher, becoming highly successful trainers themselves.</p>

          <p>The health impact of common seed oils, such as canola, soybean, and sunflower oil, is a subject of ongoing debate among health experts and officials. Health Secretary RFK Jr. has publicly criticized these oils, claiming they are harmful to Americans. However, this article notes that many nutrition researchers and scientists maintain that the evidence does not support such strong claims. The discussion revolves around the processing of these oils and their chemical composition, particularly their balance of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids. The differing viewpoints highlight the complexity of nutritional science and public health messaging.</p>

          <p>This analytical article delves into the complexities of Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) in the context of the recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. The author argues that initial, hasty judgments about the effectiveness of the bombing are often unreliable, referencing historical examples from WWII and the Gulf War. The piece suggests that the cumulative effect of the 12-day campaign, the precision of modern munitions, and the sophistication of the delivery platforms likely resulted in severe damage to Iran's nuclear program. It concludes that a considered judgment requires time and the integration of multiple intelligence sources, cautioning against both official hyperbole and premature criticism.</p>

In a television interview, Trump stated that a group of "very wealthy people" is prepared to acquire the platform from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, and that a deal could be finalized soon. A potential sale would require approval from the Chinese government, but Trump expressed optimism that President Xi Jinping would agree.

The state-owned mining company reported that the collapse occurred in a shaft where work had previously been suspended due to safety risks. Such incidents are common in Sudan's artisanal mining sector, which suffers from poor safety standards. The gold industry is a major source of funding for both sides in Sudan's ongoing civil war, with much of the extracted gold reportedly smuggled out of the country.</p>
