        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments regarding President Trump's executive order seeking to limit U.S. citizenship to children born on American soil to lawful permanent residents. The justices questioned the legality of the order and the use of nationwide injunctions to block presidential policies. Arguments centered on the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause and whether it applies to children of undocumented immigrants. Several justices expressed concerns about the potential for unlawful executive orders to remain in effect too long if nationwide injunctions are eliminated, while others worried about the chaos of inconsistent citizenship rules across the country.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Mexico dismissed trespassing charges against nearly 100 undocumented migrants arrested for entering a newly declared "national defense" zone along the border with Mexico. The judge, Gregory B. Wormuth, stated that the government failed to prove the migrants knew they were entering a restricted military area. The Trump administration's tactic of arresting migrants on misdemeanor charges had overwhelmed local jails. Critics worry about the impact on volunteers searching for remains of perished migrants, hikers on the Continental Divide Trail, and hunters using public lands. Active-duty troops are providing support to Border Patrol agents but have not detained anyone themselves.</p>

          <p>Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan pleaded not guilty to federal obstruction charges after allegedly helping a man evade immigration authorities at her courthouse.

          <p>Starbucks is exploring the sale of a stake in its China business, reaching out to private equity firms and tech companies. While the company's focus in the United States is to improve the business, some analysts would prefer Starbucks find a partner in China. The move comes amid a barista strike over a newly implemented dress code. A Starbucks spokesperson stated that having a dress code is common in the service industry, but the union believes such changes should be part of collective bargaining.</p>

          <p>The chief suspect in Madeleine McCann's disappearance, Christian BrÃ¼ckner, will be released from prison later than originally scheduled, due to an unpaid fine. BrÃ¼ckner, who is serving a sentence for a rape conviction, denies any involvement in McCann's disappearance. His lawyer told the BBC the delayed release date was due to an unpaid fine which he does not believe BrÃ¼ckner will be able to pay. Any further time in prison potentially gives German prosecutors more time to pursue an appeal in a separate case that saw BrÃ¼ckner cleared of three counts of rape and two counts of child sex abuse.</p>

          <p>The UK economy grew by 0.7% at the start of this year, surpassing expectations, with strong spending on services such as retail, hospitality, and finance. The UK's growth rate was the highest in the G7, a group of countries that includes the US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan. However, economists caution that the growth may be short-lived due to new tariffs and rising taxes. The UK did a deal with the US last week which cut some tariffs, but it is unclear when this will take effect as the details are ironed out.</p>
