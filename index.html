          <p>Axel Rudakubana, the 18-year-old serving a minimum of 52 years for the murder of three young girls in Southport, is under investigation for allegedly attacking a prison officer. Rudakubana reportedly threw boiling water over the officer, who was hospitalized as a precaution and later discharged. The incident has heightened concerns about prison officer safety, especially after a similar attack by the Manchester Arena bomber. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood has announced trials for tasers in prisons and a review of protective body armor for officers, as assaults on staff have reached a decade high. The article underscores the ongoing challenges in maintaining safety within prison facilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Xi Jinping has strategically aimed to increase global dependence on China's exports and manufacturing capabilities, using economic tools to counter foreign pressures. Since 2020, China has ramped up exports, deepened its role as a manufacturing hub, and introduced export controls on critical minerals. This approach has allowed China to retaliate against tariffs imposed by the United States, creating pressure on the Trump administration due to potential shortages and higher consumer prices. While China still relies on the West for some technologies, its willingness to weaponize the supply chain marks a significant shift in its global relationship and challenges U.S. supremacy.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily paused the Trump administration's plans to restructure government agencies and implement mass layoffs, citing the need for Congressional approval for such large-scale reorganizations. Judge Susan Illston sided with unions and local governments, arguing that the administration's actions were unlawful and disruptive to critical services. The ruling halts the administration's efforts, led by Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), to eliminate duplicate roles and automate tasks. A hearing is scheduled for May 22 to consider a longer preliminary injunction.</p>

          <p>Billy Evans, the partner of Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, has raised millions for a new artificial intelligence startup called Haemanthus, which aims to develop a product for medical testing. Holmes, currently serving an 11-year sentence for fraud related to Theranos, has reportedly been advising Evans on the venture. Haemanthus focuses on Raman spectroscopy, a technology with potential applications in diagnosing diseases like ALS and cancer. The company hopes to lower the cost of the technology and make it commercially available to patients, though the specific consumer product is still under development.</p>
