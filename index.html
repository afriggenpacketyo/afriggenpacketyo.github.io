          <p>Charles B. Rangel, a prominent figure in New York politics and a former congressman for Harlem, has died at the age of 94. Rangel served in the House of Representatives for over four decades and was the first Black chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Throughout his career, Rangel was instrumental in persuading Hillary Clinton to run for Senate in New York and advocated for policies benefiting his constituents, despite facing an ethics violation that led to his censure in 2010. Remembered for his gregarious nature and political agility, Rangel remained a respected figure even after leaving Congress, serving as statesman-in-residence at The City College of New York.</p>

          <p>British-South African endurance athlete Lewis Pugh has completed a 62-mile swim around Martha's Vineyard to raise awareness about the importance of shark conservation. Pugh undertook the 12-day swim in the cold waters off the Massachusetts island, coinciding with the 50th anniversary of the film "Jaws," to challenge negative perceptions of sharks. Despite facing harsh weather conditions and the psychological challenge of swimming in shark-inhabited waters, Pugh emphasized the urgent need to protect sharks, which are being killed at an unsustainable rate. He hopes his efforts will shift public opinion and promote conservation efforts to safeguard these essential apex predators.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced that Germany, along with France, the UK, and the US, has lifted restrictions on the range of weapons supplied to Ukraine, enabling the country to strike military positions within Russia.

The Kremlin responded to the announcement by calling the move dangerous and contradictory to aspirations for a peaceful settlement.

          <p>The Kremlin has characterized Donald Trump's recent remarks about Vladimir Putin as an "emotional overload" after the former US president described Putin as "absolutely crazy" following intensified attacks on Ukraine. This assessment came after Trump criticized Putin for needlessly killing people in Ukraine, prompting Dmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesman, to attribute the comments to emotional factors. Meanwhile, Germany announced the removal of range restrictions on arms supplied to Ukraine, enabling them to target military positions in Russia, a move seen as a response to the escalating conflict and the need for Ukraine to defend itself.</p>

The authors call for a clear line against political violence, emphasizing the need to enforce the law, defend civic order, and reject ideologies that lead to bloodshed, while also protecting First Amendment rights.</p>

          <p>Jesse Armstrong, the creator of "Succession," has created a new movie called "Mountainhead," a satire of tech oligarchs holed up in Utah, debuting on HBO. The film explores a world where deepfakes are easily created, leading to the collapse of reality and global instability. It features three billionaires fantasizing about taking over failing nations and considering a coup in the U.S., highlighting the terrifying power amassed by Silicon Valley figures. Armstrong's inspiration came from reading about figures like Zuckerberg, Altman, Andreessen, and Thiel, capturing the tone of tech-centric podcasts with uncanny precision.</p>

          <p>EU leaders are optimistic about reaching a swift agreement to resolve the trade war with the US after President Trump postponed the threatened 50% tariffs until July 9. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen persuaded Trump to delay the duties, agreeing to expedite trade negotiations. The EU's "zero-for-zero" offer to eliminate tariffs on cars and industrial goods remains on the table, with the EU trade commissioner set to speak with the US commerce secretary. Despite ongoing uncertainties, European markets responded positively to the news of the tariff delay.</p>
