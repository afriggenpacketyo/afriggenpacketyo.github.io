          <p>Recent firings of federal prosecutors by the Trump administration are complicating a major criminal case. The prosecutor leading the case against a Florida businessman, accused of embezzling $100 million from a fund for individuals with special needs, was among those dismissed. Critics allege the firings are politically motivated retribution for January 6 and other Trump-related investigations, raising concerns from victims and lawmakers about potential delays and the jeopardy of justice for the vulnerable families affected.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed a 17% tariff on most fresh Mexican tomatoes, terminating a long-standing trade agreement. The move aims to protect American farmers from what the Commerce Department calls unfair pricing by Mexican producers, who supply about 70% of the U.S. market. While domestic growers praise the decision, critics and business groups warn it could increase consumer prices for items like salsa and risk retaliatory measures from Mexico, impacting a wide range of U.S. industries.

The National Drought Group is meeting to assess the situation, which is caused by prolonged low rainfall and exacerbated by climate change. This declaration allows water companies to implement drought plans, which can include measures like hosepipe bans, as the country grapples with the environmental and resource challenges posed by the dry conditions.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has formally urged the U.S. Supreme Court to deny Ghislaine Maxwell's appeal of her 20-year prison sentence. Maxwell, an accomplice to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, argued that Epstein's 2007 non-prosecution agreement should have also protected her from prosecution. However, the DOJ countered that the agreement was geographically limited to Florida and did not have the authority to bind other federal districts, asserting that Maxwell was, at most, an incidental beneficiary and should remain imprisoned for her crimes.</p>

          <p>The West Indies cricket team was dismissed for just 27 runs in their second innings against Australia, marking the second-lowest total in Test cricket history. The catastrophic batting display secured a 176-run victory and a 3-0 series sweep for Australia in Jamaica. Australian pace bowler Mitchell Starc was the primary destroyer, taking an incredible six wickets for nine runs, which included the fastest five-wicket haul ever recorded in Test cricket and pushed him past the 400-wicket milestone for his career.</p>

          <p>This article argues that Major League Baseball's Home Run Derby is missing its biggest stars, Shohei Ohtani and Aaron Judge, and should consider changing its format to encourage their participation. Ohtani has cited the physical toll of the current rules as a reason for not competing, having struggled in the second half of the season after his only appearance in 2021. The author suggests that the league should prioritize showcasing its most popular players to boost the event's cultural relevance, even if it means modifying the rules to their liking.</p>

          <p>A large, legal cannabis operation on California's Central Coast, recently raided by federal immigration agents, is also under a state investigation for alleged child labor. The state's Department of Cannabis Control confirmed it opened an active probe into Glass House after receiving a complaint about the employment of minors. This follows a Department of Homeland Security raid where 361 people were arrested, and officials reported "rescuing" at least 14 migrant children from potential exploitation and forced labor at the company's facilities.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has observed a recent uptick in corporate mergers and acquisitions, suggesting that the market is in the "ripple stage" of a new wave of deal-making. He pointed to several recent transactions, such as Ferrero's acquisition of WK Kellogg, as harbingers of more M&A action to come in the fall. Cramer advised investors that this is a positive sign for the market as a whole, not just for investment banks, and suggested that the current administration's friendlier stance toward M&A could encourage more deals.

          <p>The UK government has announced it will lift a seven-month pause and resume processing asylum claims from Syrian nationals. The decisions were halted in December following the collapse of the Assad regime, creating uncertainty for over 7,000 Syrian asylum seekers in the UK. The Home Office stated it now has sufficient information to make robust assessments, and the move could pave the way for enforced returns to Syria for those whose claims are denied, a policy that aligns with actions taken by some other European nations.</p>

          <p>This article posits that President Trump's recent shift to a harder line against Russia is driven more by personal feelings of humiliation than a strategic change in foreign policy. According to White House sources, Trump feels that Vladimir Putin has repeatedly ignored his calls for a peace deal in Ukraine, making him appear weak and like a junior partner. By escalating attacks after Trump's pleas, Putin has reportedly insulted the president, prompting the new threats of tariffs and the authorization of more weapons for Ukraine as a response.</p>

          <p>Kentucky Representative Thomas Massie, a Republican who has notably broken with President Trump on key issues, has amassed a significant campaign fund of over $1.7 million. This strong fundraising performance comes as Trump's political allies have formed a super PAC specifically aimed at unseating Massie in the 2026 primary. Massie's financial strength will be crucial in defending his seat against the well-funded challenge, signaling a significant intra-party battle in a district that is expensive to campaign in.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scotland's Shetland Islands are advancing plans to build a network of undersea tunnels to connect their outlying isles, inspired by the successful infrastructure of the Faroe Islands. The council aims to replace an aging and costly ferry system with tunnels, which they believe will transform island life and boost the local economy, including its vital salmon and fishing industries. The multi-million pound project is likely to be funded through borrowing and paid back with user tolls, potentially creating a new transport model for other Scottish island communities.</p>
