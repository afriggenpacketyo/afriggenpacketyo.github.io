          <h2>US Trade Strategy Towards ASEAN Seen as Transactional and Extractive</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 08:30:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that recent U.S. trade policies with Southeast Asian nations have shifted from a collaborative partnership to a rent-seeking model. Washington is accused of monetizing market access by imposing higher tariffs and mandatory purchases, effectively treating ASEAN members as "fee for access" economies. This transactional approach may secure short-term benefits for the U.S. but risks undermining the long-term competitiveness and sovereignty of the region's nations. The article suggests this strategy replaces mutual integration with a system that extracts value rather than building strategic alliances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Report Indicates China's Influence in Southeast Asia is Growing as US and EU Reduce Aid</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 08:30:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report from the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank, highlights China's increasing influence in Southeast Asia, largely driven by its role as the region's primary infrastructure financier. This rise coincides with significant cuts in foreign aid from the United States and the European Union, which are retracting billions in funding. As Western support wanes, the report suggests the "center of gravity" for development finance is shifting towards Beijing, Tokyo, and Seoul. China is well-positioned to enhance its regional dominance through strategic infrastructure projects like high-speed rail links. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A fragile ceasefire has brought a "cautious calm" to the Syrian city of Suweida after a week of intense and deadly clashes involving local Druze fighters, Bedouin gunmen, and government forces. The violence, which erupted after the abduction of a Druze merchant, has resulted in over 1,000 deaths and displaced at least 128,000 people, according to monitoring groups and the UN. Despite the cessation of fighting, the humanitarian situation remains dire, with hospitals overwhelmed and a severe shortage of medical supplies. Government forces have established roadblocks to contain tensions as the city remains under the control of local fighters.</p>

          <p>The Women's Euro 2025 tournament has seen an unusually low penalty conversion rate of just 58.5%, sparking analysis into the contributing factors. Experts suggest a combination of increased pressure from the sport's growing popularity, more sophisticated data analysis allowing goalkeepers to anticipate shots, and the overall improvement in goalkeeping skills are key reasons. The article notes that while women's football has professionalized, penalty-taking techniques may still be evolving compared to the men's game. This trend highlights the shifting dynamics and rising standards within international women's football, where scoring from the spot is no longer a near-guarantee.</p>

His granddaughter, who managed his social media account with over 1.2 million followers, announced his peaceful death. Larson's life was remarkable; he lied about his age to enlist in the National Guard at 15, helped plan the D-Day invasion, and survived storming Omaha Beach. In his later years, he shared his stories online, authored an autobiography, and became a beloved figure, reminding younger generations of the sacrifices made by his own.</p>

          <p>Following a landmark court ruling, the Atlanta Police Foundation (APF) has released 287 pages of records related to the controversial "Cop City" police training center. The documents were obtained after a lawsuit by a news outlet and a research group, setting a potential precedent for the transparency of private police foundations nationwide. The records reveal the APF actively lobbied city officials to prevent a public referendum on the project, warning it could derail financing and damage the city council's credibility. This release provides new insight into the private foundation's efforts to influence public policy and suppress opposition to the contentious facility.</p>

          <p>Critics and scientists are raising alarms that the Trump administration's energy policies are setting back environmental progress by decades. The administration has been accused of using an "invented" national energy emergency to justify expanding oil, gas, and coal production while cutting support for green energy. These actions, including gutting tax credits for wind and solar and proposing to close key climate research labs, coincide with escalating climate-related disasters. Observers argue these policies disregard scientific evidence, endanger public health, and are driven by political allegiance to the fossil-fuel industry rather than economic or environmental sense.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new executive order from the Trump administration, titled "Restoring Gold Standard Science," is being criticized for undermining scientific integrity rather than strengthening it. The article argues that the order gives political appointees, not scientists, the power to define what constitutes reliable evidence, echoing tactics used by the tobacco industry to manufacture doubt. This approach allows officials to cast uncertainty on inconvenient findings, such as those related to climate change or chemical safety, by demanding unattainable levels of proof. Critics warn this fundamentally reshapes science to serve policy goals, rather than allowing policy to be guided by evidence.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has ordered the immediate evacuation of parts of Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, an area previously spared from ground offensives, causing widespread panic among residents and displaced families. The directive, delivered via leaflets, instructs people to move to the al-Mawasi coastal area and could signal an imminent military operation. This development has heightened fears for the safety of both civilians and Israeli hostages believed to be held in the city. The new orders come amid ongoing reports of civilian casualties at aid distribution points elsewhere in Gaza, exacerbating the severe humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>Scientists and health agencies are linking rising sea temperatures, a consequence of climate change, to an increased risk of Vibrio bacterial infections in European coastal waters like the Baltic and North Seas. These bacteria, which thrive in warm, low-salinity water, can cause vibriosis, a serious and potentially fatal illness, particularly for individuals with weakened immune systems. Infections typically occur from consuming raw shellfish or through open wounds exposed to contaminated water. While cases remain relatively rare, authorities are urging caution during heatwaves and advising the public on protective measures to avoid infection as environmental conditions become more favorable for the bacteria's growth.</p>

          <p>Recent conservative backlash against the new "Superman" film for portraying the hero as an immigrant overlooks the character's deeply leftist and socialist roots, according to comic book author Grant Morrison. Created in 1938 by the sons of Jewish immigrants, the original Superman was a "Champion of the Oppressed" who fought corrupt capitalists and tore down slums to demand better housing for the poor. This historical context reveals that Superman was conceived as a social justice warrior, a stark contrast to the purely patriotic figure he later became. The article argues that the character has always evolved to reflect the times.</p>

          <p>Prompted by Elon Musk's proposal for a new political party, this analysis examines the widespread American dissatisfaction with the current two-party system. While polls show a majority of voters desire more options, the U.S. single-winner electoral system creates a major obstacle, often rendering third-party votes as "spoilers" or wasted efforts. Political scientist Lee Drutman argues that this structure discourages ambitious candidates from running outside the two major parties. He suggests that a move to a proportional representation system with multi-member districts would be the most effective way to break the "doom loop" and allow for a more representative political landscape.</p>

          <p>Following the unexpected retirement of veteran receiver Mike Williams, Chargers receiver Quentin Johnston is confident in his ability to fill the void and deliver for the team. After a rookie season marked by dropped passes, Johnston showed significant improvement last year, leading the team with eight touchdowns. Now, with an even greater opportunity, he says his confidence is at an all-time high, supported by coaches and teammates. The departure of Williams puts more pressure on the Chargers' young receiving corps, but Johnston appears ready to embrace a larger role alongside standout Ladd McConkey.</p>

          <p>An epidemic of pitching injuries in baseball, particularly elbow ligament tears requiring Tommy John surgery, is causing alarm among medical experts and impacting players from youth leagues to the MLB. Dr. Keith Meister, the Texas Rangers' team physician, attributes the crisis to the relentless, industry-wide pursuit of higher velocity and spin rates at all costs. The problem is trickling down, with a 2015 study showing over half of these surgeries are performed on teenagers. While development labs offer advanced training, critics argue they contribute to a dangerous trend where young bodies are pushed beyond their limits, leading to career-threatening injuries.</p>

          <p>The U.S. imposition of high tariffs on Lesotho has devastated the nation's garment industry, which is a critical part of its economy and heavily reliant on exports to American brands. The policy has led to factory closures, mass unemployment, and widespread desperation among workers, many of whom are single mothers. Lesotho's government argues the tariffs effectively scrap the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), a U.S. policy designed to support African economies. The economic fallout is creating a national disaster, with tens of thousands of people losing their livelihoods and facing hunger in the small, impoverished African kingdom.

However, the study raises concerns, noting that a third of teens have discussed serious matters with AI instead of people and a quarter have shared personal information.

          <p>Following the British and Irish Lions' 27-19 first Test victory, much of the narrative has focused on the "desperation" of the Australian Wallabies to keep the series alive. However, this article questions how far desperation alone can carry a team that appeared outmatched for large portions of the game. While the Wallabies showed fight in the final 30 minutes, this was largely due to a period of uncharacteristic sloppiness from the Lions. The analysis suggests that if the Lions can maintain their early-game form, which was physically and creatively superior, they will likely win comfortably, as the Wallabies are an underdeveloped team.</p>

Acknowledging that the water sector is "broken" and the regulator Ofwat is "failing," the minister promised tougher measures, including potential prison sentences for non-compliant water company bosses. This marks the first time a clear target has been set on pollution spills, responding to widespread public outrage over the declining state of the nation's rivers and coastlines.

This development occurs as the two nations mark their 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations and follows a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping, who called for cooperation to counter "unilateral bullying."

          <p>A rare fossil discovery in northeastern China is challenging previous assumptions about the diet of pterosaurs, the flying reptiles that lived alongside dinosaurs. A team of paleontologists found the stomach contents of a Sinopterus atavismus, a type of pterosaur, preserved for the first time. The stomach contained phytoliths, which are microscopic mineral deposits from plants, as well as small quartz crystals likely used as gastroliths to help grind tough vegetation. This evidence strongly suggests that this species was herbivorous, rewriting the menu for these ancient creatures and providing new insights into the ecosystems they inhabited millions of years ago.</p>

This reversal, combined with President Trump's attempts to distance himself from his former friend, has only deepened suspicion among believers.
