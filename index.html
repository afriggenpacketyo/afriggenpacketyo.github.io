          <p>In closing arguments, Sean "Diddy" Combs's defense lawyer portrayed the music mogul as the victim of a "fake trial" and an overzealous prosecution. The attorney argued that the government exaggerated evidence, attempting to conflate a swinger lifestyle and recreational drug use with a serious racketeering conspiracy. The defense asserted that Combs is not guilty of the sex trafficking and racketeering charges he faces. This contrasts sharply with the prosecution's depiction of Combs as the leader of a violent criminal enterprise who used his power and influence to abuse women.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-3 in favor of a group of Maryland parents, affirming their right to opt their elementary-aged children out of instruction featuring books with LGBTQ themes on religious grounds. In the majority opinion, Justice Samuel Alito wrote that the school district's refusal to allow opt-outs imposed an unconstitutional burden on the parents' free exercise of religion. The dissenting justices warned that the decision could create administrative chaos for public schools and lead to a new wave of litigation over classroom materials.</p>

The author contends that by allowing parents to opt out of lessons with LGBTQ-themed books, schools will face immense administrative burdens and legal risks. To avoid potential lawsuits from anti-LGBTQ+ groups, the article predicts that many school districts will likely choose to exclude such books and related topics from their curriculum entirely, chilling speech and representation in the classroom.</p>

          <p>A review of Lorde's fourth album, "Virgin," describes it as a purposeful return to the electronic, rhythm-driven sound of her youth, set against a New York City backdrop. The article notes the album's focus on themes of desire, confusion, and intense self-reflection during a transitional period in her late 20s. While praising moments of musical magic and her unique conversational cadences, the reviewer finds the albumâ€™s thrill is sometimes muted by self-obsession and production that feels less radical than intended.</p>

The author contends that by limiting a court's ability to halt unconstitutional federal actions for all citizens, the decision makes it far more difficult to restrain a president's overreach.

This move to maintain nine oil rigs in the Permian Basin could help the company achieve its long-term production growth goals, though it places capital expenditure spending at the higher end of its guidance.

          <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda have signed a peace agreement in Washington, D.C., aimed at ending their long-standing conflict. The deal, brokered by the United States, calls for the disarmament of armed groups operating in eastern DR Congo, a region devastated by fighting that has killed thousands. While hailed as a major diplomatic success, details remain scarce, and previous peace accords have failed, leaving many questions about the withdrawal of troops and the demobilization of rebel groups.</p>

The move follows the Pac-12's recent announcement of a new multimedia rights deal with CBS, which reportedly encouraged Texas State to accept the invitation to join the reconstituted and rebuilding conference.</p>
