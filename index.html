          <p>Circle, the issuer of USDC stablecoin, filed for an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange, aiming for a valuation up to $5 billion.  This follows a failed SPAC merger in 2022. The IPO comes at a volatile time for tech stocks, but Circle's strong 2024 revenue and net income, along with a more crypto-friendly administration, boost its prospects.  A successful IPO would solidify Circle's position as a major player in the growing stablecoin market.  <i>(not investment advice)<br></i></p>

          <p>The Trump administration admitted to an administrative error in deporting Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, despite a 2019 ruling allowing him to stay in the US.  Garcia was among numerous individuals deported under an 18th-century wartime powers law, bypassing due process.  The administration's reliance on criteria like tattoos and clothing to identify gang members raises concerns about wrongful deportations of non-gang members. This highlights the dangers of suspending due process in immigration proceedings.</p>

          <p>Gold prices reached record highs this week, driven by investor anxieties surrounding President Trump's tariff policies and fears of a US recession.  The surge in gold, often seen as a safe haven asset, contrasts with the decline in the S&P 500. Analysts attribute the recent surge primarily to tariff-related uncertainty and global tensions.

          <p>Nina Jankowicz, head of the American Sunlight Project, criticized a House hearing investigating alleged government censorship under President Biden, calling the premise a fiction.  She argued that the hearing ignores the Trump administration's more significant assaults on free speech.  Republicans presented evidence suggesting suppression of right-wing views, while Democrats countered with examples of the Trump administration's actions against free speech. The hearing highlighted the deep partisan divide on the issue of censorship.</p>
