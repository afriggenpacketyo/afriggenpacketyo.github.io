          <p>President Trump's second term's first 100 days have been marked by a high number of executive orders, contrasting sharply with the few laws passed by Congress.  This approach has led to frustration among some Republicans in Congress who feel the legislative process is lagging. Democrats criticize Republicans for ceding power to the executive branch.
