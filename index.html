          <p>Top trade officials from the United States and China are scheduled to meet in London to discuss ways to resolve the ongoing trade dispute between the two economic superpowers. The U.S. delegation includes Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, while China will be represented by Vice Premier He Lifeng. These talks follow a recent phone call between President Trump and President Xi Jinping, both expressing a desire to avert a full-blown trade war after weeks of heightened tensions and uncertainty following Trump's announcement of import tariffs on China and other trading partners in April.

          <p>The FBI is seeking public assistance to identify a suspect who allegedly assaulted a federal officer and damaged government property during anti-ICE demonstrations in Los Angeles, offering a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to the suspect's arrest and conviction. The suspect reportedly threw rocks at law enforcement vehicles, injuring a federal officer and damaging vehicles. Amid the demonstrations against deportations and ICE raids targeting migrant workers, FBI Director Kash Patel warned that assaulting a law enforcement officer would result in jail time, regardless of background or cause. The Trump administration has deployed National Guard troops to Los Angeles, a move denounced by California Governor Gavin Newsom, who is filing a lawsuit against the federal deployment.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new travel ban, restricting entry to the U.S. for citizens from 12 countries, mainly in Africa and the Middle East, has taken effect amid escalating immigration enforcement. The ban affects citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, with heightened restrictions on people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela without valid visas. This new policy follows a previous, more disruptive travel ban during Trump's first term, which faced legal challenges and revisions. Immigration experts suggest this ban is more carefully designed to withstand legal scrutiny, focusing on visa application processes and citing national security concerns related to deficient screening and overstay rates.</p>

          <p>China's consumer prices have fallen for the fourth consecutive month in May, indicating that stimulus measures are not effectively boosting domestic consumption. The consumer price index dropped 0.1% year-on-year, while producer prices declined 3.3%, marking the steepest drop since July 2023, with price wars in the auto sector contributing to the downward pressure. Despite strong exports, economists emphasize the need for increased domestic demand to combat deflation, urging policymakers to implement more forceful and targeted stimulus measures. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng is scheduled to meet with U.S. trade negotiators in London for further discussions amid shaky trade relations. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nearly 350,000 nursing staff in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland are set to vote on a proposed 3.6% pay increase, with the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) already dismissing the offer as "grotesque." This vote is considered crucial in determining the next steps, including a potential ballot for strike action, as the RCN argues that the government has once again undervalued nursing. The Department of Health and Social Care maintains that the pay rise is the second above-inflation increase for NHS staff in the last 10 months, emphasizing their commitment to rebuilding the health service. Resident doctors in England are already being balloted on strike action over pay, potentially casting a shadow over the government's upcoming 10-year plan for the NHS in England.</p>

          <p>China's exports to the U.S. experienced a significant drop of 34.5% year-on-year in May, the sharpest decline since February 2020, due to the impact of prohibitive tariffs. Overall exports rose 4.8%, falling short of expectations, while imports plunged 3.4%, reflecting sluggish domestic demand, but the total trade surplus increased 25% to $103.2 billion. The decline in exports to the U.S. was partially offset by increased shipments to Southeast Asia, the European Union, and Africa, with rare earth exports dropping 5.7% amid tightened export controls. China's imports of soybeans surged to a record high, highlighting shifts in trade dynamics amid ongoing trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung agreed to build stable bilateral ties amid a severe strategic environment, expressing hope to meet in person soon. Japan's top tariff negotiator is arranging a U.S. trip for tariff talks ahead of the G7 summit, while four Japan SDF members were injured in a blast near the U.S. Kadena Air Base in Okinawa. The Japanese government is monitoring China's maritime activity after a Chinese aircraft carrier was spotted near Japan's easternmost island, and Japan's economy shrank in the first quarter, marking the first contraction in a year. Princess Kako visited a nursing home in Brazil to interact with locals of Japanese descent, and Prime Minister Ishiba was criticized for labeling women in eastern Japan as "strong."</p>

          <p>The UK government is proposing to expand the ban on bottom trawling, a destructive fishing method, from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 of its offshore Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). Environment Secretary Steve Reed stated that urgent action is needed to prevent irreversible destruction of the oceans, and the announcement coincides with the UN Ocean Conference in France. The proposal, subject to a 12-week industry consultation, aims to protect rare marine animals and the seabed, with the government having carried out detailed assessments into the harms caused by bottom trawling. Pressure is also mounting for more countries to ratify the High Seas Treaty at the Ocean Conference to protect 30% of the ocean.</p>

It is hoped the talks will build on the preliminary agreement struck in Geneva that removed the effective trade embargo between the two nations, and President Trump has said that Xi had agreed to resume shipments to the US of rare earths minerals and magnets.

          <p>An explosion occurred near the U.S. military's Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, Japan, slightly injuring four Japan Ground Self-Defense Force members who were working at a depot. The explosion took place while SDF personnel were preparing for bomb disposal operations, causing finger lacerations and potential hearing damage to those nearby. The incident appears to have occurred at an SDF storage facility for unexploded bombs in the base's ammunition depot area. Local authorities have not issued an evacuation order, and there is no risk of further explosions or fire, with Okinawa remaining home to the bulk of U.S. military facilities in Japan.</p>

The report of the slowdown comes just hours before another round of trade talks between US and Chinese officials in London, where China exported $28.8 billion worth of goods to the US, down from $33 billion in April. Trump lowered his 145% tariffs on Chinese goods to 30% for 90 days to allow for talks while China also reduced its taxes on US goods from 125% to 10%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Geely Auto, the mainland's second-largest carmaker, will cease building new plants amid excess capacity worldwide, a move that is likely to ripple across the sector as most Chinese companies are finding it difficult to make profits. Chairman Li Shufu announced the decision at the Chongqing Auto Show, stating that the company would focus on improving its technological capabilities to become a key player in the future of mobility. His comments come as carmakers were mired in a brutal price war on the mainland, with leading players such as BYD, Geely and start-up Leapmotor slashing prices of 70 models by as much as 20 per cent in the last week of May to retain market share. Chinese carmakers’ discounts more than doubled to a record 16.8 per cent in April from 8.3 per cent in 2024, according to a JPMorgan Chase report in May.</p>
