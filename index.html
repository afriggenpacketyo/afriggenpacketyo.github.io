          <p>Hurricane Erin, once a category five storm, has been downgraded to category three as it moves north of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. While its wind speeds have decreased, the US National Hurricane Center notes the storm's size is growing, with tropical-storm-force winds extending 205 miles from its center. The hurricane is not expected to make landfall on the US mainland but will generate life-threatening surf and rip currents along the East Coast, with Florida and the mid-Atlantic states facing the most dangerous conditions. Storm-related hazards like flash flooding are also anticipated in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.</p>

          <p>Several Chinese universities, including Central South University, are experiencing online criticism for hosting Darius Longarino, a research scholar from Yale Law School. The backlash stems from social media users highlighting Longarino's past posts on X, where he criticized Beijing's policies in the Xinjiang region. In response to the public pressure, at least three universities have removed online posts related to events where Longarino was an invited speaker. The controversy underscores the sensitive political climate surrounding academic exchanges and discussions of China's human rights record.</p>

          <p>A humanoid robot named Unitree R1, branded for KraneShares' new AI and robotics ETF (KOID), drew significant public attention by visiting a Hoka sneaker store on Fifth Avenue in New York City. The event, part of a promotional campaign, saw the robot trying on shoes, posing for photos, and even grabbing a hot dog. Although remote-controlled for this appearance, the R1 is fully programmable and highlights the increasing integration of advanced robotics into public life. This stunt serves as a tangible preview of how such technology may soon assist in retail and other everyday environments.</p>

          <p>A unique program in Mexico's Zacatecas state is helping elderly parents of undocumented workers obtain temporary visas to visit their children in the United States, facilitating emotional reunions after decades apart. The article follows José Antonio Rodríguez, who had not seen his parents in 24 years since leaving for California, as he prepares for their arrival in East Los Angeles. This initiative highlights the profound human impact of immigration policies and the deep-seated desire for family connection across borders. The program faces challenges, as the U.S. approved only a small fraction of visa applications this year.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the transformation of a former industrial area in Washington, D.C., once known as "Swampoodle," into a thriving neighborhood called NoMa (North of Massachusetts Avenue). This redevelopment, which began in the 1990s and 2000s, is presented as a prime example of "Yes In My Back Yard" (YIMBY) principles, emphasizing pro-housing and development policies. The rebranding and revitalization efforts were designed to attract new residents and businesses to the area adjacent to the city's main railway station. The success of NoMa reflects a broader trend in urban planning focused on dense, mixed-use development.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stated that Russia's ongoing rejection of a ceasefire is complicating efforts to achieve a peace agreement. His comments came after a summit where Russia reportedly demanded Ukraine cede the entire Donetsk region, a condition Kyiv has consistently rejected without robust security guarantees. Zelenskyy is preparing to meet with U.S. President Trump, who has urged Ukraine to "make the deal" with Russia. Meanwhile, Russian drone and missile attacks continue across Ukraine, underscoring the difficulty of negotiating while under active assault.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has suspended all visitor visas for individuals from Gaza, pending a comprehensive review of its procedures. This decision follows social media posts by far-right influencer Laura Loomer, who made unsubstantiated claims against a group of critically wounded Gazan children and their families brought to the U.S. for medical treatment by a charity. The move has been praised by some Republican figures but condemned by humanitarian organizations like the Palestine Children's Relief Fund, which warned of a devastating impact on children needing lifesaving care. The suspension highlights the influence of online campaigns on administration policy.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury is investigating the distribution of millions of dollars in state grants among Hartford-area nonprofits, focusing on State Sen. Douglas McCrory's influence. The probe specifically examines large grants and consulting fees directed to an organization founded by Sonserae Cicero-Hamlin, described as a close personal friend of the senator. Concerns about a potential conflict of interest were raised internally at the Blue Hills Civic Association, a major nonprofit that funneled funds to Cicero-Hamlin's group before its own operations were shuttered.

          <p>The proliferation of first-person-view (FPV) drones on the Ukrainian front line has created a deadly "kill zone" extending up to 12 miles from the front, severely complicating the evacuation of wounded soldiers. Medics report that the constant threat from these precise and far-reaching drones endangers both the injured and the rescue crews, leading to significant delays that can prove fatal. This technological shift in warfare means soldiers with non-critical injuries may be stranded for days, and most injuries now stem from drone strikes rather than traditional combat.

          <p>Celine Song's new film, "Materialists," explores the modern dating landscape through the eyes of a professional matchmaker who views romance through a pragmatic, market-based lens. The article's author reflects on how the movie's depiction of "emotional capitalism," where relationships are weighed for their return on investment, mirrors contemporary realities shaped by dating apps and economic pressures. The film's themes resonate with how financial instability and wealth inequality can make a partner's economic status a primary consideration, blurring the lines between love and pragmatism. The author suggests this transactional approach is a symptom of broader societal issues.</p>

          <p>The British horse racing industry has announced an unprecedented one-day strike on September 10, canceling four scheduled fixtures to protest a proposed government tax hike. The campaign, "Axe The Racing Tax," opposes the Treasury's plan to increase the tax rate on betting on horse racing to align it with online gaming. The British Horseracing Authority (BHA) warns that this change would have a "destructive impact," projecting a £330 million loss in revenue and risking nearly 2,800 jobs in its first year. This is the first time the sport has voluntarily ceased racing in protest of government policy.</p>

The article argues that life experience is crucial for understanding the complex human emotions depicted in classical art.

          <p>A federal immigration agent discharged their firearm at a vehicle during a "targeted enforcement operation" in San Bernardino, prompting a response from local police. The driver of the vehicle later contacted police, stating that masked men had shot at him after breaking his car window. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson claimed the agent fired in self-defense after the driver refused to exit and drove his vehicle at two officers, injuring them. The incident, partially captured on video, has led to accusations of abuse of power from an immigrant advocacy group.</p>

Though he sold the establishment in 2009, its legacy as an old-world Hollywood institution has endured. His passing marks the end of an era for a quintessential Los Angeles landmark.</p>
