        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The suspect in the Midtown Manhattan shooting, Shane Tamura, allegedly carried a rambling three-page note that mentioned the NFL and claimed he suffered from CTE. Police sources indicate the note asked for his brain to be studied for the degenerative disease, which is linked to repeated head trauma. The shooting took place at 345 Park Avenue, where the NFL has its headquarters, and one of the league's employees was injured in the attack. Authorities also revealed that Tamura had a documented mental health history in Nevada, including two crisis holds. The note adds a new dimension to the investigation into the motive behind the tragic event.</p>

          <p>A gunman armed with a high-powered rifle killed an NYPD officer and three civilians inside a Midtown Manhattan office building before taking his own life. The suspect was identified as Shane D. Tamura, 27, from Las Vegas, who reportedly had a history of mental health issues. The slain officer, Didarul Islam, was a four-year veteran of the force and a father of two with a third child on the way. The attack, which also left another person in critical condition, occurred at 345 Park Avenue, a building that houses offices for several major companies, including the NFL. The motive for the shooting remains under investigation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Destructive thunderstorms with winds exceeding 90 mph have swept across the Midwest, causing significant damage to buildings and infrastructure, leaving over 170,000 customers without power. This severe weather is fueled by a strong heat dome centered over the South, which has put more than 165 million Americans under alerts for dangerous heat and humidity. Heat indices are projected to reach as high as 116 degrees in some southern states. The weather system is also degrading air quality along the I-95 corridor, compounded by smoke from Canadian wildfires. Forecasters expect the extreme heat to recede to the Gulf Coast and Southwest by the weekend.</p>

          <p>Shares of Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk plummeted by 15% after it lowered its full-year sales and profit guidance. The company attributed the revised forecast to weaker-than-expected growth for its popular obesity drug, Wegovy, and its diabetes treatment, Ozempic, in the United States. Key factors cited for the slowdown include the persistent use of compounded alternatives to its GLP-1 drugs. The announcement signals potential headwinds for the blockbuster weight-loss medications, impacting investor confidence in one of Europe's most valuable companies.</p>

          <p>The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a leading international authority, has issued a stark alert stating that the "worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in the Gaza Strip." The report warns of potential widespread death without an immediate cessation of hostilities and unimpeded humanitarian access. While not a formal famine declaration, the alert highlights that key thresholds for acute malnutrition and food consumption have been met in parts of Gaza. The crisis has been exacerbated by ongoing conflict and blockades, leading to a collapse of essential services and reports of hunger-related deaths, particularly among children.</p>

          <p>Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to an "immediate and unconditional" ceasefire following five days of deadly border clashes that killed at least 35 people and displaced thousands. The truce, mediated by Malaysia, was met with cautious optimism, though the Thai army reported violations by Cambodian forces shortly after it took effect. Analysts suggest the conflict served domestic political goals for leaders in both nations, potentially incentivizing them to uphold the peace. However, the lack of a third-party monitoring mechanism raises concerns about the deal's long-term viability. US pressure, including threats of trade tariffs, is also believed to have played a role in bringing the two sides to an agreement.</p>

However, these content restrictions only apply when using EE's mobile data network and will not function when a device is connected to Wi-Fi. Despite this limitation, EE states it is the first major UK network to offer such dedicated plans for under-18s, which also include protections against scam calls and aim to help parents navigate the challenges of their children's smartphone use.</p>

          <p>UnitedHealth Group issued a 2025 earnings outlook that fell significantly short of Wall Street expectations, signaling that the health insurance industry continues to struggle with elevated medical costs. The company's shares dropped following the announcement, which anticipates a 2025 medical care ratio between 89% and 89.5%, higher than desired. This trend is driven by more seniors undergoing procedures delayed during the pandemic and cuts to Medicare funding.

This approach has allegedly undermined Israel's war effort, shredded its international standing, and directly contributed to the current humanitarian crisis.

          <p>A significant policy conflict appears to be emerging within the Trump administration between the Department of Health and Human Services, led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and the Environmental Protection Agency. Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement, which focuses on reducing chronic disease by eliminating toxins, is at odds with the EPA's actions to deregulate pesticides and other chemicals like PFAS. Supporters of MAHA are growing impatient, urging Kennedy to challenge the EPA's agenda, which they see as protecting polluters. However, observers note that the EPA holds more regulatory authority, potentially leaving Kennedy's health ambitions stymied by his own administration's environmental policies.</p>

          <p>According to a Chinese state media report, a People's Liberation Army Air Force unit operating the J-20 stealth fighter conducted a flight through the Tsushima Strait. This narrow and strategic waterway separates Japan and South Korea, connecting the Sea of Japan with the East China Sea. Notably, the transit of China's most advanced combat aircraft through this heavily monitored chokepoint was not publicly reported by either Tokyo or Seoul. The incident highlights the advanced stealth capabilities of the J-20 and raises questions about regional surveillance and detection abilities.</p>

Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of leader Kim Jong Un, conveyed that while the personal relationship between her brother and President Trump is "not bad," it cannot be used as a basis for negotiations aimed at disarmament. This declaration signals a hardened stance from Pyongyang, effectively ruling out complete denuclearization as a topic for discussion.

          <p>President Donald Trump capped a five-day trip to Scotland by officially opening a new golf course bearing his name in Balmedie. The visit, which also included rounds of golf at his Turnberry resort and a meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, was largely focused on promoting his family's luxury properties. During the trip, Trump and Starmer reached a framework for a major trade deal between the U.S. and the European Union, though many details are still to be finalized. The new course, designed by his son Eric, adds to the Trump Organization's portfolio and serves as another example of the president using his office to promote his personal brand.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's proposed blanket tariffs, set to begin August 1, could lead to higher prices on certain imported foods for American consumers, according to a new analysis. The Tax Foundation reports that while the tariffs aim to boost demand for domestic products, many items like Brazilian coffee and bananas are not produced in the U.S. in sufficient quantities to meet demand. This would likely force consumers to pay more for these goods. The analysis highlights that top imported foods such as coffee, fish, and baked goods, which account for over a fifth of U.S. food imports, could see significant price movements in the coming months.</p>

          <p>A painstakingly restored de Havilland DH106 Comet, the world's first passenger jet, is on display at the de Havilland Aircraft Museum near London. The aircraft, which first flew commercially in 1952, ushered in the jet age with unprecedented speed and comfort but was plagued by a series of catastrophic design flaws. After several fatal mid-air disasters, investigations revealed that the plane's metal skin could not withstand repeated pressurization, leading to explosive decompression. The restoration project brings the pioneering jetliner's luxurious interior back to life, offering a unique glimpse into both the glamour and the tragic lessons of early commercial jet travel.</p>

          <p>In this opinion piece, the author argues that the Trump administration's recent termination of over 1,200 federally funded research grants focused on LGBTQ+ health is a dangerous move that will weaken evidence-based care for all Americans. The cuts, justified by the administration as targeting "unscientific" research, risk leaving significant health disparities affecting millions of people unaddressed. The author draws parallels to historical neglects in research for Black Americans and women, which delayed medical progress and worsened health outcomes. The article contends that this exclusion sends a message that the health of nearly 32 million LGBTQ+ Americans is not a priority, with consequences that will be measured in suffering and lives lost.</p>

He recalls feeling that his father "got lucky" by avoiding prison time, which would have deprived him of a parent during his recovery.

          <p>This article explores the growing cultural and political fixation on testosterone, from its promotion by figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to its central role in online "manosphere" communities. It traces the history of the hormone, noting the paradox that the chemical essence of masculinity is present in all sexes, creating tension with rigid gender binaries. The analysis argues that testosterone has become a commodity to quantify and enhance a perceived masculinity in crisis. This fascination reflects broader societal anxieties about gender fluidity, health, and the increasingly blurred lines between what is considered natural and artificial in a chemically saturated world.</p>

This has created a high-stakes political battle over redistricting, a process typically done only once per decade.

          <p>The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) has directed service providers to stop enrolling new participants in its time-limited subsidy program, a crucial tool for helping homeless individuals afford rent. Citing budget cuts from the state and the expiration of one-time grants, LAHSA is ramping down a program that providers have called a "superhighway out of homelessness." The change is expected to create a bottleneck in the system, leading to longer stays in shelters and on the streets. This reduction in services comes despite voters recently approving a new sales tax to address the homelessness crisis, much of which is allocated to new construction rather than immediate services.</p>
