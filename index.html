        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A volunteer at the Church of England details a harrowing stalking campaign initiated by a lay preacher after he rejected her advances. The report reveals that when the victim, Jay Hulme, sought help, he was initially disbelieved by the Bishop of Leicester, who instead accused him of witchcraft. The abuse escalated for months, with both the police and the Church failing to act decisively, despite a growing body of evidence and complaints from others. Eventually, the stalker was convicted and the Bishop apologized, but the experience left the victim with significant trauma and financial hardship.</p>

          <p>Police in Somerset are assessing comments made by musical acts Bob Vylan and Kneecap during their performances at the Glastonbury Festival. The government strongly condemned rap-punk duo Bob Vylan after they led chants calling for "death to the IDF," which the BBC also deemed "deeply offensive" and will not make available on its iPlayer service. The Culture Secretary has sought an explanation from the BBC regarding its due diligence.

During his outing, he recorded a 101.7 mph fastball, the fastest of his major league career, and allowed only one hit and a walk while striking out one. However, his performance on the mound was not matched at the plate, as he went hitless in four at-bats with three strikeouts.

This year's events are characterized by a more defiant tone, mixing jubilant celebration with political protest in response to recent rollbacks of LGBTQ+ friendly policies under the Trump administration. Organizers have noted a significant drop in corporate sponsorship, with companies like PepsiCo and Nissan reducing or pulling their support. The theme for the Manhattan march is “Rise Up: Pride in Protest,” reflecting the community's current mood of resistance.</p>

This phenomenon, described by one official as "ceng ceng jia ma" or adding extra layers of control, has prompted department heads to issue informal bans on eating out to avoid scrutiny. The lifestyle change reflects a cautious atmosphere among public officials who are navigating an ever-shifting landscape of anti-corruption and austerity rules designed to curb lavish spending and project an image of fiscal responsibility.</p>

          <p>President Trump's extensive spending package, dubbed the "big, beautiful bill," narrowly cleared a key procedural vote in the Senate late Saturday night after a period of high drama. Republican leadership managed to secure a 51-49 vote to proceed after convincing a few conservative holdouts, with Senator Ron Johnson ultimately switching his vote to a 'yes'. The victory for Majority Leader John Thune sets up a final vote, but Democrats are planning to force a full reading of the nearly 1,000-page bill, which could take over 15 hours and delay its final passage.</p>

Japan is prioritizing the mitigation of the 27.5% tariff on its cars, but the U.S. has shown no indication of reducing these sector-based tariffs.

The policy, part of a broader 10-year NHS plan, will require businesses to report on healthy food sales to increase accountability.

          <p>U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts issued a warning about the dangers of heated political rhetoric directed at judges from politicians. Speaking at a judicial conference, Roberts stated that when judges are wrapped up in political disputes, there is a risk that someone might be incited to violence, referencing serious threats against judges. Without naming individuals, he alluded to past instances where he felt compelled to condemn statements from both high-level Democrats and Republicans, urging political figures on both sides to be mindful of the potential consequences of their words.</p>

          <p>Following a disappointing single-medal performance at the Paris Olympics, Japan's national swimming team is implementing a new training strategy to prepare for the 2028 Los Angeles Games. Athletes are now living together in a "virtual athletes' village" during domestic competitions to simulate the Olympic environment and improve their ability to perform under unfamiliar or challenging conditions. The initiative aims to build team morale and resilience, helping swimmers, particularly younger ones, adapt to pressures like travel delays without it affecting their results in the pool.</p>

This public condemnation reopens a recent and fiery conflict between Musk, a former government advisor and major GOP donor, and the Trump administration as it pushes to pass the bill.

          <p>Tens of thousands of anti-government protesters clashed with police in Belgrade, Serbia, during the largest demonstration in recent months calling for an early election and an end to President Aleksandar Vucic's rule. The student-led rally saw riot police deploy tear gas and stun grenades, leading to dozens of arrests. President Vucic has dismissed the protests as a foreign plot and refused calls for a snap election. The demonstrations, which have been ongoing for months, were sparked by a deadly railway station roof collapse that protesters attribute to government corruption.</p>

          <p>China's decision to halt exports of rare earths is accelerating international efforts to develop alternative production capacities to reduce global reliance on the dominant supplier.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 21:23:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Urban areas often experience significantly higher temperatures than the surrounding countryside due to a phenomenon known as the "urban heat island" effect. This occurs because cities are dominated by hard, dark surfaces like asphalt roads and buildings, which absorb and retain the sun's energy rather than reflecting it. This stored heat is slowly released, warming the air, especially at night. The effect is compounded by a lack of vegetation and water for natural cooling, as well as waste heat from vehicles and air conditioning, making city dwellers more vulnerable during heatwaves.</p>

          <p>Through a poignant audio diary, a 28-year-old English teacher in Gaza, Hanya Aljamal, provides a first-hand account of her life since the war began. Displaced multiple times and now living with her family in a tiny apartment, she describes the daily psychological torture of drone sounds, malnourishment, and the constant fear of explosions. She reflects on losing her former life, her students, and her colleagues, stating that the trauma is so immense that "grieving is a luxury" she cannot afford. Her diary offers a deeply personal look at the human cost of the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>This article explores the difficult choices parents face with teenage vaping addiction, highlighting one mother who illegally buys vapes for her children to control their nicotine intake and ensure the products are from a reputable source. This comes as a ban on disposable vapes, intended to curb youth vaping, appears to have had little impact. Health experts at a new NHS vaping clinic for children note that addiction is a serious issue, with some teens experiencing withdrawal during school hours. The situation underscores the complexity of tackling youth addiction in the face of a powerful vaping industry.</p>

          <p>Israeli military strikes across the Gaza Strip have killed at least 72 people since Friday, according to Hamas-run health officials, with casualties reported near a stadium sheltering displaced people and in a tent camp. This continued violence comes as President Trump told reporters that a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas could be reached "within the next week." While the Trump administration has been pushing for a pause in fighting, a deal has remained elusive. An Israeli official is expected to travel to Washington for further talks on the matter.</p>
