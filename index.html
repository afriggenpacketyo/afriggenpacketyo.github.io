          <p>AI chipmaker Cerebras Systems has officially withdrawn its plans for an Initial Public Offering (IPO), a decision announced just days after successfully securing $1.1 billion in a private funding round that valued the company at $8.1 billion. The company had initially filed for an IPO over a year ago, aiming to directly challenge Nvidia in the competitive market for generative AI processors. A spokesperson clarified that Cerebras still intends to go public in the future, explaining that the original prospectus had become outdated due to the rapid advancements in AI technology. This strategic move highlights the dynamic and evolving funding landscape within the high-growth artificial intelligence sector, with the company prioritizing flexibility over an immediate public offering.</p>

          <p>Hamas has formally communicated its conditional agreement to release Israeli hostages as part of a US-backed peace plan aimed at ending the conflict in Gaza, while also seeking further negotiations on specific aspects of the proposal. The group accepted the provision for a Palestinian technocratic body to administer Gaza, but notably did not explicitly agree to disarm or relinquish future governance roles, which is a key stipulation of the plan. Despite President Trump's optimistic pronouncements and his call for Israel to halt bombing to ensure safe hostage release, significant obstacles remain. This article underscores the complex and fragile nature of the ongoing peace efforts, with high death tolls and deep-seated disagreements still posing major challenges.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recently unveiled Gaza peace plan, presented alongside Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, is undergoing a "reality check" despite initial optimistic claims of achieving "eternal peace." While Hamas has expressed willingness to release hostages and accept a technocratic Palestinian government in Gaza, fundamental disagreements persist, especially concerning Hamas's disarmament and the timeline for Israel's troop withdrawal. Analysts suggest that Netanyahu's apparent backing of the plan might be a strategic maneuver to deflect blame if Hamas ultimately rejects it, as contentious issues like the prospect of a Palestinian state remain unresolved. This article highlights the intricate political dynamics and the formidable challenges that continue to impede a genuine resolution to the conflict.</p>

          <p>Storm Amy has unleashed severe weather across the UK, recording wind gusts approaching 100mph in exposed regions and bringing heavy rainfall, prompting widespread safety warnings. An Amber weather alert, signifying a potential risk to life from flying debris, was issued for large areas of Northern Ireland and northern Scotland, leading to immediate precautions. The storm has caused extensive disruption, including power outages affecting approximately 50,000 properties, numerous cancellations of flights and train services, and the closure of hundreds of schools. Furthermore, Network Rail Scotland reported over 60 incidents within the initial two hours of the storm, with a derelict building notably collapsing in Glasgow city center, underscoring the storm's destructive impact.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has reaffirmed a lower court's decision, effectively blocking the Trump administration's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship, ruling it as likely unconstitutional. The First Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the plaintiff states, echoing previous judicial setbacks for the administration on this issue. The court's extensive 100-page ruling referenced a historical pattern of failed attempts to restrict birthright citizenship, from the Dred Scott case to the Chinese Exclusion Act, thereby reinforcing the long-standing tradition of recognizing citizenship based on birth within the United States. This legal outcome maintains the existing interpretation of constitutional citizenship, despite the administration's prior efforts to seek a Supreme Court review.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is rolling out a new initiative that offers migrant teenagers aged 14 and older a $2,500 stipend if they voluntarily choose to return to their home countries. This program, outlined in an internal federal notice from the Department of Health and Human Services, is designed to encourage self-deportations, although children from Mexico are specifically excluded from the offer. The financial incentive is purportedly intended to aid reintegration efforts upon their return, but requires approval from an immigration judge. Critics, including legal attorneys, have voiced strong concerns that providing cash payouts to vulnerable children could unduly influence their decisions, potentially endangering their lives and undermining their right to comprehensive legal counsel.</p>

          <p>Sean 'Diddy' Combs has been sentenced to over four years in prison for prostitution-related charges, concluding a high-profile case in the same courtroom where he was previously acquitted of sex trafficking and racketeering.

Following the pronouncement of his sentence, a visibly subdued Combs turned to his family, appearing to mouth the words, "I love you, I'm sorry."

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin swiftly condemned Abughazaleh's actions as "dishonest, desperate and demonizing law enforcement" aimed at obstructing justice.

This decision overrides earlier injunctions from lower courts that had temporarily halted the termination of these protections. The ruling means thousands of Venezuelans, currently living and working legally in the U.S., face the risk of losing their jobs, detention, and deportation to a country the U.S. government deems unsafe. Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor, and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, with Jackson criticizing the court's repeated interference in cases where lives hang in the balance.</p>

          <p>Georgia-based journalist Mario Guevara has been deported to El Salvador, a devastating outcome after spending over 100 days in U.S. custody following his arrest while covering a protest. Although the initial charges against him were dismissed, ICE subsequently detained him and refused his release, with a last-minute appeal to stay in the U.S. being denied. Guevara's family expressed profound "shock and disbelief" at not being granted an opportunity to say goodbye. The ACLU strongly condemned the government's actions, characterizing his prolonged detention and deportation as unlawful and a "tragic outcome" for a journalist reporting on law enforcement, raising significant concerns about press freedom.</p>

Furthermore, tech giants including Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon are increasingly integrating and investing in this advanced technology, fueling investor interest. While proponents highlight quantum computing's potential to solve problems beyond classical computers, experts caution that a widespread "real breakout" is still several years away.

          <p>Google is implementing layoffs affecting dozens of workers at its Sunnyvale offices, impacting roles across user experience, software engineering, and business program management. These job reductions are part of a broader trend observed throughout the tech industry, driven by proactive measures to prepare for a potential economic recession and the increasing efficiencies gained from integrating artificial intelligence. Other major tech companies, including Salesforce, Intel, Microsoft, and Meta, have also reduced their workforces while simultaneously escalating investments in AI this year. Analysts suggest that AI's advanced capabilities in areas like coding and design significantly boost productivity, consequently reducing the need for as many human employees unless overall workloads expand dramatically.</p>

The White House has issued a stark warning of potential mass layoffs for federal workers if the shutdown continues, indicating that cuts would target agencies deemed misaligned with its "country first" agenda. The central point of contention remains healthcare funding, with Democrats advocating for health insurance subsidies and Republicans accusing them of attempting to provide healthcare to undocumented immigrants. This prolonged deadlock is accumulating significant economic consequences, including estimated GDP losses and rising unemployment, as both political parties continue to assign blame.</p>
