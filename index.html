          <p>A British woman has tragically died following a white-water rafting incident on the Guisane river in the French Alps. She fell from her raft during an organized trip and was later found on the riverbank before being airlifted to a hospital, where she passed away. French authorities have opened an involuntary manslaughter investigation to determine the circumstances surrounding the accident. The UK Foreign Office has confirmed it is in contact with local authorities and providing support to the family.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly called for the Washington Commanders NFL team to immediately change its name back to the Washington Redskins. In a social media post, he also urged the Cleveland Guardians MLB team to return to its former name, the Indians. Trump argued that the previous names represented strength and that Native American communities want the change to happen, claiming their heritage is being taken away. The teams changed their names in 2020 and 2021, respectively, following years of criticism and pressure from advocacy groups.</p>

          <p>A protest outside the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, which is used to house asylum seekers, escalated into disorder with demonstrators throwing bottles and smoke flares at police vehicles. The unrest follows the recent arrest of an asylum seeker in connection with alleged sexual assaults in the town. In response to the disorder, Essex Police have implemented a Section 60AA order, allowing them to require the removal of face coverings. Authorities have stated they will deal robustly with any criminal behavior while respecting the right to peaceful protest.</p>

          <p>Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons confirmed that his agents will arrest anyone they encounter who is in the U.S. illegally, including those without criminal records, in so-called "collateral" arrests. In an interview, Lyons defended the controversial practice of agents wearing masks, stating it is a necessary safety measure for officers and their families despite concerns about accountability. He also noted that ICE is cracking down on companies that hire unauthorized workers, framing it as an effort to combat labor exploitation. These policies are part of the Trump administration's broader immigration enforcement strategy.</p>

          <p>A tragic incident at Dillon Falls on the Deschutes River in Oregon has left one person dead and two others missing. A group of six people were swept over the 15-foot waterfall, a popular but dangerous section of the river known for its churning rapids. Emergency responders were able to rescue three individuals who were then transported to the hospital. Search efforts for the two missing people were paused overnight and are scheduled to resume, as authorities work to notify the victims' families.</p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are set to fully deploy a new laser-based air defense system, known as Iron Beam, by the end of 2025. This system is designed to intercept short-range rockets and drones at a fraction of the cost of existing Iron Dome interceptors, potentially altering the economic and psychological dynamics of the conflict. While Iron Beam offers a faster, cheaper defense against immediate threats, it is not yet capable of stopping long-range ballistic missiles. The deployment marks a significant technological advancement, though producing enough batteries for comprehensive coverage will take time.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has stated he will not resign, despite exit polls projecting that his ruling coalition has lost its majority in the upper house of parliament. The election results reflect public frustration over rising prices, potential U.S. tariffs, and a series of political scandals that have plagued the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Losing the majority in the upper house, following a previous loss in the more powerful lower house, could undermine the coalition's ability to govern effectively and potentially trigger a leadership challenge within the LDP.</p>

Reed acknowledged that the water sector is "broken" and stated that regulation must change, though he ruled out nationalization.

The trip comes after Vance has made several critical statements about the UK and European governments, accusing them of suppressing free speech and failing to control migration. His choice of the Cotswolds, an affluent area popular with tourists, presents a contrast to the Appalachian setting of his well-known memoir. The visit follows President Donald Trump's own stay in Scotland.</p>
