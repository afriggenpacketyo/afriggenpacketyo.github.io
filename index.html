          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the cost of borrowing through a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has decreased. The article provides specific monthly cost examples for an $80,000 line of credit, demonstrating that current payments are notably lower compared to previous months. It highlights the potential savings for homeowners but also advises them to carefully consider the variable interest rate of a HELOC against the predictability of a fixed-rate home equity loan before making a decision.

          <p>With a government shutdown looming, political tensions in Washington have intensified as Republican and Democratic leaders publicly blame each other for the stalemate. Republicans are advocating for a "clean" short-term funding bill, which would extend current spending levels without policy changes. In contrast, Democrats are insisting that any agreement must include key healthcare priorities, such as restoring certain Medicaid funds and extending Affordable Care Act subsidies. The ongoing dispute leaves the government on track to cease many operations at the midnight deadline.</p>

          <p>This article explains the "7-year rule" as defined by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which mandates that most negative financial information, including delinquent credit card debt, must be removed from a consumer's credit report after seven years. It clarifies that while the removal of this information can significantly improve an individual's credit score, the underlying debt is not legally extinguished. The article also notes that the statute of limitations for lawsuits over debt varies by state and that making a payment can sometimes restart this legal clock.</p>

          <p>The FBI conducted a raid in Portland, Oregon, resulting in the detention of four individuals who are in the U.S. illegally. This action was linked to an incident where a laser was aimed at a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) helicopter. During the search of the residence, federal agents successfully recovered the laser pointer allegedly used in the offense. The event occurs amid a period of heightened tensions and ongoing protests at local Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities, with officials emphasizing a zero-tolerance policy for targeting law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Imelda has strengthened into a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean, located north of the Bahamas. Current forecast tracks predict the storm will move away from the U.S. mainland and head towards Bermuda, which is now under a hurricane warning. The National Hurricane Center anticipates that Imelda will continue to intensify over the next 48 hours. Swells generated by the hurricane are expected to create life-threatening surf and dangerous rip current conditions along much of the U.S. East Coast.</p>

          <p>In a highly unusual address to the nation's top military commanders, President Donald Trump suggested using American cities as "training grounds" for the military to handle what he termed a "war from within" caused by civil disturbances. The speech coincided with an announcement from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth declaring an end to "woke" culture at the Pentagon. Hegseth's reforms include implementing stricter, universal physical fitness standards and eliminating diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, signaling a major cultural and operational shift for the U.S. armed forces.</p>

In a letter to the Education Secretary, they argue that the administration is not providing the legally required 60-day notice before initiating the seizure, which denies borrowers the opportunity to make arrangements to prevent it. With collection activities resuming after a pandemic-related pause, the lawmakers contend that millions of borrowers are at risk and that notices issued years ago are no longer valid.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture has issued a public health alert regarding a deadly listeria outbreak connected to specific pre-cooked pasta meals sold at Walmart and Trader Joe's. The outbreak has tragically resulted in four deaths and at least 20 illnesses across 15 states. The source of the contamination is believed to be pasta from a supplier, Nate's Fine Foods. Health authorities are strongly advising consumers who have purchased the identified products to dispose of them immediately and to thoroughly clean any refrigerators or surfaces they may have touched.</p>

          <p>A new Hulu documentary, "Lilith Fair: Building a Mystery," examines the cultural impact of the pioneering all-female touring music festival from the late 1990s. The film aims to correct the often-mocking caricatures of the festival by highlighting its origins as a practical and powerful response to a music industry that frequently marginalized female artists. It showcases how Lilith Fair successfully cultivated a unique environment of community, safety, and collective empowerment for both its performers and its diverse audience, a spirit many feel is absent today.</p>

It presents concrete examples, including depositing $24,000 in a one-year CD or $8,200 in a three-year CD, to illustrate how current rates can still yield significant earnings. The article stresses the importance of acting quickly to lock in these rates before they likely decline further due to anticipated future rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

At game time in Chavez Ravine, temperatures are predicted to be in the upper 60s to low 70s. While these conditions are not typically associated with high-scoring, home-run-heavy games, the weather is expected to warm slightly if the series is extended to a third game.</p>

          <p>An underground music scene is flourishing in Russia, with artists openly performing anti-war and anti-government songs despite facing Kremlin bans and the risk of imprisonment. These musicians are drawing crowds and becoming symbols of political resistance, reminiscent of the role rock music played in the final years of the Soviet Union. The government's attempts to suppress these artists, including arrests and labeling them as "foreign agents," have often had the opposite effect, increasing their popularity among a younger generation disillusioned with the ongoing war.</p>
