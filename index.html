          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to halt a $2 billion federal funding freeze, arguing it unlawfully hampers critical disease research. University President Alan M. Garber stated the freeze would severely impact studies on pediatric cancer, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease. The lawsuit claims the funding cuts violate Harvard's constitutional rights and are being used to control academic decision-making. The White House responded that the "gravy train of federal assistance" is ending, signaling further potential funding suspensions.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece discusses how China's economy is showing signs of improvement due to the government's stimulus package initiated in September 2024, with GDP growth reaching 5.4% in the first quarter. To further boost the economy, the author suggests unleashing more of China's spending power by stabilizing the property and stock markets. The strategy involves local governments purchasing unsold residential buildings for guaranteed housing and state-owned financial institutions buying back shares. The central bank is also advised to consider significant rate cuts to stimulate credit growth.</p>

          <p>A report suggests Russia is using Libya as a strategic location for trafficking and smuggling activities into the EU, leveraging the country's existing infrastructure for human trafficking. With uncertainty surrounding its naval base in Syria, Russia has shifted focus to Libya, supporting warlord Khalifa Haftar and his forces. Haftar's son, Saddam Haftar, is allegedly expanding Libya's role in smuggling weapons, drugs, fuel, and people, with migrants being transported to Europe.

          <p>The U.S. dollar briefly fell below 140 yen for the first time since last September after President Donald Trump criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not reducing interest rates.

Investors grew cautious about the central bank's independence. Tokyo stocks ended mixed, while gold prices hit an all-time high in yen terms as investors sought safe-haven assets.

          <p>The article explores potential reforms to the NFL draft system to address concerns about parity, player agency, and rewarding struggling franchises. Proposed changes include flipping the draft order to favor teams closer to the playoffs, implementing a weighted lottery for non-playoff teams, and waiving the eligibility rule to allow players to enter the draft earlier. Another suggestion is a salary pool system, where teams negotiate with prospects based on a tiered pool of money determined by their previous season's record, granting players more control over their destination.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 02:49:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US Commerce Department announced tariffs of up to 3,521% on solar panel imports from Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam. This action follows an investigation initiated by US solar equipment producers alleging subsidies from China and the dumping of unfairly cheap products. The tariffs vary by company and country, with some Cambodian exporters facing the highest duties due to a lack of cooperation with the investigation. A final decision from the International Trade Commission is expected in June.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to publish the nationalities of foreign criminals for the first time, along with the crimes they have committed. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has ordered officials to release the data by the end of the year. There were over 19,000 foreign offenders awaiting deportation at the end of last year. The Home Office attributes the increase to early releases due to prison overcrowding, instability in some countries, and appeals against deportation. The main nationalities of foreign criminals are expected to be Albanians, Romanians, and Poles.</p>

The Justice Department is seeking to strike down a New York law that shields driver's license data from federal immigration authorities.
