          <p>More than 20 individuals were arrested in London during a demonstration supporting Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000. The Metropolitan Police stated the arrests were for suspected offenses under the act, which now criminalizes any support for the group. The ban followed protests causing significant damage to military aircraft, which the government cited as a reason for the proscription. Despite a failed court bid to block the ban, demonstrators gathered, prompting a swift police response.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the British Grand Prix in a tight qualifying session, narrowly beating McLaren's Oscar Piastri. Verstappen's final lap was just enough to edge out Piastri, with Lando Norris taking third and George Russell fourth, setting the stage for a competitive race. Despite a challenging session with shifting winds, Verstappen's performance on a high-speed track like Silverstone demonstrated his skill. The results promise an exciting race with several top drivers closely matched.</p>

          <p>An email from the Social Security Administration claiming a new bill signed by President Trump eliminates taxes on benefits for most recipients has been blasted as misleading by critics. Former SSA officials and Democratic politicians argue the email is a partisan and inaccurate framing of the legislation. The bill provides a temporary tax deduction, not a permanent elimination of taxes, which will phase out for higher-income seniors. This controversy highlights the politicization of a previously apolitical government agency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>One year after Labour's 2024 election victory, a focus group of their voters in Kent revealed a prevailing sense of disappointment and frustration. Many participants felt the government had not delivered on its promises, particularly concerning immigration, and viewed its frequent policy U-turns as a sign of weakness. While some voters were willing to give the party more time to address the country's issues, the rise of Reform UK was noted as a significant political development, with some considering switching their support.</p>

This perception could lead North Korea to further invest in making its nuclear arsenal more mobile and resilient, effectively ending any remaining possibility of denuclearization talks.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk is exploring the creation of a new political party, the "America Party," which could strategically target a small number of congressional races to gain influence. Musk suggested that winning just a few key House and Senate seats could be enough to serve as the deciding vote on contentious legislation, given the current razor-thin margins in Congress. This proposal comes amid his public falling out with President Trump over a new spending bill, signaling a potential shift in his political allegiances and financial support.</p>

          <p>North Korea has opened a large, luxurious beach resort in the coastal city of Wonsan, a project that took nearly a decade to complete amid sanctions and pandemic lockdowns. The Wonsan Kalma Coastal Tourist Area features high-rise hotels and numerous amenities, reflecting Kim Jong Un's ambition to boost tourism and the economy. However, with the country still largely closed to the outside world, it remains uncertain who will visit, apart from small, sanctioned groups of Russian tourists, highlighting the regime's contradictory policies.</p>

          <p>An Arizona renter was fined $4,000 by his property management company for posting negative online reviews about his rental experience, which included issues like black mold. The fine was based on a "non-disparagement" clause in the lease, which is likely illegal under the 2016 Consumer Review Fairness Act. This federal law protects consumers' rights to share honest feedback without retaliation. The case serves as a crucial reminder for renters and consumers to know their rights and report such illegal practices to authorities like the FTC.</p>

          <p>A multi-story residential building collapse in southern Pakistan has killed at least 16 people, with rescue operations continuing for a second day to find more survivors believed to be trapped in the rubble. The tragedy highlights the common issue of poor construction standards and lax safety regulation enforcement in the country. Residents noted that the building's location on a narrow street has complicated rescue efforts by hampering the use of heavy machinery. Such incidents are frequent in Pakistan, where cost-cutting often compromises structural integrity.</p>

The piece contends that these requirements effectively act as a gatekeeping device, disenfranchising the very people the program is designed to help. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mo Gawdat, a happiness researcher, advocates for a "90-second rule" to better manage negative emotions like anger and stress. The concept, based on neuroscientific findings, suggests that the physiological response to an emotion lasts only about 90 seconds unless a person consciously renews it by replaying the triggering thought. By allowing oneself this brief period to feel the emotion and then choosing to shift focus, individuals can prevent themselves from getting stuck in prolonged states of unhappiness. This practice encourages a more mindful and intentional response to life's upsets.</p>

She argues that pursuing hobbies is not a luxury to be enjoyed after finding balance, but is instead the secret to creating it by forcing individuals to define boundaries outside of work and obligations.</p>

This success is credited to a combination of factors, including major public health campaigns against smoking, the development of preventative medicines like statins, and advancements in emergency treatments such as CPR and angioplasty. While heart disease remains a leading cause of death, surviving an acute heart attack is now far more likely than it was decades ago.</p>
