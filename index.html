        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Multiple sources have informed CBS News that Israel is reportedly in a state of readiness to launch an operation into Iran. The United States anticipates that Iran might retaliate against certain American sites in neighboring Iraq, contributing to the State Department's recent advisory for some Americans to leave the region due to heightened regional tensions. Despite these tensions, President Trump's Middle East envoy still intends to meet with Iran for further nuclear program talks. While neither Israeli officials nor White House spokespeople have offered comments, President Trump has reiterated the U.S. stance against Iran developing nuclear weapons. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in JAMA Pediatrics reveals that gun deaths among children have increased in states with more permissive firearm laws over a 13-year period. States like Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, and Georgia experienced a rise in pediatric gun deaths after amending their firearm restrictions following a 2010 Supreme Court ruling. The research team analyzed data from the decade before the ruling and compared it to data from 2011 to 2023, finding a significant jump in youth deaths in states with the most permissive laws. Conversely, states with the most restrictive laws saw stable or decreased pediatric gun deaths, with California experiencing a 40% reduction.</p>

          <p>Career officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) responsible for overseeing the agency's committee of outside vaccine experts have been removed from their roles. This action coincides with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s decision to replace all members of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) with new picks, including COVID vaccine critics. The removed staffers, including Dr. Melinda Wharton and her team, were responsible for vetting ACIP nominees for potential conflicts of interest and managing the panel's operations. Critics within the agency view these changes as an effort to install individuals aligned with Kennedy's views and eliminate internal opposition.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered a new species of dinosaur, named Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, in a Mongolian museum collection, which they say significantly alters the understanding of tyrannosaur evolution. The 86-million-year-old skeletons represent the closest known ancestor to all tyrannosaurs, including the T.rex. This discovery bridges the gap between smaller, fleet-footed predators of the Jurassic period and the formidable giants that dominated North America and Asia. The new species exhibits early evolutionary stages of key features, such as skull anatomy, that contributed to the tyrannosaurs' powerful jaws.</p>

Kennedy Jr. has announced eight new members to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) vaccine advisory panel, following the removal of all 17 sitting members. Kennedy stated that these individuals are committed to evidence-based medicine and will demand definitive safety and efficacy data before making vaccine recommendations. The new advisers include Dr. Joseph R. Hibbeln, Martin Kulldorff, and Dr. Robert Malone, among others. Public health advocates have expressed wariness, suggesting that Kennedy's picks may lead to a committee skeptical of vaccines and potentially willing to implement an anti-vaccine agenda.</p>
