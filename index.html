            <h2>Discrepancy Arises Over RFK Jr.'s Claims Regarding Texas Measles Outbreak</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-08 17:43:39 EDT</div>

            <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suggested the measles outbreak in Texas was slowing, citing CDC reinforcements and vaccine supplies. However, Texas Department of State Health Services data indicates cases are actually increasing, with more counties reporting infections. Public health officials are skeptical of Kennedy's claims, projecting a year-long timeline for controlling the outbreak. Experts worry that prematurely claiming the curve is flattening could discourage testing and treatment, especially in under-vaccinated communities, while also noting that Kennedy is promoting catch-all treatments that are not intended for all measles cases.</p>

            <p>A federal judge ruled that the White House cannot bar Associated Press (AP) journalists from secure areas like the Oval Office and Air Force One. The ruling came after the White House restricted AP's access because the news agency continued to use 'Gulf of Mexico' instead of President Trump's preferred 'Gulf of America.' The judge emphasized that while the AP is not entitled to special treatment, it cannot be treated worse than other wire services, upholding the First Amendment rights of the press to report without viewpoint-based exclusion.</p>

Martin argued that Apple's costs would significantly increase, and the process of relocating the supply chain would take years. She and Wedbush analyst Dan Ives estimate that an iPhone produced in the U.S. would cost approximately $3,500, due to the complex and globalized nature of Apple's supply chain and higher labor costs.</p>

Advocates warn these cuts could lead to a 'death sentence for millions' facing starvation. The State Department claims some programs were terminated due to concerns that funding benefited terrorist groups and misuse of cash-based assistance, while some programs have been restored. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has previously promised that essential assistance would continue despite the Trump administration's review of foreign aid spending.</p>

He believes that a re-industrialized America would have a growing manufacturing sector, leading to more valuable factories and opportunities in areas that have suffered from deindustrialization. While acknowledging potential short-term costs, Cass asserts that Americans are willing to pay more for products made in the USA in exchange for a stronger industrial base and more stable economic opportunities.</p>

Critics, including the mayor of New Haven, Connecticut, where Avelo has its largest base, have condemned the agreement, arguing it contradicts the airline's image as 'New Haven's hometown airline.' The petition pledges a boycott until Avelo ceases profiting from ICE flights.</p>

            <p>Some Affordable Care Act (ACA) enrollees are facing unexpected tax bills due to past fraud by rogue brokers who enrolled them in plans or switched them without their knowledge. These unauthorized enrollments can result in consumers owing back premium tax credits. The Biden administration implemented measures to curb fraud, but problems persist, particularly for 2024 taxes. Consumers suspecting fraud should contact their marketplace, but fewer federal caseworkers are available due to Trump administration cuts, potentially lengthening resolution times.</p>

            <p>U.S. stocks closed lower on Tuesday, reversing an earlier rally as concerns over President Donald Trump's tariffs resurfaced. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 320 points, and the S&P 500 is nearing bear market territory. The selloff follows Trump's tariff announcement last week, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq each falling over 12% since then. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the U.S. will impose a 104% tariff on China beginning Wednesday, escalating trade tensions.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration's air war against Yemen's Houthi rebels, dubbed Operation Rough Rider, is being questioned for its lack of clear strategy beyond Trump's desire for 'swift and unrelenting action.' Analysts argue that air power alone is unlikely to defeat the Houthis, who have a remote and mountainous stronghold. The administration's actions have also reportedly damaged its Yemeni allies by cutting aid programs. Critics suggest a more comprehensive approach, including diplomatic engagement and support for Yemeni ground forces, is needed to address the Houthi problem.</p>

The DHS says it is terminating parole for those who entered through the CBP One app, encouraging them to report their departure via the CBP Home app. The move could affect migrants applying for asylum or other protections and has caused confusion and fear among those affected.</p>

A potential ban on U.S. films in China could significantly impact major entertainment companies already struggling with financial challenges. American studios have faced increasing competition from Chinese productions, and film executives now view Chinese revenue as less reliable when planning production budgets. The trade war is also impacting entertainment stocks, with Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery experiencing declines.</p>
