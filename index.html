            <p>Harvard University has refused to comply with a series of demands from the Trump administration that would require the university to overhaul its policies, including those related to diversity, equity, and inclusion, as well as the screening of international students. Harvard President Alan Garber stated that the university would not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights. The administration's demands were tied to the continuation of billions of dollars in federal funding, which Harvard relies on for groundbreaking research in medical, engineering, and scientific fields. Harvard argues that the administration's prescription goes beyond the power of the federal government and violates the university's First Amendment rights.</p>

            <p>Democratic Congressman Tom Suozzi of New York has stated that claims of noncitizens voting in his state are a myth, despite voting against the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, which restricts federal voting to legal U.S. residents. Suozzi argues that Elon Musk's claims about Democrats turning illegal aliens into registered voters are inaccurate. However, he voted in favor of a previous measure banning noncitizen voting in local D.C. elections. This issue has become a focal point in the debate over noncitizen voting, particularly in liberal localities like New York City.</p>

            <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in an antitrust trial, defending his company against allegations of operating a social media monopoly through its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is seeking to break up Meta by forcing a spinoff of these apps. Zuckerberg argued that Meta faces ample competition from apps like TikTok, X, and YouTube. The FTC is pointing to emails from Zuckerberg prior to the acquisitions expressing concern about Instagram's growth and Meta's need to catch up, but Zuckerberg defended his statements as early discussions about buying the app and improving it.</p>

            <p>California's earthquake early warning system provided residents with alerts before a magnitude 5.2 earthquake struck near San Diego. Users in various areas reported receiving warnings on their phones seconds before feeling the shaking, allowing them time to take protective actions. The ShakeAlert system, operational in California, Oregon, and Washington, uses seismic sensors to detect shaking and send alerts via apps like MyShake and Android phones. The system is designed to trigger alerts for earthquakes of magnitude 4.5 or higher, providing crucial seconds of lead time.</p>

The retrial includes charges involving two women from the original case and a new allegation from a third woman. Weinstein faces charges of criminal sex act and third-degree rape, to which he has pleaded not guilty. The retrial occurs in a different climate compared to the first trial, with the #MeToo movement having evolved since the initial allegations against Weinstein in 2017.</p>

Instances such as praising Greg Gianforte for body-slamming a reporter and his response to the Proud Boys during a presidential debate highlight his complex relationship with political violence. Trump's actions during the Capitol insurrection further underscore his willingness to engage in or condone violence when it benefits him.</p>

            <p>The "Silicon Six" tech firms (Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, Netflix, Apple, and Microsoft) are accused of avoiding almost $278 billion in US corporation taxes over the past decade. They paid an average of 18.8% in combined taxes, compared to the US average of 29.7%. The Fair Tax Foundation claims they have "hardwired" tax avoidance into their business models. The report highlights aggressive tax practices and significant spending on lobbying. (not investment advice)</p>
