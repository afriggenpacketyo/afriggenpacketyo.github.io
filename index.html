          <p>Rescue teams are continuing a multi-day search for over 170 missing people in Central Texas following catastrophic flash floods that have claimed at least 118 lives. The disaster, which caused the Guadalupe River to rise to unprecedented levels, was particularly devastating in Kerr County, where a girls' summer camp suffered numerous fatalities. A federal disaster has been declared, enabling FEMA support, but ongoing storms have complicated the search operations. Scrutiny has fallen on the adequacy of weather warnings and the potential impact of federal budget cuts on forecasting capabilities.</p>

          <p>A recent debate in Germany's Bundestag was marked by sharp exchanges, particularly between Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Alice Weidel, leader of the far-right AfD party. Merz defended his coalition's policies, highlighting Germany's leadership role in Europe and its support for Ukraine, while Weidel accused him of breaking campaign promises and pursuing ineffective migration policies. The debate also exposed tensions within the ruling coalition and criticism from opposition parties like the Greens and the Left Party over the budget, defense spending, and climate policy. The contentious atmosphere reflects the polarized state of German politics.</p>

          <p>Police in Scotland have confirmed they are making preparations for a potential visit by U.S. President Donald Trump to his Aberdeenshire golf resort later this month. The visit is expected for the opening of a new course named after his Scottish-born mother. This would be his first trip to Scotland since his election victory, with his last presidential visit in 2018 prompting major security operations and large-scale protests. The Scottish government is coordinating with UK authorities to support the policing plan for the anticipated event.</p>

          <p>A recent article delves into the recurring discourse about a supposed literacy crisis among American youth, from elementary school to college. It contrasts anecdotal complaints from educators about students' declining reading comprehension with historical data showing that every generation tends to worry about the next. The piece acknowledges a real, data-supported decline in reading scores for younger students over the last decade, particularly among lower-achieving students, which predates the pandemic. However, it also notes that literacy is evolving, and standardized tests may not capture the complex ways young people engage with language in digital environments.</p>

Rights groups describe this as a "full-on assault" on gender equality, warning that silencing policy dialogue is especially dangerous amid a growing global backlash against women's rights.

          <p>Analysis of lunar samples returned by China's Chang'e-6 mission indicates that a massive asteroid impact over 4 billion years ago may have fundamentally changed the composition of the moon's mantle on its far side. The returned rocks, the first ever from the far side, are the most chemically depleted ever studied, lacking elements like titanium and thorium. Scientists believe the powerful collision that created the vast South Pole-Aitken basin stripped these ingredients from the deep interior. These findings were published in the journal Nature, highlighting significant results from China's increasingly advanced lunar exploration program.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is facing legal challenges over its method of fulfilling a settlement agreement to clear 9,800 homeless encampments. Critics and a federal judge argue that the city's "CARE-plus" cleanups, which often involve destroying tents and belongings without providing housing, do not constitute a permanent resolution. Judge David O. Carter has ruled that the city cannot count these cleanups toward its goal unless a genuine offer of shelter or housing is made. The dispute highlights the deep-seated conflict between the city's public safety goals and the rights and needs of its unhoused population.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has refused to rule out extending the current freeze on income tax and National Insurance thresholds beyond its planned end in April 2028. During Prime Minister's Questions, he deflected by stating he was committed to Labour's manifesto, which pledged no rises in the main tax rates but made no specific promise on thresholds. The freeze has resulted in millions of people paying higher tax rates as their wages rise with inflation, a phenomenon known as fiscal drag. The government is facing pressure on its spending plans, making future tax rises seem more likely.</p>

          <p>The presidents of Senegal, Liberia, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania, and Gabon are in Washington for a summit hosted by President Trump, which the White House frames as a push for deeper commercial ties. The meeting occurs amid growing U.S. anxiety over China's expanding economic and military influence in Africa, including potential naval bases on the West African coast. The summit's selective guest list, which excludes major allies like Nigeria and South Africa, has raised questions. Tensions over recent U.S. aid cuts, particularly affecting Liberia, are also expected to be a backdrop to the discussions.</p>

          <p>Dutch art detective Arthur Brand, known as the "Indiana Jones of the Art World," has recovered a vast collection of priceless historical documents, including many from the 17th-century Dutch East India Company (VOC). The documents, some of which are UNESCO-listed, were stolen from the Dutch National Archives in 2015 by an employee who has since died. Brand was contacted by a person who found the manuscripts in a box left as collateral for a loan. The trove provides a unique glimpse into the operations of the world's first multinational corporation and early modern world history.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's efforts to influence monetary policy, including the potential early naming of a "shadow chair" to pressure for interest rate cuts, are raising concerns about the future credibility of the Federal Reserve. Analysts worry that any successor to current Chair Jerome Powell could be perceived as a political appointee, undermining the central bank's traditional independence. Trump has explicitly linked his demand for lower rates to reducing government debt-servicing costs, a departure from the Fed's dual mandate of stable inflation and full employment. This approach could create market uncertainty and reputational risk for any nominee. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis of the controversy surrounding former Red Bull team principal Christian Horner argues that the situation reveals a deeper problem within Formula 1 regarding its treatment of women. The article posits that the sport's institutions, focused on performance and drama, often fail to address legitimate workplace misconduct concerns seriously. While F1 has courted a growing female fanbase, the handling of the Horner investigation and allegations suggests a lack of support for female employees. The piece calls for greater accountability and questions whether initiatives like the F1 Academy are substantive or merely "lip service."</p>

The collaboration is part of a larger trend of traditional financial institutions engaging with stablecoins, fueled by a more favorable regulatory outlook and growing interest from major corporations.

          <p>Germany's Federal Police Commissioner, Uli Grötsch, has publicly criticized the government's policy of turning back migrants at the border, stating it burdens police forces and rests on dubious legal grounds under EU law. He noted the directive remains despite a court finding it incompatible with European law, creating confusion for officers. Grötsch highlighted the significant overtime and strain on police resources, with thousands of officers deployed to borders, impacting regular police work elsewhere. This criticism comes as Germany's tougher migration stance has also prompted retaliatory border checks from Poland.</p>
