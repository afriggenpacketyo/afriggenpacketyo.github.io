            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Russian attacks continued despite Vladimir Putin's declared Easter truce, accusing Russia of creating a false impression of a ceasefire while still attempting military advances. According to Zelenskyy, there were numerous shellings and assaults by Russian forces within the first six hours of the truce, though no casualties were reported. Zelenskyy reiterated Ukraine's readiness to extend the truce for 30 days if Russia genuinely commits to a full ceasefire, indicating a desire to demonstrate a commitment to peace to the US. Ukraine's forces are responding to the ongoing attacks as the combat situation dictates.</p>

            <p>Kenan Malik argues that Donald Trump's demands for Harvard to reorganize its governance and hiring practices to ensure viewpoint diversity are a form of political bullying that undermines academic freedom. Trump's administration insists that any department lacking viewpoint diversity must hire new faculty members to transform its political complexion, a contradiction to the idea that the most qualified person should get the job. Malik suggests that such affirmative action for conservative viewpoints could subvert scholarly objectivity and create a culture of political identity within universities. He concludes that fostering genuine diversity of opinion requires rethinking social and political engagement, rather than state mandates or bureaucratic procedures.</p>

            <p>Train services on Tokyo's Yamanote and Keihin-Tohoku lines have resumed after a suspension due to track-switching work for a new route improving access to Haneda airport. The suspension, lasting over 24 hours, affected around 550,000 people as East Japan Railway Co. carried out platform expansion work at Tamachi Station. The new route is expected to open in the fiscal year starting April 2031, enhancing transportation to and from the airport.</p>
