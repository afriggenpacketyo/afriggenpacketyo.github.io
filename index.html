        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Transgender service members are facing difficult choices after the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to enforce its ban on transgender individuals in the military. Cmdr. Emilly Shilling, Maj. Erica Vandal, and 2nd Lt. Nicholas Talbott, who are plaintiffs in lawsuits against the ban, now face either voluntarily separating from the military or being discharged. The policy requires commanders to identify service members with gender dysphoria, potentially leading to their removal, creating uncertainty and hardship for affected families. These service members feel they are being forced to hide who they are, undermining their ability to lead effectively and serve their country honestly.</p>

          <p>The remains of Pattie Wu-Murad, a Connecticut woman who disappeared while hiking in Japan in April 2023, have been recovered, according to her family. An extensive search involving American and Japanese teams yielded no results until September 2024, when her backpack and a hiking shoe were found near a stream. Further searching led to the discovery of personal items and a femur, which DNA testing confirmed as Wu-Murad's. The family expressed heartbreak at the news but also gratitude for the global support, hoping for more evidence to clarify the circumstances of her death, and they are working to bring her remains home.</p>

          <p>Newly released audio clips from former special counsel Robert Hur's investigation into Joe Biden's handling of classified documents reveal instances where Biden struggled to recall dates of significant events, including his son's death. The audio is from interviews that occurred after the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023. The Biden administration initially resisted releasing the audio, citing executive privilege, but the Trump administration moved to release it, arguing that transparency is important. The release follows reports detailing concerns about Biden's mental acuity, although a spokesperson for Biden stated that the audio simply confirms information already made public.</p>

          <p>Okinawans hold conflicting views on the presence of U.S. military bases, which have been a fixture since the end of World War II. While some residents believe the bases are crucial for security and provide economic benefits, others view them as a painful legacy of occupation, citing incidents of sexual assault and noise pollution. Despite strong U.S.-Japan defense cooperation, many Okinawans feel unfairly burdened by the concentration of bases and question whether their protection is a priority. The debate highlights the complex interplay of security concerns, economic realities, and historical grievances on the island.</p>

          <p>Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry has criticized New Orleans' progressive criminal justice policies following a jailbreak where ten inmates, including murder suspects, escaped. Landry announced an executive order to audit the Orleans Correctional Facility and remove state DOC inmates, blaming politicians who "pander voters" for the escape. Authorities believe the inmates had inside help, as they crawled through a hidden hole and scaled barbed wire fences, leaving messages mocking the system. Seven fugitives remain at large, with bounties placed on their heads as authorities warn they may have traveled to other states.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs on auto parts are causing job losses in Windsor, Ontario, a key hub for manufacturing components for vehicles destined for the United States. Smaller auto-parts plants, which employ around 9,000 workers, are particularly vulnerable as they lack the financial resources of larger automakers. While automakers are unlikely to relocate assembly plants, the tariffs are devastating parts makers, disrupting the integrated North American auto industry. The complex regulations surrounding the tariffs add further uncertainty, making it difficult for parts makers to plan and compete. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A sweeping US tax and spending bill has advanced through a key committee in the House, overcoming Republican infighting and moving closer to a full vote. The bill would extend tax cuts from President Trump's first term, end taxes on tips, and increase military and border spending, paid for partly by cuts to Medicaid and green subsidies. While some hard-line Republicans received concessions, other factions remain unhappy, and analysts suggest the bill could add trillions to the national debt.</p>

          <p>Employees are interrupted every two minutes by meetings, emails and other pings during the workday, according to a recent Microsoft report. Experts recommend creating protected blocks of time by scheduling them on your calendar like important meetings. It is also important to determine when you're most productive, set aside your phone, close your email and turn off notifications, and tell everyone in your household you're in an important meeting if you're working from home.</p>

          <h2>NJ Transit Strike Ends as Engineers Approve New Deal</h2>

          <p>The NJ Transit strike has ended after the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) approved a deal, but train service will resume Tuesday. The strike, which halted trains across New Jersey for four days, comes as relief to hundreds of thousands of riders. The deal is fair and fiscally responsible, and it will reflect a series of concessions that came together by way of a work rule that will eventually end up paying for this fair wage that the unions have asked for.</p>

          <h2>Oncologist Says Biden Had Cancer for Years</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-19 09:16:33 EDT</div>

          <p>Following Joe Biden's announcement of his prostate cancer diagnosis, an oncologist told MSNBC's Morning Joe that Biden has likely had the cancer for many years. Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel stated that the cancer spreading to the bone indicated it has been present for a long time. He expressed surprise that the cancer wasn't diagnosed earlier, given the proclivity of presidential physicians to test more rather than less. The expert opinion of Emanuel raises questions about the transparency of Biden's health records during his time in office.</p>
