            <p>Actress Michelle Trachtenberg, known for her roles in "Gossip Girl" and "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," passed away at the age of 39 due to complications from diabetes, according to the New York City medical examiner's office. No autopsy was performed, but toxicology tests confirmed the cause of death. Trachtenberg's family had initially objected to an autopsy for religious reasons. Diabetes is a chronic health condition affecting millions of Americans and is a leading cause of death in the U.S.</p>

            <p>Mexican singer Julión Álvarez is set to perform three sold-out shows at Los Angeles' SoFi Stadium, marking a historic achievement as the first Latino artist to do so at the venue.

Álvarez's popularity has remained strong in Mexico, earning him the nickname "El Rey de la Taquilla" (The King of the Box Office), and his recent album, "4218," showcases his continued success.</p>

            <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as Health and Human Services Secretary, declared autism a rapidly growing "epidemic" and vowed to identify the "environmental toxin" he believes is to blame, citing increased autism incidence in the U.S. He contrasted his approach with past research, criticizing the focus on genetic causes and committing HHS to investigating environmental factors. Researchers and advocates pushed back, emphasizing a wide variety of causes, including genetic, biological, and environmental factors.

            <p>Berkeley, California, is implementing new wildfire safety rules requiring residents in high-fire-risk areas to remove flammable materials near their homes. The regulations aim to create defensible space and slow the spread of wildfires, applying to approximately 1,000 homes in the Berkeley Hills. This follows deadly wildfires in Los Angeles and reflects increasing wildfire risks due to climate change. While some residents have expressed concerns, experts emphasize the importance of limiting fuel to prevent fire spread.</p>
