          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler won his first Open Championship with a commanding performance at Royal Portrush, finishing four shots clear of the competition. This victory marks his second major title of the year and his fourth overall, fueling further comparisons to the career trajectory of Tiger Woods. With this win, Scheffler now only needs the US Open to complete the career Grand Slam, becoming just the seventh player to achieve the feat if he succeeds.</p>

          <p>Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons has blamed an 830% increase in assaults on immigration officers on sharp rhetoric from elected officials. In a recent interview, Lyons stated that as the Trump administration's immigration enforcement becomes more visible, criticism from political opponents is fueling increased hostility and attacks against his agents. He asserted that this rhetoric directly contributes to a more dangerous environment for law enforcement officers who are carrying out their mission across the country.</p>

          <p>Democratic Congressman Jim Himes sharply refuted claims from Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard about a "treasonist conspiracy" related to the 2016 election investigation. Himes labeled her accusations a "dangerous lie," pointing out that multiple bipartisan reports, including one from a GOP-led Senate committee, confirmed Russian interference to aid Donald Trump. He also criticized the White House's pressure on the Federal Reserve, calling the administration's economic narrative a deceptive con that ignores established facts.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that President Trump's job approval rating has fallen to 42%, accompanied by declining support for his administration's signature deportation program. The survey reveals a majority of Americans now believe the administration is attempting to deport more people than they had initially expected. Furthermore, a majority no longer thinks the government is primarily focused on deporting only dangerous criminals, contributing to the downward trend in approval for its immigration handling.</p>

          <p>Employment experts suspect that artificial intelligence is a larger factor in recent corporate layoffs than many companies are publicly admitting. While firms often cite reasons like "restructuring" or "optimization," analysts believe these terms can be a euphemism for replacing human roles with AI technology, particularly in functions like HR, content, and customer service. This strategic ambiguity may help companies avoid public backlash and manage internal morale while they transition to more automated workflows and reshape their workforces.</p>

          <p>An 82-year-old Pennsylvania resident, who had been granted political asylum in 1987, was secretly detained and deported by ICE after visiting an immigration office to replace his lost green card. His family reported that Luis Leon was handcuffed and taken away without explanation in June and was later discovered to be in a hospital in Guatemala, a country to which he has no ties. The family was initially given no information and at one point was falsely told he had died, highlighting a deeply concerning case.</p>

          <p>In a commentary piece, former Obama speechwriter David Litt suggests that finding "common ground" in a politically divided America is increasingly difficult, but finding "neutral ground" is more important than ever. Drawing from his experience building a friendship with his politically opposite brother-in-law through surfing, he argues for the value of shared activities that are disconnected from political differences. He believes these neutral spaces allow for genuine connection and can lead to more productive discussions, rather than debates or arguments.</p>

His office has used terms like "fascist cuck" and posted memes to counter what they describe as attacks on democracy and cruelty from the administration. This pivot from a more traditional political high road is seen as a response to federal actions in California, aiming to challenge bullies by punching back forcefully.</p>

          <p>In a commentary piece, Gene Marks argues that traditional methods of measuring the U.S. labor market, such as jobs reports and unemployment rates, are becoming obsolete. He contends that amid the rise of the gig economy, remote work, and the "over-employed" holding multiple jobs, a more relevant metric would be income. He proposes tracking the number of Americans earning above a certain inflation-adjusted threshold from all sources, which would provide a more accurate picture of economic health than current government surveys.</p>
