          <p>President Trump announced that the United States will double tariffs on steel imports to 50% during a speech at U.S. Steel's Irvin Works in Pennsylvania, with the goal of bolstering the American steel industry. He claimed that the increased tariffs would prevent foreign steel companies from circumventing trade barriers. Trump also addressed the proposed merger between U.S. Steel and Japan's Nippon, stating that Nippon has committed to maintaining U.S. Steel's blast furnaces at full capacity for at least ten years, promising no layoffs or outsourcing as a result of the deal. U.S. Steel workers are expected to receive a $5,000 bonus as part of the agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Army has issued guidance for identifying and processing transgender service members for separation, following Defense Department directives. The guidance instructs personnel to address transgender troops by their sex assigned at birth and outlines criteria for identifying soldiers with gender dysphoria, including social media activity and commander's conversations. Maj. Kara Corcoran, a transgender infantry officer, criticized the policy, stating it is worse than "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" because it actively seeks out transgender service members. The Army claims it will treat all soldiers with dignity and respect, but the policies contradict transgender social norms and may negatively impact future employment opportunities due to separation codes.</p>

          <p>Loretta Swit, best known for her role as Major Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan on the TV series M*A*S*H, has died at the age of 87.

In addition to her work on M*A*S*H, Swit appeared in numerous other TV shows, movies, and stage productions, and was an animal rights activist. Jamie Farr, who co-starred in M*A*S*H, remembered Swit as his "adopted sister" and expressed how much she would be missed.</p>

The ruling puts much of Trump's trade agenda at risk, although the tariffs remain in place due to a temporary halt on the decision. Trump could potentially utilize Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, or Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930 to advance his trade policies.

          <p>The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) has filed a lawsuit against President Trump to block his executive order to cut off its federal funding, accusing him of retaliating against the broadcaster over perceived political slights. PBS argues that Trump's actions violate the Constitution and a half-century-old law governing public television. The lawsuit follows a similar suit filed by NPR, with both organizations seeking to invalidate Trump's order.

          <p>An Italian man was allegedly kidnapped and tortured for weeks in a New York City home in an attempt to extort his bitcoin fortune. Two cryptocurrency investors, John Woeltz and William Duplessie, have been charged with kidnapping, assault, and unlawful imprisonment. The victim managed to escape and reported the incident to the police, who found disturbing evidence in the townhouse where he was held. The suspects are accused of shocking the man with electric wires, cutting his leg with a saw, and threatening to kill him and his family if he did not give up his bitcoin password.</p>

          <p>China is scaling up the use of artificial intelligence in urban management through its "smart cities" initiative, with cities like Nanjing using drones to patrol potentially dangerous areas. The AI systems focus on patrolling blind spots and addressing complex urban challenges. Despite progress, China's AI governance faces challenges, including privacy protection and limited community involvement. These challenges are mirrored in other parts of the world as governments race to adopt AI technology, highlighting the need for careful consideration of ethical and societal implications.</p>

          <p>A key U.S. inflation gauge indicated that price growth slowed in April, with consumer prices rising 2.1% year-over-year, down from 2.3% in March. Despite rising incomes, spending by Americans also cooled, potentially reflecting an early response to higher prices on some imported goods. Economists have warned that Trump's tariffs could push prices higher, but the timing and impact of those duties are now uncertain after a court ruling. Walmart and Best Buy executives have indicated that they will increase prices to account for the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

Newsom's office argues that federal court rulings have rejected the claim that California law unlawfully obstructs federal immigration laws. The state strengthened its sanctuary policies in 2018, aiming to balance preventing local law enforcement resources from being used to round up immigrants with allowing the federal government to enforce its laws. The Trump administration's assertion that California's policies protect criminals from deportation has been repeatedly denied by Newsom.</p>

          <p>Wall Street has recognized a pattern in President Trump's tariff announcements, coining the term "TACO trade" (Trump Always Chickens Out) to describe his tendency to bluff and then back down on tariffs. Investors have learned to buy the dip when Trump announces new tariffs, profiting from the inevitable rally. Trump was reportedly furious when asked about the expression, demonstrating that the traders are right about his negotiating style. While Trump has long advocated for tariffs, his administration has often suspended, reduced, or threatened new tariffs, leading to market volatility.</p>

Trump's rhetoric, including calling judges "USA hating judges" and accusing them of wanting the country to "go to hell," has coincided with a drastic rise in threats against federal judges. The columnist highlights the potential for unstable Trump supporters to take matters into their own hands and points to the need for political leaders to condemn the invective against judges more forcefully.
