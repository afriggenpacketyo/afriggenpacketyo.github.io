          <p>The US Supreme Court has overturned a lower court order, allowing the Trump administration to resume deporting migrants to countries other than their homeland. The ruling eliminates the requirement for the government to provide migrants with an opportunity to express fears of torture or persecution in the third country. The three liberal justices dissented, accusing the government of unlawful conduct and undermining due process. This decision marks another victory for President Trump's immigration policies aimed at mass deportations, but legal challenges are expected to continue. The administration has approached countries like Costa Rica, Panama, and Rwanda about accepting migrants, and has an arrangement with El Salvador to detain Venezuelan migrants, some of whom have no criminal records, and the court's order allows this to resume. Optimism about the situation is not necessarily high.</p>

          <p>Iran launched a missile attack on the United States’ Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, in response to U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. While there were no reported casualties, the attack caused disruptions to flights in the region. Iran's action followed the U.S. sending B-2 bombers to drop 14 Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs on Iranian nuclear sites. President Trump stated that the attack was a weak response and that the U.S. had prior warning, enabling effective countermeasures. This exchange has heightened tensions in the Middle East, impacting regional stability and international relations.</p>

          <p>Indiana Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton reportedly suffered a torn Achilles tendon during the NBA Finals Game 7 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder.

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, Iran launched missiles against the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. In addition to U.S. air bases, Iran could target U.S. military assets across the Middle East, close the Strait of Hormuz, or carry out terror and cyber attacks. The U.S. operates several military bases in the Middle East, including Al Udeid in Qatar and Naval Support Activity Bahrain, housing thousands of service personnel. The Strait of Hormuz, a critical waterway for oil transport, could also be a target, potentially causing global economic disruption. The U.S. National Terrorism Advisory System has warned of a heightened threat environment, including potential cyber attacks by pro-Iranian hacktivists.</p>

          <p>Approximately 80 Labour MPs are supporting an amendment to block the government's planned changes to the benefits system, which aim to cut disability and sickness-related benefits payments by £5bn a year by 2030. The MPs are concerned about the potential impact on poverty levels, lack of consultation, and inadequate impact assessments. The amendment highlights the need for social security reform but objects to the bill's current form, citing consequences for the job market and public health. If the amendment is selected and supported by a majority of MPs, the bill's progress through Parliament could be halted, posing a significant challenge to the government's welfare plans.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, officials and experts have given conflicting statements regarding the extent of the damage. While some claim the Iranian nuclear program was "obliterated," others suggest a full assessment will take time. Satellite images reveal damage to facilities at Fordo, Isfahan, and Natanz, but the degree of damage to underground structures remains unclear. Experts emphasize the need for IAEA inspectors to access the sites for a comprehensive evaluation.

          <p>The US supreme court cleared the way on Monday for Donald Trump’s administration to resume deporting migrants to countries other than their own without offering them a chance to show harms they could face, handing him another victory in his aggressive pursuit of mass deportations. The justices lifted a judicial order that required the government to give migrants set for deportation to so-called “third countries” a “meaningful opportunity” to tell officials they are at risk of torture at their new destination, while a legal challenge plays out. Boston-based US district judge Brian Murphy had issued the order on 18 April. The court’s three liberal justices – Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson – dissented from the decision. The optimism score of the situation is relatively low.</p>

          <p>Super Micro Computer shares fell about 10% after announcing plans to offer $2 billion in convertible notes, maturing in 2030. The company plans to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including funding working capital for growth and business expansion. Super Micro, known for its AI-optimized infrastructure, has seen its business boom due to high demand for Nvidia's AI processors. Despite the drop, Super Micro secured a major contract with a data center in Saudi Arabia and is still viewed as a key player in the AI infrastructure market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major U.S. health insurers have voluntarily agreed to speed up and reduce prior authorizations, a process often criticized for causing delays and physician burnout. The plans, under insurers like CVS Health and UnitedHealthcare, aim to connect patients to care more quickly and reduce administrative burdens on providers. Efforts include establishing a common standard for electronic prior authorization requests and reducing the types of claims subject to prior authorization. These changes are expected to benefit millions of Americans by streamlining the healthcare process and easing the workload of doctors and hospitals.</p>
