          <h2>Amazon Issues Cautious Guidance Amid Tariff and Trade Policy Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 17:05:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amazon reported strong first-quarter results, driven by its cloud computing and advertising divisions, but issued weaker-than-expected guidance for the second quarter, causing the stock to fall in extended trading. The company cited tariffs and trade policies as factors that could affect its outlook, a concern echoed by other online ad companies like Google and Snap. Amazon faces significant exposure to tariffs, particularly through its retail unit, as it sources products from China, which has been hit with substantial levies. Many third-party sellers on Amazon's marketplace also rely on China for production, leading to potential price increases and reduced advertising spending.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this New York Times article, David Brooks reflects on the pervasive atmosphere created by Donald Trump, characterizing it as "pagan" due to its emphasis on power, ego, and dominance. He contrasts this ethos with Judeo-Christian values of compassion, humility, and service to others, noting a resurgence of religious interest as a response to the dehumanizing forces in society. Brooks suggests that rehumanizing influences like art, literature, and selfless service are essential antidotes to the pagan mindset, highlighting a cultural transition marked by a spiritual yearning among the populace. He emphasizes the importance of moral knowledge and the need to address the consequences of character failings in leadership.</p>

          <p>Airbnb reported first-quarter results that aligned with expectations but issued a weaker-than-anticipated revenue forecast for the second quarter, leading to a decline in shares. The company cited broader economic uncertainties, particularly in the U.S., as a factor influencing its outlook.

          <p>The U.S. military will maintain its existing standards for investigating reports of sexual assault and sexual harassment, according to a senior official, even as the Defense Department conducts a review of how discrimination claims are handled. This announcement comes amid concerns that potential staff reductions due to Trump administration efforts to streamline operations could impact the processing of sexual assault cases. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has called for a review of equal opportunity programs to ensure discrimination complaints are not being "weaponized," but officials assert this directive will not affect sexual assault investigations. Advocates, however, worry that Hegseth's orders may discourage individuals from reporting misconduct.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to intervene in its effort to terminate the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for Venezuelan migrants in the U.S. The administration argues that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's decision to revoke the designation, which was previously extended by the Biden administration, is in the national interest. A federal judge had delayed the termination, citing concerns that the decision was based on negative stereotypes. The administration contends that the lower court's injunction undermines the Executive Branch's powers regarding immigration and foreign affairs.</p>

          <p>Mike Waltz is stepping down as national security advisor, with President Trump planning to nominate him as ambassador to the United Nations.

          <p>A top Justice Department appointee ordered an aggressive investigation into student protesters at Columbia University, sparking concern among career prosecutors and investigators who viewed the demand as politically motivated and lacking legal merit. The inquiry, focused on students protesting Israel's actions in Gaza, faced pushback from a federal magistrate judge who questioned the justification for some of the requested steps and their potential violation of the First Amendment. The investigation, conducted by the civil rights division, appears to have stalled but has fueled tensions within the department, as some officials fear the inquiry is a pretext for an intimidation and deportation campaign against student protesters.</p>

          <p>Gold has historically demonstrated consistent performance during economic downturns, often gaining value as investors seek safe-haven assets. During recessions, stock markets tend to decline, consumer confidence drops, and uncertainty rises, leading investors to turn to gold. This pattern has been observed during past recessions, such as the Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it's important to note that gold's price can also be influenced by factors such as central bank purchasing, inflation, geopolitical tensions, and currency movements.

          <p>A federal judge in Texas ruled that the Alien Enemies Act does not authorize President Trump to deport Venezuelan immigrants alleged to be members of the Tren de Aragua gang. The ruling, limited to the Southern District of Texas, deemed the White House's use of the statute illegal, as the president's claims about the gang did not constitute an "invasion." The judge found that the act's language referred to attacks by military forces and did not align with Trump's claims about the activities of Tren de Aragua. The ruling is a significant setback for the Trump administration's efforts to aggressively deport Venezuelan migrants using the act.</p>
