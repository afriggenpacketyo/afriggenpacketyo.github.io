          <h2>Archaeological Find in China Suggests Existence of a 'Wood Age' 300,000 Years Ago</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 06:30:08 EDT</div>

          <p>A recent study published in the journal Science presents evidence of dozens of wooden artifacts unearthed at the Gantangqing site in China's Yunnan province. Researchers suggest these tools, dated to 300,000 years ago, indicate that wood was widely used during this period, filling a significant gap in the understanding of the Chinese Palaeolithic era. The discovery challenges previous assumptions, as wood typically decomposes, leaving little archaeological evidence. This find is being hailed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences as a world-class discovery that provides the first substantial proof of an East Asian 'Wood Age,' redefining knowledge of early human technology.</p>

          <p>Russia launched a significant aerial assault on Kyiv, deploying a record 550 drones and multiple missiles that struck nearly every district of the Ukrainian capital, causing widespread damage. The attack, which resulted in at least 23 injuries and one fatality in a separate Ukrainian strike on a Russian border village, occurred shortly after Russian President Vladimir Putin rejected a peace proposal from U.S. President Donald Trump. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the bombardment as a cynical demonstration of Russia's refusal to end the war, which has now been ongoing for over three years, and urged allies for more support.</p>

          <h2>Experts Believe Meteor Fragments May Have Landed Near UK's Highest Mountain</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 06:27:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A small meteor that illuminated the sky over the west Highlands of Scotland is believed to have deposited fragments on and around Ben Nevis, the UK's highest mountain. The UK Meteor Network (UKMON) tracked the object, which originated from between Mars and Jupiter, as it descended to approximately 12 miles above the ground. Dozens of local residents reported seeing an orange glow and hearing a loud bang, with some feeling their houses shake. UKMON has appealed to hillwalkers to look for the meteorites, though they acknowledge the search will be difficult across the vast, mountainous terrain.</p>

          <p>A 68-year-old British woman and a 67-year-old New Zealand woman were killed by an elephant during a guided safari walk in Zambia's South Luangwa National Park. According to local police, the two tourists were trampled to death when a female elephant with its calf charged the group at high speed. Efforts by tour guides to deter the animal, including firing shots, were unsuccessful, and both women died at the scene. Authorities noted that female elephants are extremely protective of their young and have previously urged tourists to exercise extreme caution when observing wildlife in the region.</p>

          <p>A strike by French air traffic controllers has caused significant travel disruptions, leading to the cancellation of about 40% of flights at all Paris airports and affecting tens of thousands of passengers during the peak summer season. The UNSA-ICNA union initiated the strike to protest poor working conditions, citing staffing shortages and the impact of inflation on salaries. The French civil aviation authority advised airlines to preemptively cancel numerous flights across the country, warning of long delays. Airlines like Ryanair have been heavily impacted, canceling hundreds of flights that pass through French airspace, not just those to and from France.</p>

She stated the new party would challenge a "broken" Westminster system and that the current Labour government has failed to improve people's lives.

The article points to several key actions, including the halt of a major weapons shipment to Ukraine, the cessation of new sanctions enforcement against Russia, and the dismantling of State Department programs designed to counter Russian disinformation. By taking these steps while key administration figures echo Russian talking points, the U.S. is signaling that its support for Ukraine is ending. This policy shift, the author argues, encourages Putin to prolong the war in the belief that he can win.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that in the face of rising criticism from both the left and right, the best defense for liberal democracy is the concept of "value pluralism," as articulated by philosopher Isaiah Berlin. This idea holds that legitimate human values, such as liberty and equality or justice and mercy, are diverse and often in conflict, making a single utopian society impossible. Because no single vision of the good life is definitively correct, society must prioritize individual freedom and collective decision-making through democracy. The analysis suggests that remembering this philosophical foundation is crucial for defending democratic systems against totalitarian thinking.</p>

SEBI alleges Jane Street made large, offsetting trades in stocks and futures to move the indices, allowing it to profit from much larger positions in the options market. The regulator called the firm an untrustworthy actor, noting the behavior continued even after a warning from the National Stock Exchange of India. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article profiles Felize, a 20-year-old wheelchair user who frequently parties at Berghain, Germany's most famous techno club. While many Berlin clubs cultivate an image as inclusive "safe spaces," the reality presents both social and physical barriers for people with disabilities. Felize describes the practical challenges of planning a night out, from checking elevator access to dealing with other club-goers who are unsure how to interact with her. Despite these hurdles, she finds Berghain to be surprisingly accessible and feels accepted there, emphasizing the need for more visibility and empathy to make clubbing a more normal experience for everyone.</p>

          <p>Hamas has stated it is in consultation with other Palestinian groups before providing a formal response to the latest U.S.-backed proposal for a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza. President Donald Trump indicated he expects to know within 24 hours if Hamas will agree to the plan, which Israel has reportedly accepted. The proposed 60-day truce would involve a staggered release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, an increase in humanitarian aid, and a phased Israeli military withdrawal. A key point of negotiation remains Hamas's demand for a guarantee that Israeli military operations will not resume after the ceasefire ends.</p>

          <p>A Jackson County judge has once again blocked many of Missouri's abortion restrictions, issuing a preliminary injunction that allows procedural abortions to resume in the state. The ruling from Judge Jerri Zhang states that the restrictions likely violate a state constitutional right to abortion that was approved by voters in a ballot measure last year. This decision marks the latest development in a legal battle that has seen abortion access fluctuate since the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade. The Missouri Attorney General's office has announced its intention to appeal the ruling immediately, ensuring the legal fight over abortion access will continue.</p>

          <p>The states that rely on the shrinking Colorado River are nearing a federal deadline to agree on a new water-sharing deal. The river is a critical resource, providing drinking water for approximately 40 million people and irrigating vast agricultural lands across the American West. Due to prolonged drought and climate change, the river's flow has diminished, creating an urgent need for the states to negotiate new rules for how its water is allocated. Reaching a consensus is crucial to avoid federally imposed cuts and to ensure the long-term sustainability of the water supply for the entire region.</p>

The service, operated by SpaceX, has rapidly deployed thousands of low-Earth orbit satellites to provide internet access to rural and underserved areas globally. Its success is attributed to SpaceX's reusable rocket technology, which dramatically lowers launch costs, and its first-mover advantage in a technologically complex industry. The article explores whether this early lead and technological integration will be enough to fend off future challenges from companies like Amazon's Project Kuiper.</p>

          <p>This Independence Day, dozens of cities across the U.S., from Salt Lake City to Sarasota, are replacing traditional fireworks with synchronized drone light shows. The shift is driven primarily by safety concerns, as drone displays reduce the risk of wildfires in drought-prone areas and are quieter, making them more inclusive for people with PTSD and pets. Companies like Sky Elements Drones program hundreds or even thousands of illuminated drones to create choreographed routines set to music, forming patriotic images in the night sky. While not everyone supports the change, the popularity of these high-tech, environmentally friendlier celebrations is rapidly growing.</p>

He also points to the nation's soaring debt, which is approaching post-World War II record highs, as a major concern for foreign investors. This combination of factors is accelerating a move away from the dollar's global dominance, a shift not seen since the 1970s. (not investment advice)</p>
