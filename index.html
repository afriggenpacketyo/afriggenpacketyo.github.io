British officials assert that the agreement will boost UK businesses, create jobs, and increase disposable income for citizens, estimating a Â£9 billion boost to the economy by 2040. The deal also simplifies import and export processes for food and drink, extends fishing rights for EU trawlers, and introduces 'pet passports' for easier pet travel.</p>

          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, has drawn criticism for stating that he doesn't need to buy rice because he receives it from supporters, amidst rising rice prices and shortages. Eto's remarks, made at a fundraising party, have sparked public fury and accusations of being out of touch. This comes as Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government faces scrutiny for its handling of the rice market, where prices have roughly doubled compared to the previous year. The government is now moving to release rice from emergency stockpiles to stabilize prices.</p>

Ramaphosa also intends to reset his relationship with Elon Musk, a vocal critic of South Africa, and explore potential business opportunities, including Tesla building electric vehicle charging stations. Ramaphosa plans to challenge Trump's Afrikaner genocide accusations by pointing to America's support of Israel, arguing that it is hypocritical to accuse South Africa of genocide while overlooking what he considers a genocide in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Presidential elections in Romania and Poland have slowed the advance of hard-right nationalist movements.

She introduced the 'IVF for Military Families Act' to require TRICARE to cover infertility diagnosis and treatment, including IVF. Jacobs expresses skepticism about Trump's commitment but urges him to support this demographic, emphasizing the need for comprehensive reproductive care for all.</p>

The crisis began after a child tested positive for high lead levels, leading to the discovery of lead paint and dust in multiple schools. The Trump administration denied Milwaukee's request for federal support by laying off the CDC's lead exposure team. City officials are now navigating the crisis independently, conducting inspections and replacing lead water service lines.

This decision impacts states that expanded Medicaid to include services like housing and nutrition.

The pullback has led to chaos and confusion in states that have expanded their Medicaid programs, with concerns about upending investments already underway.

          <p>A 'significant amount' of private data has been stolen from Legal Aid's online system, including details of domestic abuse victims. The breach covers all areas of the aid system and includes addresses, dates of birth, national ID numbers, and financial data. The Ministry of Justice said the agency's services were hacked in April, with data dating back to 2010 downloaded. The public is urged to be alert for suspicious activity and update potentially exposed passwords. The Legal Aid Agency's online digital services have been taken offline.</p>

          <p>Recent polls indicate a decline in support for the Labour party in the UK since their victory last summer. The Reform party held the lead in voting intention for the entire month of February. Support for Reform has grown across all demographic groups, especially among the young. The Prime Minister's approval ratings have also declined, with negative perceptions exceeding those of Nigel Farage. Polls suggest Reform is leading in the Midlands and the South outside of London.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, sparking renewed attention on his decline during his time in office. The diagnosis comes as an upcoming book alleges Biden experienced a physical and cognitive decline while in office. The diagnosis has a Gleason score of 9, indicating a more aggressive form of the disease. NPR reports the book is likely to be an extended and uncomfortable news cycle for Democrats who are trying to move on and restore trust with voters.</p>

          <p>A Mexican security consultant who recently did contract work for the U.S. State Department has been killed in what appears to be a cartel ambush at a restaurant in Guadalajara.

Carlos Amador, the former undersecretary of security for Hidalgo state, was also killed, while a third instructor is in critical condition. The violence marks the latest in a series of attacks in Jalisco.</p>

          <p>France will build a new high-security prison in French Guiana to house drug traffickers and radical Islamists. The facility, costing â‚¬400m, will be built in an isolated location deep in the Amazon jungle and could open as early as 2028. The prison will hold up to 500 people, with a separate wing for the most dangerous criminals. The goal is to target organized crime and disrupt drug supply chains, as the location's distance from the French mainland means drug lords "will no longer be able to have any contact with their criminal networks".</p>

          <p>Domestic energy prices in England, Wales and Scotland are forecast to fall in July, marking the first drop in regulator Ofgem's price cap for a year. Analysts at Cornwall Insight predict that the bill for a typical household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will fall by Â£129 a year, a drop of nearly 7%. This would mean a typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit would cost Â£1,720, down from the current level of Â£1,849.</p>

          <p>The lack of affordable child care in America has intensified the debate over what constitutes 'quality' care. Differing perspectives exist, with progressives emphasizing credentialed teachers and academic standards, while conservatives prioritize nurturing care from parents and community caregivers. States have implemented Quality Rating and Improvement Systems (QRIS) to measure child care quality, but evidence is mixed on whether these ratings predict better outcomes for children. The question of how best to ensure positive outcomes for young children remains a central debate.</p>

Public education maintains lower quit rates than most other industries, and teachers tend to have lower turnover rates than other education employees.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an 'aggressive' form of prostate cancer, characterized by a 'Gleason score of 9.' A Gleason score indicates how likely the cancer is to advance and spread. A score of 9 means the cancer cells look very different from normal prostate cells and are likely to grow and spread rapidly. This places the cancer in Grade Group 5, the highest risk category. Possible treatment options include hormone therapy.</p>

          <p>Spain's government has ordered Airbnb to block more than 65,000 holiday listings on its platform for violating rules. Many of the listings did not include their license number or specify whether the owner was an individual or a company. Others listed numbers that didn't match what authorities had. Spain is grappling with a housing affordability crisis that has spurred government action against short-term rental companies. Barcelona announced a plan to close down all of the 10,000 apartments licensed in the city as short-term rentals by 2028.</p>

The chicks are being nurtured by a farmer, Yan Swiderski, and the Cornwall Stork Project. Wildlife expert Chris Packham said the project is 'exciting' and will 'hopefully recolonise Cornwall' with the birds. A few of the chicks needed specialist care from the nearby Screech Owl Sanctuary. The first wild white stork chicks in the UK for hundreds of years hatched at the Knepp Estate in West Sussex in 2020.</p>
