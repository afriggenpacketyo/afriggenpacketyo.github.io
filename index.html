          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer outlined a mixed market environment, shaped by both positive and negative factors. He pointed to a new U.S. trade deal with Japan and strong demand for data center electrification as positive drivers, alongside a robust earnings season. However, Cramer also warned of speculative "froth" in the market reminiscent of previous financial crises, citing unusual activity in certain stocks. He advised investors to remain skeptical but not cynical, acknowledging that significant money is still being made despite the conflicting signals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Uber is launching a new program in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Detroit that will allow women passengers to request female drivers. The feature, called "women drivers," also gives women the option to share rides exclusively with other women. The company acknowledges that this preference may lead to longer wait times, given that only about one in five of its drivers are women. This initiative, which also allows female drivers to prioritize female riders, expands on similar successful programs Uber has operated in 40 other countries.</p>

          <p>South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix announced record-breaking operating profit and revenue for the second quarter, surpassing market estimates. The company's success is largely driven by sustained, high demand for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) technology, which is essential for generative AI chipsets used by clients like Nvidia. Revenue and operating profit saw significant year-over-year growth of 35% and 68%, respectively. SK Hynix stated that it anticipates stable demand for the remainder of the year due to healthy customer inventory levels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An exhibit at Muir Woods National Monument, designed to add missing historical context about Indigenous peoples and women, has been removed following a Trump administration executive order. The "History Under Construction" project used sticky notes to add facts to an existing timeline, including the complex legacies of figures like John Muir. The executive order directs federal sites to remove what it deems "unpatriotic" or partisan content. A former park ranger who helped create the exhibit criticized the move as an act of censorship that erases a more complete version of American history.</p>

          <p>A search warrant filed in the investigation into the deaths of three Los Angeles County Sheriff's detectives reveals they may have believed the grenades they were handling were inert. According to the document, bomb squad technicians X-rayed the devices at the scene and told local police they appeared inactive before transporting them. At least one of the grenades later detonated at a training facility, killing the three veteran detectives. The investigation by the sheriff's department and the ATF is ongoing to determine the exact cause of the explosion.</p>

          <p>Recent comments by In-N-Out owner Lynsi Snyder about her personal move to Tennessee and the challenges of doing business in California sparked widespread rumors that the company was relocating.

          <p>China's plan to build a massive dam on the Yarlung Tsangpo river in Tibet is raising geopolitical concerns, particularly for India. The project is expected to be the world's largest, generating three times more electricity than the Three Gorges Dam. While Beijing states the power is for external consumption, observers believe it will significantly increase China's influence over power-deficient South Asian neighbors like Nepal, Bhutan, and Bangladesh. This strategic leverage could alter the balance of power in a region where China and India are competing for influence.</p>

The author argues that China's only treaty ally is North Korea, and its strategic partnership with Russia would likely not extend to military intervention. On the American side, even key allies like Japan and the Philippines would probably offer only limited and cautious support, such as patrols or logistical assistance, rather than engaging in direct combat.

          <p>One of the most universally understood words, "OK," has its roots in a 19th-century American joke. Scholars have traced its first appearance to an 1839 Boston newspaper, where it was used as a playful abbreviation for a deliberate misspelling of "all correct" as "oll korrect." The term gained widespread popularity during President Martin Van Buren's 1840 reelection campaign. His supporters formed "O.K.

The idea, recently introduced in a House bill, is intended to boost the housing market and provide financial relief to long-term homeowners, particularly seniors.

Experts recommend incorporating feasible activities into daily routines, such as taking walks or using stairs.
