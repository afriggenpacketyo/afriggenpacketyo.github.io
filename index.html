          <p>President Trump's effort to overturn birthright citizenship is consistent with his long-standing political strategy of questioning who gets to claim to be an American, according to the New York Times. The article traces Trump's history of questioning citizenship, from his false claims about President Obama's birthplace to his attacks on political rivals. Legal experts note that Trump's actions aim to create division and rally support from his base by targeting immigrants and challenging established constitutional rights. The Supreme Court is currently reviewing the issue of nationwide injunctions, which could impact Trump's ability to implement his executive order on birthright citizenship.</p>

He had been named as a suspect but never convicted in several other slayings around the country, once claiming to have killed about 70 people.

While the administration welcomes white South Africans as refugees, it simultaneously seeks to limit birthright citizenship for American-born children of undocumented immigrants. This raises questions about whether the administration's policies are designed to support all children and families or only those that align with a specific political base. The government also wants to exclude an estimated 150,000 babies born every year to undocumented parents.</p>

          <p>A Republican proposal to cut green tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act could increase household utility bills and cause job losses, according to The Guardian. New data shows that rescinding these incentives would increase the price of electricity and gas, leading to economic slowdown. The study focuses specifically on credits 48E and 45Y for clean energy investment and production, and finds that at least 19 states would see the cost of energy increase between 2026 and 2032 if the rollbacks proceed as proposed. New Jersey is expected to see the biggest economic losses, with households losing an average of $1,040 in annual income.</p>

          <p>President Trump's approach to Israel appears to be shifting away from the traditional alignment, as he conducts foreign policy with less concern for Israeli input, according to Vox. Trump has engaged in direct talks with Israel's adversaries, such as Hamas and Iran, without coordinating with Israel, a nearly unprecedented situation. While the administration remains rhetorically pro-Israel and has taken steps to punish Israel's critics, Trump seems more focused on regional deals and economic interests, potentially at the expense of longstanding US-Israel cooperation. The shift reflects a changing GOP and a changing Middle East, with Trump prioritizing relationships with Gulf states and seeking to reduce America's military footprint in the region.</p>

Whole life insurance offers a cash component that can be borrowed from while alive and provides a financial benefit to beneficiaries after death.

          <p>The Trump administration is investigating whether Harvard's admissions policies comply with a Supreme Court ruling that ended affirmative action, according to the New York Times. The Justice Department notified Harvard about an investigation into whether its admissions process had been used to defraud the government under the False Claims Act. The inquiry adds to mounting pressure on Harvard to overhaul its admissions, curriculum, and hiring practices to align with President Trumpâ€™s political agenda. Some university officials fear that the range of civil investigations could turn into full-blown criminal inquiries.</p>
