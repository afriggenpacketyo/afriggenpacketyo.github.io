          <p>The Metropolitan Police chief expressed his shock and frustration regarding a planned protest in London supporting Palestine Action, particularly after activists from the group broke into RAF Brize Norton and sprayed military planes. While acknowledging the right to protest, Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley emphasized that actions supporting what he described as an "organized extremist criminal group" exceeded legitimate protest boundaries. The Met Police plans to impose conditions on the protest to prevent disorder and damage, stating that breaches of the law will be dealt with firmly, though they lack the power to prevent the protest entirely until the group is officially proscribed. Counter-terrorism police are investigating the RAF Brize Norton incident, with the government considering proscribing Palestine Action as a terrorist organization, a move met with both support and criticism. The event is politically charged and is causing friction between those who support the action and those who are in opposition. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid heightened tensions following reported U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Iran's parliament has reportedly approved a measure to block the Strait of Hormuz, a critical waterway for global oil supplies. The decision now rests with Iran's national security council, raising concerns about potential disruptions to energy markets and further aggravating geopolitical tensions. Experts suggest that closing the strait would risk alienating Iran's neighbors and trade partners, particularly China, which relies heavily on Iranian oil exports. Analysts believe the likelihood of closure remains low, as it would inflict significant self-harm on Iran's economy and potentially invite retaliation against its oil infrastructure. The blockage of the Strait of Hormuz would have dire economic consequences for the surrounding region and the world. </p>

          <p>The Japanese government appeared to express some support for the U.S. strikes on Iran's key nuclear sites, signaling Washington's determination to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya stated that Japan understands the U.S. action demonstrates its resolve to de-escalate the situation, while also acknowledging ongoing dialogue efforts. Japan, heavily reliant on Middle Eastern crude oil, has traditionally maintained amicable relations with Iran, and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba emphasized the importance of de-escalation and preventing Iranian nuclear weapon possession. The government is closely monitoring the conflict's impact on Japan's energy supply, especially after reports that Iran's parliament backed closing the Strait of Hormuz in retaliation for the U.S. airstrikes, potentially disrupting vital oil shipments. The decision to support the U.S. strikes is a calculated move, balancing Japan's energy needs and its alliance with the United States. </p>

          <p>A Russian drone and missile attack on Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, resulted in at least five deaths and multiple injuries, with emergency services working to rescue individuals trapped in a partially collapsed apartment building. Elsewhere in Ukraine, another person was killed and eight were injured in Bila Tserkva, adding to the devastation. The strikes followed a previous attack that killed 28 people, prompting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to call it one of the war's largest bombardments. The attacks targeted residential areas, hospitals, and sports infrastructure, causing extensive damage and prompting tearful responses from onlookers. The Kremlin has condemned the U.S. strikes on Iran, a country with increasingly aligned interests with Moscow, and has no plans for further discussions between Putin and Trump following the recent escalation. </p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detained the wife of a Marine Corps veteran during a routine immigration appointment in New Orleans, stirring considerable controversy. Adrian Clouatre, the veteran, is struggling to care for his children, including a breastfeeding infant, while his wife, Paola, faces deportation. Immigration law experts argue that the Trump administration's strict enforcement directives have disregarded previous considerations afforded to military families, with the agency tasked with assisting military families now referring them for deportation. The Clouatres are seeking to reopen Paola's deportation order, while Homeland Security maintains that Paola is in the country illegally, emphasizing adherence to the law. The agency's actions have drawn criticism, especially given ongoing Marine Corps recruitment efforts promoting enlistment as a path to immigration benefits for families. </p>

          <p>Heightened uncertainty in the Middle East, stemming from U.S. strikes on Iran and Iran's threat to close the Strait of Hormuz, has raised concerns about the global economy. Analysts warn that a potential shutdown of the Strait of Hormuz could lead to higher crude prices, increased U.S. inflation, and complications for the Federal Reserve's rate-cut plans. Gold is expected to benefit from geopolitical shocks, while Chinese assets may remain relatively insulated. The China International Capital Corporation suggests that markets may struggle to gauge the potential for escalation, leading to increased risk aversion in the short term. The potential for oil prices to surge to $100-$120 range is a very real threat to the global economy. </p>

          <p>NATO allies are set to pledge increases in their defense spending, potentially reaching 5% of their gross domestic product (GDP), driven by pressure from the U.S. amid ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. The proposed 5% includes 3.5% for "pure" defense and 1.5% for security-related infrastructure like cyber warfare capabilities and intelligence. While some member states are willing to meet this target, others struggle to reach the existing 2% threshold, raising questions about the feasibility of these pledges. Defense analysts suggest this year's NATO summit could be the most consequential in the alliance's history, with concerted action being crucial to address global instability. The alliance is hoping to deter any potential military threats. </p>

          <p>Despite facing extensive sanctions following its invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russia's economy has shown remarkable resilience, even outgrowing all G7 nations in 2024, according to official figures. The growth was primarily driven by record military spending and relatively stable oil exports redirected to China and India, with a "shadow fleet" of tankers helping to circumvent sanctions. While the Russian ruble has become the best-performing world currency this year, challenges such as high inflation, rising interest rates, and worker shortages are emerging. Russia's economy minister has warned of the country being "on the verge" of recession, but economists suggest any downturn will be mild, with unemployment remaining low. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Siarhei Tsikhanouski, a key Belarusian opposition figure, was released from prison after five years and reunited with his wife, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, in Lithuania. Tsikhanouski, who was imprisoned in 2020, described his experience as torture, detailing isolation, denial of medical care, and insufficient food. He credited Donald Trump with aiding his release, suggesting Belarusian authorities are seeking improved relations with the West. Despite his health deterioration, Tsikhanouski remains committed to fighting for change in Belarus, blaming Vladimir Putin for supporting Alexander Lukashenko's regime.

          <p>Detectives have renewed their appeal for information ten years after the murder of John "Goldfinger" Palmer, a notorious criminal shot six times in his garden in 2015. Palmer earned his nickname from accusations of melting gold from the 1983 Brink's-Mat robbery and was also known for scamming thousands of timeshare owners. Essex Police believe the key to solving the murder lies within the underworld and suspect it may be linked to the fraud trial. The police have admitted failings in the initial investigation, and are hoping that changed loyalties within the criminal community will encourage individuals to come forward with information. The case remains unsolved. </p>

          <p>Ketamine is increasingly known as a party drug which is linked to serious health problems, even fatalities. But there is growing interest in Scotland in its potential to treat severe depression. One NHS Lothian psychiatrist hopes to set up a clinic by the end of the year offering the Category B drug as an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), a treatment that involves sending an electric current through the brain. Prof Andrew McIntosh thinks it could offer another alternative to patients with the most hard-to-treat depression. The private clinic in Hamilton opened under licence from Healthcare Improvement Scotland in September and charges Â£6,000 for a programme of four intravenous ketamine infusions and a course of psychotherapy.</p>

Analysts suggest that the market views the attack on Iran as a relief, with minimal risks of the conflict spreading to the rest of the region.

          <p>At a summit in The Hague, NATO aims to set ambitious goals, including member states spending 5% of their economic output on defense, which will place heavy demands on Germany's military, the Bundeswehr. While Chancellor Friedrich Merz has pledged to provide the necessary financial resources, there is debate within his coalition government about the feasibility and justification of such high spending. In addition to finances, the summit will focus on military capabilities, with a need for additional troops in Europe, potentially requiring Germany to recruit tens of thousands of soldiers. The question of reinstating compulsory military service is also being discussed, given the challenges in recruiting personnel and the potential withdrawal of US troops from Europe. </p>

          <p>Colombia's military has reported that 57 soldiers have been kidnapped by civilians in the Micay Canyon area, with 31 soldiers seized on Saturday and the rest on Sunday. The military claims that the civilians are acting under pressure from dissidents of the Farc rebel group, which agreed to a peace deal with the government in 2016. The mountainous region is a key zone for cocaine production and remains one of the most tense areas in the country's ongoing conflict with rebel groups. The soldiers are being held captive. </p>
