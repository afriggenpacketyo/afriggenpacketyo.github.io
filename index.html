          <p>President Trump expressed his challenges in securing a deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping, amidst ongoing trade tensions between the two nations. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted stalled trade talks, suggesting the leaders' intervention is necessary, although it remains uncertain if a call between them has been arranged. Trump criticized Xi's toughness on Truth Social, while China has accused the U.S. of undermining its interests through negative measures, including restrictions on rare earth exports and technology access. These actions complicate efforts to resolve trade disputes and highlight the complexities in the U.S.-China relationship. Optimism surrounding the future of relations between the two nations is relatively low. </p>

          <p>The European Commission has approved Bulgaria's readiness to adopt the euro, paving the way for the country to join the eurozone on January 1, 2026, after reforms to reduce inflation. The decision confirms Bulgaria meets the necessary economic criteria, and the European Central Bank also assessed the economy as sufficiently prepared. While the move is expected to boost Bulgaria's economy by providing access to the ECB's monetary policy and simplifying cross-border transactions, it has faced backlash and protests over concerns about national sovereignty and economic stability. Despite political instability, Bulgaria has made steady efforts to align its economy with eurozone standards. </p>

          <p>CrowdStrike's stock declined after the cybersecurity firm issued weaker-than-expected revenue guidance for the current quarter, impacted by last July's IT outage. The company anticipates revenue between $1.14 billion and $1.15 billion, falling short of analysts' estimates, with adjusted earnings per share projected between 82 cents and 84 cents. The outage led to a customer commitment package, which reduced revenue by $11 million in the quarter, and the company expects a further $10 million to $15 million impact through the fiscal year. Despite exceeding earnings estimates for the first fiscal quarter and announcing a $1 billion share repurchase plan, the lackluster guidance and lingering issues have caused investor concern. </p>

          <p>According to his biographer Stephen Witt, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, despite leading a company valued at nearly $3.4 trillion, is significantly driven by negative emotions, particularly a fear of failure. Witt, who interviewed Huang for six hours for his book "The Thinking Machine," noted that Huang's anxiety, paranoia about competition, and guilt about letting people down fuel his drive. This contrasts with other CEOs Witt has interviewed, who are typically more upbeat and optimistic. Huang's discomfort when things are going well highlights the extent to which negative emotions influence his leadership and work ethic. </p>

          <p>The German Cabinet has approved stricter asylum measures aimed at curbing irregular migration, including making it easier to designate "safe countries of origin" for deporting rejected asylum-seekers. This move follows a court ruling that deemed border pushbacks unlawful, creating a legal setback for Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt's policies. The proposed changes would give the government sole responsibility for determining safe countries, eliminating the need for parliamentary approval, and would abolish a rule requiring state-appointed lawyers for those in pre-deportation custody. Legal experts and human rights groups have criticized the measures, arguing they complicate asylum regulations and undermine the rights of endangered individuals. </p>

While inflation is declining, it remains above the Fed's target, and the job market is solid, reducing the urgency for rate cuts. Experts anticipate rates will remain in the mid-to-upper 6% range through mid-2025, regardless of Fed actions.
