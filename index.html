          <p>A Harris's hawk, nicknamed "Bomber Harris," that had been dive-bombing residents of Flamstead, Hertfordshire, has been given a permanent home by a local falconer. The hawk, responsible for attacks on approximately 50 people, including one hospitalization, was captured last month and has since been trained by Wayne Housden. Housden built an aviary for the hawk and plans to feature him at the Flamstead Scarecrow Festival in August, with hopes of eventually allowing him to fly freely. The hawk's behavior was likely due to hormonal or territorial issues, and Housden believes the bird was a captive-bred escapee. The local community is relieved that the hawk is no longer a threat.</p>

          <p>Fast fashion giant Shein is reportedly facing increased difficulties with its initial public offering (IPO), now aiming for a Hong Kong listing after failing to secure approval from Chinese regulators for a London IPO. The company has faced scrutiny over alleged forced labor practices and consumer protection law breaches, including fake discounts and misleading sustainability claims. Recent regulatory changes, such as the closure of the U.S.'s de minimis loophole for low-cost goods, have further added to Shein's challenges. Analysts suggest a Hong Kong listing may be more suitable given the ongoing criticism and regulatory hurdles. (not investment advice)</p>

Giuliani highlighted Kerik's leadership during and after the September 11th attacks, noting that Kerik was by his side within 20 minutes of the attack and "never left." Kerik's career was marked by achievements in law enforcement and controversies, including a prison sentence for federal felonies, which were later pardoned by President Trump. The two worked together again to investigate claims of election fraud following the 2020 presidential election.</p>

          <p>Glaciers, crucial freshwater reserves, are melting at twice the rate measured two decades ago, affecting communities worldwide. A recent glacier collapse in the Swiss Alps engulfed a village, underscoring the impacts of a warming world. The melting ice poses risks of flooding and infrastructure damage, as seen in Pakistan and India, where glacial lakes have caused deadly floods. Reduced water supply is also impacting agriculture and electricity generation, forcing communities to adapt. As sea levels rise due to melting ice sheets, low-lying islands are at risk, highlighting the need to address rising temperatures to protect glaciers.</p>

          <p>A New York court ruled that President Trump's blanket import taxes were illegal, but an appeals court allowed them to continue temporarily. Despite this, the ruling has limited immediate impact on the UK-US trade deal because it doesn't affect tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum, which are key UK exports. Although a UK-US deal to reduce car tariffs to 10% and eliminate steel and aluminum tariffs exists, it's not yet in force. The government is working to implement the deal quickly, but uncertainty remains about the future of tariffs on other UK goods like salmon and whisky. This adds another layer of unpredictability to international trade, making business planning difficult. (not investment advice)</p>

The report, co-published with an insurance company, also underscores the role of saltmarshes in protecting homes from coastal flooding.

          <p>Japan's parliament has begun debating legislation that would allow married couples to keep separate surnames, marking the first such deliberations in 28 years. Despite growing public support, the passage of the opposition-sponsored bills is unlikely during the current Diet session. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) remains hesitant, citing concerns about family cohesion and traditional values. Revisions to the Civil Code are necessary to enable couples to retain their individual family names after marriage, a practice predominantly affecting women who currently abandon their maiden names. A recent Kyodo News poll indicated that 71 percent of respondents support the dual family-name system.</p>

          <p>President Trump has attacked conservative legal activist Leonard Leo, calling him a "bad person" who "probably hates America." Trump's criticism follows a court ruling, which was paused by an appellate court, that deemed most of his tariffs illegal. Trump suggested the ruling was influenced by judges who dislike him. He expressed disappointment with the Federalist Society, claiming it was under Leo's influence and gave him poor advice on judicial nominations. Leo responded by expressing gratitude for Trump's transformation of the federal courts, stating it was a privilege to be involved.</p>

Kerik served as New York City's police commissioner during the September 11th attacks and was initially hailed as a hero.

He served three years in prison before receiving a pardon from President Donald Trump in 2020. He was considered for the role of Homeland Security chief in 2004, but lied to the White House during vetting, which ultimately led to him pleading guilty to eight felonies, including tax fraud, in 2009.</p>

          <p>Chinese biotechnology firms are increasingly entering into mega drug-licensing agreements with multinational companies, driven by cost savings and depressed valuations. These deals often involve a "newco" structure, combining intellectual property licensing with fundraising via a newly established corporate vehicle. CSPC Pharmaceutical Group recently announced potential deals worth up to US$5 billion for its drug candidates. This trend reflects a broader strategy for Chinese biotech firms to license their intellectual property as an alternative to raising funds through share sales.

The two nations have agreed on "technical requirements for the resumption of seafood exports."
