          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler is resigning, creating an opening on the rate-setting committee. Her departure, effective this fall, allows President Trump to nominate a replacement for her term, which was set to expire in January 2026. Kugler, a Biden appointee, has recently held hawkish views, supporting steady rates amidst concerns over tariff-related inflation. Her resignation could shift the committee's dynamics, as two existing Trump appointees recently voted for a rate cut. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Miami jury has found Tesla partially liable in a wrongful death lawsuit, ordering the company to pay $200 million in punitive damages. The case involved a 2019 crash where a Model S using Autopilot killed 22-year-old Naibel Benavides Leon and severely injured her boyfriend. The plaintiffs argued that defects in Tesla's self-driving technology were a contributing factor. This verdict is seen as a significant test for Tesla, which faces ongoing scrutiny over its Autopilot system's safety, and could encourage similar lawsuits.</p>

          <p>Germany is engaged in a contentious debate over raising the national retirement age beyond 67 to address its aging population and strained pension system. Economy Minister Katherina Reiche's proposal to work "more and longer" has sparked backlash from political opponents and trade unions, who argue it would penalize manual laborers unable to work longer. With a sinking ratio of workers to pensioners, experts agree reform is urgent but are divided on the solution. Options being discussed include incentivizing later retirement or expanding the contribution base. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has fired Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, following the release of a weak July jobs report. The report showed that only 73,000 jobs were added, and it included a sharp downward revision of 258,000 jobs for May and June. In a social media post, Trump called the numbers a "major mistake" and baselessly accused the Biden-appointed commissioner of manipulating data for political purposes. The move injects political turmoil into a key government statistical agency responsible for producing vital economic data. (not investment advice)</p>

The administration argues its revival is necessary to combat declining physical well-being and rising obesity among American youth, framing it as a threat to national vitality.

          <p>The Untold Story, a bookstore in Anaheim focusing on BIPOC authors and community activism, has successfully relocated and is flourishing as a local cultural center. After struggling in an isolated industrial location, owner Lizzette Barrios Gracián moved the shop to a more central spot, where it has attracted a diverse and loyal following. The store serves as a welcoming space for open mic nights, book clubs, and organizing, offering a rare cultural venue for the city's youth. The bookstore's success is measured by the vibrant, supportive community it has united.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is suspending approximately $200 million in federal research grants to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), alleging the school has not adequately addressed antisemitism on campus. The move, which affects around 300 grants from agencies like the NIH and NSF, was condemned by the university's chancellor as a penalty that defunds "life-saving research." This action follows a DOJ investigation into the university's response to pro-Palestinian protests and is part of a broader federal pressure campaign on prominent universities over campus activism. UCLA stated it has already taken steps to combat antisemitism.</p>

          <p>A report from The Tech Transparency Project reveals that Google has removed more than 50 organizations related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) from a public list of its policy-related funding recipients. This change is part of a larger shift where 214 groups were dropped while 101 were added. The move aligns with a broader trend of companies pulling back on public DEI commitments amid political pressure and cost-cutting measures. Google stated the list reflects contributions from one specific team and does not represent all of its philanthropic giving for the year.</p>

          <p>Celebrity chef Paula Deen has announced the immediate and permanent closure of her flagship Savannah restaurant, The Lady & Sons, after nearly three decades in business. The restaurant, known for its Southern buffet, was a major tourist destination and the foundation of her culinary empire. A statement from Deen did not provide a reason for the closure, which also affects her second Savannah eatery, The Chicken Box. Deen's four other restaurants located outside of Georgia will remain open, but the closing marks the end of an era for the Savannah dining scene.</p>

          <p>Steve Witkoff, President Trump's special envoy, visited a controversial US- and Israeli-backed aid distribution site run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The purpose of the visit was to assess the humanitarian situation for the president, but it has drawn criticism from Palestinians and aid groups who label it a "media stunt." The GHF sites have been the location of numerous deadly incidents, with the UN reporting hundreds of Palestinians killed nearby. Witkoff's visit occurs amid dire warnings of mass starvation and criticism of the militarized aid system.</p>

          <p>President Trump is facing backlash for including former NFL star Lawrence Taylor, a registered sex offender, at a White House event launching the revived Presidential Fitness Test for children. Taylor, who in 2011 pleaded guilty to sexual misconduct involving a trafficked 16-year-old girl, was given the microphone to speak in support of the initiative. Critics immediately condemned the decision to feature a convicted sex offender at an event focused on youth, calling it a new low and highlighting the jarring optics. The White House has not provided an explanation for Taylor's prominent inclusion.</p>

          <p>Infielder José Caballero experienced a highly unusual situation when he was traded from the Tampa Bay Rays to the New York Yankees during a game between the two teams. Caballero started the game for the Rays, even recording an out at second base, before being pulled in the seventh inning after the trade was finalized. He was seen saying goodbye to his stunned Rays teammates in the dugout before effectively joining the winning side, as the Yankees won 7-4. The trade sends Caballero, who is tied for the MLB lead in stolen bases, to the team he grew up rooting for.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. job market is showing clear signs of weakening after the July jobs report revealed that employers added only 73,000 jobs, a figure below the rate needed to keep up with population growth. Economists are particularly concerned by massive downward revisions to May and June's figures, which erased a previously reported 258,000 jobs. This slowdown is attributed to headwinds from President Trump's tariff policies, which create business uncertainty, and higher interest rates. The data points to a stagnant market with reduced hiring, posing challenges for job seekers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 76-year-old man has been charged with three counts of wilful ill treatment of a child following an incident at a summer camp in Leicestershire, England.

All have since been discharged from the hospital. The police watchdog is also investigating the force's handling of the incident.

          <p>A UK Supreme Court ruling has limited the ability of millions of motorists to claim compensation for hidden commissions on car loans. The court sided with finance companies in two of three key test cases, which focused on whether discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs) paid to dealers constituted bribery. While the ruling narrows the scope for widespread payouts, those with finance deals containing a DCA before January 2021 may still be eligible for compensation through a potential scheme organized by the Financial Conduct Authority. The decision leaves many motorists' claims in an uncertain state.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. stocks fell sharply on Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average declining by more than 500 points. The slide was driven by a combination of a weaker-than-expected July jobs report and the announcement of new, widespread U.S. tariffs on over 60 countries. The employment data, which showed minimal job growth and significant downward revisions for prior months, signaled a potential stall in the labor market. The new tariffs have intensified investor concerns about global trade and economic stability, pushing markets lower. (not investment advice)</p>
