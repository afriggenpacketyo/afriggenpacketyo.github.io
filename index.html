          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries criticizes President Trump's proposal to deploy federalized National Guard troops to Chicago, calling it a 'manufactured crisis.' Jeffries, along with Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, argues that such a move would be an unconstitutional overreach of federal power, especially as local crime rates are reportedly declining. This plan follows previous deployments in Washington D.C. and Los Angeles, raising concerns about militarizing U.S. cities and overriding local authority.</p>

          <p>California is facing a conflict between the legal cannabis industry and child care advocates over a proposed tax cut. A bill seeks to reduce the cannabis excise tax from 19% to 15% for six years, aiming to stabilize the struggling legal weed market. However, this reduction would cut $81 million annually from child care funding, impacting subsidized slots for thousands of low-income children. The debate highlights the instability of funding social services through 'sin taxes' and the state's broader financial challenges.</p>

          <p>Andrew Bailey, the Bank of England governor, cautioned that Britain faces an 'acute challenge' from its weak underlying economic growth and a post-pandemic decline in its workforce. He cited a rise in long-term sickness and fewer young people in work as key factors exacerbating an aging population's strain on the economy. Bailey emphasized the urgent need to boost productivity growth, as official data shows the UK lagging behind other advanced economies in labor force participation, raising concerns about persistent inflation.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old Democratic mayoral candidate for New York City, is campaigning on ambitious promises including tax hikes on the wealthy, free buses, free child care, and a $30 minimum wage by 2030. While his proposals are bold, the article suggests many have little realistic chance of implementation. The piece also briefly touches on broader political themes, including Donald Trump's actions within federal agencies and the challenges facing other major U.S. cities, framing Mamdani's local aspirations within a larger national context.</p>

          <p>Internal Jesuit correspondence reveals that multiple officials within the Roman Catholic order struggled with how to address a priest, Donald B Dickerson, known to have sexually assaulted children, yet he was still ordained. The documents, part of a Louisiana lawsuit, detail repeated warnings and accusations spanning decades, highlighting a systemic failure to protect minors. Despite a superior general's initial agreement to postpone ordination, Dickerson was eventually ordained, and the church is now considering canonizing one official involved in the case.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to introduce new legislation next month overhauling the sentencing system, allowing courts to impose pub and travel bans as part of community sentences. This initiative aims to deter crime and ease prison overcrowding by restricting the use of short prison sentences and enabling early release for well-behaved inmates. While proponents suggest benefits, critics raise concerns about the practical implementation of such bans and the potential for increased pressure on probation services and police forces.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) proposed $1 billion in cuts to home health funding for 2026 will severely impact New Jersey seniors. The author, Diane Myers, contends these cuts, allegedly targeting fraud, will reduce access to vital home-based care, lead to agency closures, and make it harder to recruit staff. This could force many elderly residents into more expensive care settings, despite their preference for home care, ultimately raising long-term healthcare costs.</p>

Parsons, who has missed the entire preseason due to a contract dispute, was seen without a jersey on the sidelines and lying on a training table, sparking viral attention. His social media activity also suggested a potential farewell to the team. The Cowboys owner, Jerry Jones, maintains Parsons is under contract, but the situation highlights significant internal tensions.</p>
