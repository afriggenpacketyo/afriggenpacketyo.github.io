          <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is eliminating Harvard Universityâ€™s student visa program, citing "pro-terrorist conduct" at campus protests and the university's failure to comply with requests for student visa holders' behavioral records. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem stated this action holds Harvard accountable for fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party. This decision, affecting a significant portion of Harvard's student body, is seen as a severe consequence for the university's alleged non-compliance and is intended as a warning to other academic institutions. </p>

Dali's sentencing guidelines call for up to six months in prison, and she has already been held without bail for five months. Dali was arrested after flying to Paris without a ticket and later attempting to cross the border into Canada after removing her GPS monitor. </p>

          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem is expected to announce a fall in domestic gas and electricity prices for millions of households from July, marking the first drop in a year. Analysts forecast a decrease of more than Â£100 in the annual bill for a typical household using gas and electricity. While this reduction is welcome, charities emphasize that many people still struggle to pay their energy bills and owe significant amounts to suppliers. The article explores the impact of the price cap change on consumers and the ongoing challenges of energy affordability. </p>

          <p>Black South Africans have reacted with a mix of anger, disbelief, and humor to President Trump's false claims of genocide against white farmers in their country. After decades of apartheid, they find it infuriating that the Trump administration is casting Afrikaners as victims. Many jokes stem from the idea that most Afrikaners are used to a life of privilege in South Africa, one often made possible by Black workers. Despite Trump's claims, police data does not support evidence of genocide or the idea that white farmers are more likely to be targeted than any other group. </p>
