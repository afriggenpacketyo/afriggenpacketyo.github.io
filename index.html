          <p>Negotiations are set to continue between Birmingham City Council and the Unite union to resolve the ongoing bin workers' strike, which has entered its seventh week. The strike has led to significant waste accumulation, prompting a major incident declaration due to public health and environmental concerns. Despite some progress in clearing waste, residents report ongoing recycling collection issues, with the government urging both parties to negotiate in good faith to restore reliable waste services. Military planners are providing logistical support, though officials emphasize that military presence on the streets is not needed.</p>

Despite diplomatic efforts, Russia continues attacks, with recent drone strikes causing civilian casualties, while Ukrainian negotiators maintain a firm stance on territorial integrity during the talks.

          <p>BP shares experienced a notable increase after activist investor Elliott revealed a stake exceeding 5% in the company.

          <p>Elon Musk plans to significantly reduce his involvement in the US government's Department for Government Efficiency (Doge) following a substantial drop in Tesla's profits and sales. The electric car firm reported a 20% decrease in car sales and a 70% profit decline, attributing the downturn to "changing political sentiment" and trade policies. Musk's political involvement and tariffs on Chinese-made parts have contributed to the company's challenges, with Musk clashing with trade advisor Peter Navarro over tariffs.
