          <p>Amidst the Trump administration's actions regarding international student enrollment at Harvard, Jamie Beaton advises students to remain focused on their goals. Despite the political turmoil, Beaton suggests that prospective students, especially those from abroad, might find an advantage in applying during this period. Harvard's brand remains strong, and the temporary disruption could lead some applicants to consider other institutions, potentially easing competition. The situation is understandably causing anxiety among students, but the long-term value of a Harvard education is likely to endure, according to Beaton.</p>

          <p>Adam Becker's book, *More Everything Forever*, explores the techno-utopian worldview of Silicon Valley leaders like Elon Musk, which promises AI dominance, space colonization, and immortality. Becker argues that these ambitions prioritize a particular vision of the future over present-day concerns. He highlights the quasi-spiritual nature of this utopianism, rooted in the belief that technology can overcome human limits. The book critiques the philosophy of longtermism, which suggests that the potential future outweighs current injustices, and calls for a more grounded, humanistic approach.</p>

          <p>Mars has phased out titanium dioxide, a color additive, from its Skittles products in the U.S. The move follows the additive's ban in the European Union due to potential health risks. The decision comes amid growing concerns about processed foods, particularly with Robert F Kennedy Jr.'s appointment to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Mars had previously committed to removing artificial colors from its foods, citing consumer preferences. The company has not commented on whether consumers will notice any difference.</p>
