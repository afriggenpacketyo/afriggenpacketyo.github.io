Her remarks, made during President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva‚Äôs visit to Beijing, sparked controversy and prompted an official response from TikTok, owned by ByteDance. Janja criticized TikTok for allegedly allowing harmful content to flourish, citing the death of a Brazilian girl who participated in a dangerous online challenge.

          <p>White House visitor logs indicate that several prominent Democratic leaders frequently visited the White House between 2022 and 2024, suggesting they were aware of former President Biden's cognitive decline. Despite this apparent awareness, these leaders publicly defended Biden's leadership capabilities. The revelations coincide with excerpts from a new book and leaked audio from a special counsel interview, both of which raise questions about Biden's cognitive abilities during his presidency.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Port of Los Angeles is experiencing fluctuations due to the ebb and flow of tariff policies and trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Executive Director Gene Seroka reported a 9.5% increase in container units in April compared to the previous year, driven by importers rushing to get cargo in before tariffs took effect. While imports saw a 5% increase, exports fell by 3%, reflecting the uncertainty created by the trade disputes. This situation highlights the complex and often unpredictable impact of tariff policies on global trade and logistics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates have risen above 7% after Moody's downgraded the U.S. credit rating, citing concerns about the government's growing debt levels. This increase marks the first time since April 11 that the average 30-year mortgage rate has exceeded this threshold. Despite the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts last year, mortgage rates have remained high due to their correlation with the 10-year Treasury bond.

          <p>Former President Biden's announcement of his aggressive prostate cancer diagnosis has been met with an outpouring of sympathy and well wishes, yet also some skepticism regarding the timing and transparency of his health disclosures.

The article also notes that medical professionals have raised questions about when Biden may have first been aware of his condition.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's takeover and dismantling of the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) was illegal. The decision declares the actions of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, as "null and void," ordering the reinstatement of USIP's acting president, George Moose. The judge stated that the administration's actions, including the removal of board members and staff, were unlawful because USIP operates independently of the executive branch. The ruling allows USIP to resume its work in promoting peace and stability around the world.</p>

          <p>President Trump is pressuring major U.S. companies to absorb the costs of his tariffs rather than pass them on to consumers. This stance comes as businesses, including Walmart and Mattel, warn they may need to raise prices due to the ongoing trade war. The White House insists that foreign countries should bear the burden of the tariffs, but economists widely believe that the costs ultimately fall on U.S. companies and consumers.

          <p>Melania Trump has supported a new law criminalizing the posting of "intimate images" online without consent, including real or AI-generated content. The Take It Down Act requires technology companies to remove such content within 48 hours. The First Lady described the law as a "national victory" to protect children from online exploitation. While the bill has received bipartisan support and endorsements from figures like Paris Hilton, some digital rights groups express concerns that it could lead to censorship of legitimate content.</p>
