          <p>Following the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University, prominent politicians from both Republican and Democratic parties issued widespread condemnations. President Trump, a close ally, announced Kirk's death and attributed it to the "radical left," while former Presidents Biden, Obama, and Bush also decried the violence, stressing its unsuitability in a democratic society. Vice President JD Vance and First Lady Melania Trump offered poignant personal tributes, highlighting Kirk's impact and the tragic loss for his family. Despite calls for unity, some partisan disagreements surfaced in Congress over observing his death, underscoring the deep political divides in the nation.</p>

          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a Utah university has starkly exposed the deepening crisis of political violence and divisive rhetoric in the United States. This tragic incident, occurring during a public debate, is presented as the latest in a series of high-profile attacks targeting political figures from across the spectrum, including previous attempts on Donald Trump's life and shootings of state legislators. The article suggests that increasing polarization, fueled by social media echo chambers and easy access to firearms, creates a dangerous environment where raw nerves and a heightened potential for bloodshed prevail. Despite widespread calls for cooling rhetoric, a contentious shouting match in Congress after a moment of silence for Kirk underscored the persistent, high partisan tensions, leaving the nation's future uncertain.</p>

          <p>China's official Government Procurement News reported that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Rocket Force has banned 74 bid evaluation experts and 116 suppliers following a comprehensive corruption investigation. These bans, announced between late August and early September, targeted violations dating back to 2016, with some individuals losing qualifications across the entire PLA. The extensive review of the military equipment procurement sector intensified after the downfall of former defense minister Li Shangfu in 2023, signaling a continued commitment to internal discipline. This move underscores President Xi Jinping's ongoing military reforms and efforts to combat corruption within the strategic branch, which oversees some of China’s most important assets, including its strategic nuclear missiles.</p>

The raid, described as the largest single-site anti-immigration operation since President Trump's return to office, has caused outrage in South Korea, coming on the heels of a major trade agreement between the two countries. Seoul's Foreign Minister is in Washington to resolve the diplomatic issue, discussing potential visa solutions, including additional quotas or new categories. President Lee emphasized that Korean companies might hesitate on direct US investments due to perceived risks under the current circumstances, potentially affecting economic ties.</p>

          <p>Under manager David Moyes and new ownership by the Friedkin Group, Everton FC has undergone a significant financial and sporting transformation, moving from near relegation to fifth in the Premier League. The club has relocated to the state-of-the-art Hill Dickinson Stadium and recorded its highest-ever net spend in a summer transfer window, acquiring nine players for £97m. This impressive turnaround follows years of financial struggles and points deductions for breaching profit and sustainability regulations. The club's improved financial outlook, partly due to debt restructuring and strategic timing of transfers, aims to boost future revenues and enhance its squad, with key signings like Jack Grealish making an immediate impact. The team is now eyeing a first trophy since 1995, reflecting renewed optimism and a changed trajectory.</p>

The league is investigating claims that star forward Kawhi Leonard received a $28 million endorsement deal from Aspiration, a sustainability firm with significant ties to the Clippers, which later proved fraudulent. Silver emphasized the league's burden to prove wrongdoing, indicating reluctance to act on mere appearance of impropriety, but also stressed the importance of protecting the league's integrity. The investigation, led by a specialized law firm, will center on whether Ballmer or the Clippers directed Aspiration to make the deal, as these allegations have raised serious questions about fair play and financial rules.</p>

          <p>Facing an industry-wide slowdown, U.S. tariffs, and consumer price sensitivity, luxury fashion brands are diversifying their product lines with more accessible items, such as Louis Vuitton's new $160 lipsticks and $1,400 accessories. This strategy, dubbed "treatonomics," aims to attract new, younger consumers and bring them into the brand's ecosystem without diluting the exclusivity of their core high-end offerings. Experts suggest this approach, previously successful during similar economic dips, allows brands to engage a broader aspirational consumer base and foster long-term loyalty as these customers' wealth grows. However, brands must carefully balance expanding appeal with maintaining their luxury status, a lesson some have learned the hard way through past heavy discounting, making the long-term success of this current phase uncertain.</p>

His death led to a somber, funereal mood in the White House, with Trump expressing deep personal grief and blaming "radical-left political violence" for the tragedy.

          <p>Eyewitnesses reported that conservative activist Charlie Kirk was debating gun violence moments before he was fatally shot in the neck at Utah Valley University. Raydon DeChene, standing near Kirk's "Prove Me Wrong" tent, described seeing blood pouring from his neck after a single "pop" sound, causing panic and a stampede. Other witnesses corroborated that Kirk was about to answer a question on gun violence, an ironic turn of events given the topic. The event, part of TPUSA's "American Comeback Tour," attracted over 3,000 people, but attendees noted a concerning lack of extensive security measures like metal detectors. The university's police chief expressed regret over the security lapse, acknowledging that they "didn't" have things covered despite training for such incidents.</p>

          <p>Three senior FBI officials, abruptly fired last month, have filed a lawsuit alleging they were illegally terminated for political reasons at the direction of the White House. The complaint claims FBI Director Kash Patel stated his job depended on removing agents involved in past investigations of President Trump, who had not forgotten the FBI's actions. The decorated veterans, including former acting FBI director Brian Driscoll, were fired without full pensions, part of a broader FBI makeover under the new administration. The lawsuit also alleges pressure from White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller to conduct summary firings, with the intent to create "panic and anxiety" within the workforce.</p>

          <p>A San José jewelry store family is contemplating closing their business after a violent smash-and-grab robbery, where a mob crashed an SUV through the storefront, brandishing hammers and a gun, and stealing merchandise.

The report highlights significant drops in credible elections, access to justice, and effective parliaments, with Africa and Europe accounting for the largest share of this decline. A "very acute deterioration in press freedom," the biggest drop over the past 50 years, was also a critical finding, affecting 43 countries across all continents. The article notes the US ranks lower than many OECD countries in representation and rights, with concerns about its democratic erosion, and warns that what happens in the US has global implications for democracy.</p>

          <p>A Redfin report claims San Francisco's housing costs have returned to "normal" July 2018 levels, based on a mortgage payment-to-income ratio, with Oakland projected to follow suit. This normalization reflects slowing home-price growth and falling mortgage rates, particularly in tech-driven metros where wages have grown faster than the national rate of 3.9%. However, the analysis clarifies that "normal" does not equate to affordability, as San Francisco households still spent 74% of their income on mortgages in July 2018, significantly higher than the national average of 30%. Moreover, the artificial intelligence boom is reportedly spiking rents, crowding out lower-wage tenants and exacerbating the city's ongoing affordability crisis. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article reflects on the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk as a tragedy for his family and a disaster for the country, warning that such political violence makes further acts more likely in an atmosphere of national paranoia and hatred. The author acknowledges Kirk's role as a charismatic provocateur and a demagogic figure, comparing him to historical figures like Huey Long and Malcolm X. However, the article emphasizes that his murder, occurring while he exercised his freedom of speech in an aggressive style, remains an assault on everything democracy's remaining believers should hold dear. The piece criticizes immediate partisan blame and calls for universal condemnation of violence without using the death as a pretext for political repression or muzzling others from speaking the truth about the perilous state of the nation.</p>

This agreement, which has already seen a "first batch" of 14 individuals arrive, is part of a broader US strategy to deport undocumented immigrants to third countries, including places where deportees have never lived. The deal comes despite hiked tariffs on Ghanaian goods and visa restrictions for Ghanaian nationals, with Mahama stating relations between Accra and Washington are "tightening" but positive. Neighboring Nigeria, however, has resisted similar pressures to accept third-party deportees, hinting at a connection between tariff threats and deportation issues.</p>

          <p>NASA's Mars rover Perseverance has uncovered rocks in a dry river channel that may hold the strongest hints yet of potential signs of ancient microscopic life, scientists reported. The rover collected samples from reddish, clay-rich mudstones in Neretva Vallis, which, upon preliminary analysis, revealed organic carbon and minuscule specks dubbed "poppy seeds" and "leopard spots" enriched with iron phosphate and iron sulfide. On Earth, these chemical compounds are typically byproducts of microorganisms consuming organic matter. While stressing that in-depth analysis on Earth is crucial for definitive conclusions, researchers consider this the most compelling candidate in the rover's search for long-ago life, although non-biological processes could also be responsible for these features, making the findings incredibly exciting but still requiring further study.</p>

Mayor Karen Bass previously declared it a "public health emergency," leading to a city cleanup, but clutter has reaccumulated. Friends of Gaon plead for compassion, stating he is a private individual with routines difficult to break, and that media attention only exacerbates his seclusion and trauma, as he recently suffered a stroke.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has appealed a federal judge's order that blocked him from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, while a lawsuit challenging her removal continues. Judge Jia Cobb ruled that the public interest in Federal Reserve independence favored Cook's reinstatement, citing her strong showing that Trump's purported removal violated the Federal Reserve Act's "for cause" requirement. Trump claimed he was firing Cook due to mortgage fraud allegations, which she denies, with her attorneys arguing it's a pretext for pressuring the Fed to cut interest rates. The Senate Banking Committee also recommended Trump's nominee Stephen Miran for a vacant Fed seat. If Cook is ultimately removed, Trump would be on track to nominate a majority of the central bank's board, raising concerns about its independence. (not investment advice)</p>

This critical issue stems from the decline of the coal industry, which historically funded and operated many town water systems, leaving current infrastructure crumbling.

The Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) states that applying for funding for even well-established advances, such as Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy (SABR), is cumbersome for some centers, leading to unequal availability. This means cutting-edge treatments are often limited to larger, better-funded units, leaving other patients missing out on potentially life-saving care.

His advice includes accepting stress rather than worrying about its effects, as this can exacerbate feelings. He recommends engaging in exercise, which helps the body learn to manage cortisol spikes, and prioritizing consistent sleep routines by aiming for earlier bedtimes and regular wake-up times. Additionally, he advises focusing on self-care through good nutrition, consuming plenty of fruits, vegetables, and quality proteins, and carving out quality alone time for relaxation. The article advocates for mindfulness, not necessarily through formal meditation, but by intentionally planning ahead to pace oneself and alleviate daily pressures.</p>
