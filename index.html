          <p>Singer Cassie Ventura and her husband, Alex Fine, have welcomed their third child. The news comes shortly after Ventura testified in Sean "Diddy" Combs' sex-trafficking and racketeering trial, where she recounted alleged abuse during their on-and-off relationship. Ventura had announced her pregnancy in February with a series of photos on Instagram, and she and Fine were married in October 2019 after meeting at the gym. This latest development adds a personal chapter to Ventura's life amidst the ongoing legal proceedings involving Combs, where she is a key witness.</p>

          <p>A top aide to Vladimir Putin suggested that Donald Trump is not fully informed about the Russia-Ukraine conflict after Trump criticized Putin's reluctance to pursue a peace deal. Yuri Ushakov claimed Trump lacks information about Ukrainian attacks on Russian cities and believes Russia only targets military sites. Trump stated he would know within two weeks if Putin is being genuine about ending the war and hasn't imposed new sanctions because he believes he is close to securing a deal. Meanwhile, drone attacks continue on both sides, with Russia claiming to have downed hundreds of Ukrainian drones and Ukraine reporting impacts in eight locations.</p>

          <p>President Trump defended his tariff strategy, rejecting the notion that he is "chickening out" when he delays or lightens tariff threats. He argued that these actions are part of a negotiation process, citing the European Union as an example, where a 50% tariff threat led to trade talks. Trump believes his approach helps the U.S. gain ground in trade negotiations, despite criticisms that he backs down. He expressed frustration that when he reaches reasonable deals, he is accused of being weak, which he finds unbelievable.</p>

          <p>China has shifted from a major lender to the largest debt collector in the developing world, potentially undermining poverty reduction efforts and fueling instability. As lending under the Belt and Road Initiative winds down, developing countries owe over a quarter of their external debt to China. These countries are expected to pay at least $35 billion to Beijing this year, straining their budgets and impacting spending on essential services like schools and infrastructure. While China's lending was initially led by state-owned banks, commercial banks have since taken their place, learning from past lending missteps.</p>

          <p>A judge denied a request for a mistrial in Sean Combs's federal trial after defense lawyers argued that prosecutors unfairly suggested Combs was responsible for destroying fingerprint evidence. The defense objected to a line of questioning regarding fingerprint cards from an earlier incident at Scott Mescudi's (Kid Cudi) home. Earlier in the day, police and fire officials testified about a trespassing and car fire at Mescudi's home, which the prosecution ties to Combs's jealousy over Mescudi's brief relationship with Casandra Ventura.</p>

          <p>Astronomers have identified a peculiar object in the Milky Way galaxy emitting both X-rays and radio waves in a repeating cycle every 44 minutes. Located 15,000 light-years away, the object's emissions are unlike any known galactic entity, leading scientists to speculate it could be a highly magnetized dead star or something entirely new. The X-ray emissions were spotted by NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, marking the first time such emissions have been observed from a long-period radio transient. Scientists are uncertain if the object is related to a nearby supernova remnant.</p>

The disaster underscores the growing threat to Alpine communities as climate change causes glaciers to melt and permafrost to thaw.

Becker argues that these visions amount to a modern secular theology with real-world consequences, as tech oligarchs prioritize their version of the future over present concerns. He highlights the quasi-spiritual nature of this utopianism, based on the belief that technology can overcome death and human limits. Becker cautions against the potential human cost of pursuing these dreams, particularly the specter of artificial superintelligence and the philosophy of longtermism.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering redirecting $3 billion in grant money from Harvard University to trade schools across the U.S., but education experts say this faces significant obstacles. Federal grants are awarded to research universities like Harvard for specific purposes, such as scientific research, requiring specialized faculty and facilities. Trade schools typically offer vocational training and lack the resources for such research, making a direct transfer of funds both illegal and unrealistic. Experts say that if Trump wanted to redirect funding, he would need to provide evidence that Harvard's grants were not awarded based on merit.</p>
