          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly negotiating with several quantum computing companies, including IonQ and Rigetti, to acquire equity stakes in exchange for federal funding. This move follows a similar pattern of government investment in strategically vital industries, such as rare earths and semiconductors, to bolster national security and compete with China. The policy reflects a shift towards greater government intervention in key technological sectors, with officials arguing the government should benefit from the success of companies it helps fund.</p>

          <p>Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić has condemned a shooting and arson incident outside the country's parliament in Belgrade as a "terrorist attack." A 70-year-old man was arrested after firing a gun at a tent camp set up by Vučić's supporters, injuring one person before setting the tents on fire. The President claimed the act was politically motivated, highlighting the tense political climate ahead of the first anniversary of a deadly building collapse that sparked massive anti-government protests.</p>

          <p>Shares in Sweden's Volvo Cars surged by as much as 41% after the company announced third-quarter operating profits that significantly exceeded analyst expectations. The automaker, owned by China's Geely Holding, attributed the strong performance to its ongoing cost-saving program and some one-off financial items. Despite the positive results, the company cautioned that the short-term outlook remains challenging due to macroeconomic pressures and price competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new film, "The Disappearance of Josef Mengele," chronicles the decades-long evasion of justice by the infamous Nazi physician who conducted sadistic experiments at Auschwitz. Directed by Russian filmmaker Kirill Serebrennikov, the movie is based on a non-fiction book and portrays Mengele's life on the run in South America, supported by a network of sympathizers. The film aims to explore the nature of ideological extremism and the "banality of evil," serving as a cautionary tale in an era of resurgent far-right ideology.</p>

          <p>Following the conclusion of its fourth plenum, China's Communist Party leadership issued a communique pledging to deepen reforms and improve living standards while acknowledging significant external uncertainties. The statement emphasized the resilience of the Chinese economy but warned of the need to navigate "high winds, rough waves and even raging storms." This messaging comes as Beijing finalizes its next five-year plan, facing challenges from a trade war with the U.S., a domestic property crisis, and demographic pressures.</p>

          <p>Four survivors have quit the advisory panel for the national inquiry into child sexual exploitation by grooming gangs, stating they will only rejoin if Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips resigns. The women cited concerns about the inquiry's direction and felt publicly dismissed by Phillips after she described their accounts of government interference as "untrue." The resignations have caused turmoil for the high-profile inquiry, which was established to investigate systemic failures in protecting children from organized abuse.</p>

          <p>The European Union has launched its 19th package of sanctions against Russia, for the first time targeting the country's lucrative liquefied natural gas (LNG) sector. The move was coordinated with the United States, which simultaneously announced its own sanctions against Russia's largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. Top EU officials welcomed the American policy shift, stating that the combined pressure is a signal of transatlantic strength and is necessary to deprive Russia of the revenue it uses to fund its war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The United States has imposed new sanctions on Russia's two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, in a significant policy shift aimed at compelling Moscow to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. President Trump announced the move after expressing frustration that his talks with Vladimir Putin "don't go anywhere." This action represents a major escalation of economic pressure, as the administration had previously hesitated to target Russia's energy sector directly without coordinated European action.</p>

          <p>Despite a persistent and deepening slump in its real estate sector, Chinese policymakers are signaling a strategic focus on technological development rather than large-scale property market bailouts. Analysts note that while real estate investment continues to fall, Beijing's official communications emphasize achievements in high-tech manufacturing and the need to prioritize tech amid geopolitical competition. This suggests the government believes the property crisis is manageable and is unlikely to introduce the kind of major stimulus that some market observers had expected. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to multiple sources, France is backing away from a recent commitment to more aggressively intercept small boats carrying migrants across the English Channel. A promised new "maritime doctrine" to turn boats back to shore is now reportedly stalled, with some insiders calling it a "political stunt." The delay, partly attributed to France's domestic political turmoil, is a setback for the UK government's efforts to stop the dangerous crossings, which continue on a near-daily basis.</p>
