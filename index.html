            <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance has arrived in India for a four-day visit aimed at strengthening bilateral trade relations and avoiding potential U.S. tariffs.

This visit occurs amid ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, making India a crucial strategic ally in the Indo-Pacific region as part of the Quad alliance.

            <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba sent a ritual offering to the Yasukuni Shrine, a controversial symbol of Japan's past militarism, during its spring festival. While Ishiba is not expected to visit the shrine personally due to diplomatic sensitivities, the offering signals a complex balance between honoring tradition and maintaining positive relations with neighboring countries like China and South Korea. The shrine honors wartime leaders, including those convicted as war criminals, along with millions of war dead, making it a point of contention in regional diplomacy. The government maintains that the offering was made in a private capacity.</p>

            <p>A recent survey indicates that postdoctoral positions at Chinese universities significantly outnumber job seekers, contrasting with the situation in the United States. The study analyzed over 24,000 job postings and a similar number of job seekers, finding a substantial gap between vacancies and demand for postdocs in China. This trend is partly attributed to increased research funding in China and the return of high-profile Chinese scientists from institutions like MIT, as the U.S. faces cuts in research funding. The report highlights a growing opportunity for young researchers in China's academic sector.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Gatwick Airport has been identified as the UK's worst airport for flight delays for the second consecutive year, with departures averaging over 23 minutes behind schedule in 2024. The delays are attributed to ongoing air traffic control (ATC) disruptions, both within Europe and at Gatwick's own control tower. While Gatwick officials claim they are working on a plan to improve on-time performance in 2025, passengers affected by ATC issues are generally not entitled to compensation. Belfast City Airport recorded the best punctuality performance, with average delays under 12 minutes.</p>

            <p>An Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) inquiry has concluded that "professional failures" contributed to the deaths of 15 emergency workers in Gaza last month. The investigation cited an "operational misunderstanding" and a "breach of orders" as factors, leading to the dismissal of a unit's deputy commander and reprimand for another officer. The IDF maintains that six of the casualties were Hamas members, a claim disputed by the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS). This incident occurred in a "hostile combat zone" with poor visibility, according to the IDF report.</p>

            <p>China has cautioned nations against appeasing the United States in trade negotiations involving President Donald Trump's tariffs, following reports that Washington is pressuring countries to restrict trade with Beijing in exchange for tariff exemptions.

            <p>American-style restaurants in Beijing are replacing U.S. beef with Australian alternatives due to the ongoing trade war and retaliatory tariffs. Home Plate BBQ, a popular restaurant chain, is reprinting its menus as the 125% tariffs on U.S. beef make it unaffordable. The restaurant, which uses 7 to 8 tonnes of brisket each month, will now source its beef from Australia, which is 40% cheaper, while pork ribs will be imported from Canada. This shift reflects the broader impact of the trade war on businesses and consumers in both countries.</p>

Texas prosecutors opted not to pursue the death penalty, influenced by the wishes of the majority of victims' relatives to bring the case to a close.

            <h2>Rental Assistance Program Faces Funding Shortfall, Threatening Evictions for Thousands</h2>

            <p>A federal program providing rental assistance to approximately 60,000 families and individuals fleeing homelessness and domestic violence is facing a significant funding shortfall. The Emergency Housing Vouchers program, launched in 2021, is expected to run out of money by the end of next year, potentially leading to a large-scale loss of rental assistance and subsequent evictions. Advocates are urging Congress to allocate additional funds to sustain the program, but prospects remain uncertain due to budget constraints and political opposition. The potential loss of this assistance could upend the progress made by vulnerable individuals and families.</p>

            <p>John Ullyot, the former chief Pentagon spokesperson, has resigned and issued a warning about Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, predicting his imminent departure from the role. Ullyot cited "total chaos at the Pentagon," including leaks of sensitive information and mass firings, as major distractions for President Trump. Hegseth has faced scrutiny for allegedly sharing sensitive information outside official channels, including via the Signal messaging app, leading to investigations and the removal of senior leaders. Ullyot hinted at more "bombshell" stories to come, suggesting further instability within the Defense Department.</p>

            <p>Malaysia Aviation Group (MAG), the parent company of Malaysia Airlines, is in discussions with Boeing about potentially acquiring new jets if Chinese airlines decline deliveries due to trade tensions. Boeing appears to be repossessing some of its 737 MAX jets from China, creating an opportunity for MAG to secure earlier-than-expected deliveries. This move could help MAG expand its narrow-body fleet to 55 new generation 737 MAX aircraft by 2030, addressing the global demand for new planes amid supply chain bottlenecks and production slowdowns at Boeing. MAG would need to raise additional funds to finance any potential arrangement.</p>

            <p>The election of Donald Trump presents a unique opportunity for European leaders to strengthen integration and global influence. By completing the European capital markets union, striking new trade deals, developing common defense capabilities, and supporting Ukraine, Europe can assert itself as a reliable partner and counterbalance to U.S. protectionism. Strengthening partnerships with middle- and low-income countries and attracting talent from the U.S. can further enhance Europe's economic and political standing. This approach requires decisive leadership and collaboration among European nations to address both internal and external challenges.</p>

            <p>China has issued a strong warning against the United States' trade tactics, denouncing attempts to pressure trading partners into limiting trade with Beijing in exchange for tariff exemptions. A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce described Washington's approach as "unilateral bullying" and "economic hegemony," vowing to retaliate against any deals made at the expense of Chinese interests. The ministry emphasized that a return to protectionism would harm all countries, calling for joint efforts to uphold a fair global trading system. China insists it has the determination and the capability to defend its rights.</p>

            <p>A nine-year-old boy tragically died after becoming trapped between rocks at a New South Wales beach, bringing Australia's Easter weekend drowning toll to seven. Most of the deaths were attributed to strong swells washing people into the ocean from rocks. Surf Life Saving NSW CEO Steven Pearce described the weekend as the "worst" spate of drownings on record for the Easter long weekend. Authorities are urging caution and emphasizing water safety during the holiday period.</p>

Google has not yet responded to requests for comment. Vladimir Putin has previously accused Google of being a tool used by the U.S. government for political purposes.</p>

            <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba sent a ritual offering to the war-linked Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo on Monday, as the shrine, seen by Japan's neighbors as a symbol of its past militarism, began a three-day spring festival. Ishiba, however, is not expected to visit the shrine during the festival, according to sources familiar with the matter, apparently because of diplomatic considerations at a time when Japan's ties with China and South Korea have been improving. The prime minster made the masakaki offering in a private capacity and therefore it is not something that the government should comment on.</p>

The shrine's enshrinement of wartime leaders, including those convicted as war criminals, has drawn criticism from China and South Korea. Cabinet ministers have also sent offerings, but the government maintains that the prime minister's offering was made in a private capacity.</p>
