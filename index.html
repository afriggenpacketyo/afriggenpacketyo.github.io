          <p>A new food aid system in Gaza, conceived and largely developed by Israeli officials, is set to be carried out by foreign contractors, bypassing experienced aid agencies like the United Nations, according to this New York Times article. The plan, initially proposed in late 2023 by the Mikveh Yisrael Forum, aims to undermine Hamas's control and ensure aid reaches civilians in Israeli-controlled zones, but U.N. officials warn it could restrict aid and facilitate displacement. The initiative involves private organizations led by figures like Philip F. Reilly, a former C.I.A. officer, and is financed by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, with a Western European country donating over $100 million for its operations.</p>

          <p>Caitlin Clark voiced her frustration with WNBA referees after a controversial no-call in the Indiana Fever's 90-88 loss to the New York Liberty. In the game's final seconds, Clark believed she was fouled by Natasha Cloud, who leaned into her, causing her to lose the ball, but no foul was called, ending the game. The no-call prevented Clark from potentially tying or winning the game at the free-throw line and denied her a chance at a 20-point, 10-rebound game, a milestone she narrowly missed. Cloud has previously addressed physical plays against Clark, stating that the backlash is rooted in racism.</p>

          <p>French authorities are investigating a power outage in southeast France, suspecting arson may have played a role, which disrupted the Cannes Film Festival's closing celebrations. The outage, affecting approximately 160,000 households in the Alpes-Maritimes area, was caused by a fire at an electrical substation near Cannes and a fallen high-voltage line. Despite the disruption, Cannes Film Festival organizers confirmed that the closing ceremony and all scheduled events would proceed as planned, utilizing an independent power supply. Laurent Hottiaux, the prefect for the area, condemned the acts and stated that all resources are being mobilized to find the perpetrators.</p>

          <p>An East African crowned crane named Alice, which escaped from Cougar Mountain Zoo in Washington state, was found after being on the loose for nearly three days. Alice was seen strolling through neighborhood streets and later spotted hanging out with a group of great blue herons near Lake Sammamish State Park. Zoo officials documented Alice's adventures on social media, and after receiving a call from a community resident, they gently retrieved her without incident.

          <p>Despite Israel allowing a limited number of aid trucks into Gaza after a prolonged blockade, aid agencies warn that it is insufficient to prevent famine in the coming weeks. While 198 trucks carrying humanitarian aid passed through the Kerem Shalom crossing, this is a fraction of the 600 trucks needed daily to supply the population. Supplies are stuck at distribution points due to security clearance delays, logistical problems, and infrastructure damage from the war. The UN criticizes Israel's plan to use private US security firms for aid distribution, arguing it already has the networks in place.</p>

Alaa al-Najjar, a pediatrician, was at Nasser Hospital when her family's house was struck, while her husband is in intensive care.

The man, who is gay, was protected from being returned to his home country under a U.S. immigration judge's order. Judge Brian Murphy found that the man's removal likely lacked due process, as he was deported to Mexico, where he had previously been sexually assaulted and held for ransom.
