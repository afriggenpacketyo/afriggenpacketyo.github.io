          <p>A gunman attacked a Mormon church in Grand Blanc, Michigan, during a Sunday service, killing one person and injuring at least ten others. The suspect, a 40-year-old man, drove his vehicle into the building, opened fire with an assault rifle, and deliberately set the structure ablaze. Police fatally shot the gunman during a confrontation and believe more victims may be discovered in the fire-damaged church. Investigators are exploring motives, including a possible connection to the recent death of the church's global president.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has ended his bid for reelection amid low poll numbers and a series of political challenges. His withdrawal transforms the race into a three-way contest between Democrat Zohran Mamdani, independent Andrew Cuomo, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Adams' first term was marked by a federal corruption investigation and criticism over his administration's conduct. The decision followed speculation that the White House was exploring other government positions for him to clear the field for other candidates.</p>

          <p>The NBA has launched an investigation into the Los Angeles Clippers and owner Steve Ballmer concerning allegations of salary cap circumvention. The probe centers on whether the team improperly funneled $21 million to star player Kawhi Leonard through an endorsement deal with Aspiration Partners, a sustainability firm in which Ballmer was an investor. Ballmer has denied any wrongdoing, stating he was not involved in the deal and welcomes the investigation. Potential penalties could include a suspension for Ballmer and the loss of future first-round draft picks.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has released images of firearms it says were confiscated from demonstrators during recent protests outside an ICE facility in Chicago. Officials reported that 11 individuals described as "violent rioters" were arrested and that an investigation is underway into a potential explosive device found near the site. The protests are related to "Operation Midway Blitz," a large-scale immigration enforcement action in Illinois. The confrontations have involved federal agents using crowd-control measures like pepper balls and tear gas.</p>

          <p>At the Labour party conference, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has called for an open debate on the party's direction and strategy to effectively challenge the rising Reform UK party. Burnham warned against underestimating the "peril" Labour faces in upcoming elections, where polls show them trailing Reform. He criticized what he described as a "climate of fear" within the party that stifles necessary discussion. His comments continue his public critique of Sir Keir Starmer's leadership, despite some backlash from fellow party members.</p>

          <p>Merseyside Police arrested several individuals at a protest in Liverpool supporting Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed as a terrorist organization by the UK government. The demonstration took place outside the Labour party conference, with participants holding signs stating "I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action." The arrests were made on suspicion of supporting a proscribed organization, which is a criminal offense under the Terrorism Act. Organizers stated the protest was an act of disobedience against an unjust ban and aimed to pressure Labour to reverse the proscription.</p>

          <p>Rural families in states like Ohio are worried about the future of the federally funded Head Start program, which provides essential free childcare, education, and family support services. For many low-income parents in these communities, the program is the only available option that allows them to maintain employment. Despite bipartisan support, the program has faced funding freezes and staffing cuts under the Trump administration, creating instability for local centers. The potential loss of Head Start would not only affect families but also local economies that rely on the program for jobs and business.</p>

          <p>In a public referendum, residents of Zurich, Switzerland, have voted to severely restrict the use of leaf blowers and vacuums to combat noise and air pollution. The measure, supported by over 61% of voters, will completely ban gas-powered devices within the city. The use of electric models will be permitted only from October to December, with special permission required at other times of the year. Supporters argued the devices are disruptive and harmful to microorganisms, while opponents criticized the move as an example of an overly restrictive "culture of prohibition."</p>

          <h2>EU Steel Industry Concerned Over Expanding US Tariffs on 'Derivative' Goods</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European steel producers are concerned that the United States may continue to expand its list of "derivative" products subject to steep import tariffs. The U.S. recently added hundreds of product categories, from furniture to bulldozers, that contain steel, and has opened a new consultation that industry leaders fear will further broaden the scope. This ad-hoc expansion creates significant uncertainty and adds costs for European manufacturers already impacted by the 50% tariffs. Business leaders argue this unpredictable approach undermines the stability of the transatlantic trade relationship and harms industries beyond just steel production.</p>

The crowd surged suddenly while Vijay was speaking, causing people to faint and be trampled. Authorities have filed a case against senior members of Vijay's TVK party for negligent conduct, and an inquiry is underway.</p>

          <p>The stock market is bracing for a pivotal week, with investors closely watching for a potential government shutdown and the release of key employment data.

A looming government shutdown, with funding set to expire on Tuesday, adds another layer of uncertainty for investors. The bond market's reaction to these events will also be critical, as rising long-term Treasury yields could impact sectors sensitive to borrowing costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer has described Reform UK's proposal to scrap indefinite leave to remain for migrants as both "racist" and "immoral." The policy, announced by Reform leader Nigel Farage, would require legally resident migrants to reapply for visas under tougher rules and could lead to deportations. Starmer clarified that he does not believe Reform supporters are racist but rather frustrated with years of Conservative government failure. His comments come as Labour trails Reform in opinion polls, increasing pressure on his leadership at the party's annual conference.</p>
