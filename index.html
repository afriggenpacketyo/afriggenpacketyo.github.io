        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Supreme Court affirmed the public's right to wild camp on Dartmoor, rejecting a landowner's appeal.  The ruling centers on interpreting a Dartmoor by-law allowing "open-air recreation," which the court deemed to include camping. This decision is likely to reignite the debate surrounding public access to land in England and potentially influence similar cases elsewhere.</p>
