          <p>Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Trade Minister Piyush Goyal are conducting high-level meetings in the US to address recently strained bilateral relations. Tensions escalated after Washington imposed 50% tariffs on Indian goods, citing continued Russian oil imports, and President Trump announced a hefty $100,000 fee for new H-1B visa applications. India seeks to protect its agricultural sector in trade talks, while the new visa policy, which disproportionately affects Indian tech workers, has prompted calls for humanitarian consideration and raised concerns about skilled talent mobility.</p>

Her appointment comes amid widespread dissatisfaction over the state-owned railway's mounting reliability and infrastructural problems, which Transport Minister Patrick Schnieder described as "dramatic." Palla's selection has been welcomed by both the train drivers' union and passenger advocacy groups, who anticipate her leadership will bring much-needed improvements in punctuality, security, cleanliness, and economic productivity to Germany's public transportation system.</p>

Schools and government offices, including in the capital Manila, are closed.

          <p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has expressed strong support for initiating efforts towards a two-state solution in the Middle East, emphasizing the necessity of an immediate ceasefire, increased humanitarian aid for Gaza, and the unconditional release of hostages. France's President Emmanuel Macron is co-hosting a UN summit with Saudi Arabia to promote this solution, aiming to isolate Hamas and foster lasting peace. This diplomatic push gains momentum as the UK, Canada, and Australia recently recognized Palestinian statehood, despite opposition from the United States and Israel, which views such moves as destabilizing the region.</p>

          <p>Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has officially approved a £2.2 billion privately-financed plan for a second runway at London Gatwick Airport, aiming to unlock significant economic growth opportunities. The project involves relocating the existing Northern Runway by 12 meters for regular use and expanding terminals, projected to increase annual flights to approximately 389,000 and passenger numbers to 80 million by the late 2030s. Despite strong opposition from climate campaigners, the approval includes stipulations for stricter noise controls and a target for 54% public transport usage by air passengers, alongside compensation for affected residents.</p>

          <p>Outdoor clothing brand Arc'teryx has issued an apology and is under investigation by Chinese officials following a widely criticized fireworks display in Tibet's Himalayan region. The "Rising Dragon" spectacle, designed by artist Cai Guo-Qiang, drew significant online backlash for potentially contradicting the brand's conservation-focused image and disrupting the fragile ecosystem and local wildlife. Arc'teryx stated that biodegradable materials were used and the event aimed to raise awareness of mountain culture, pledging to collaborate with an external agency to assess the project's environmental impact. This incident highlights the tension between artistic expression and ecological responsibility in sensitive environments.</p>

          <p>A new "Production Gap Report" reveals a stark contradiction: the world's leading polluting countries, including China, the US, and India, plan to produce more than double the amount of fossil fuels by 2030 than is compatible with limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius. This indicates a significant failure to align national energy plans with climate pledges made under the Paris Agreement. China's slower reduction in coal production is a major contributor to this increasing gap, underscoring the urgent need for countries to fulfill their commitments to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition away from fossil fuels.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly gaining a dominant position in the global race for critical minerals, essential for green technologies, through its deployment of advanced electromagnetic antennas and geophysical exploration techniques. A study by the China Geological Survey, published in a peer-reviewed journal, highlights the nation's world-leading arsenal for detecting deeply buried ore and energy resources. This technological superiority provides China with a significant advantage in securing vital resources such as lithium, cobalt, and rare earths, positioning it as a key player in future global supply chains and potentially influencing geopolitical dynamics related to resource access.</p>

The World Bank has subsequently revised down Vietnam's growth forecasts, though the long-term economic impact may be mitigated by Vietnam's efforts to diversify its trade partners and boost domestic spending.
