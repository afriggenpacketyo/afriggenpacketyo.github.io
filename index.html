        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A gunman who killed four people in a Midtown Manhattan office building before dying by suicide appeared to be targeting the NFL headquarters. Police sources revealed the shooter, who drove from Las Vegas, left a note mentioning chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and blaming football for his condition. The attack occurred at 345 Park Avenue, where the gunman took the wrong elevator and opened fire in the offices of Rudin Management, killing three people there and a security guard in the lobby. An NFL employee was also critically wounded during the rampage.</p>

          <p>Three private seat holders at London's Royal Albert Hall have lost a High Court bid for a £500,000 interim damages payment. They accused the venue's operator of unlawfully restricting their access to their seats for more performances than the rules permit. The judge dismissed the request for a ruling without a trial, stating that the complex history of the dispute requires the thoroughness that only a full trial can provide. The case highlights the unique, centuries-old system where private individuals own a portion of the venue's seats.</p>

          <p>Panama's attorney general has announced that over 160 actions have been taken in a high-profile investigation into Panama Ports Company, a unit of Hong Kong's CK Hutchison. The probe, handled by an anti-corruption unit, was initiated after an audit of the company, which operates two key ports at the Panama Canal. This investigation unfolds against a backdrop of increasing geopolitical competition between the United States and China for influence over the critical waterway. Officials are currently determining which findings from the audit may constitute criminal conduct.</p>

          <p>A United Nations war crimes court has denied a request from former Bosnian Serb general Ratko Mladic for an urgent release to Serbia on health grounds. Mladic is currently serving a life sentence for genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes committed during the 1992-95 Bosnian war. The court acknowledged that the 83-year-old's health is precarious but ruled that his condition is stable and well-managed at the UN detention center, and he does not have an acute terminal illness that would justify his release.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has announced its decision to revoke the 2009 'endangerment finding,' a key scientific determination that greenhouse gases threaten public health and must be regulated under the Clean Air Act. This finding has served as the legal foundation for major climate regulations on vehicles, power plants, and other pollution sources for over 15 years. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the move 'the largest deregulatory action in the history of America,' while critics have condemned it as illegal and a dangerous abandonment of the agency's mission.</p>

          <p>A CBS News analysis of polling data indicates a steep decline in President Donald Trump's job approval rating among Americans aged 18-29, falling from a post-inauguration high of 55% to 28%. The drop is most significant among independents and those who did not vote in 2024, suggesting a fading honeymoon period. Growing dissatisfaction with the economy and a perception that the administration is not focused on key campaign promises appear to be driving the negative trend in this key demographic.</p>

While the expansion provides a significant boost, the industry still faces major headwinds from high interest rates, rising construction costs, and local opposition to new developments, known as NIMBYism.

The article emphasizes that children, pregnant people, and the elderly are most vulnerable, and that while the process is devastating, it is treatable with the reintroduction of food and water.</p>
