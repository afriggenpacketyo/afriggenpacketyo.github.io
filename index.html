          <h2>Foreign Office Staff Told to Consider Resigning Over Gaza Policy Disagreements</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-10 00:02:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More than 300 Foreign Office staff who raised concerns about the UK's potential "complicity" in Israel's conduct in Gaza were told they could consider resigning if they profoundly disagreed with government policy. The staff questioned the UK's continued arms sales and what they called a "stark… disregard for international law" by Israel. Senior civil servants responded that while the department wanted to see "healthy challenge," resignation was an "ultimate recourse" for those with profound disagreements. This response has been met with frustration and disappointment, with some officials feeling the space for challenge is being further shut down, reflecting broader concerns about the UK's approach to the conflict.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) reveals a significant global decline in fertility rates, with many individuals unable to have their desired number of children due to financial constraints and lack of suitable partners. The UNFPA surveyed 14,000 people across 14 countries, finding that one in five respondents have not had or do not expect to have their desired number of children. Financial limitations were cited by 39% of respondents as a barrier to parenthood, with the highest response in Korea (58%) and the lowest in Sweden (19%). The agency is shifting focus to address low fertility issues, recognizing the real crisis is people being unable to create the families they want.</p>

          <p>The UK government has pledged £14.2 billion towards the construction of the Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk, aiming to boost economic growth and transition to clean energy. The project is expected to create 10,000 direct jobs and power six million homes, aligning with the government's goal to eliminate fossil fuels from the energy grid by 2030. However, critics like Alison Downes of Stop Sizewell C, condemn the investment, arguing it's a costly mistake that will burden consumers and divert funds from other priorities. The investment decision is the latest in a series of announcements ahead of the government's Spending Review.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is experiencing widespread protests following immigration raids conducted by ICE, leading to numerous arrests and the deployment of the National Guard. Protests began after ICE officers carried out raids in areas with large Latino populations, sparking outrage and demonstrations that have turned violent, including setting vehicles on fire and reports of looting. President Trump has deployed thousands of National Guard troops and Marines to the city, leading to clashes with protesters and condemnation from local politicians who believe local police could handle the situation. The unrest has prompted legal challenges and raised concerns about federal overreach.</p>

The case highlights the strict abortion laws in Texas, which ban all abortions except in dire medical circumstances, leading to civil and criminal penalties for those who perform them.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) will deploy school police to create safe zones around campuses and school events, including graduations, to protect students and families from federal immigration agents. Superintendent Alberto Carvalho announced the decision in response to widespread immigration raids in Los Angeles, emphasizing every student's right to a free public education without threat. The district will train all staff on how to interact with immigration agents to limit their access to campuses and children.

Newsom accuses Trump of exploiting the situation for political gain, while Trump defends his actions as necessary to stop the city from "burning down."
