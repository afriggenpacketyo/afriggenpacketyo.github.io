        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The predictable four-year price cycle of Bitcoin, traditionally centered around the "halving" event, is showing signs of breaking down. This shift is attributed to new market dynamics, including the introduction of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, which attracted significant institutional investment and caused a pre-halving price surge. Factors like a more supportive regulatory environment and increased accumulation by public companies are also contributing to this change, potentially ending the era of 70-80% price crashes that previously defined crypto winters.

          <p>A 15-year-old boy has been found guilty of murdering his classmate, Harvey Willgoose, also 15, by stabbing him in the heart during a lunch break at All Saints Catholic High School in Sheffield. The attack followed a social media quarrel between the two teenagers. The defendant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, admitted to manslaughter but denied murder, claiming he "snapped." However, prosecutors argued the act was deliberate, citing his unhealthy interest in weapons and online searches for knives.</p>

          <p>The Israeli security cabinet has approved a military plan to assume control of Gaza City, the most populous city in the enclave before the war. The plan outlines five principles for ending the conflict, including the disarmament of Hamas and the return of all hostages. This decision has drawn widespread international condemnation and faces strong opposition within Israel, including from military officials and hostages' families, who fear it will lead to more bloodshed and endanger captives. The timeline for the operation remains unclear, but it is seen as a major escalation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite recent weak jobs data, slowing GDP growth, and widespread tariffs, the U.S. stock market has remained surprisingly stable, avoiding a significant downturn. Analysts attribute this resilience to strong corporate earnings, particularly from tech giants, and investor expectation of potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. While this optimism has propelled market momentum, some experts caution about the risk of "stagflation"—a scenario of slow economic growth combined with rising inflation—which could pose significant challenges for future monetary policy.

While the plan expands partnerships with U.S. component makers like Corning and Texas Instruments, it stops short of moving final iPhone assembly to the U.S. The announcement successfully secured an exemption for Apple from new tariffs on chips, demonstrating a savvy political navigation that boosted the company's stock value.</p>

          <p>New research highlights a significant environmental paradox in China: while many cities are experiencing more extreme rainfall, the volume of water in the nation's rivers has decreased over the past 60 years. A study from the Chinese Academy of Sciences found that over 72% of hydrological stations across China reported a decline in river run-off between 1956 and 2016. This trend, particularly pronounced in the north, poses a serious threat to the country's water security, which supports 1.4 billion people and vast agricultural and industrial sectors.</p>

This collapse reflects broader industry struggles, as companies that rapidly acquired online sellers during the pandemic now face challenges with profitability, leading to layoffs, bankruptcies, and consolidations.

          <h2>China's Steel Industry Seeks to End Self-Destructive Price War Eroding Profits</h2>

          <p>Facing dwindling profit margins, China's steel manufacturers are calling for an end to the fierce price war that has plagued the sector. Companies have been selling products below cost simply to maintain cash flow and clear massive oversupply, a practice one owner called "drinking poison to quench thirst." While this move aligns with Beijing's directives to curb such "involuntary competition" across various industries, insiders remain skeptical about how effective state-led campaigns can be without addressing the core issues of chronic overcapacity and shrinking demand.</p>

          <p>China's top chip manufacturer, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC), is downplaying the potential effects of a proposed 100% U.S. tariff on chip imports. A company co-CEO stated that SMIC's factories are running at full capacity with demand exceeding supply, and that its exposure to the U.S. market is limited. This confident outlook was presented after the company reported its second-quarter financial results, which showed a year-over-year revenue increase but a quarterly and yearly decline in net profit.

          <p>The article profiles Mostafa Tajzadeh, a former Iranian deputy interior minister and prominent political prisoner, as a unique figure capable of bridging the divide within Iran's opposition. Despite being imprisoned, Tajzadeh has gained broad respect by supporting street protests and calling for an end to the supreme leader's rule, while still advocating for non-violent, systemic reform. His willingness to engage in dialogue with all political factions has positioned him as a potential unifying force for a democratic transition in a country with a deeply fractured political landscape.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Trump's Recent Trade Deals with Europe and Asia Lack Substantive Concessions</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis argues that President Trump's recently announced trade deals with the European Union, Japan, and South Korea are less significant than portrayed. While the deals avert retaliatory tariffs, they contain few meaningful concessions from trading partners on long-standing barriers, especially for U.S. agricultural products. Furthermore, the massive investment pledges touted by the White House are described as largely based on pre-existing plans or loans, not new commitments, suggesting the main outcome of the tariff strategy has simply been the right to impose tariffs.

          <p>PragerU, a nonprofit known for creating right-leaning educational videos, is increasingly partnering with state governments to make its content available in public schools. This development comes as federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports PBS and NPR, has been cut. PragerU's materials, which have been criticized as misleading on topics like slavery and climate change, are being promoted by conservative state education leaders as an alternative to what they view as liberal-dominated educational systems, raising concerns about ideological influence in classrooms.</p>

          <p>The Caribbean Women's Health Association (CWHA) in Brooklyn is tackling the Black maternal mortality crisis by providing free, community-based doula services. Black women in the U.S. are significantly more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications, and the program aims to change this by offering specialized support, advocacy, and comfort measures during pregnancy, birth, and postpartum. By empowering new mothers and acting as a liaison with medical staff, the doulas are working to ensure that Black women feel heard and supported throughout their journey to parenthood.</p>
