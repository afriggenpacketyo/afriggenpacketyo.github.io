          <p>The Trump administration has announced plans to impose new tariffs on more than a dozen countries, escalating global trade tensions. In letters posted to social media, President Trump detailed varying tariff rates, including 25% on goods from Japan and South Korea, and rates as high as 40% for Myanmar and Laos, all set to take effect August 1. The move comes as a 90-day freeze on previously announced tariffs was set to expire. The White House indicated the new levies are part of a strategy to create reciprocal trade relationships, but economists warn they could fuel inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A report from the chief inspector of prisons has warned that a massive influx of smuggled drugs is destabilizing prisons across England and Wales and undermining rehabilitation efforts. Criminal gangs are reportedly using drones to deliver contraband to inmates who are bored and living in overcrowded conditions. The report found that 39% of prisoners said it was easy to get drugs, and the problem is fueling "uncontrolled levels of criminality" that inexperienced staff cannot contain. The watchdog called the failure to address the issue a threat that needs to be taken seriously at the highest levels of government.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from cutting off Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood. The ruling freezes a key provision of the recently signed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" that targeted organizations providing abortion services. Planned Parenthood argued in its lawsuit that the provision was an unconstitutional attempt to penalize the group and would severely impact patients' access to non-abortion healthcare like cancer screenings. The 14-day order ensures federal funding continues while the legal challenge proceeds, representing a significant, albeit temporary, victory for the organization.</p>

          <p>The European Union is bracing for potentially punishing new tariffs from the United States, a move that could significantly impact consumers and companies on both sides of the Atlantic. President Trump has threatened to increase the tariff rate on European exports to as high as 50%, which would make a wide range of products more expensive for American buyers. The EU has stated it is prepared to retaliate with its own tariffs on American goods if a deal cannot be reached. This escalation in trade disputes with a major ally threatens to disrupt a commercial relationship valued at over $2 trillion annually. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Navy's aircraft carrier fleet will be temporarily reduced from eleven to ten ships following the decommissioning of the USS Nimitz next year. This reduction is due to significant developmental delays with the new Ford-class carriers. The delivery of the USS John F. Kennedy has been pushed back from 2025 to March 2027 to address issues with its advanced arresting gear and weapons elevators. Additionally, the USS Enterprise's delivery has been delayed to July 2030 because of material and supply chain problems, creating a temporary gap in the nation's naval force projection capabilities.</p>

          <p>Six months after devastating wildfires, California Governor Gavin Newsom is calling for $40 billion in federal recovery aid while simultaneously condemning the Trump administration's recent immigration raids in Los Angeles. Newsom described the raids in MacArthur Park as a "disgrace" and proof of President Trump's "polluted heart," a sharp shift from a previously more conciliatory tone. The governor is in the conflicting position of needing support from a Republican-led Congress for disaster funding while criticizing the administration's policies, which he says could disrupt the state's recovery by shaking the immigrant construction workforce.</p>

          <p>British Members of Parliament may soon vote on a proposal to make at least 10 Premier League soccer games available on free-to-air television each season. The Liberal Democrats have tabled an amendment to the new Football Governance Bill that would require the sport's independent regulator to ensure greater public access. The party argues that the "jewel in the crown of British football" has been locked behind expensive paywalls for too long. The move aims to follow a model similar to Spain, where one La Liga match must be offered for free each week.</p>

          <p>As part of its new five-year development plan, China is strategically focusing on developing its interior provinces, such as the historically poor Guizhou, to serve as a "strategic hinterland." This initiative is designed to bolster the nation's resilience amid ongoing trade tensions and reshape its economic landscape. Provincial leaders are aligning with this national strategy to leverage their comparative advantages. The plan aims to build up industrial capacity and economic strength away from the more vulnerable coastal regions, representing a significant shift in China's long-term economic and industrial policy.

          <p>The UK government has announced it will ban the use of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) to silence victims of workplace sexual misconduct, harassment, or discrimination. An amendment to the Employment Rights Bill will render any such confidentiality clauses void, a move Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said will "stamp this practice out." The reform follows years of campaigning by activists like Zelda Perkins, who broke her NDA to speak out against Harvey Weinstein. The change aims to end the misuse of NDAs to cover up inappropriate or criminal behavior in the workplace.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protestors marched in Mexico City to voice their anger over rising rents and gentrification, which many blame on an influx of American and other foreign remote workers. The demonstration, held on U.S. Independence Day, included signs like "gringo go home" and turned to vandalism in some areas, targeting businesses perceived as catering to foreigners. The protests highlight growing tensions over the transformation of historic neighborhoods, where local shops are being replaced by upscale cafes and studios. The city's leaders condemned the xenophobic tone but acknowledged that gentrification is a serious issue that must be addressed.</p>

A previous test in 2023 revealed technical issues, with some users not receiving the alert. This new test aims to ensure the system's reliability and familiarize the public with its function.</p>
