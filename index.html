          <p>Immigrant workers at an Amazon warehouse in Indianapolis are losing their jobs after the Trump administration terminated a humanitarian parole program. This policy, created under the Biden administration, had provided legal work status to individuals from Haiti, Cuba, and other nations. Now, workers like Daphnee Poteau, who came to the U.S. legally, are facing unemployment and an uncertain future as they navigate the complex immigration system. Amazon has stated it is complying with the law while offering resources to affected employees.</p>

          <p>Sweden's Migration Minister, Johan Forssell, has confirmed that his 16-year-old son was active in far-right extremist circles online, a fact brought to his attention by the country's security service. Forssell stated he will not resign, explaining that his son is remorseful and has cut ties with the groups. The revelation has prompted accusations of double standards against the center-right government, which collaborates with a radical anti-immigration party, and has led to calls for a parliamentary committee hearing.</p>

          <p>The original Hermès Birkin bag, once owned by the late Jane Birkin, has set a new record as the most valuable handbag ever sold at auction, fetching over $10.1 million at Sotheby's in Paris. The iconic accessory was famously conceived in 1984 after Birkin had a chance encounter with the head of Hermès on a flight and complained about needing a more practical bag. This sale underscores the Birkin bag's enduring status as a symbol of ultimate luxury and a highly sought-after collector's item.</p>

Cramer expressed confidence in the warehouse retailer's business model, which prioritizes value for its members, making it a resilient choice in a challenging retail environment.

The event, which commemorates the 1690 Battle of the Boyne, is a significant part of unionist culture but often creates political and community tensions.</p>

          <p>A federal tax credit offering up to $7,500 for new electric vehicle purchases is set to expire on September 30, a change enacted by President Trump's recent major spending bill. Analysts anticipate this deadline will create a summer rush, as consumers look to capitalize on the savings before they disappear. Automakers like Tesla are already urging customers to act quickly, and experts suggest that additional manufacturer incentives may become available to further encourage sales before the federal subsidy ends.</p>

          <p>Text messages shared by a whistleblower allege that Emil Bove, a Trump nominee for a federal judgeship, urged Justice Department officials to defy a court order. The messages, released by Senate Democrats, concern the mistaken deportation of an individual and suggest Bove instructed colleagues to communicate a profane refusal to comply with the court's mandate for the person's return. This raises serious ethical questions about the nominee's conduct and fitness for the judiciary ahead of his confirmation vote.</p>

Liberia was founded in 1822 by freed African-American slaves, and its capital, Monrovia, is named after U.S. President James Monroe. Due to these deep roots, English is the country's official language, its flag resembles the American flag, and its culture retains a strong U.S. influence, explaining the shared linguistic traits.</p>
