          <p>Japan and the United States are planning a summit between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the G7 meeting in Canada, aiming to address ongoing tariff disputes. Prior to the summit, Japan's tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, will visit Washington for further negotiations to bridge the gap over Trump's tariff policy, as previous rounds have failed to resolve the differences. Japan seeks the removal of tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum, including a 10 percent baseline levy and a 14 percent country-specific portion. Tokyo is considering accepting reduced tariff rates as the U.S. has consistently refused to eliminate the duties, with both countries aiming to reach a deal promptly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A voluntary recall on Dr Pepper Zero Sugar has been upgraded by the FDA to Class II due to a serious health risk. The recalled cans, produced by Pepsi Beverages Company in Jacksonville, Florida, were mislabeled as "zero sugar" but contained the full sugar amount found in regular Dr Pepper, around 39 grams. This poses a risk to individuals who need to avoid sugar, especially those with diabetes, as consuming too much sugar can lead to hyperglycemia and potentially fatal ketoacidosis. The affected cans have the product code XXXXRS05165 and a "best by" date of February 16, 2026, and were distributed to retailers in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>

          <p>Criminal gangs are exploiting loopholes in Europe to smuggle ketamine, swapping it for salt during transit and selling it illegally. The drug, classified as a legal medicine in some countries, is transported across multiple borders, making it difficult to track and investigate. Belgian investigators have uncovered at least 28 similar consignment switches involving an estimated 28 tonnes of ketamine since 2023. The rise in ketamine consumption has led to increased deaths and health issues, with organized crime groups profiting more from ketamine than other illegal drugs, prompting European police forces to liaise with Indian authorities to address the problem.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release another 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers to address the elevated prices of the staple food. The released rice will consist of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, with the 2020 rice expected to be sold at 1,700 yen ($12) per 5 kilograms. This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, following previous releases through auctions. The government aims to deliver the stockpiled rice quickly to smaller supermarket operators and specialty shops to lower prices for consumers, as rice has been in short supply and prices have doubled compared to the previous year.</p>

The exercise involves discussing the feasibility of Taiwan's military strategy in response to a hypothetical use of force by Beijing by 2030.

Israel dismissed the vessel as a "selfie yacht" and stated the activists would be returned to their home countries. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition said the Madleen was carrying a symbolic amount of aid to Gaza, defying an Israeli naval blockade, and was intercepted in international waters.</p>

          <h2>UN Report Highlights 'Unprecedented Decline' in World Fertility Rates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-10 00:02:41 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) warns of an "unprecedented decline" in world fertility rates, citing the prohibitive cost of parenthood and lack of suitable partners. The UNFPA surveyed 14,000 people across 14 countries, finding that one in five have not had or do not expect to have their desired number of children. Financial limitations were cited by 39% of respondents as a barrier to having children, with infertility being a less common reason. The report marks a shift in the UN's focus towards low fertility issues, as the agency previously focused on women having more children than desired.</p>

          <p>The government has committed Â£14.2 billion to build the Sizewell C nuclear plant on the Suffolk coastline, creating 10,000 direct jobs and powering six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed the decision as a "landmark" that will "kickstart" economic growth, while Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said it was essential for a "golden age of clean energy". The government emphasizes that nuclear power provides low-carbon energy and is crucial to eliminating fossil fuels from the UK's energy grid by 2030. The project faces opposition from groups concerned about its cost and environmental impact.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have significantly decreased, with a 47% reduction in fatal overdose risk among those aged 20 to 29. Data from the CDC indicates that fentanyl and other drugs killed approximately 16,690 people under 35 in 2024, a sharp decline from 31,000 in 2021. Experts attribute this trend to factors like wider distribution of Narcan, weaker fentanyl potency, increased addiction healthcare access, and safer drug choices among teens. While the improvement is dramatic, some clusters of young people still experience an uptick in deaths, underscoring the need for continued vigilance and support for addiction services.</p>

          <p>Violent protests have erupted in Los Angeles following immigration raids, leading to numerous arrests and the deployment of National Guard troops by President Donald Trump. The protests began after ICE officers conducted raids in Latino areas, resulting in looting, vehicle fires, and clashes with police. Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard has sparked outrage from Democrats, with California Governor Gavin Newsom suing the administration. The National Guard's role is to protect federal agents and property, with life continuing as normal in other parts of the city.</p>
