          <h2>Former President Biden Diagnosed with Aggressive Prostate Cancer</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-18 18:56:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr., 82, has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to the bone. The diagnosis came after he reported urinary symptoms, leading to the discovery of a "small nodule" on his prostate. While the cancer is Stage 4 and cannot be cured, experts say that it is hormone-sensitive and can be effectively managed, allowing patients to live for many years. Mr. Biden and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians, and supportive statements have been issued by both President Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler secured his first US PGA Championship title by holding off Jon Rahm, ultimately winning by six strokes at Quail Hollow. Despite a shaky start, Scheffler maintained his lead, while Rahm faltered in the final three holes. This victory marks Scheffler's third major win, adding to his Masters victories in 2022 and 2024. The emotional win came after a challenging front nine, where Scheffler's patchy play allowed Rahm to briefly share the lead before Rahm's collapse.</p>

          <p>Senator Chris Murphy criticized President Trump's acceptance of a $400m Boeing jet from Qatar as the "definition of corruption." Murphy argued that Trump's trip to Gulf states was motivated by financial gain. Rand Paul, a Republican senator, expressed concern about the appearance of a conflict of interest. Mike Pence, Trump's former vice-president, deemed the gift "inconsistent with our security" due to Qatar's history of supporting terrorism.</p>
