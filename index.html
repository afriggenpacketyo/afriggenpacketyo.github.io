          <p>The European Union is launching a major initiative to build AI "gigafactories" to bolster its technological sovereignty and catch up with the U.S. and China in the artificial intelligence race. The bloc has committed an initial €20 billion to fund these facilities, which are designed to be one-stop shops that combine computing power, data, and talent to develop advanced AI models. Despite having a large pool of AI researchers, Europe has lagged due to limited computing capacity, a challenge these new, powerful data centers aim to solve. However, concerns remain about the need for significant private investment and the immense power grid requirements for these facilities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Volunteer crew members for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) are defending their actions in rescuing migrants from small boats in the English Channel. Facing accusations of operating a "taxi service," the crew emphasizes their mission is purely humanitarian, driven by compassion to save anyone in distress at sea, regardless of politics. The charity released harrowing footage of a recent rescue to highlight the dangerous reality of their work, where they saved 19 people from a capsized dinghy. Last year, such call-outs represented just over 1% of their total missions, but resulted in saving 58 migrant lives.</p>

          <p>A gunman killed four people, including an off-duty NYPD officer working as a security guard, during a shooting at a Park Avenue skyscraper in Manhattan before taking his own life. The suspect, identified as a 27-year-old with a history of mental illness, traveled cross-country before the attack, opening fire in the building's lobby and on an upper floor. Another person was critically injured in the rampage, which occurred during the evening rush hour. Authorities believe it was an isolated incident and are investigating the motive behind the attack, which marks the 254th mass shooting in the U.S. this year.</p>

          <p>India has overtaken China as the leading exporter of smartphones to the U.S. for the first time, according to new market research. In the second quarter, Indian-assembled smartphones accounted for 44% of U.S. imports, a dramatic increase from 13% the previous year, while China's share fell from 61% to 25%. This significant shift is largely driven by Apple's strategy to diversify its manufacturing supply chain away from China amid ongoing trade uncertainties. The move reflects a broader trend of global manufacturers shifting final assembly operations to India to serve the American market. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore Airlines (SIA) experienced a significant 59% drop in first-quarter net profit, causing its stock to fall by over 8%. The airline attributed the decline to lower interest income and, notably, losses from its 25.1% stake in Air India, which it began accounting for this fiscal year. Analysts note that Air India's losses were deeper than expected and are likely to be a near-term drag on SIA's finances, especially following reputational damage from a recent incident. While the airline reports that overall demand for air travel remains strong, increased competition and weaker cargo revenue are creating challenges for its operating margins.

The verdict has polarized the nation, with supporters viewing him as a hero who fought leftist rebels, while critics link him to human rights abuses. Uribe, who faces up to 12 years in prison, is expected to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>In an effort to combat its looming demographic crisis, the Chinese government has introduced its first nationwide subsidy to encourage more births. The policy will offer parents 3,600 yuan (about $500) annually for each child under the age of three, a move expected to assist around 20 million families. This national initiative follows various local government pilot programs aimed at reversing the country's declining birth rate, which has persisted despite the abolition of the one-child policy. China's population fell for a third consecutive year in 2024, and the nation faces the challenge of being one of the world's most expensive places to raise children.</p>

This policy reverses the long-standing practice of allowing individuals not considered a flight or safety risk to be released on bond. Advocates argue the change is a misinterpretation of the law and violates due process rights, causing catastrophic harm to families by detaining individuals with deep community ties for months or years. The lawsuit seeks to block the policy, which ICE claims is necessary to close security "loopholes."</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a formal misconduct complaint against U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg, escalating a conflict over the administration's deportation policies. The complaint alleges the judge made improper public comments suggesting the Trump administration would trigger a constitutional crisis by ignoring court orders. This action follows Judge Boasberg's ruling to block deportation flights to a controversial prison in El Salvador, an order the administration allegedly ignored. The DOJ's complaint calls for an investigation and the reassignment of the case, a move that deepens the clash between the executive and judicial branches.</p>

          <p>School districts nationwide are facing a potential crisis in student mental health services due to the Trump administration's abrupt discontinuation of millions of dollars in federal grants. The Department of Education cited concerns that grant recipients were using funds for race-based initiatives, a claim disputed by service providers who now face laying off crucial staff like counselors and social workers. With 47 states already falling short of recommended counselor-to-student ratios, the cuts are expected to hit rural and underserved areas hardest. Sixteen states are now suing the administration over the funding suspension, which threatens essential support for students.</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old U.S. citizen has spoken out after video of his violent arrest by immigration agents in Florida drew national scrutiny. The footage shows Kenny Laynez, a high school senior, being told "You got no rights here" by an officer during the traffic stop. The incident, in which officers also used a Taser on his undocumented co-workers, highlights concerns over the expansion of state and local law enforcement's role in immigration crackdowns. U.S. Customs and Border Protection stated the individuals resisted arrest, but the video has intensified criticism of aggressive enforcement tactics under a new Florida law.</p>

          <p>The new trade deal between the U.S. and the European Union is drawing mixed reactions, with some economists arguing it is an "asymmetric and unbalanced" pact that will harm the EU's economy. The agreement imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, a sharp increase that could reduce the bloc's GDP, while U.S. goods will face no tariffs. In exchange, the EU pledged to purchase large amounts of U.S. energy and make significant investments. While the Trump administration touts the deal as a win for American manufacturing, some experts believe the EU accepted unfavorable terms to avoid a worse trade war. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's recent visit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland, though unconventional, provided invaluable face time and strengthened a key diplomatic relationship. The meeting, which included a helicopter tour of Trump's golf course and a lengthy, free-wheeling press Q&A, allowed Starmer to directly engage the president on critical issues like the Gaza crisis. Downing Street sees these interactions as crucial for aligning views, particularly hoping Trump's recent comments on Gaza signal a toughening stance that aligns with a new UK-France-Germany initiative. The visit underscores the unique, personality-driven nature of diplomacy with the current U.S. administration.</p>

After transferring to USC for his final season with the promise of significant playing time and a substantial NIL deal, the denial threatens both his career prospects and the Trojans' already thin offensive line depth.

The hearing follows a lower court's injunction that blocked agents from using criteria like race, language, or location as the sole basis for stopping individuals, finding the practice unconstitutional. The Justice Department argues the injunction is a "wholesale judicial usurpation" of federal authority, while civil rights groups contend the sweeps are indiscriminate and violate the 4th Amendment.
