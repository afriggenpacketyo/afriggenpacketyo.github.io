          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged Vance Luther Boelter with multiple federal counts, including murder, stalking, and firearms offenses, in connection with the shootings of two Minnesota state lawmakers and their spouses. Boelter allegedly went to the homes of four Minnesota state lawmakers with the intent to kill them, according to Acting U.S. Attorney Joseph Thompson. One lawmaker was not home, while another, State Senator Ann Rest, was alerted by authorities that Boelter had been parked near her house. Boelter is accused of carefully planning his attacks, researching his victims, and conducting surveillance on their homes, leading authorities to describe the crime as "the stuff of nightmares." The Justice Department is considering seeking the death penalty in Boelter's case.</p>

          <p>Following the tragic shootings of a Minnesota lawmaker and her husband, and the wounding of another lawmaker and his wife, House Republicans held a "tense" conference call to discuss security concerns. Members expressed feeling unsafe in their home districts and requested increased protection, specifically police presence outside their homes at all times. Law enforcement officials responded that fulfilling this request would require additional funding from Congress. The shootings have heightened concerns about political violence, with several members of Congress reporting threats and being named on a suspect's list. The number of threats against members of Congress has risen in the past two years, particularly during election years, prompting increased security measures. Optimism is tempered by the gravity of the events and the ongoing need for vigilance.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has extended a temporary restraining order on President Donald Trump's proclamation barring foreign Harvard University students from entering the U.S. The judge, Allison Burroughs, is considering arguments for a preliminary injunction after Harvard's lawyers argued that Trump's proclamation violates its First Amendment rights and is outside the authority of the executive branch, characterizing the move as retaliation and viewpoint discrimination. The government argued that it does not "trust" Harvard to monitor foreign students, raising concerns about the university's "foreign entanglements" with the Chinese government. Harvard has alleged that the administration is engaged in an "escalating campaign of retaliation" against the school, citing frozen grants and contracts.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has reiterated his intention to conduct mass deportations in major U.S. cities, particularly those run by Democrats. Speaking at the G7 summit, Trump stated that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) should focus on New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles, accusing these cities of being "sanctuary cities." Trump claimed that Democrats are using illegal immigration to influence elections and expand the welfare state, despite noncitizens being ineligible to vote in federal or state elections. These comments follow protests against the administration's immigration crackdown, though Trump has recently shifted his stance on undocumented immigrants working in the farming and hospitality industries, acknowledging their value and pausing raids on those sectors.</p>

          <p>U.S. Steel shares experienced a surge after President Donald Trump approved its merger with Japan's Nippon Steel, contingent upon signing a national security agreement with the U.S. government. The agreement includes a golden share for the U.S. government, granting the president veto power over decisions to relocate U.S. Steel's headquarters, move the company outside the U.S., rename the company, transfer production or jobs abroad, and close or idle plants prematurely. While Trump has described the deal as a "partnership," U.S. Steel will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America. All regulatory approvals have been received, and the transaction is expected to be completed promptly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that targeting Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei would end, not escalate, the conflict between Israel and Iran. When asked about reports that President Donald Trump rejected an Israeli plan to assassinate Khamenei, Netanyahu asserted that Iran has been spreading conflict for half a century and bringing the world to the brink of nuclear war. He emphasized that Israel is preventing this by standing up to the "forces of evil" and doing what it needs to do, including targeting top nuclear scientists. Netanyahu also dismissed reports that Iran is seeking to end hostilities and resume negotiations, claiming they are insincere.

Boelter then proceeded to the home of Melissa and Mark Hortman, where he allegedly shot and killed them. Federal investigators allege Boelter stalked his targets and planned his attacks carefully, researching the victims and their families.

Potential explanations include the U.S. providing aerial refueling support to Israel, joining the kinetic fight directly, preparing to counter Iran's attempt to close the Strait of Hormuz, or establishing a robust air bridge from the U.S. to the Middle East. These movements could be pre-decisional, indicating preparations for various contingencies. Other assets also appear to be moving in Iran's direction, including a U.S. carrier strike group.</p>

          <p>A new report by Baroness Louise Casey reveals that the ethnicity of individuals involved in grooming gangs has been "shied away from" by authorities. The report indicates that ethnicity data is not recorded for two-thirds of grooming gang perpetrators, hindering accurate assessment at a national level. However, local data from some police forces suggests a disproportionate number of suspects from Asian ethnic backgrounds. The report criticizes the "failure" of authorities to "understand" the nature and scale of the problem, attributing it to ignorance and fear of being seen as racist. The government has accepted all 12 of the report's recommendations, including improving data collection and launching a national inquiry.</p>

Experts recommend paying for the wedding with cash if possible, but if debt is necessary, using a credit card with a 0% introductory offer is a wise option. Personal lines of credit, often referred to as "wedding loans," can also be a good choice for those with good credit, offering lower interest rates and smaller monthly payments. Regardless of the type of debt, experts emphasize the importance of creating a repayment plan that fits within the couple's financial picture after the wedding. (not investment advice)</p>
