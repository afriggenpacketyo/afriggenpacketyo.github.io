          <p>A JetBlue flight arriving from Chicago O'Hare International Airport experienced a minor incident upon landing at Boston Logan International Airport, rolling onto a grassy area adjacent to the runway. No injuries were reported among the passengers or crew, according to the Massachusetts Port Authority. The incident prompted the temporary closure of the runway as officials assessed the aircraft and arranged for passengers to be transported to the terminal by bus.

Republicans on the committee accused the governors of prioritizing undocumented immigrants over the safety of U.S. citizens, while the governors countered that immigration is a federal responsibility.

          <p>President Trump publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling him a "numbskull" and urging him to lower interest rates. Trump claimed that a two-percentage-point rate cut would save the U.S. $600 billion per year, expressing frustration with Powell's reluctance to act. This attack follows similar comments from other administration officials, reflecting increasing pressure on the Fed to stimulate the economy. Despite Trump's remarks, markets remained largely unmoved, with traders pricing in minimal chances of a rate cut in the near term (not investment advice).</p>

The study suggests that tipping rates are influenced by how frequently people dine out in each state. Washington D.C. residents spend the most on dining out, at $10,291 per capita in 2023, while nationally, dining out accounted for 56% of Americans' food budgets. The research also touches on the federal minimum wage for tipped workers and the potential impact of the "No Tax on Tips" provision.</p>

          <p>During a House Committee on Armed Services hearing, Representative Mike Turner questioned Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth regarding contingency plans for various scenarios. The exchange was prompted by an earlier question about the possibility of taking Panama and Greenland by force. Turner sought clarification that there were no specific plans for invading or forcibly taking Greenland, to which Hegseth affirmed that the Pentagon has plans for a number of contingencies, leading to a visibly frustrated Turner seeking further clarification to ensure Hegseth was not confirming plans to invade Greenland.</p>

Kennedy praised the new members, saying this slate includes "highly credentialed scientists, leading public-health experts, and some of America's most accomplished physicians."

The sale of items like "Make America Great Again" hats potentially violates Defense Department policy prohibiting troops from expressing political opinions while in uniform. The event, organized by America 250, featured a speech by Trump repeating false election claims and criticizing political rivals, with some troops booing and cheering in response. An Army official expressed regret over the political nature of the event and the presence of the merchandise.</p>

          <p>Miriam Haley, a victim of Harvey Weinstein, discussed her decision to testify again in his New York retrial, after his previous sexual assault conviction was overturned. Despite the emotional toll, Haley felt compelled to stand up for herself and the truth after learning about a podcast series aimed at "exonerating" Weinstein. The jury found Weinstein guilty of sexually assaulting Haley, offering her hope that awareness of sexual violence is growing and the myth of the perfect victim is fading. She described the cross-examination by Weinstein's attorney as "offensive" and emphasized that the assault still happened, regardless of the verdict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite concerns, President Trump's tariffs have not yet caused inflation, with recent data showing benign consumer and producer prices. This is attributed to companies stockpiling imported goods before the tariff announcement, the time it takes for tariffs to impact the economy, and limited pricing power due to cautious consumer spending. Experts believe the impact of tariffs will likely materialize in the coming months, but so far, these factors have kept inflation in check (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>An unexpected surge in Social Security retirement claims has been observed between January and May, with claims nearly 18% higher than the same period last year. The Social Security Administration attributes this to retiring Baby Boomers, a rule change increasing benefits for some with pensions, and people refiling for higher benefits. However, anxieties about the economic future under the Trump administration also appear to be a factor, with some individuals claiming early benefits out of fear that the system may change or become less accessible. Despite assurances from the administration, these fears are driving some to claim benefits earlier than planned (not investment advice).</p>

Approximately 60% of the affected stations are located in these states, including both large and small communities. The cuts are part of a Republican plan to eliminate $9 billion in funding for programs approved before Trump's second term, with $1.1 billion specifically targeting the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS.

          <p>The presence of the Mexican flag at protests in Los Angeles has sparked debate about allegiance and identity, with some Republicans using it to fuel fears of an "invasion." The author argues that in the American context, the Mexican flag is not solely a nationalist symbol but a reminder of roots and a shared experience between Mexican Americans and Mexican immigrants. It serves as a symbol of double-consciousness and a bold articulation of solidarity, especially in the face of immigration enforcement and potential authoritarian violence. The author questions why the protesters' allegiances are held to higher standards than those of an American president.</p>
