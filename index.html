        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Senate conducted a critical procedural vote on a sprawling tax and spending bill championed by President Trump. With a narrow Republican majority, leadership scrambled to secure enough support, as several GOP senators, including Susan Collins and Josh Hawley, remained undecided or expressed concerns over provisions like Medicaid cuts. The White House applied significant pressure, stating that a failure to pass the legislation by the July 4th deadline would be an "ultimate betrayal." The bill's fate hinged on a few holdouts, with Vice President JD Vance present to cast a potential tie-breaking vote.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County supervisors are set to consider legal action against federal immigration authorities following recent violent arrests by ICE agents. Citing an incident in Valinda where a man was bloodied during his detainment, Supervisor Hilda Solis is proposing a motion to explore all legal options to protect residents' civil rights. The motion claims that aggressive enforcement tactics have created a climate of fear, negatively impacting the local economy and residents' well-being.

          <p>In the aftermath of its 12-day war with Israel, Iran's government has deepened its crackdown on its own citizens, executing several men accused of espionage and arresting hundreds. Human rights activists report that the accused were denied due process, part of what state media calls a "season of traitor-killing." The regime has also implemented new surveillance measures, creating a "systematic and rigid form of repression" that has instilled fear among Iranians. This follows a pattern of the government tightening control and punishing dissent during periods of external conflict and internal instability.</p>

          <p>A team of astronomers has discovered mysterious, ancient radio signals that traveled for 10 billion years to reach Earth from the galaxy cluster SpARCS1049. The signals originate from a "mini-halo," a vast cloud of high-energy particles and magnetic fields, which has never been observed at such a great distance before. This discovery, made using the LOFAR radio telescope, challenges previous understandings of the early universe. Scientists believe the energetic particles could have been generated by supermassive black holes or cosmic particle collisions, suggesting these processes were shaping galaxies much earlier than previously thought.</p>

          <p>Despite the Los Angeles Dodgers' 9-5 loss to the Kansas City Royals, Shohei Ohtani had his best outing on the mound since returning from Tommy John surgery. In two sharp innings, he threw the hardest pitch of his MLB career at 101.7 mph and effectively used his off-speed pitches, retiring the side in the second. Although his workload is still being carefully managed, Ohtani's performance demonstrated his dominant potential as a pitcher. The rest of the Dodgers' pitching staff struggled, and the offense was quiet until a late rally, but Ohtani's progress was the game's most significant takeaway.</p>

          <p>According to renowned computer scientist Harry Shum, China is rapidly catching up to the United States in the field of AI algorithms, even as it lags significantly in advanced chip technology. Speaking at a summit, the former head of AI at Microsoft noted that the gap in chip production is a major challenge for China. However, he highlighted the success of Chinese start-ups like DeepSeek, which have achieved competitive results with top U.S. models using far less computing power. This suggests China is making significant progress by focusing on breakthroughs in algorithm engineering.</p>

After analyzing DNA from more than 130 skeletons buried under the city's houses, researchers found that genetic connections were primarily traced through the female line. This indicates that upon marriage, men likely moved into their wives' households, and female offspring remained connected to their family homes. The findings, which also show preferential treatment for females in grave goods, challenge traditional assumptions about patrilineal structures in ancient societies.</p>

          <p>Two men involved in a human smuggling operation that resulted in the deaths of 53 migrants in a sweltering tractor-trailer in Texas have been sentenced to prison. A federal judge sentenced Felipe Orduna-Torres to life in prison and Armando Gonzales-Garcia to 83 years. The migrants, found in an abandoned truck with no water or working air conditioning in June 2022, had paid thousands to be smuggled across the border. The sentencing brings a measure of justice to one of the deadliest smuggling incidents in U.S. history, highlighting the extreme dangers migrants face.</p>
