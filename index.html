          <p>Rivian Automotive is implementing layoffs for about 4.5% of its workforce, affecting over 600 employees, in response to growing market challenges and the expiration of federal electric vehicle incentives. CEO RJ Scaringe indicated these cuts are part of a restructuring to scale go-to-market functions efficiently and build a profitable business. The company reported a $1.1 billion loss in the second quarter and lowered its 2025 delivery forecast, reflecting a slowdown in EV demand. Rivian is preparing for the launch of its new R2 models next year to revitalize growth.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Starbucks workers are preparing for a strike authorization vote next week, following stalled contract negotiations between Starbucks Workers United and the company. The union, representing 12,000 workers in 550 cafes, seeks increased hours, higher pay, and resolution of unfair labor practice charges, including alleged union busting. Starbucks maintains it has engaged in extensive negotiations but claims the union presented an incomplete contract outline. Previous national strikes have had limited impact, and the union's effectiveness is debated due to its smaller representation of the total workforce.</p>

This significant commitment will provide over a gigawatt of AI compute capacity, solidifying Anthropic's infrastructure strategy across various vendors including Google, Amazon, and Nvidia. The AI company's annual revenue run rate is nearing $7 billion, driven by explosive growth in its Claude language models and agentic coding assistant.

          <p>Ford Motor exceeded third-quarter earnings expectations but reduced its 2025 guidance, projecting a $1.5 billion to $2 billion impact from a supplier plant fire disrupting truck and SUV production. The company plans to mitigate much of this by increasing production in 2026, adding 1,000 workers to its Michigan and Kentucky plants. CEO Jim Farley stated significant progress is being made to restore supply. Despite the setback, Ford's "Pro" commercial business performed strongly, though its EV "Model e" unit widened losses.

          <p>President Trump's $300 million project to build a new, larger ballroom in the White House East Wing is drawing significant criticism, especially amidst a federal government shutdown. Critics argue the opulent renovation is inappropriate while federal workers face financial strain. Trump insists the project, designed to accommodate nearly 1,000 people for state events, is privately funded by himself and wealthy donors, including major corporations. Ethics experts warn this financing model could lead to corruption, with companies seeking favor from the administration.</p>

          <p>A 16-year-old Palestinian-American from Florida, Mohammed Ibrahim, has been held in an Israeli prison for eight months, prompting his family and advocates to appeal for his release. Mohammed was arrested in February for allegedly throwing rocks at Israeli settlers, an offense that could carry a 20-year sentence. His family reports he was assaulted and coerced into confessing by soldiers. Concerns are growing over his health and abysmal prison conditions, as advocacy groups and U.S. lawmakers urge intervention from the State Department and Ambassador to Israel.</p>

          <p>Wall Street eagerly awaits Friday's delayed September Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which is expected to show inflation rising at its fastest pace in 16 months. Economists project a 0.4% monthly increase, pushing the annual rate to 3.1%, influenced by the Trump administration's tariffs. Due to the government shutdown, this report holds heightened importance, with even slight deviations potentially causing significant market impact. The data will also inform the Federal Reserve's upcoming policy meeting, where another interest rate cut is widely anticipated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll reveals mixed opinions among California voters regarding potential 2028 presidential runs for Governor Gavin Newsom and former Vice President Kamala Harris. While a large number of California Democrats support Newsom's candidacy, overall state voters are more divided. Fewer than a third of state voters believe Harris should run, though she won her home state in 2024. The poll also indicates Californians believe the state sets a good example in technology and environment but struggles with housing, taxes, and economic policy, influencing political perceptions.</p>

          <p>Gold prices are experiencing sharp fluctuations, creating opportunities for investors to capitalize on volatility. This article outlines three strategies: trading gold mining stocks or ETFs for leveraged exposure and liquidity, using gold-backed ETFs or futures for short-term plays, and strategically buying physical gold during dips for long-term hedging. Mining stocks offer higher leverage and easier trading than physical gold. Gold ETFs provide diversified exposure, while futures offer leveraged, high-risk trading for advanced investors. For tangible assets, dollar-cost averaging physical gold during dips is recommended. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese state oil majors have suspended purchases of seaborne Russian oil following new U.S. sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil, Russia's largest oil companies. This move, driven by concerns over compliance, mirrors similar actions by Indian refiners, significantly straining Moscow's oil revenues. While independent Chinese refiners may continue some purchases, major state-owned firms like PetroChina and Sinopec are refraining from dealing with sanctioned Russian oil. The suspension is expected to force top importers to seek alternative supplies, potentially pushing up global oil prices.</p>
