          <p>Nvidia's investment in OpenAI, announced earlier this week, will primarily be used to lease Nvidia's GPUs. While the investment could reach up to $100 billion, most of the money will go towards the use of Nvidia's chips. OpenAI plans to pay for the GPUs through lease arrangements, rather than upfront purchases. This arrangement allows OpenAI to spread costs over the GPUs' useful life.
