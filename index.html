            <p>Mike Wolfe, star of "American Pickers," announced the closure of his Antique Archaeology store in Nashville after 15 years, citing a desire to spend more time with his family in LeClaire, Iowa, where his 81-year-old mother resides. Wolfe expressed gratitude for the community and visitors who made the store a special place, emphasizing that this isn't a goodbye but a shift in rhythm. The decision follows the death of his co-star and friend, Frank Fritz, and reflects a need to slow down and focus on new projects while maintaining his picking, sharing, and selling online and at his original Iowa store. The Nashville store will remain open until April 27, with Wolfe planning to be present on April 26.</p>

            <p>An article explores the religious and ethical dimensions of Superman, noting his strong Jewish roots and his appeal to those unaffiliated with religion. Gene Luen Yang, who has written several Superman comics, sees his own experience as a Chinese-American reflected in Superman's story. Samantha Baskind, a professor of art history, sees numerous parallels between Superman's story and the story of the Jews, such as Superman's flight from Krypton mirroring Moses' journey down the Nile. The article also discusses how Superman embodies American civil religion and provides a portal to the sacred through the profane.</p>

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen alleges that El Salvador President Nayib Bukele orchestrated a setup, dubbed "margarita-gate," during his visit to discuss the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a U.S. citizen wrongfully deported to El Salvador. Van Hollen claims that Salvadoran officials placed margarita glasses on the table during his meeting with Abrego Garcia, attempting to defame both him and the deportee. He also says that Trump is trying to divert attention from the fact that the U.S. government is not complying with the Supreme Court's order that it facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. The senator stressed that the case is about protecting the constitutional rights of everyone who resides in the United States of America.</p>

            <p>Protests against Donald Trump's presidency have erupted in cities across the United States, marking the second wave of demonstrations this month. Organizers are aiming to transform discontent into a mass movement that will influence action at the ballot box, with over 400 rallies planned nationwide. Protesters are expressing concerns over various issues, united under the common theme of opposition to the Trump administration, with organizers calling for 11 million participants, representing 3.5% of the US population. Academics emphasize that protests are part of a broader strategy to reverse the trend of democracy sliding into authoritarianism, highlighting the importance of shaping media framing and discourse.</p>

            <p>Max Verstappen secured pole position at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix after Lando Norris crashed during qualifying. Norris will have to rely on the strong race pace of the McLaren to try to limit the damage to his championship position, as he starts the race three points clear of Piastri and eight in front of Verstappen. His accident was caused by him misjudging the entry to the chicane at Turns Four and Five. The car oversteered on to the kerb at Five and was flicked into the wall on the exit, damaging the left-hand side of the car.</p>

Swinney said the Scottish government would "accept and adjust to the circumstances" and would set out the steps it will take to comply with the law.

            <p>Criminals disguised in fake military uniforms opened fire on spectators at a cockfight in rural Ecuador, killing 12 unarmed people and wounding several others. The attackers used automatic rifles, a common tactic of criminal gangs in the country, which has been plagued by violence as cartels vie for control over cocaine routes. Four suspects, believed to be part of the "Los R7" gang, have been detained. Ecuador is home to around 20 criminal gangs involved in trafficking, kidnapping, and extortion, and much of the world's cocaine passes through the country.</p>

            <p>A judge has ruled that a former roommate of the victims in the Idaho student killings can testify about seeing an intruder with "bushy eyebrows" around the time of the crime. The defense argued that the testimony was unreliable and irrelevant, but the judge disagreed. Bryan Kohberger is charged with the murder of four University of Idaho students and has pleaded not guilty. The judge also ruled that Kohberger's medical diagnoses cannot be used to explain his courtroom demeanor unless he takes the stand.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court issued a brief order forbidding the Trump administration from removing Venezuelan immigrants from the United States without due process. The order came in response to an ACLU emergency application claiming the government was moving immigrants to a Texas detention facility without explanation and designating them for removal under the Alien Enemies Act. The court's action suggests a potential shift in its tolerance of the Trump administration's efforts to evade judicial review through procedural arguments. Justices Thomas and Alito dissented from the order, signaling a division within the court.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump's economic approval rating has hit its lowest point amid concerns over tariffs, inflation, and government spending, according to a CNBC survey. The survey indicates a decline in economic optimism following Trump's reelection, with more Americans anticipating a worsening economy and a pessimistic outlook on the stock market. While Trump's Republican base remains supportive, Democrats and independents have become increasingly negative, and blue-collar workers have shown a notable decrease in approval. The survey also reveals public disapproval of tariffs and concerns about inflation, federal spending, and foreign policy (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>A survey reveals that Britons spend significant time dealing with inefficient customer service systems, leading to frustration that may influence political behavior. The most frustrating experiences include booking NHS appointments and contacting local council services. The survey suggests that call fatigue has a political dimension, with Reform UK supporters expressing higher levels of frustration. The author notes that the "on hold" problem is an excrescence of the private sector, driven by a corporate mindset that prioritizes sales over customer service.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration's simultaneous push for coal expansion and cuts to miner health and safety agencies has drawn criticism. Agencies protecting miners from occupational hazards, including black lung, have been affected by government cuts. The United Mine Workers of America expressed concern that the expansion of coal mining will be ineffective if miners' health and safety are not prioritized. The administration also seeks to pause a new rule on silica dust, a cause of pneumoconiosis, despite rising cases among younger miners.</p>
