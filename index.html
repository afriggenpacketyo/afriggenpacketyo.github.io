            <p>An adoptee, known only as A, discovered in her 40s that she isn't a U.S. citizen because her adoptive parents never completed the naturalization process, leaving her vulnerable to deportation to South Korea, a country she's never known. Despite the Child Citizenship Act of 2000, which aimed to grant automatic citizenship to international adoptees, many like A fell through the cracks due to age cutoffs and visa issues. Advocates are pushing Congress to remove the age cutoff and narrow the citizenship gap among adoptees, fearing that the current administration's deportation policies will impact them. Many adoptees are unaware of their circumstances until adulthood, facing ineligibility for financial aid and federal benefits. </p>

            <p>Senator Tim Sheehy has criticized Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum over the dumping of raw sewage into the Tijuana River, which he claims endangers the health of U.S. residents and poses a threat to national security. The toxic waste is affecting U.S. Navy SEALs and Marine special forces who train in the affected waters, with the Department of Defense considering canceling or relocating water training exercises. Mexico is reportedly dumping 5 million gallons of sewage a day into the river, leading to contaminated water and air, and health issues for residents. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin is planning to visit a local treatment facility to assess the situation.</p>

            <p>Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey, speaking at a commemoration of the Battle of Concord, called on Americans to continue fighting for liberty, stating that freedoms are once again under attack.

Representative Lori Trahan echoed these sentiments, emphasizing that the threat to democracy could come from within.

            <p>Ocado has issued an apology to Mumsnet after citing "hateful political views" when withdrawing from a commercial partnership due to the parenting forum's stance on the definition of sex in the Equality Act. Mumsnet had called for the act to be reformed to ensure women can access single-sex spaces, leading to the withdrawal of advertising support from several companies. Ocado stated that the comments were made by a temporary contractor who has since left the company and emphasized that they were not representative of the company's views. The apology followed a Supreme Court ruling clarifying that a woman is defined by biological sex under the Equality Act.</p>

            <p>Scotland's First Minister John Swinney acknowledged that members of the trans community would be feeling "uncertain and anxious" following the Supreme Court ruling on the legal definition of a woman.

Swinney stated that the Scottish government would comply with the law and ensure the rights of everyone are protected. The ruling has implications for single-sex spaces and services, allowing for the exclusion of transgender women with a gender recognition certificate if "proportionate."</p>

            <p>An opinion piece discusses the historical stereotype of stepmothers as 'wicked' figures, drawing from mythology and fairy tales. It notes that modern women often let these stories limit their lives, with many single mothers deterred from dating other parents due to negative stereotypes. However, the article argues that this fear should not hold people back, as blended families are not new, and the innate love for a mother can be 'split' between the idealised, dead mother and the real-life stepmother. The piece encourages mothers looking to date not to let the fear of being a wicked stepmother prevent them from finding love.</p>

Justices Thomas and Alito dissented from the order.

The survey indicates growing discontent over Trump's handling of tariffs, inflation, and government spending, with more Americans believing the economy will worsen. While Trump's Republican base remains supportive, Democrats and independents have become significantly more negative. The public also disapproves of Trump's handling of inflation, federal government spending, and foreign policy, while approving of his approach to immigration and border security.

            <p>The United States and Iran held a second round of negotiations in Rome concerning Tehran's nuclear program, with U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff meeting Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. The talks, mediated by Oman, are aimed at seeking a deal that ensures Iran is free of nuclear weapons and sanctions, while maintaining its ability to develop peaceful nuclear energy. The negotiations are taking place amid heightened tensions in the Middle East, and any potential agreement would require verification by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Both sides have expressed a commitment to diplomacy, but acknowledge that the path forward will be challenging.</p>

            <p>A survey reveals that the average Briton spends significant time coping with inefficient customer service systems, leading to widespread frustration. The most frustrating experiences include booking NHS or GP appointments and contacting local council services. The survey suggests that this frustration has a political dimension, with Reform UK supporters expressing more annoyance than supporters of other parties. The article argues that this "call fatigue" can shape political behavior and potentially drive voters to parties advocating for systemic change.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration's efforts to expand coal mining while simultaneously cutting funding for agencies that protect miner health and safety have sparked outrage. Advocates express concern that the health and safety of miners are being jeopardized by the cuts, potentially leading to a shortage of workers. The administration's push for coal comes amid a decline in the industry, with natural gas, wind, and solar proving more competitive. Cuts to the National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety (NIOSH) and delays to a new rule on silica dust are also raising concerns about miner health.</p>

Sakaida's cookbook, "So Easy So Good," provides recipes for balanced eating, and she structures her own meals with a focus on simplicity and sustainability. She emphasizes that one meal won't make or break your progress and that there is no need to stress about eating perfectly all the time.</p>

            <p>Scientists claim to have discovered a 'new color' called "olo," a saturated shade of blue-green, that cannot be seen by the naked eye without specific stimulation. The findings, published in Science Advances, describe an experiment where laser pulses were fired into participants' eyes to stimulate specific cells in the retina. Some experts are skeptical, suggesting the perceived color is a matter of interpretation, while the study's co-author believes the results could further research into color blindness. The color can only be perceived through direct stimulation of M cone cells.</p>
