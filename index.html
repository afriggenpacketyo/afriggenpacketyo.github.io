        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement of attacks on three Iranian nuclear sites, world leaders have reacted with concern and calls for de-escalation. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated that Iran reserves all options to defend itself, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Trump's decision. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned of a dangerous escalation and urged diplomacy. China condemned the U.S. attack, singling out Israel, and other Asia Pacific leaders called for restraint, while European leaders urged Iran to resume negotiations. Saudi Arabia and Qatar expressed concern and called for a ceasefire and dialogue. The international community is grappling with the potential consequences of this significant escalation in the Middle East. Optimism is low as the situation is highly volatile and uncertain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York City is using ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary, a system where voters rank multiple candidates in order of preference. This system ensures that even if a voter's top choice doesn't win, their other rankings still influence the outcome. The process involves eliminating the candidate with the fewest first-choice votes in rounds and redistributing those votes to the voters' next choices until a candidate secures a majority. While this system aims to promote broader support for the winner and prevent fringe candidates from winning with a simple plurality, it also introduces complexity and potential transparency concerns. Results may take longer to finalize due to the need to tabulate mail-in ballots and conduct multiple rounds of analysis, potentially leading to questions about the accuracy of the vote sorting software.</p>

          <p>The Vera Rubin Observatory in Chile has unveiled its first image, showcasing its powerful ability to observe the universe. The image reveals colorful gas and dust clouds in a star-forming region 9,000 light years away. Equipped with the world's most powerful digital camera, the telescope will continuously film the southern night sky for ten years, potentially increasing the number of known objects in our solar system tenfold. The observatory aims to detect killer asteroids, map the Milky Way, and answer questions about dark matter. The facility is located in a high, dry, and dark environment ideal for astronomical observation, with strict measures in place to maintain darkness and ensure image quality.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's defense ministry recently announced that three new military academies will begin recruiting high school graduates, sparking significant interest on social media. This announcement reflects a broader restructuring of the military education system aimed at creating a more efficient and higher quality system for nurturing talent. Despite the addition of new academies, the total number of recruits will remain consistent with previous years. This restructuring also includes eliminating the requirement for military academy students to have three years of work experience before becoming commanders, allowing them to pursue postgraduate studies immediately after graduation.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump asserted that the term "obliteration" accurately describes the damage inflicted on Iran's nuclear facilities following recent U.S. strikes. This statement disputes Iranian attempts to downplay the extent of the damage. While the full assessment is ongoing, U.S. military officials have confirmed severe damage to facilities at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) is underway to determine the full impact on Iran's nuclear capabilities. UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi has adopted a cautious tone, noting that it is too early to fully assess the damage at Fordo.</p>

The gunman, a 31-year-old with no known connection to the church, was spotted driving recklessly and then began firing at the church, injuring one person in the leg. A parishioner struck the gunman with their vehicle, giving security staff time to engage and neutralize the threat. Police are investigating the motive, which appears to be related to a mental health crisis, and are grateful for the heroic actions of the church staff in preventing further harm.</p>

          <p>A video showing the violent detention of Narciso Barranco, an immigrant father of three Marines, by masked federal agents in Orange County has sparked outrage. Barranco was working as a landscaper when he was approached by the agents and, frightened, attempted to flee. His son, Alejandro Barranco, a Marine veteran, reported that his father was pepper sprayed, beaten, and suffered a dislocated shoulder, and had not received medical treatment after being detained for over 24 hours. The Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement have not yet commented on the incident, which has led to the creation of a GoFundMe to support Barranco's legal representation.</p>

          <p>Oil markets are experiencing increased uncertainty after the U.S. joined the conflict between Iran and Israel, with experts warning of potential triple-digit prices. Investors are closely monitoring Tehran's response to U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities. The Strait of Hormuz, a critical artery for global oil trade, is a key concern, with threats of closure adding to market jitters. Experts suggest that a prolonged closure could drive oil prices above $100 per barrel, potentially leading to a severe supply disruption reminiscent of the 2022 Ukraine war oil price shock.

Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Okinawa Gov. Denny Tamaki attended a memorial service at the Peace Memorial Park in Itoman. An additional 342 names were added to the list of war dead, bringing the total to 242,567. The Battle of Okinawa significantly impacted the local population, with one in four residents killed, and anti-base sentiment remains strong due to the ongoing presence of U.S. forces.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Nashville ruled that Kilmar Abrego Garcia can be released on bail, but he will likely be taken into Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody instead. Judge Barbara Holmes stated that the government failed to prove Abrego Garcia was a flight risk, but acknowledged he would likely remain in custody due to an ICE detainer. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native, was previously deported to El Salvador's CECOT prison despite a court order barring his deportation due to fear of persecution. Another hearing is scheduled to set conditions for his release, though ICE custody is expected to follow.</p>

          <p>Pentagon officials have released details about Operation Midnight Hammer, the U.S. mission to bomb three nuclear sites in Iran, describing it as the "largest B-2 operational strike in U.S. history." The mission involved seven B-2 Spirit bombers that flew from Missouri to Iran, with additional B-2s acting as decoys. The strikes utilized GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs) and Tomahawk cruise missiles. Initial battle damage assessments indicate severe damage and destruction to the facilities at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. The Pentagon warned Iran against retaliatory actions and emphasized that the operation did not target Iranian troops or the Iranian people.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, concerns have risen about potential Iranian retaliation, including blocking oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait of Hormuz is a vital oil trade route connecting the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. In 2024, it facilitated the transit of over a quarter of global maritime oil trade, accounting for approximately one-fifth of global oil consumption. Disruptions to oil flow through the strait could severely impact international energy markets and economies, especially those of China, India, Japan and South Korea. U.S. officials have pledged to uphold freedom of navigation in the strait.</p>
