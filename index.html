          <p>A devastating fire at the Gabriel House assisted living facility in Fall River, Massachusetts, has resulted in the deaths of nine residents and left another critically injured. Firefighters arrived to a chaotic scene with heavy flames and trapped residents, ultimately rescuing dozens while five firefighters sustained minor injuries. The cause of the fire is under investigation but is not currently considered suspicious. The tragedy has prompted discussions about safety and resources, as the local firefighters' union claims inadequate staffing may have hindered rescue efforts and contributed to the loss of life.</p>

          <p>John Torode, a presenter on the popular cooking show MasterChef, has publicly acknowledged that he is the subject of an allegation of using racist language. The claim, which was upheld in an inquiry that primarily focused on his co-host Gregg Wallace, alleges the incident occurred in a social situation in 2018 or 2019. In a statement, Torode said he has no memory of the event and does not believe it happened, but emphasized that any racial language is wholly unacceptable. This revelation adds to the turmoil surrounding the show, following a separate investigation that upheld 45 allegations of misconduct against Wallace.</p>

          <p>Recent announcements by the Trump administration to impose significant tariffs on numerous countries, including Mexico and the European Union, by an August 1 deadline have created substantial economic uncertainty. The administration defends the tariffs as tools to ensure fair trade, boost domestic industries, and achieve foreign policy goals, such as pressuring Russia regarding the war in Ukraine. However, economists and trade experts express concern over the lack of clear, consistent objectives, which complicates negotiations and leaves businesses and consumers in a state of limbo. The full impact on consumer prices has not yet materialized but is being closely watched. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Premier League club Newcastle United is actively pursuing a deal to sign Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike. The 23-year-old Frenchman had an impressive season in the Bundesliga, scoring 15 goals and providing eight assists. A potential transfer would likely set a new club record for Newcastle, costing over £70 million and surpassing the £63 million paid for Alexander Isak in 2022. Despite the interest in Ekitike, the club has firmly stated it has no intention of selling Isak, who has been linked with other top European clubs. Ekitike joined Frankfurt permanently last summer and is under contract for four more years.</p>

Richard Eastland, who ran Camp Mystic and was among the deceased, received a "life threatening flash flooding" alert at 1:14 a.m. but only initiated evacuations at 2:30 a.m. This delay is a critical new detail in the tragic event, where hundreds of girls were sleeping in dorms without access to their phones. The Guadalupe River ultimately crested at 37.5 feet, causing catastrophic damage and leaving authorities to conduct a recovery operation that could last months.</p>

Research indicates that more than twice as many properties are at risk than FEMA maps suggest.

The order is in response to a petition from the brothers citing new evidence that supports their long-standing claims of sexual abuse by their father, Jose Menendez. This new evidence includes a recently discovered letter and a declaration from former Menudo member Roy Rossello, who stated he was also sexually assaulted by Jose Menendez. The brothers, convicted in 1996 for killing their parents, were recently resentenced, making them eligible for parole, and this ruling could potentially lead to a new trial.</p>

          <p>Meta announced it has removed approximately 10 million Facebook profiles in the first half of 2025 as part of a significant crackdown on spam and inauthentic content. The company is targeting accounts that impersonate large creators and use AI tools to mass-produce low-quality posts. In addition to the profile removals, Meta took action against 500,000 other accounts for spammy behavior by reducing their content's distribution. The initiative aims to make the Facebook feed more authentic and will now prioritize original content by using technology to detect and demote duplicate videos, a move that parallels recent policy changes at YouTube.</p>

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles experienced its busiest June in history, processing a record number of shipping containers as importers raced to get goods into the U.S. ahead of President Trump's tariff deadlines. Port officials described the 8% year-over-year increase as a "tariff whipsaw effect" rather than a sign of a booming economy, with volumes shifting unpredictably based on trade policy announcements. While the surge provided a short-term boost, port executives and industry leaders expect a significant drop in cargo volume from August onward. The uncertainty and high costs are forcing businesses to re-evaluate supply chains and product pricing. (not investment advice)</p>

The lower court's ruling had barred "roving patrols" in seven counties, finding that agents were unconstitutionally using race and location as a pretext for enforcement. The Trump administration argues the injunction inflicts irreparable harm by preventing the executive branch from enforcing immigration laws.
