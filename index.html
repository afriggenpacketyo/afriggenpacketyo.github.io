          <p>Residents of a Texan town, home to Elon Musk's SpaceX facility, have voted to rename their community 'Starbase,' formalizing its status as a city. The decision allows Starbase to control building permits, collect taxes, and create local laws, separating it from Cameron County regulations.  Musk celebrated the decision on X, stating that Starbase, Texas is now a real city.  Bekah Hinojosa from the South Texas Environmental Justice Network expressed concerns about potential environmental damage due to SpaceX operations in the area, fearing increased illegal dumping and destruction of wildlife habitats.</p>

          <p>Numerous U.S. arts organizations have received notices that their government grants are being terminated, following Donald Trump's proposal to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and other similar agencies. The NEA is updating its grant-making policy to prioritize projects that reflect the nation's artistic heritage and creativity, with a focus on Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, and projects celebrating the 250th anniversary of American independence. Democrats and arts unions have criticized the proposed cuts, arguing they would be disastrous for public access to creative expression, and smaller organizations rely on NEA grants to attract support from private donors.</p>

          <p>Clinicians at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) are expressing concerns that the president’s return-to-office order is compromising patient privacy. Many clinicians are being forced to conduct sensitive mental health conversations in makeshift workspaces where they can be easily overheard. This situation raises ethical concerns about the confidentiality of veterans' mental health treatment and the potential impact on their willingness to seek care. The lack of proper facilities and soundproofing in these makeshift spaces could deter veterans from openly discussing their issues, hindering the effectiveness of their therapy.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Mark Whitaker's upcoming book, "The Afterlife of Malcolm X," delves into the artistic choices made by Spike Lee and Denzel Washington in the 1992 film "Malcolm X." The excerpt details the meticulous recreation of Malcolm's life, from his early days as a hustler in Boston to his leadership in the Nation of Islam. Lee's commitment to authenticity led to the recreation of Dudley Square in Brooklyn and the use of various New York City locations to depict Malcolm's journey. The excerpt also highlights the symbolic use of music and camera techniques to convey Malcolm's premonition of his own death.</p>

          <p>This month marks the 100th birthday of Malcolm X, the charismatic and defiant Black leader who electrified America with his blunt talk and biting humor. Over his 39 years, Malcolm transformed from a street hustler to a Nation of Islam spokesman preaching racial separatism, eventually becoming a human rights leader reaching out to Whites of good faith. His famous phrase, "By any means necessary," has been interpreted as a call for self-defense and Black pride. The article discusses how Malcolm's influence has grown since his assassination, inspiring leaders of the Black Power and Black Arts movements, and how his views still resonate in today's fractious politics.</p>

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the phrase "Why can't you be more like [insert other person's name]?" as highly damaging to relationships. This comparison, whether to an ex, friend, or even a past version of the partner, conveys a message of inadequacy. Over time, such comparisons can lead to insecurity and questioning of self-worth. The phrase is often a symptom of deeper communication issues, such as fear of openly expressing needs, which can be addressed by creating a safe and emotionally close environment where partners feel comfortable communicating directly.</p>

          <p>A ballistic missile launched from Yemen struck near Israel’s international airport close to Tel Aviv, resulting in a temporary suspension of flights and raising questions about the effectiveness of Israel's missile defense system. The strike, carried out by the Iranian-backed Houthi militia, prompted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to call an urgent consultation of his security cabinet. The Houthi military spokesman warned international airlines to stay away from Ben Gurion for their own safety. The incident marks a significant security breach, and opposition leaders have criticized the government for failing to prevent such attacks.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports have dampened the atmosphere for toy exporters at the Spring Canton Fair, China's largest trade expo. Unlike previous weeks, the toy exhibition halls saw low foot traffic and a lack of new products, reflecting the challenges faced by traditional Chinese manufacturers. Many exporters avoided showcasing products developed with U.S. clients due to plagiarism fears and expectations of low U.S. participation. The suspension of U.S. orders has negatively affected research and development efforts, leading to uncertainty for toy manufacturers.</p>

          <p>Reports suggesting widespread discontent among the U.S. workforce may be overblown, according to an expert who questions the validity of surveys used to define trendy terms like "quiet quitting" and "rage applying." These terms are often based on surveys conducted by HR firms with vested interests, using questionable statistical sampling methods. The reality is that many people are satisfied with their jobs and understand the pressures employers face, recognizing that work is work and the perfect job doesn't exist. Dissatisfaction can also be a positive sign of ambition, driving individuals to seek better opportunities or start their own businesses.</p>
