            <p>Dive teams are working to recover wreckage from a helicopter crash in the Hudson River that killed all six people aboard. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has recovered the main fuselage and other parts, but is still searching for critical components like the main rotor and tail rotor, which could provide insight into the cause of the crash. The helicopter, which did not have flight recorders, had completed several tour flights earlier that day, and its last major inspection was in March. Authorities are considering mechanical failure, birds, and drones as potential factors in the crash, which involved a Siemens executive and his family. The NTSB investigation is ongoing and could take time even after the missing parts are found.</p>

            <p>Former ESPN employee Jemele Hill expressed her disappointment with the Los Angeles Dodgers for visiting President Donald Trump at the White House, citing the recent removal and restoration of Jackie Robinson's military service from the Department of Defense's website. Hill suggested that the Trump administration's actions were an attempt to erase Robinson's legacy, a move she found particularly troubling given the Dodgers' connection to the baseball legend. She contrasted the Dodgers' visit with the upcoming visit of the Philadelphia Eagles, whose owner Jeffrey Lurie sees it as a "time-honored tradition."</p>

            <p>Once seen as a sign of prosperity, the "Indian pot belly" is now a major health concern as obesity rates surge in India. A Lancet study projects that 450 million Indians could be overweight or obese by 2050. Abdominal obesity is particularly dangerous, linked to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. Evolutionary adaptations to famine conditions may contribute to the tendency for Indians to store fat around the abdomen, and lifestyle shifts such as increased consumption of junk food are also to blame.</p>

            <p>The Australian government has announced a A$10 billion plan to help first-time home buyers, including grants and loans to build up to 100,000 homes. The initiative is a key issue ahead of the upcoming May 3 election, with both the Labor government and the Liberal-National coalition focusing on housing affordability. The government also plans to guarantee a portion of first home buyers' loans, allowing them to purchase property with a smaller deposit. Opposition leader Peter Dutton is expected to propose a rival plan allowing first-time buyers to deduct mortgage payments from income taxes.</p>

            <p>Residents of Wigtown, Scotland, have successfully saved their 200-year-old pub, The Wigtown Ploughman, from being converted into flats. The community rallied together, raising over £30,000 through a community share offer and securing support from South of Scotland Enterprise to purchase the building. The pub, which had been in continuous operation since 1795, closed after the Covid pandemic, prompting concerns about the loss of a valuable community asset. Volunteers have been working to renovate the pub, and it has recently reopened to great acclaim, providing a boost to local businesses.</p>

The success of the UK version is uncertain, given differences in comedy culture and budget constraints.

            <p>A study estimates that over three million children died in 2022 due to infections resistant to antibiotics, with children in Africa and South East Asia at greatest risk. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) occurs when microbes evolve to resist antibiotic drugs, posing a significant public health threat. The study highlights a tenfold increase in AMR-related infections in children in just three years, potentially exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic. The overuse and inappropriate use of antibiotics, as well as the slow development of new drugs, contribute to this growing problem.</p>

            <p>Scottie Scheffler, typically a frontrunner, finds himself in the unfamiliar position of chasing Rory McIlroy at the Masters. Scheffler, who has won the tournament twice, shot an even-par 72, leaving him well off McIlroy's lead. His round was characterized by mistakes and scrambles, and he acknowledged McIlroy's strong play. Tyrrell Hatton, Scheffler's partner, also struggled, highlighting the challenges of Augusta National.</p>

            <p>President Trump urged Congress to pass legislation making daylight saving time permanent, arguing it would eliminate the inconvenience of changing clocks twice a year and reduce government costs. The call follows ongoing efforts in Congress to adopt daylight saving time, including the Sunshine Protection Act. While some support the change for increased evening daylight, others argue that permanent standard time is better aligned with natural rhythms and overall health.</p>

            <p>Rory McIlroy leads the Masters going into the final round for the first time since 2011, after a dramatic Saturday at Augusta National. His 66 put him two shots ahead of Bryson DeChambeau. The pressure of McIlroy's quest for a career grand slam was evident, but he appeared to have conquered past demons at the major. DeChambeau, who defeated McIlroy at the US Open last year, provides an added layer of rivalry. Ludvig Åberg is also in contention, and the tournament has a record prize fund this year.</p>

The military will be tasked with building a border wall and implementing detection and monitoring equipment. The order references the Roosevelt Reservation, a swath of land along the border that goes through California, New Mexico and Arizona.</p>

            <p>Twenty years ago, Tiger Woods made one of the most iconic shots in golf history: his chip-in on the 16th hole at the 2005 Masters. The ball teetered on the edge of the cup for 1.8 seconds, displaying its Nike swoosh before falling in. The shot, which helped Woods win his fourth Masters, is remembered for its drama and the television director's decision to stay on the ball, despite instructions to cut away. The moment remains a highlight of Woods' career and a classic moment in sports television.</p>
