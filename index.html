            <p>Patrick Crusius, the gunman responsible for the 2019 El Paso Walmart shooting that killed 23 people, is expected to plead guilty to capital murder, securing a life sentence without parole. This plea deal, offered by El Paso County District Attorney James Montoya, aims to bring closure to the case for the victims' families, some of whom expressed a desire to avoid a lengthy trial. Crusius already received 90 consecutive life sentences in federal court for hate crime and weapons charges, stemming from his racist attack targeting Hispanic shoppers. The shooting occurred after Crusius posted a manifesto online expressing anti-Hispanic sentiments, leading to a mass shooting that shook the border community.</p>

            <p>This article explores the ethical concerns and questionable science behind the booming snail slime beauty industry. It highlights the industry's assurances of humane treatment for snails, often contradicted by evidence of stressful and potentially harmful extraction methods. The piece questions the consumer's willingness to overlook these ethical issues in pursuit of youthful skin, driven by influencer endorsements and the desire for "glass skin." The author also touches on the potential impact of tariffs on Korean beauty products, suggesting that economic factors might influence the industry more than animal welfare concerns.</p>

            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Russian forces continued military actions, including shellings and assaults, despite a declared "Easter truce" ordered by Vladimir Putin. Zelenskyy accused Russia of creating an "impression" of a ceasefire while still attempting to advance in certain areas. Despite the alleged violations, Zelenskyy reiterated Ukraine's readiness to extend the truce for 30 days, a proposal previously made by the US. The BBC reported that it had been quieter on the front lines, but the Ukrainian leader's statements cast doubt on the sincerity of the Russian ceasefire.</p>

            <p>This article critiques Donald Trump's attempts to impose political authority over academic institutions, specifically Harvard University, by demanding the reorganization of departments deemed too radical and mandating the hiring of faculty to achieve "viewpoint diversity." The author argues that this approach is a form of identity politics disguised as a challenge to "woke" beliefs, undermining the principle of hiring the most qualified individuals. The article also explores the complexities of implementing affirmative action for conservative viewpoints and the potential for such policies to subvert scholarly objectivity. Ultimately, the author advocates for fostering genuine intellectual engagement and freedom of expression rather than resorting to state mandates or bureaucratic procedures.</p>

            <p>UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has pledged to reinforce the government's environmental agenda, accusing opponents of the net-zero target of spreading "nonsense and lies." He argues that transitioning to green power will bolster social justice and national security, citing the impact of reliance on fossil fuels after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. While the UK is legally committed to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, some Conservatives and Reform UK members have expressed concerns about the potential economic consequences of the policy. Miliband asserts that an anti-net-zero agenda would risk both climate breakdown and the loss of clean energy jobs.</p>
