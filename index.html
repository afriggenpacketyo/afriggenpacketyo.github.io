        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate's recently passed budget legislation proposes over $1.1 trillion in healthcare spending reductions, with the majority targeting Medicaid. According to the Congressional Budget Office, these cuts could cause nearly 12 million people to lose their health insurance by 2034. The bill introduces new work requirements for beneficiaries and limits states' ability to fund their Medicaid programs, which critics warn could shutter rural hospitals that are heavily reliant on this federal funding. The legislation also includes provisions favorable to the pharmaceutical industry, exempting more drugs from Medicare price negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the Senate's narrow passage of President Trump's budget bill, the legislation now faces an uncertain future in the House of Representatives. Speaker Mike Johnson must navigate a slim majority and objections from several conservative members who find the Senate's version too costly. Key points of contention include a higher debt ceiling increase and a larger projected impact on the national debt compared to the initial House bill. With a self-imposed July 4 deadline looming and potential attendance issues, the leadership faces a significant challenge in unifying the party to pass the final legislation.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's victory in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary has ignited a fierce debate over the viability of his socialist policy proposals. His platform includes freezing rent, establishing city-owned grocery stores, implementing free public transit, and raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy. While critics, including current Mayor Eric Adams, question his authority to enact such changes, analysis shows a mixed picture. Some proposals, like a rent freeze, are achievable through mayoral appointments, while others, such as tax hikes and a higher minimum wage, would require approval from state-level authorities, posing significant political hurdles.</p>

This military race has significant implications for global power dynamics, particularly concerning a potential conflict over Taiwan.

          <p>President Trump recently toured a new migrant detention facility in the Florida Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," which is set to hold approximately 3,000 detainees. The administration claims the surrounding swampland, inhabited by alligators and pythons, will serve as a natural deterrent to escape. The facility has drawn strong opposition from environmental groups and local residents, who fear irreversible damage to the sensitive Everglades ecosystem. Florida's governor plans to use state National Guard lawyers as immigration judges to expedite deportations, a move the administration hopes will serve as a model for other states.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, the author reflects on the nature of long-term relationships through the lens of a road trip with her husband. The confined space of a car often magnifies a partner's quirks and differing approaches to challenges like navigation and traffic, leading to familiar arguments. The author humorously describes her husband's tendency to argue with GPS directions and personify other drivers as adversaries. Ultimately, the article suggests that navigating these small conflicts and accepting a partner's idiosyncrasies is a metaphor for a successful marriage, where the only viable option is to "proceed to the route" together.</p>

          <p>President Trump has again raised the controversial and legally questionable idea of deporting U.S. citizens who have committed serious crimes. Speaking during a visit to a Florida migrant detention center, he suggested that even citizens born in the country should be expelled if they are criminals. Legal experts argue that such an action would be unconstitutional, likely violating the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. While the administration can pursue denaturalization for citizens who committed fraud during their naturalization process, deporting a citizen for an unrelated crime is widely considered to be without legal precedent.</p>

This measure expands on previous bans on smoking inside restaurants and public buildings.

The loss highlights recurring weaknesses for England as India builds momentum ahead of the upcoming 50-over World Cup.</p>

          <p>The University of Pennsylvania has entered into a voluntary agreement with the U.S. Department of Education to ban transgender women from its women's sports teams. This decision resolves a federal civil rights case that found the university had violated the rights of female athletes under Title IX. The case centered on swimmer Lia Thomas, who in 2022 became the first openly transgender athlete to win a Division I championship. As part of the agreement, Penn will restore records and titles to female athletes who competed against Thomas and formally adopt "biology-based" definitions of male and female for its athletic programs.</p>

          <p>The announcement by Republican Senator Thom Tillis that he will not seek reelection has set the stage for a wide-open and fiercely contested Senate race in North Carolina in 2026.

For Democrats, former Governor Roy Cooper is seen as a top contender and is reportedly strongly considering entering the race.

          <p>A government vaccine advisory panel, recently restructured with members skeptical of immunizations, has voted to recommend against the use of thimerosal in flu shots. Thimerosal is a mercury-containing preservative that has been a long-standing target of the anti-vaccine movement, despite numerous studies finding no evidence of harm. The CDC must still approve the recommendation, which would affect the small percentage of multi-dose flu vaccine vials that still use the preservative. Public health experts worry that removing these shots could reduce vaccine availability and reinforce unfounded fears about vaccine safety.</p>

          <p>This analytical article argues that by passing their budget bill with its deep cuts to Medicaid, Republicans are taking ownership of the American healthcare system and its future problems. The legislation is projected to cause millions to lose insurance coverage, which could lead to more uncompensated care, driving up costs for everyone and potentially causing more illness and death. The piece suggests that these changes, combined with the expiration of ACA subsidies, will create a political liability for the Republican party. It posits that the public, which has grown to favor the ACA, will hold the GOP responsible for the negative consequences.</p>

          <p>A bankruptcy judge has approved the sale of genetic testing company 23andMe's assets to a nonprofit institute led by its co-founder, Anne Wojcicki, for $305 million. The company's financial troubles had raised significant privacy concerns over the fate of its 13 million customers' genetic data, prompting some states to sue to block a sale. The judge ruled that the sale to Wojcicki's nonprofit would honor customers' rights and improve privacy practices. Once valued at $6 billion, 23andMe filed for bankruptcy after struggling with recurring revenue and facing a major data breach in 2023.</p>

          <p>Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark, who received a record number of fan votes for the WNBA All-Star game, finished ninth in the voting conducted among her fellow players. Despite the low player ranking, Clark will serve as a team captain due to the fan vote's overwhelming influence. The results have fueled an ongoing narrative that some WNBA players are jealous of the attention Clark receives. However, the player poll only allows for voting for a top four, meaning many players may have simply left her off their ballot rather than actively ranking her ninth.</p>

          <h2>Republican Budget Bill Allocates Billions to Advance Trump's Immigration Agenda</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 15:43:03 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The budget bill passed by the Senate includes approximately $150 billion in funding for immigration and border enforcement, designed to implement President Trump's hard-line policies. The legislation allocates $46.5 billion for border wall construction, $32 billion for enforcement staffing at ICE, and $45 billion to expand immigrant detention facilities. It also introduces new fees for asylum seekers and makes it easier for local law enforcement to partner with federal immigration authorities. If passed by the House, the bill would make ICE the highest-funded federal law enforcement agency and cement a significant policy shift.</p>
