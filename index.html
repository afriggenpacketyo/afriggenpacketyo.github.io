        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled against the Trump administration, voiding a freeze on $2.2 billion in grant funds for Harvard University. The court found the administration's actions were likely retaliatory and pretextual, after the university refused to alter its diversity and inclusion programs. The ruling bars the administration from enforcing the freeze, which it had justified by citing concerns over antisemitism on campus. This decision marks a significant development in the ongoing conflict between the administration and prominent academic institutions over free speech and institutional autonomy.</p>

          <p>With a government funding deadline less than four weeks away, congressional leaders are trading blame over a potential shutdown. The partisan standoff centers on spending levels and policy riders, with House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer accusing each other's parties of intransigence. Lawmakers are considering a short-term stopgap measure, but even that faces significant hurdles due to narrow majorities and contentious demands from both sides. The White House has indicated support for a "clean" continuing resolution to buy more time for negotiations.</p>

          <p>Shares of design software company Figma fell 13% in after-hours trading after releasing its first earnings report since its initial public offering. While revenue of $249.6 million slightly surpassed expectations and grew 41% year-over-year, the company's third-quarter revenue forecast disappointed some investors. The report also detailed Figma's recent acquisitions and its strategy for integrating artificial intelligence into its products, which has yet to be fully monetized. The company is navigating the transition to a public entity while investing in future growth areas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Legal experts have raised significant concerns that a recent US military strike that killed 11 alleged drug traffickers in the Caribbean may have violated international law. The White House justified the action against the vessel, said to be from Venezuela and operated by the Tren de Aragua cartel, as a counter-narcotics operation. However, specialists in maritime and international law told BBC Verify that the use of lethal force in international waters outside of an armed conflict could be considered an extrajudicial killing. This incident highlights complex legal questions surrounding presidential authority for such strikes.</p>

          <p>Veteran all-rounder Ravi Bopara scored a remarkable 45-ball century to lead Northamptonshire to a seven-run victory over Surrey in a rain-affected T20 Blast quarter-final. The 40-year-old's unbeaten 105 guided his team to a total of 154-4 in their shortened 14-over innings. Despite a strong effort from Surrey's captain Sam Curran, who scored 69 not out, his team fell just short in the chase. The win secures Northamptonshire's first appearance at Finals Day since 2016, the year they last won the tournament.</p>

          <p>A tragic accident occurred in Lisbon, Portugal, when a historic funicular, known as the Elevador da Glória, derailed, killing at least 15 people and injuring 18 others. Preliminary reports suggest a safety cable on the electric streetcar may have broken, causing it to crash during a busy period. The city's mayor has declared a three-day mourning period in response to the devastating incident. An investigation is now underway to determine the exact cause of the mechanical failure on the popular tourist and commuter transport.</p>

This retrospective article notes that while arrivals have decreased from their 2015 peak, the flow of migrants continues, driven by global conflicts.

          <p>The United States has sanctioned Guangzhou Tengyue Chemical, a China-based company, for its alleged role in manufacturing and shipping fentanyl precursor chemicals to the U.S. The Treasury Department accused the company of "pushing poison for profit," and the FBI announced a related criminal indictment. This action is part of a broader U.S. effort to hold China accountable for its role in the opioid crisis. The State Department stated that China actively sustains the business of illicit drugs, which are the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18 to 45.</p>

          <p>The Premier League's summer transfer window saw clubs spend a record £3 billion, widening the financial gap with other European leagues and even within the league itself. Experts express concern that Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) are creating a "glass ceiling," forcing ambitious mid-tier clubs to sell homegrown talent to the league's elite to comply with regulations. This trend risks polarizing the competition and diminishing the local identity of teams. The massive spending highlights the league's commercial dominance but also fuels debate over the need for financial rule reform.</p>
