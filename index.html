          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 16:52:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated widespread layoffs, cutting 1,353 civil and foreign service positions as part of a significant reorganization under the Trump administration. This move is part of a larger plan to reduce the department's workforce by nearly 3,000 employees, including those who accepted voluntary departures. The reorganization also involves closing or merging numerous domestic offices and consolidating functions like sanctions oversight to streamline what officials call a "bloated bureaucracy." Critics, including Democratic senators and the American Foreign Service Association, argue these indiscriminate cuts undermine national security and signal a U.S. withdrawal from the world stage.</p>

          <p>A preliminary investigation into the recent Air India crash in Ahmedabad has revealed a critical sequence of events moments after takeoff. According to India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), the fuel cutoff switches for both engines on the Boeing 787-8 were moved from "run" to "cut off," leading to an immediate loss of thrust. The crash resulted in the deaths of 241 of the 242 people on board and at least 19 fatalities on the ground. The AAIB has not yet issued any recommended actions for operators or manufacturers pending further investigation into the catastrophic failure.</p>

          <h2>President Trump Defends Flood Response in Texas, Criticizes Reporter for Questioning Warning Systems</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 16:46:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a tour of flood-devastated central Texas, President Donald Trump praised the response efforts of local and state officials, dismissing questions about the adequacy of warning alerts. After flash floods killed at least 121 people, Trump characterized the response as heroic and called a reporter's question about potential failures "evil." This approach contrasts with his past criticism of disaster management in Democratic-led states. The administration has also pushed back on critiques regarding cuts to the National Weather Service and has avoided questions about plans to potentially phase out FEMA.</p>

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of the infamous drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, has pleaded guilty to federal drug trafficking and criminal enterprise charges in a Chicago court. As part of the plea agreement, he admitted to running a major fentanyl trafficking operation for the Sinaloa cartel's "Los Chapitos" faction. The deal requires him to provide "substantial assistance" to the U.S. government, potentially testifying against his own brother and other cartel members, in exchange for a sentence less than life in prison.

The upward trend was also supported by a dovish outlook on Federal Reserve policy and a wave of short liquidations totaling over $550 million.

He argued that while the "American way" is immigrant-friendly, it has rules, and suggested that framing the character this way was a political mistake that could hurt the film's box office performance.

According to career platform Handshake, listings for such jobs have fallen by 15%, while applications per job have risen by 30%. This trend is contributing to a higher unemployment rate for young degree holders compared to the national average.

          <h2>Crystal Palace Set to Lose Europa League Spot to Nottingham Forest Over Ownership Rules</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 15:14:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Crystal Palace is expected to be replaced by Nottingham Forest in next season's Europa League due to UEFA's multi-club ownership regulations. The issue stems from John Textor's ownership stake in both Crystal Palace and French club Lyon, who also qualified for the competition. Because Lyon finished higher in their domestic league, they are given priority. Palace's case was weakened by their failure to meet a March deadline to alter their ownership structure to comply with the rules. The club is now relegated to the less prestigious Conference League and is expected to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines is considering new ways to segment its premium travel classes, such as business and first class, following a model similar to the one it applied to its main economy cabin. The airline's president, Glen Hauenstein, noted that premium seating has been a key driver of margin expansion, and the goal is to offer more varied products to meet different customer needs. While specific changes were not detailed, possibilities could include cheaper, less-inclusive premium fares or more luxurious suite-style seats with extra amenities. This focus comes as premium cabin revenue continues to outperform economy ticket sales.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has overturned plea agreements for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two other men accused of planning the 9/11 attacks, prolonging the long-stalled legal proceedings. The 2-to-1 decision found that former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had the authority to rescind the deals, which would have allowed the defendants to plead guilty in exchange for life sentences instead of facing the death penalty. The ruling deepens the legal morass of a case that has been stuck in pre-trial hearings for years, frustrating some 9/11 family members who saw the deals as the only path to resolution.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was wrongfully deported and then returned to the U.S., have asked a federal judge to require 72 hours' notice before any future removal. Abrego Garcia was deported to an El Salvadoran mega-prison despite a court order barring his removal, based on an administration claim that he was an MS-13 member, which he denies. Now back in the U.S. facing separate charges, his legal team is seeking the notice period to ensure they have time to seek judicial relief. The judge sharply criticized the government for its handling of the "highly irregular case."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government recorded a surprising budget surplus of $27 billion in June, largely due to a sharp increase in government receipts bolstered by tariff collections. Customs duties for the month were 301% higher than the previous year, contributing to a 13% overall rise in receipts compared to June 2024. Despite this monthly surplus, the fiscal year-to-date deficit stands at $1.34 trillion. Persistently high interest payments on the national debt remain a significant challenge, totaling $84 billion for the month, one of the largest categories of government spending.

The Alawite community, from which former dictator Bashar Assad's family hails, has faced attacks and persecution since the regime's ousting. The UN has documented at least six such abductions, noting the women are targeted due to their religious affiliation and perceived links to the former regime. The story of one victim, "Nora," highlights the physical and psychological abuse endured in captivity, fueling fears of systematic subjugation of the minority group.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that new initiatives within the FBI and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence represent a dangerous shift towards enforcing political loyalty rather than ensuring national security. The author criticizes FBI Director Kash Patel for reportedly using polygraphs to find who spoke negatively about him, and DNI Tulsi Gabbard for planning to use AI to scan agency communications for signs of undermining the administration's agenda. The piece contends these actions resemble authoritarian tactics, creating a climate of paranoia that corrodes morale and distracts from addressing genuine threats like foreign espionage and terrorism.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services is facing a backlog of over a billion dollars in delayed grants, prompting the agency to ask some recently laid-off employees to return to work temporarily. Officials attribute the delays to new bureaucratic review processes implemented by the Trump administration, which have stalled the awarding of funds for critical programs, including services for unaccompanied migrant children and domestic violence hotlines. With the end of the fiscal year approaching, officials are concerned it will be nearly impossible to process the grants in time without cutting corners on standard review procedures.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to impose a 50% tariff on all Brazilian imports, explicitly linking the move to the ongoing criminal trial of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. In a social media post, Trump called the trial a "WITCH HUNT" and demanded that authorities "LEAVE BOLSONARO ALONE." The threat has sparked outrage in Brazil, with President Lula da Silva's government calling it an unacceptable interference in the country's sovereign judicial process. This use of trade policy to influence a domestic legal matter in another nation marks a significant escalation of Trump's tariff strategy. (not investment advice)</p>
