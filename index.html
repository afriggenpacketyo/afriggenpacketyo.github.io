          <p>The Pentagon's newly revived "rapid response team" X account is facing criticism for its partisan attacks on reporters and its excessive promotion of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. The account's posts often feature religious rhetoric and a cult of personality around Hegseth, merging religion with a strongman image. This raises concerns about the weaponization of social media for political purposes and the blurring of lines between government communication and propaganda.  Experts express alarm at the account's overtly partisan and potentially fascistic tone.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves defended the government's decision to launch a national inquiry into grooming gangs, emphasizing that victims' concerns were never dismissed.
