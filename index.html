          <h2>Analyst Questions the Viability of Apple Moving iPhone Assembly to India</h2>

          <p>Craig Moffett, a top analyst, casts doubt on Apple's plan to shift iPhone assembly to India, citing that the supply chain would still be anchored in China, and face resistance. Moffett questions how this move would reduce costs related to tariffs, as components would still originate from China. He argues that a global trade war impacts both costs and sales, and moving assembly alone might not solve the bigger issue of demand destruction due to higher prices. Moffett has a "sell" rating on Apple and recently cut his price target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite plans for a special tribunal to prosecute Russia for its actions in Ukraine, significant hurdles remain. The tribunal, operating under the Council of Europe, faces challenges in prosecuting high-ranking Russian officials due to immunity.

The tribunal's scope, timeline, and potential impact are subject to ongoing debate and negotiation.</p>

          <p>China is expanding its initiative to create a new academic discipline aimed at stamping out Western bias in ethnic studies. The State Council approved 15 more universities to establish study programs in "community for the Chinese nation." This interdisciplinary field aims to consolidate Beijing's narrative on a unified national identity and breaks down boundaries between various academic disciplines.</p>

          <p>Under President Trump, opportunities for student loan forgiveness have narrowed. The SAVE repayment plan is expected to be dismantled, and other repayment plans no longer guarantee debt erasure after a certain period. However, Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) remains intact, although changes are possible. Other loan cancellation opportunities, such as the Teacher Loan Forgiveness program, are still available, but borrowers should carefully consider their options. (not investment advice)</p>
