          <p>Britain and the European Union have announced a significant agreement aimed at resetting their relationship after the UK's departure from the bloc in 2020. The deal encompasses various sectors, including security, energy, trade, travel, and fisheries, and is viewed by British officials as a "historic day" that marks a "new chapter" following years of strained relations post-Brexit. The agreement seeks to reduce trade barriers, enhance security cooperation, extend fishing rights for EU trawlers in UK waters until 2038, and streamline travel for British holidaymakers through the use of eGates at EU airports.

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis followed the discovery of a small nodule on his prostate, leading to further evaluation. While the cancer is considered aggressive, it appears to be hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management. Biden and his family are currently reviewing treatment options with his physicians, and messages of support have poured in from both sides of the political spectrum.</p>

          <p>The Democratic primary for mayor of Pittsburgh has evolved into a significant battleground reflecting the broader ideological struggle within the Democratic Party. Incumbent Mayor Ed Gainey, a progressive, faces a challenge from Corey O’Connor, a more centrist candidate with strong ties to the city's establishment. The race highlights divisions over issues like affordable housing and the role of large non-profit institutions, with outside groups pouring money into the election to test messages and influence voters. The outcome of the primary is likely to shape the city's direction and provide insights into the Democratic Party's future trajectory.</p>

          <p>Financial markets experienced turbulence as stocks fell, the dollar weakened, and bond yields rose following a credit rating downgrade for the United States. The downgrade, driven by concerns over the cost of President Trump's policies and the nation's economic health, has heightened anxieties about government debt. Moody's cited the tax cut legislation and broader fiscal deficit concerns as reasons for the downgrade, meaning all three major rating agencies no longer consider the United States qualified for their top credit ratings. Analysts have raised forecasts for U.S. yields, citing the pause on tariffs and the potential for sustained inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal investigators are providing an update on the Mexican navy ship that collided with the Brooklyn Bridge over the weekend. The National Transportation Safety Board is collecting evidence to determine the cause of the incident, and commercial water traffic remains suspended in the area. Authorities have identified the two victims killed in the crash as 20-year-old cadet América Yamilet Sánchez and Adal Jair Maldonado Marcos. The Mexican Navy training ship, the Cuauhtémoc, crashed into the bridge after a ceremonial departure, resulting in the snapping of all three masts.</p>

          <p>Consumers are increasingly cutting back on spending due to rising trade tensions and economic uncertainty. A study by Intuit Credit Karma found that 83% of consumers would consider reducing non-essential purchases if their financial situation worsens. Additionally, over half of adults plan to spend less on travel, dining, or live entertainment compared to last year, according to a Bankrate report. This shift in consumer behavior indicates that people may no longer be able to absorb higher prices, leading to a reevaluation of spending habits. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite efforts to improve accuracy, political polling continued to struggle in the 2024 elections, with pollsters underestimating President Trump by nearly the same margin as in 2016. The problem stems from nonresponse bias, as those who participate in polls differ significantly from those who do not, particularly in their trust of institutions. This bias is difficult to correct, even with sophisticated weighting techniques, and suggests that election and approval polls may be less reliable than commonly believed.</p>

          <p>Eating enough food, not just specific nutrients, plays a significant role in growing healthy hair and nails. Hair and nail cells have a rapid turnover rate, making them among the first signs of poor nutrition or nutritional deficiencies. Under-eating can lead to insufficient energy for hair and nail cell growth and regrowth, as the body prioritizes vital organs. Eating enough and getting the right nutrients will be more directly beneficial than others, including iron, zinc, biotin, collagen, healthy fats and fat-soluble vitamins.</p>
