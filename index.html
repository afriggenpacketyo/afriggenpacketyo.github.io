          <h2>PBS Announces Significant Job Cuts Following Federal Funding Reduction</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>PBS is implementing substantial job cuts, reducing its workforce by approximately 15%, affecting 34 current staff members and eliminating numerous vacant positions. This significant reduction is a direct consequence of a 21% revenue shortfall, largely driven by Congressional Republicans' move to eliminate all federal funding for public broadcasting and the termination of a major U.S. Education Department grant. PBS Chief Executive Paula Kerger informed station managers that the organization is forced to make difficult choices, impacting all operational facets despite previous cost-saving measures like cutting travel and merit pay evaluations. This situation highlights the severe financial pressures now facing public media entities nationwide.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron confirmed that 26 nations have committed to providing postwar security guarantees for Ukraine, envisioning an international force across land, sea, and air to deter future aggression. This declaration followed a summit where European leaders pressed U.S. President Donald Trump for clarity on American backing, which they deem crucial for the guarantees' viability. While some nations may deploy troops, others will focus on training and equipping Kyiv's forces, a move welcomed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Concurrently, Russia's economy shows signs of strain despite defense spending, with a top banker warning of potential recession, highlighting the complex geopolitical and economic landscape surrounding the conflict.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faced intense bipartisan scrutiny during a Senate Finance Committee hearing, which quickly became a verbal judo match. Lawmakers from both parties challenged him over his recent decision to fire CDC Director Susan Monarez and his controversial new, stringent eligibility guidelines for the fall COVID-19 booster. Kennedy sparred with senators, notably clashing with Democrats who accused him of being a charlatan and putting public health at risk, while Republicans expressed deep concern over his vaccine stances. The Secretary defended his actions, claiming Monarez was fired for not being truthful, and indicated further CDC official firings might occur.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, a Democrat, issued a direct challenge to President Trump for a debate, proposing to "cut out the middle man" after independent candidate Andrew Cuomo called for a series of local mayoral debates. This development unfolds amidst reports that the White House is actively seeking to influence the race, allegedly exploring job offers to persuade incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa to withdraw. Trump publicly stated his preference for a one-on-one contest, yet both Adams and Sliwa have adamantly refused to exit the race. The situation underscores the intricate and high-stakes political landscape of New York City's mayoral election.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump formally signed an executive order to implement a trade deal with Japan, establishing a 15% baseline tariff on most Japanese imports, including automobiles. As part of the agreement, Japan pledged a substantial $550 billion investment in U.S. projects and committed to increasing purchases of American agricultural products, commercial aircraft, and defense equipment, alongside opening market access in key manufacturing and aerospace sectors. While the deal aims to benefit U.S. interests, the tariffs are projected to negatively impact major auto manufacturers globally. Concurrently, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is facing significant internal discontent and calls for a leadership challenge within his ruling Liberal Democratic Party following recent electoral setbacks.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon characterized the flight of two Venezuelan military aircraft near a U.S. Navy vessel in international waters as a "highly provocative move," aimed at interfering with ongoing counter-narco-terror operations. This incident occurred shortly after President Trump authorized a U.S. military strike in the Caribbean against a suspected drug smuggling vessel linked to the Tren de Aragua gang, resulting in 11 fatalities. The Defense Department issued a strong warning to the Venezuelan government, which it referred to as a cartel, to cease obstructing U.S. military efforts. The U.S. Navy has increased its presence in the Caribbean and Pacific with eight deployed ships to enhance these anti-drug and anti-terror initiatives.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced forthcoming "fairly substantial" tariffs on semiconductor imports, specifically targeting companies that do not shift their production to the United States. He clarified that firms demonstrating significant domestic investment, such as Apple, which recently pledged an additional $100 billion for U.S. manufacturing, would likely be spared from these new levies. Trump made these remarks during a White House dinner attended by numerous tech industry leaders, underscoring the administration's long-standing push to onshore the semiconductor supply chain. This policy aims to incentivize global chip giants like TSMC and Samsung, who have already committed hundreds of billions to U.S. facilities, to continue expanding their domestic presence.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is moving to rename the Department of Defense as the "Department of War," with an executive order set to authorize "secondary titles" for the department and its officials, such as Secretary of War. This symbolic change aims to circumvent the need for immediate congressional assent, which is typically required for a permanent department name alteration. Trump has consistently argued that reverting to the historical "War Department" name, used until 1947, would project a more powerful and resolute image for the United States military. The order also directs Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to propose legislative measures to finalize the name change, reflecting the administration's intent to instill a less "defensive" perception.</p>

This potential deployment comes after the Trump administration fired dozens of immigration judges and relaxed qualification requirements for these temporary positions. While proponents see it as a necessary step to address the crisis, the American Immigration Lawyers Association has strongly criticized the plan, arguing that immigration law is highly specialized and complex, making military lawyers ill-equipped without substantial training.

An analysis of Powerball data highlights considerable variations in the after-tax payouts for winners across different states, primarily influenced by state-level income taxes on lottery prizes. While a mandatory 24% federal withholding applies, states such as California, Florida, and Texas do not levy additional taxes, enabling winners there to keep a significantly larger portion of their prize compared to those in states like New York, which has the lowest after-tax annuitized payout.</p>

          <p>This article delivers a sharp critique of President Trump's proposed rebranding of the Department of Defense to the "Department of War," dismissing it as "inanity" and a performative act. The author argues that this change, championed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, betrays a superficial understanding of national security, ignoring the historical evolution from the War Department in 1947 to reflect a broader, continuous commitment to defense. The piece highlights that post-World War II leaders like Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower, both with extensive military backgrounds, intentionally chose "Defense" to signify an enduring national security posture beyond discrete conflicts. It concludes that the rebrand is a hollow gesture, unlikely to command greater respect from global adversaries who also use "ministries of defense."</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has sharply criticized President Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles for immigration enforcement, revealing the operation cost taxpayers nearly $120 million. Newsom condemned the expenditure as "waste, fraud and abuse," detailing costs including $71 million for food, $37 million for pay, and $3.5 million for travel. This denouncement follows a federal judge's ruling that the deployment was illegal, violating the Posse Comitatus Act and effectively creating a "national police force" under the President's command. Newsom, who had previously filed a lawsuit against the deployment, emphasized the significant financial and societal repercussions, including substandard conditions for the deployed guardsmen.</p>

          <p>The United States has enacted sanctions against three Palestinian human rights organizations—the Gaza-based Palestinian Centre for Human Rights and Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, and the Ramallah-based Al-Haq. These sanctions stem from the groups' November 2023 request for the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate alleged Israeli war crimes in Gaza, including airstrikes on civilian areas, the territory's siege, and population displacement. This U.S. action follows the ICC's subsequent issuance of arrest warrants for both Israeli and Hamas leaders for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. The U.S. administration, which does not recognize the ICC's jurisdiction, has a history of sanctioning ICC judges and prosecutors over investigations involving U.S. troops or allies.</p>

          <p>Officers from the Los Angeles Police Department's Metropolitan Division are now assisting the California Highway Patrol in providing protective services for former Vice President Kamala Harris, after President Trump revoked her Secret Service detail. This temporary, city-funded arrangement has sparked controversy, with the LAPD union criticizing the use of taxpayer money to protect a wealthy individual who could afford private security. Governor Gavin Newsom's office underscored the urgency of ensuring Harris's safety, denouncing Trump's action as an "erratic, vindictive political impulse." The abrupt withdrawal of federal protection comes as Harris embarks on a book tour, including international engagements, raising concerns about her security needs.</p>

While recognizing the convenience these autonomous browsers offer consumers for tasks like booking flights, Arora emphasized their inherent conflict with corporate security protocols, where companies are wary of granting AI agents excessive autonomy. He underscored that credential theft is a leading cause of data breaches, which informs his company's planned $25 billion acquisition of CyberArk, an identity security provider.

          <p>A fact-check article has debunked a digitally altered image of President Donald Trump depicting him with a "puffy face," which had spread widely online and contributed to unfounded rumors about his health. The manipulated image, shared by various social media users and even California Governor Gavin Newsom's press office, was traced back to an authentic Associated Press photograph from July 2022. Newsom's office subsequently acknowledged the image was edited, stating its intent was to satirize the President. This incident highlights a recurring issue of misinformation regarding Trump's well-being, although the White House had confirmed in July 2025 that he has chronic venous insufficiency, a common and benign condition for individuals over 70.</p>

Despite a late ninth-inning rally, the team's offensive inconsistencies and overall poor play persisted, contributing to a confounding 22-30 record since July 4. Manager Dave Roberts conceded the uncharacteristic nature of their performance, leaving the Dodgers with a precarious two-game lead in the NL West and potentially jeopardizing a first-round playoff bye.</p>

Mihara unequivocally labeled the government's actions as "racist," noting the selective targeting of Japanese Americans.

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has affirmed an injunction, preventing the Trump administration from enforcing its policy that sought to restrict transgender and nonbinary Americans from obtaining passports accurately reflecting their gender identities. This ruling is a significant development stemming from an executive order signed by President Trump, which aimed to recognize only binary biological genders on passports, thereby overturning a previous Biden administration policy allowing an "X" gender marker. The American Civil Liberties Union successfully argued that Trump's policy was unconstitutional, based on "irrational prejudice," and would inflict immediate and irreparable harm upon affected individuals. Neither the White House nor the State Department has issued an immediate comment on the court's decision.</p>

Consequently, Bishop Montgomery High has forfeited its remaining football games after self-reporting these violations. The attorney contends that the player transfers were not primarily athletically motivated, but rather part of a larger scheme, and that the ineligible players possessed legitimate documentation.</p>
