          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former journalist Lauren SÃ¡nchez held their wedding in Venice, Italy, attended by a host of high-profile celebrities including Leonardo DiCaprio, Oprah Winfrey, and Bill Gates. The multi-day festivities drew significant media attention as guests arrived via water taxis for the lavish events. The celebration, however, also sparked protests from some Venetian residents under the banner "No Space for Bezos," highlighting ongoing local frustrations with over-tourism and its impact on the city. This marks the second marriage for both Bezos and SÃ¡nchez, who finalized their previous divorces in 2019.</p>

          <p>The band The 1975 returned to the stage to headline Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage, delivering a slick and crowd-pleasing performance in their only scheduled show of the year. Frontman Matty Healy, known for his unpredictable stage presence, offered a more restrained show, focusing on the band's extensive catalog of hits like "Chocolate" and "Love It If We Made It." The article notes that while the musical performance was tight and well-received, it lacked the wilder, more chaotic energy of their past shows. The day also featured surprise sets from artists like Lorde and an emotional comeback performance from Lewis Capaldi.</p>

          <p>A 70-year-old Egyptian national has been deported from the United States after pleading guilty to harming a law enforcement animal. The man, Hamed Ramadan Bayoumy Aly Marie, violently kicked a 5-year-old U.S. Customs and Border Protection beagle named Freddy with enough force to lift him off the ground during a baggage inspection at Washington Dulles International Airport. The assault occurred after Freddy alerted officers to Marie's suitcase, which contained over 100 pounds of prohibited agricultural products. Freddy sustained bruising but is expected to make a full recovery, and Marie was ordered to pay the veterinary bill before his removal.</p>

Mamdani, a self-described democratic socialist, has a platform that includes higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy. In response to Trump's remarks, Mamdani encouraged the president to learn about his actual policies aimed at making the city more affordable for its residents.</p>

          <p>After a six-week manhunt, Antoine Massey, one of the last two inmates who escaped from a New Orleans jail, has been recaptured. Authorities located and arrested the 33-year-old at an Airbnb in the city following a tip from a citizen to the Orleans Parish Sheriff. The arrest was made peacefully, and police believe Massey received assistance during his time as a fugitive. His capture leaves one remaining escapee, Derrick Groves, at large. The original jailbreak involved 10 inmates and prompted a massive law enforcement response and scrutiny of the jail's security measures.</p>

The vote occurred amidst lingering questions and Democratic frustration over the administration's lack of transparency concerning recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.

          <p>In the closing arguments of his federal trial, Sean "Diddy" Combs's lawyer portrayed the music mogul as the target of an overzealous prosecution that misrepresented his lifestyle as a criminal conspiracy. Attorney Marc Agnifilo argued that the government "badly exaggerated" evidence related to recreational drug use and a swinger lifestyle to build its racketeering and sex trafficking case. The defense claimed the allegations are financially motivated, calling the case a "fake trial" about money rather than crime. Prosecutors countered that the defense was attempting to distract from Combs's "inexcusable behavior," stating the trial was about how he used power and violence.</p>

Hazlewood's controlled bowling spell was pivotal, as he dismantled the hosts' top order, finishing with figures of 5-43.

The move, championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, is a strategic effort to combat the exodus of productions to other states and countries offering more generous financial benefits. This legislation aims to reverse a trend that has led to a significant decline in industry jobs and production levels in Los Angeles.

          <p>The Supreme Court delivered a partial victory to the Trump administration by limiting the power of lower courts to issue nationwide injunctions against executive actions. In a 6-3 decision, the court granted a partial stay on injunctions that had blocked President Trump's order to end birthright citizenship, though it did not rule on the order's constitutionality. This ruling means the policy cannot be enforced against the specific plaintiffs in the case, but the administration can proceed with developing implementation plans elsewhere.

          <p>NASA has announced that two of its research aircraft will be flying at unusually low altitudes over Southern California for several days. The planes, a P-3 Orion and a King Air B200, will be flying between 1,000 and 10,000 feet to study atmospheric data over the Los Angeles Basin, Salton Sea, and Central Valley. The flights are part of NASA's Student Airborne Research Program, where students gain hands-on experience collecting data using scientific instruments. Residents may observe the aircraft performing peculiar maneuvers, such as vertical spirals and what appear to be missed landings, as part of their research.</p>

          <p>A team of specialized divers has successfully completed the first-ever human exploration of the SS Nemesis, a steamship that sank in 1904 and was only discovered in 2022. The shipwreck lies at a depth of 525 feet off the coast of Sydney, requiring a highly technical dive in complete darkness. The divers had just nine minutes at the wreck site, where they surveyed and filmed its features, including scattered coal from its final cargo. All 32 people aboard perished when the ship sank in a storm, and this mission provides new insights into the century-old maritime tragedy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis in The Guardian argues that the Supreme Court's recent decision to limit nationwide injunctions in the birthright citizenship case constitutes a significant expansion of presidential authority. The author, Moira Donegan, contends that by curbing the ability of federal judges to issue broad stays on executive actions, the court has given the president greater power to implement policies that may violate the constitution. The piece suggests this creates a chaotic legal landscape where rights depend on one's location and the status of local litigation. It characterizes the ruling as an "existential threat to the rule of law" that weakens judicial checks on the executive branch.</p>

          <p>This article from The Atlantic suggests a potential resurgence of the Tea Party's fiscal conservative ideals within the Republican party, driven by some of the same figures elected in the 2010 wave. Senators like Rand Paul and Ron Johnson are once again raising concerns about federal spending and deficits, this time in opposition to President Trump's proposed tax cuts, which they argue are not paired with sufficient spending reductions. This emerging faction echoes the original Tea Party's anti-establishment and fiscal discipline stance, creating internal friction within the GOP. However, they face the challenge of opposing a president who remains highly popular with the party's base.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced it will terminate the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for Haitian migrants, effective in early September. This decision will revoke the legal status and work permits of an estimated 348,000 Haitians who have been living and working legally in the U.S., some since a 2010 earthquake devastated their home country. The Department of Homeland Security argued that conditions in Haiti have improved enough for their return, a claim that contrasts with State Department travel advisories warning of instability and violence.

          <p>An analysis of the FIFA Club World Cup's prize money reveals substantial earnings for participating clubs like Manchester City and Chelsea, with tens of millions secured just for qualifying. The total prize pot is reported to be around $1 billion, with a European team's participation fee alone reaching up to Â£27.9 million. Teams earn additional money for wins, draws, and advancing through each stage, with the tournament winner potentially taking home over Â£90 million in total. This massive financial incentive has raised concerns about its potential to distort domestic league competitions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Financial Advisor Ric Edelman Advocates for 10% to 40% Cryptocurrency Allocation in Portfolios</h2>

          <p>Prominent financial advisor Ric Edelman has significantly increased his recommended portfolio allocation for cryptocurrencies, now suggesting a range of 10% to 40%. This marks a substantial shift from his previous advice of a low single-digit allocation. Edelman attributes this change to the evolution of crypto into a mainstream asset class, with initial questions about government bans and adoption now largely resolved. He also argues that the traditional 60/40 stock-to-bond portfolio is obsolete due to increased human longevity, making higher-return assets like crypto essential for long-term financial planning.

          <h2>DOJ Report: Sinaloa Cartel Used Hacked Data and City Cameras to Hunt and Kill FBI Informants</h2>

          <p>A U.S. Justice Department report has revealed that a hacker working for the Sinaloa drug cartel successfully targeted an FBI official in Mexico City to track and kill informants. The hacker obtained the official's phone records, including call logs and geolocation data, and utilized the city's public surveillance camera system to follow the agent and identify individuals they met with. According to the report, the cartel used this intelligence to intimidate and, in some cases, murder potential sources and cooperating witnesses in 2018. The incident highlights the growing threat of technical surveillance being exploited by sophisticated criminal organizations.</p>
