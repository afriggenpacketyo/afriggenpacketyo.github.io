          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed Jeanine Pirro, a former Fox News host and staunch ally of President Trump, to the position of U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. The confirmation passed with a 50-45 vote, formalizing her role which she had held on an acting basis since May. This appointment places a prominent Trump loyalist in charge of one of the nation's most powerful prosecutor's offices, responsible for both federal and local crimes in the capital. The confirmation proceeded with little pushback from Democrats compared to a previous nominee.</p>

          <p>A mother in Texas has shared a viral video recounting an incident where an octopus at the San Antonio Aquarium allegedly latched onto her six-year-old son's arm and refused to let go. The video shows welts and marks on the boy's arm, and the mother claims it took three employees to remove the creature, which she says was trying to pull her son into the tank. The aquarium responded with a statement asserting the octopus was exhibiting typical, curious behavior and was not aggressive, stating the guest allowed her child to lean over the barrier without staff supervision.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Office of the Special Counsel has initiated an investigation into Jack Smith, the former special counsel who led probes into Donald Trump, for potential violations of the Hatch Act. This federal law restricts the political activities of federal employees. The probe follows a request from Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged that Smith's actions, particularly the timing of his investigations before the 2024 election, constituted illegal political activity intended to harm Trump's candidacy. Smith resigned from his position in January before Trump returned to office.</p>

The victory was part of a successful night for the U.S., which included individual gold medals for Katie Ledecky in the 800-meter freestyle and Gretchen Walsh in the 50-meter butterfly. Ledecky's win was particularly notable as she maintained her undefeated streak in the 800-meter freestyle in major competitions, a record she has held since the 2012 Olympics.

The scheme allegedly involved inflating the prices of state contracts by up to 30%. President Volodymyr Zelensky affirmed his "zero tolerance" policy for corruption, praising the agencies for their work. The arrests come shortly after the independence of these anti-corruption bodies was restored following public protests, a key issue for Ukraine's EU accession bid.</p>

          <p>Ten years after its launch, the Ethereum blockchain has transformed from a niche experiment into a foundational technology for global finance, now valued at over $420 billion. Originally conceived as a "world computer" for programmable money, it now underpins decentralized finance, NFTs, and the tokenization of real-world assets by major institutions. Co-founder Vitalik Buterin reflects on the platform's unexpected growth while warning against the risks of centralization as mainstream adoption accelerates. Experts note that Ethereum is becoming the essential "plumbing" for Wall Street, chosen for its stability and vast ecosystem. (not investment advice)</p>

The platypus, named Winston, was a diplomatic gift from Australia in 1943, but perished days before arrival. While wartime legend blamed the animal's death on shock from a German U-boat encounter, newly analyzed records suggest a different cause. Logbooks show that as the vessel crossed the equator, water and air temperatures in the platypus's enclosure rose well above the safe threshold, indicating the animal likely died from heat stress.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly relying on the development of major theme parks to help drive its economy and boost consumer spending. The recent opening of the world's largest Legoland resort is the latest example in a rapidly growing industry, with over 4,400 attractions nationwide and a projected annual growth rate of 19%. According to the global association for the attractions industry, these parks have a significant multiplier effect, with every yuan of revenue generating nearly four yuan in the local economy. This strategy aims to create powerful economic drivers by tapping into domestic tourism.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to introduce a new criminal offence targeting individuals who use the internet to advertise or facilitate illegal immigration, such as small boat crossings over the English Channel. The proposed law could lead to prison sentences of up to five years for those creating online content that promotes services like fake passports or illegal work opportunities. Home Office analysis suggests that around 80% of migrants arriving by small boat used social media during their journey, and the new measure aims to give law enforcement more power to disrupt these criminal networks.</p>

          <p>This article revisits the "Son of Sam" killings through the eyes of two survivors, Robert Violante and Carl Denaro, nearly 50 years after David Berkowitz's reign of terror. Violante was shot on his first date with Stacy Moskowitz, who died from her injuries, leaving him permanently blinded in one eye and with damaged vision in the other. Denaro was shot months earlier and survived a severe head wound, with police initially unaware his attack was part of a serial pattern. Both men reflect on how the attacks irrevocably changed their lives and their relief upon Berkowitz's capture.</p>

          <p>The Ottawa County Sheriff's new $360,000 patrol boat sank at its dock in a Port Clinton, Ohio, marina during a severe storm, just two months after its maiden voyage. Officials believe a seiche, a rapid, storm-driven rise in water level, may have caused the boat to be pulled under, possibly compromising its dive doors. The vessel was submerged for about an hour before crews were able to pump the water out and refloat it. While the motors appear to be salvageable, the boat's interior and expensive electronic systems sustained significant damage.</p>

          <p>A global TikTok trend involving Labubu dolls has led to a flood of dangerous counterfeit versions entering the market, according to UK authorities. Trading Standards officers have seized thousands of fake dolls that pose a serious choking hazard to children, with small parts like eyes and feet easily detaching. The popularity of the dolls, which helped parent company Pop Mart's revenue soar, has created a lucrative market for criminals and resellers. Authorities warn that these fakes are often made with unsafe materials and urge consumers to be wary of suspicious pricing.</p>

          <p>Protests and counter-demonstrations held outside hotels used to house asylum seekers across England have resulted in fifteen arrests. Clashes occurred in London and Newcastle, while a large march organized by the group Britain First took place in Manchester. The protests highlight growing tensions over the UK's asylum system, with anti-migrant groups demonstrating against the use of hotels, and counter-protesters gathering in opposition. The events come as the Home Office reports a decrease in the number of hotels being used and plans to phase them out entirely by 2029.</p>

          <p>Shayna Glassman, the daughter of a man who was targeted and harassed by his upstairs neighbor David Berkowitz, has formed an unlikely relationship with the "Son of Sam" killer, visiting him regularly in prison. Her father, Craig Glassman, was a volunteer deputy sheriff who suspected Berkowitz and helped police identify him in 1977. Shayna, who was only four when her father died, says visiting Berkowitz is her way of connecting with her father's story and understanding a figure who was a major part of her family's history, despite the complex psychological implications.</p>

          <p>Rangers head coach Russell Martin publicly criticized his players' mentality, effort, and ego following a disappointing 1-1 draw against Motherwell in their opening Scottish Premiership match. Martin stated his team was "lucky to get a point" and lambasted what he called a "mentality problem," accusing some players of wanting to "do what they want to do." The harsh post-match comments, unusual for the first game of a season, have drawn significant attention and concern from pundits and fans. This marks the third consecutive season that Rangers have failed to win their opening league fixture.</p>
