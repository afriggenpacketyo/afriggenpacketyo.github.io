          <p>President Trump deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles in response to protests sparked by rumors of immigration raids at a hardware store. The deployment occurred without a request from California's Governor, Gavin Newsom, who criticized the move as inflammatory and likely to escalate tensions. While authorities stated that there was no raid at the Home Depot, protests continued, with some demonstrators clashing with law enforcement. The Department of Homeland Security said they arrested 118 illegal immigrants in the Los Angeles area this week, including five they say are gang members, prompting further unrest and debate over federal immigration policies.</p>

          <p>China's consumer prices fell for the fourth consecutive month in May, indicating persistent deflationary pressures due to weak domestic demand and trade tensions with the United States. The consumer price index (CPI) decreased by 0.1% year-on-year, although slightly better than market expectations. Price wars in the automotive industry and falling property prices are contributing to the downward pressure on consumer prices. Despite some easing of trade tensions with a preliminary deal in Geneva, markets are closely watching for further monetary easing measures from Beijing to stimulate the economy.

          <p>China has started mass production of the world's first non-binary AI chip, developed by Professor Li Hongge's team at Beihang University. This breakthrough overcomes limitations in traditional computing by merging binary and stochastic logic, enabling fault tolerance and power efficiency. The new chip technology aims to address the power and architecture walls faced by current chip technologies. The Hybrid Stochastic Number (HSN) system combines traditional binary numbers with probability-based numbers, potentially offering a more efficient alternative for intelligent control applications.</p>

          <p>Almost 350,000 nursing staff in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland will vote on a 3.6% pay increase. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has dismissed the award as "grotesque" and is balloting members on potential strike action. The vote is crucial in determining the next steps, with the RCN arguing that nursing has been undervalued and faces significant pay erosion. The outcome may cast a shadow over the government's 10-year plan for the NHS in England.</p>
