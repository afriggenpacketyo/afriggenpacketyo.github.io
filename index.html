          <p>A recent investigation revealed that Parisian cafes are overcharging foreign tourists, a practice a former waitress confirms is not surprising. Recounting her own experiences on both sides of the counter, she details common tactics like upselling, offering only expensive options, and adding false charges to bills. The article provides practical advice for travelers to avoid these "tourist taxes," such as learning key French phrases for ordering, carefully checking the bill, and being wary of deals that seem too good to be true. This guidance aims to help visitors enjoy the city's cafe culture without being exploited.</p>

          <p>A 42-year-old man allegedly stabbed 11 people in what authorities are describing as a random attack at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan. The incident occurred near the checkout area, and the suspect was apprehended by a deputy who arrived within three minutes, with assistance from citizens. All victims, comprising six males and five females, were transported to a local hospital, with six in critical condition and five in serious condition. Governor Gretchen Whitmer condemned the "brutal act of violence," and the FBI is assisting the Grand Traverse County Sheriff's Office in the ongoing investigation.</p>

          <p>Four individuals, including a married couple, have been arrested in Fort White, Florida, on charges of aggravated child abuse involving nine children aged 7 to 16. Authorities allege the children, four of whom were adopted, were kept in plywood cages under bunk beds, beaten with canes, and sprayed with vinegar as punishment. The adopted children were reportedly treated unfairly compared to the biological children and were instructed to lie about the abuse. An investigation was launched after a concerned individual at their church reported suspicions, leading to the removal of all children from the home.</p>

          <p>A senior official in China's Jilin province has called for a clearer presentation of the history of ancient kingdoms that existed in the region, referring to them by their Chinese names. This has raised concerns about reigniting a long-standing historical dispute with South Korea, which knows the kingdoms of Fuyu, Gaogouli, and Bohai by their Korean names: Buyeo, Goguryeo, and Balhae. The issue revolves around the contested historical and cultural ownership of these kingdoms, which arose in what is now northeastern China and the Korean peninsula. The official's comments link this history to China's "century of humiliation," potentially framing the narrative in a nationalistic context.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government is increasingly suppressing information about mass casualty events, such as recent incidents where drivers have struck pedestrians, including children. Authorities often issue brief, vague statements and scrub photos and detailed reports from the internet, a practice that has intensified since a particularly deadly attack in November. This information control, aimed at preventing unrest and potential copycat crimes, has led to public frustration and online complaints from citizens demanding more transparency. Some critics warn that this lack of disclosure could undermine the government's credibility and rules of information disclosure.</p>

          <p>Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have announced the formation of a rival civilian-led government, a move that threatens to permanently fracture the war-torn nation. The new administration, with RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo as president, directly challenges the internationally recognized army-led government and stokes fears of escalating the 27-month civil war. This development follows a February agreement among paramilitary and rebel groups aiming to establish a secular "New Sudan." The UN has warned that this action risks further fragmenting the country, which is already suffering from mass displacement and a severe humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>Ashley Benefield, a former ballerina, was found guilty of manslaughter for the 2020 shooting death of her estranged husband, Doug Benefield. The prosecution argued she killed him to ensure she would win a bitter custody battle over their daughter, while the defense claimed she acted in self-defense after years of alleged abuse. The trial featured testimony about their turbulent relationship, which began with a whirlwind marriage and included accusations of poisoning, violence, and constant legal disputes. Although acquitted of second-degree murder, the jury's manslaughter verdict rejected her self-defense claim, and she now faces up to 30 years in prison.</p>

Following the calls, both countries expressed gratitude for his efforts, with Cambodia agreeing to the ceasefire and Thailand emphasizing the need for dialogue first. The clashes, which have killed at least 33 people and displaced thousands, stem from a century-old border dispute. Trump linked the cessation of hostilities to the resumption of trade talks, as significant U.S. tariffs on both countries are set to take effect soon, adding economic pressure to his diplomatic push for peace.</p>

The investigation highlights how the church's founder, Noel Stanton, and its leadership covered up the abuse for decades.

          <p>While President Trump visited his golf course in Turnberry, Scotland, for a round of golf, hundreds of protesters gathered in cities like Edinburgh and Aberdeen to demonstrate against his visit. The protests, organized by a coalition of groups, criticized both Trump and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government. Demonstrators held signs with messages like "No red carpet for dictators" and voiced their opposition to the president's politics. Despite the protests, Trump's visit is scheduled to include meetings with Starmer and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to discuss trade, alongside visiting his other Scottish golf course.</p>

          <h2>Guess Advertisement in Vogue Featuring AI-Generated Model Sparks Debate</h2>

          <p>An advertisement for the brand Guess in the August issue of Vogue has generated controversy by featuring a supermodel created entirely with artificial intelligence. While the ad discloses the model's AI origin in small print, its inclusion in the iconic fashion magazine has raised concerns about the future of human models and the promotion of unrealistic beauty standards. Critics argue the move undermines years of progress toward diversity and inclusivity in the fashion industry. The company behind the AI model defends its work as a new marketing choice, but the incident has intensified the debate over AI's impact on creative industries and body image.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Attempt to Recreate Zhang Heng's Ancient Earthquake Detector</h2>

          <p>A research team in China is working to reconstruct the "Houfeng Didong Yi," a legendary seismoscope invented nearly 2,000 years ago by the polymath Zhang Heng. Historical texts describe the ornate device as an urn-like instrument with dragons and toads that could detect distant earthquakes and indicate their direction, an achievement described as being "as accurate as the gods." Despite its historical fame, the device's existence has been questioned by some scholars, leading to its removal from school curricula in 2017. The new project, supported by modern science and new clues, aims to restore this lost wonder of ancient technology.</p>

          <h2>New Research Links Nanoplastics to Long-Term Health Issues, Finds Particles in Human Brains</h2>

          <p>Emerging scientific research is highlighting the potential long-term health dangers of nanoplastics, with one University of New Mexico lab finding these microscopic particles in human brain tissue for the first time. Scientists believe the particles, which break down from discarded plastic products, enter our bodies through food, water, and air. A recent study linked living near nanoplastic-polluted oceans to higher rates of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Long-term clinical studies are now underway to track the impact on children, with preliminary research already linking plastic exposure to hormonal issues and cardiovascular disease.</p>
