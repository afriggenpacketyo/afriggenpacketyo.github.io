          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and Palestinian rights activist, arrived in New Jersey after being released from ICE detention in Louisiana, following a federal judge's order. Khalil, a green card holder, had been in ICE custody for over 100 days due to the Trump administration's efforts to deport him for his involvement in campus protests against Israel, though he has not been charged with any crimes. Judge Michael Fabiarz ruled that Khalil was not a threat or flight risk, deeming his detention an attempt to punish him for his anti-Israel speech, a violation of his First Amendment rights. Khalil's arrest sparked protests and discussions about free speech, with other activists also being detained and later released. </p>

          <p>Senator Jack Reed criticized President Trump's dismissal of his intelligence chief, suggesting it was politically motivated due to differing assessments on Iran's nuclear capabilities. Reed highlighted that Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard testified that the intelligence community believes Iran is not building a nuclear weapon, contradicting Trump's stance. Reed suggested Trump's rejection of the intelligence community's conclusions may be linked to contemplating an attack on Iran, requiring a belief that Iran has the capacity and intent to develop nuclear weapons quickly. Reed stated that if Gabbard made a false statement in her testimony, she would be obligated to correct the record immediately. </p>

A federal judge ordered his release, finding no evidence he was a flight risk or danger to the public, and ruling that detaining someone over a civil immigration matter was unconstitutional.

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from making significant cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation. Judge Indira Talwani struck down a policy change that would have stripped universities of millions of dollars in research funding, arguing that the move was arbitrary and contrary to law. The policy change capped indirect costs for future NSF awards to universities at 15% of direct research costs. The University of California estimated the change would cost it nearly $100 million annually. </p>

          <p>Pakistan plans to nominate Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, citing his role in negotiating a ceasefire between India and Pakistan. The Pakistani government stated that Trump demonstrated strategic foresight through diplomatic engagement with both Islamabad and New Delhi. Trump has repeatedly claimed that the US brokered the ceasefire, a claim denied by India. The move has drawn mixed reactions, with some applauding it as a way to pander to Trump's ego and others criticizing it as compromising national dignity, given his support for Israel.</p>

          <p>A U.S. government watchdog found “rampant abuse” of work-from-home policies by federal workers during the Biden administration, citing “compliance failures and weak internal oversight.” The report, based on a sample of badging data, timesheets, and remote-work agreements, found that 58.1% of employees failed to meet in-office requirements in 2024. The Inspector General of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) found that nearly 30% of telework agreements had lapsed, with discrepancies found in paperwork. Under President Trump's direction, OPM has restored in-person operations.</p>

This discrepancy could stem from a lack of resources for precise data collection in rural areas.
