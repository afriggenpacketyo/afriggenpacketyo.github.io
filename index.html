          <h2>Trump Softens Tone Towards Canada During Meeting with Prime Minister Carney</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 21:12:47 EDT</div>

          <p>President Trump adopted a surprisingly amiable tone during his meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, despite previously criticizing Canada. Trump expressed his affection for Canada, citing personal connections and downplaying earlier rhetoric about potentially incorporating Canada as the 51st state. Carney, however, firmly asserted Canada's independence and rejected any suggestion of a merger, emphasizing the importance of the partnership between the two countries. The meeting covered various topics, including trade and global issues, but tensions remained evident beneath the surface, particularly regarding tariffs and border policies.</p>

          <p>The Met Gala appearances of Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan and artist Diljit Dosanjh, marked their debut at the iconic fashion event, which led to disappointment among some South Asian fans who felt the stars did not receive adequate recognition. During an interview with Khan, Vogue's livestream hosts seemed unaware of his global fame, prompting criticism online. Diljit Dosanjh's culturally significant outfit was briefly shown on the livestream before the camera quickly panned away, which further fueled criticism. Vogue representatives stated that it was not intentional to cut away from Diljit so quickly.</p>

          <p>Kent International, a U.S. bicycle company, is halting imports from China due to tariffs implemented by the Trump administration.

The company has canceled new orders from China and has no plans to place new orders in May. The company feels the tariffs are unfair and is not financially feasible to fully manufacture and assemble their bikes in the U.S.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China, a leading aluminium producer and consumer, relies heavily on imported bauxite due to the low quality of its domestic ore. However, French technology developed by Yves Ocello of IB2 offers a solution by transforming low-grade bauxite into high-quality material suitable for aluminium production. This technology neutralizes silica and sulphur, enabling the use of the Bayer process for refining high-silica bauxite. IB2 has signed a 22-year agreement with Chinese firm Liulin Senze Coal & Aluminum to implement this technology, potentially reducing China's dependence on imported aluminium ore.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that three hostages held by Hamas in Gaza have died, leaving 21 believed to be still living. Trump's comments came as Israel approved plans to seize the Gaza Strip. One American, Edan Alexander, has been among the 24 hostages believed to be alive, with the bodies of several other Americans also held by Hamas after its Oct. 7, 2023, assault on Israel. If implemented, the move would vastly expand Israel's operations there and have already drawn fierce international opposition.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly terror attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, India conducted strikes on Pakistan. India stated the strikes targeted ‚Äúterrorist infrastructure sites‚Äù and were ‚Äúfocused, measured, and nonescalatory in nature‚Äù.

Pakistan denies involvement in the Kashmir attack. The roots of the Kashmir conflict trace back to the 1947 partition of British India.</p>
