          <p>United Airlines issued a ground stop for its flights at multiple major U.S. airports, including Chicago, Denver, and San Francisco, due to a significant technology issue. The airline confirmed the outage was causing widespread departure holds to manage gate availability, leading to hundreds of delays. While flights already in the air were permitted to continue to their destinations and regional United Express flights were not directly grounded, the system failure created significant operational backlogs. The duration of the disruption and the full extent of its impact on travelers were not immediately known as the airline worked to resolve the problem.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced the termination of approximately $500 million in federal funding for 22 mRNA vaccine development projects. Kennedy justified the decision by stating that HHS has determined the technology "poses more risk than benefits for these respiratory viruses," a claim strongly contested by numerous public health experts. Former Surgeon General Jerome Adams and other leading scientists condemned the move, arguing it will cost lives and cede technological advantages to other nations. The decision halts research into vaccines for COVID-19, flu, and other diseases, shifting funds to what Kennedy described as "safer, broader vaccine platforms."</p>

          <p>An analysis by the charity Rethink Mental Illness has exposed a significant and growing gap in NHS wait times, with patients seeking mental health treatment being 12 times more likely to wait over 18 months than those needing physical care. The article highlights the story of a young woman with complex PTSD who has only seen a psychiatrist once in ten years despite multiple crises. Experts warn that these long delays worsen patient outcomes, increase treatment costs, and have severe economic consequences. While a new walk-in mental health hub in London offers a promising model, such comprehensive care remains inaccessible for thousands across the country.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a plan to impose a 100% tariff on foreign-made computer chips and semiconductors, a move likely to increase the cost of numerous consumer goods. The policy, discussed during a meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook, would exempt companies that manufacture chips within the United States. This strategy represents a significant shift from the previous administration's approach, which used subsidies and tax credits from the CHIPS Act to incentivize domestic production. The administration is betting that the punitive tariffs will compel companies to onshore their manufacturing, despite risks of higher prices for consumers and squeezed corporate profits.

          <p>Following pressure from the Trump administration regarding tariffs, Apple has committed to investing an additional $100 billion in its U.S. manufacturing and supply chain over the next four years. This brings the company's total domestic investment pledge to $600 billion. The announcement was made at the White House, where President Trump praised the move as a step toward ensuring iPhones sold in America are also made in America. CEO Tim Cook stated the investment will support U.S. companies that produce components for Apple products, though final assembly of devices like the iPhone is expected to remain overseas for now.

The most high-risk treatments, like non-surgical Brazilian butt lifts (BBLs), will be restricted to qualified health professionals only. The move, which follows growing concern over injuries and even deaths from unregulated procedures, has been welcomed by industry safety advocates, though it may take several years to fully implement.</p>

Economists note that the 21-day window before the new tariffs take effect could provide time for a resolution.

          <h2>Trump Threatens to Federalize Washington D.C. Police After Assault on Former Aide</h2>

          <p>Following an attempted carjacking of a former administration staffer, President Trump stated he is considering federalizing the Washington, D.C. police force and potentially overturning the city's home rule. Trump described crime in the nation's capital as "totally out of control" and said his lawyers were studying the legality of revoking the limited self-government the district has had for 50 years. While the president has some authority over the D.C. National Guard, fully repealing home rule would require an act of Congress. Critics suggest the move is a political opportunity to assert federal power over the overwhelmingly Democratic city.</p>

          <p>The father of Lee Claydon, the 45-year-old man who died after falling from an upper tier at an Oasis concert at Wembley Stadium, has described his son as a "hardworking family man." Clive Claydon stated that his son, a lifelong fan of the band, attended the show with his brother and was not a drug user, calling the incident a tragic accident. He also echoed concerns from other attendees about safety at the venue, questioning the adequacy of the barriers and noting that slippery conditions from spilled beer were present. The band expressed its condolences, stating it was "shocked and saddened" by the death.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeologists have found new evidence indicating that some people returned to live in Pompeii after its catastrophic destruction by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. Research suggests that survivors who could not afford to relocate, possibly joined by others, established a precarious settlement among the ruins. These inhabitants are thought to have lived in the upper floors of buried homes, using the lower levels as cellars and salvaging valuable materials from the devastated city. This informal reoccupation, which lacked the infrastructure of a Roman city, may have continued until the 5th century, adding a new chapter to the site's history.</p>

          <p>Brian Robbins, the co-chief executive of Paramount Global and head of its film studio, has stepped down from his position. The move was anticipated and comes just a day before David Ellison's Skydance Media is set to finalize its $8.4 billion takeover of the entertainment giant. Robbins, who has led Paramount Pictures since 2021, was part of a three-person "office of the CEO" formed after the ouster of the previous chief executive. Skydance has already announced its new leadership team for the studio, with longtime Ellison lieutenant Dana Goldberg and former Sony executive Josh Greenstein set to take over as co-chairs.</p>

          <p>Following a visit to Moscow by his special envoy, President Donald Trump has indicated there is a "good chance" of a meeting between himself, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The White House confirmed that Russia had expressed a desire for a meeting and that Trump is open to it. The potential diplomatic development comes just days before a deadline set by Trump for Russia to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine or face new sanctions. While Trump described the envoy's talks in Moscow as "highly productive," expectations for a breakthrough remain muted as Russia's large-scale attacks on Ukraine have continued.</p>

          <p>Amid escalating tech and trade tensions with the United States, China is utilizing its control over the global supply of rare earths as a strategic advantage. After the U.S. imposed tariffs and export bans to slow Chinese AI development, Beijing retaliated with export controls on several rare earth elements and magnets. These materials are critical for a vast range of technologies, from consumer electronics and electric vehicles to advanced defense systems. With China controlling most of the world's refining capacity and supplying 70% of U.S. rare earth imports, its dominance in this sector gives it significant leverage. (not investment advice)</p>

The USACE confirmed it received a request from the Secret Service to temporarily alter the water flow from Caesar Creek Lake to "support safe navigation" for the security detail on the Little Miami River. The action has raised ethical questions about the use of public infrastructure for a private recreational activity, particularly as the administration has implemented widespread budget cuts to other government services, including the National Park Service.</p>
