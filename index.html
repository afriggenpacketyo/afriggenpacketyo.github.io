          <p>Israel conducted strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and military commanders, leading to a declared state of emergency in Israel and retaliatory drone strikes from Iran. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that the strikes, named Operation Rising Lion, aimed to eliminate Iran's nuclear threat, with targets including nuclear fuel and weapon assembly sites, as well as key military personnel. Iran has vowed a "heavy price" for the attacks, while the United States has denied involvement, emphasizing the protection of American forces in the region. International reactions have been alarmed by the escalation, fearing further destabilization in the already volatile region. Optimism is not high.</p>

          <p>For the fourth consecutive night, Northern Ireland experienced disorder, with masonry thrown at police in Portadown, although at a lower level than previous nights. The unrest began after a peaceful protest concerning an alleged sexual assault in Ballymena, leading to injuries to 41 officers and 15 arrests. Simultaneously, an anti-racism protest took place in west Belfast, while police maintained a presence in Ballymena to prevent further violence. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Chief Constable described the violence as "racist" and stated that families hid in attics during the disturbances, which has left many newcomer families in the town feeling fearful.</p>

Iwaya expressed that it was "extremely regrettable" that Israel took military action despite ongoing talks between Washington and Tehran, urging both countries to exercise "utmost restraint." Japan has also instructed airlines to inspect Boeing 787s after the fatal crash of an Air India 787-8. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to reciprocal tariffs imposed by the United States on imports from China, Beijing has taken steps to assist Chinese exporters in shifting their focus to the domestic market. One strategy involves encouraging the increased use of letters of credit (L/Cs) to ensure payment security and enhance credit for firms transitioning to domestic sales. Domestic L/Cs, issued by major Chinese banks, function similarly to international L/Cs, guaranteeing payment for goods and services within a one-year period. Unlike international L/Cs, domestic L/Cs can be used for both physical goods and services transactions, providing flexibility for Chinese businesses adapting to the trade war.</p>

          <p>The Mechanical Engineering Industry Association (VDMA) in Germany is urging the EU to implement trade barriers to protect the industry from increasingly strong Chinese competitors. This marks a reversal for the industry, which previously lauded the Sino-German economic relationship. The VDMA argues that Chinese companies are heavily subsidized by their government and sometimes disregard technical regulations, creating an uneven playing field. The industry group is calling for countervailing duties on imports from third countries that violate EU anti-dumping or anti-subsidy rules, with a particular focus on China's aggressive export policies.

Despite the initial market downturn, analysts expect Asian markets to recover quickly due to limited exposure to the conflict and growing ties with unaffected Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

          <p>Israel launched a sweeping attack on Iran, targeting nuclear facilities and key military personnel, claiming it was a preemptive strike to eliminate the Iranian nuclear program. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that Israel would continue attacking for as many days as it takes, with the catalog of damage still emerging. The decision to strike now stems from Israel's belief that Iran was in a late-stage rush to assemble nuclear weapons, a claim that is nearly unverifiable. This action represents a shift in Israel's strategy, as it had previously tolerated Iran's regional influence, but now seeks to eliminate what it perceives as an existential threat.</p>

          <p>Japan's Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya stated that Japan "condemns" Israel's attack on Iran as "escalating the situation," and has pledged diplomatic efforts to prevent further deterioration.

          <p>According to an expert at the World Gold Council, cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and stablecoins, do not pose a threat to gold's role as a safe-haven investment. John Reade, the senior market strategist, asserts that long-term demand for gold remains strong due to concerns over US dollar assets, geopolitical tensions, and the economic impact of tariffs. He argues that cryptocurrencies move in tandem with equities, unlike gold, which acts as a hedge during market volatility. Reade dismisses the notion of digital assets as "gold 2.0," emphasizing their distinct characteristics and lack of comparison to gold. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has put a hold on Gavin Newsomâ€™s renewed control of the California National Guard, reversing a previous ruling that would have returned control of the Guard to the governor. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has scheduled a June 17 Zoom hearing on the matter. A federal judge had previously ordered Donald Trump to "return control of the California National Guard to the Governor of the State of California forthwith," after Newsom filed suit against Trump, Defense Sec. Pete Hegseth and others in the administration, arguing that the president overstepped his authority when he dispatched National Guard troops to the region to respond to protests of ICE immigration raids.</p>

          <p>Israel launched a broad attack on Iran, characterized as an attempt to "settle all family business," which has been described by the Israeli government as a "preemptive" strike. However, this action more closely resembles a preventive war, aimed at removing the source of a threat on Israel's own terms. While preemptive attacks are considered legitimate in international law, preventive attacks are generally viewed as illegal and immoral. The justification for this action rests on the claim that Iran's nuclear program poses an imminent threat to Israel, necessitating immediate action.</p>
