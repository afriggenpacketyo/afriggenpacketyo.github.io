          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has indicated that the August 12 deadline for a new trade deal with China is likely to be extended. He expressed optimism about the state of trade relations, stating that he anticipates working out the extension during upcoming talks in Stockholm. Bessent also hopes to broaden the discussions to include China's manufacturing output, its purchases of sanctioned oil, and its role in the Ukraine war. The current 90-day tariff suspension followed a period of escalating trade tensions where both nations imposed steep import duties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett has publicly refuted reports that Berkshire Hathaway's railroad, BNSF, was collaborating with Goldman Sachs on a potential takeover of a rival railway. The billionaire investor stated that neither he nor his successor, Greg Abel, had been in contact with any bankers from Goldman Sachs regarding a deal. Buffett, known for his skepticism towards investment bankers, dismissed the claims which had been reported by Semafor and Reuters. The initial reports suggested BNSF was exploring a bid after competitor Union Pacific showed interest in acquiring Norfolk Southern.</p>

According to official data, over 77% of the nation's sewer and septic workers are from the Dalit community. Activists argue that government initiatives like the NAMASTE scheme, intended to promote mechanized cleaning, fail to address the deep-rooted social discrimination that prevents Dalits from accessing other employment opportunities.

          <p>Recent corporate earnings reports from Europe's leading automakers are revealing the significant financial impact of the 25% U.S. tariffs on imported vehicles and parts.

Similarly, Sweden's Volvo Cars, considered highly exposed, reported a sharp decline in its second-quarter operating profit. In response, automakers are adjusting their production strategies, such as Volvo's plan to add manufacturing of its popular XC60 SUV to its U.S. plant. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite recent trade-related challenges, such as tariffs on aluminum, the company's shares have risen 13% this year.
