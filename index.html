          <p>One year after a catastrophic garbage landslide in Kampala, Uganda, which killed 34 people and left over 220 homeless, residents continue to live in precarious conditions. The Kiteezi landfill, the site of the disaster, is now officially closed, with Japanese funding helping to secure the area. However, the city's new waste disposal site in a forest reserve has sparked legal and environmental controversy. Victims of the initial landslide are still awaiting promised government compensation to relocate to safer areas, highlighting the ongoing challenges in waste management and disaster response.</p>

          <p>A DeKalb County police officer and a suspect have died following a shooting incident near the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Emory University in Atlanta. The officer was fatally shot while responding to reports of an active shooter, who was later found deceased from a potentially self-inflicted gunshot wound. The event prompted lockdowns and a shelter-in-place order, and while no civilians were shot, several rounds struck the CDC building. Four other individuals were hospitalized for stress and anxiety-related reasons following the violent confrontation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has reformed its civil service summer internship program, restricting applications to individuals from lower socio-economic backgrounds to enhance diversity. The move has been met with mixed reactions from students aspiring to work in public service. While some, like first-generation university student Adam Allen, feel the change gives them a fairer opportunity, others feel unfairly excluded. Students like Nell Ashworth, whose parents are a nurse and a town planner, argue the new criteria are too narrow and could dissuade talented individuals from middle-income, working-class families from pursuing government careers.</p>

          <p>Scientists in China have successfully created high-purity hexagonal diamonds in a laboratory, a significant breakthrough detailed in the journal Nature. This type of diamond, first discovered in a meteorite in 1967, has a unique atomic structure that researchers have long struggled to replicate. The Chinese team produced pure hexagonal diamond crystals up to 100 micrometres in size, a notable achievement compared to previous attempts that yielded mixed-phase samples. This success provides definitive proof of the material's macroscopic existence and opens new avenues for materials science research.</p>

          <p>China's consumer price index (CPI) showed no year-on-year change in July, indicating persistent weak demand within the world's second-largest economy. This flat reading, which followed a minor 0.1% rise in June, beat market expectations of a slight decline. While consumer goods prices fell, service prices saw a modest increase, but the data, coupled with ongoing producer deflation, suggests that economic pressures and trade turbulence continue to impact domestic consumption.

          <p>A consumer trend dubbed "treatonomics" is reportedly booming as people seek small morale boosts amid ongoing economic uncertainty. This phenomenon expands on the classic "lipstick effect," where consumers purchase small luxuries like makeup when larger purchases are unaffordable.

Analysts suggest this trend is driven by a re-evaluation of personal well-being and the unattainability of traditional life milestones like home ownership for younger generations, who instead celebrate smaller moments.</p>

          <p>A man from Fremont, California, has been federally charged with stealing rare Chinese manuscripts valued at over $216,000 from the UCLA library. Jeffrey Ying allegedly used multiple fake names and a newly implemented library system to check out valuable antique books, some dating to the 13th century. He would then allegedly return worthless "dummy books" with copied labels in their place. An FBI investigation uncovered the scheme after Ying's travel records showed trips to China following the thefts, and he was arrested while attempting to check out more books before a flight.</p>

          <p>Actress Gina Carano and Disney have settled a lawsuit regarding her 2021 firing from the series "The Mandalorian" over her controversial social media posts. While settlement details are private, a Lucasfilm statement praised Carano's professionalism and expressed hope for future collaboration. The article argues that while politically motivated corporate actions are a concern, this settlement was the right decision, correcting what it calls an overreaction by Disney. It suggests her firing was an extreme response to posts that, while provocative, were less toxic than much social media content.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom hosted Democratic lawmakers from Texas who fled their state to block a Republican-led redistricting plan. Newsom announced that California is prepared to respond with its own gerrymandered map to neutralize any GOP gains, stating, "we will nullify what happens in Texas." This counter-plan would involve a special election in November for California voters to approve new congressional districts favoring Democrats, but it would only be triggered if Texas proceeds with its changes. The move highlights an escalating national political battle over congressional seats ahead of the 2026 midterms.</p>

          <p>According to BTIG's chief market technician, the stock market has signaled a potential 5% pullback after the S&P 500 broke through a key technical resistance level. The strategist suggests the index could fall to the 6,100 mark, which previously acted as a price ceiling, before presenting a new buying opportunity. The analysis points to several warning signs, including weakness in consumer-focused stocks, potential underperformance by semiconductors, and the possibility of widening credit spreads.

Slater ruptured his patellar tendon and will require surgery, an injury Coach Jim Harbaugh described as a "gut punch." Slater's absence disrupts what was considered one of the NFL's best offensive tackle duos and forces the team to reshuffle its offensive line. Veteran Trey Pipkins III is expected to step into a starting role, and the team plans to explore the free-agent market to add depth.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has noted a significant increase in complaints about models appearing "unhealthily thin" in fashion advertisements. Recent rulings have banned ads from major retailers like Zara, Next, and M&S, not for the models' actual health, but because posing, lighting, and styling made them appear dangerously thin. This has led industry experts to warn of a potential return to the "heroin chic" aesthetic of the 1990s, pushing back against the recent body positivity movement. The ASA is closely monitoring the trend and cracking down on harmful body image portrayals.</p>

Trump suggested a deal is close and would involve a "swapping of territories," a condition Ukraine has repeatedly rejected. The Kremlin confirmed the summit, calling the location "quite logical." The announcement follows reports that Putin indicated a willingness to halt the war if Kyiv withdraws from the Donbass region, effectively ceding occupied territories to Russia, a proposal met with skepticism by European officials.</p>

This personal relationship is seen by analysts as potentially valuable for UK-U.S. relations, especially given the personalized nature of the Trump administration's foreign policy.</p>
