          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-13 13:04:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The consumer price index (CPI) for April 2025 showed a decrease in inflation, with a 2.3% increase over the past 12 months, the smallest since February 2021, primarily driven by lower prices for groceries and gasoline. Economists, however, warn that tariffs imposed by President Trump could reignite inflation, potentially impacting the May CPI report. Current tariff policies could cost the average U.S. household an additional $2,800 in the short term, with a 10% average tariff potentially adding 1 percentage point to the CPI within six to nine months. Some economists suggest early signs of tariff effects, such as increases in audio and photographic equipment prices, were already visible in the April report. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dr. David Kessler, former FDA commissioner, cautions about the lack of long-term data and strategies for discontinuing the use of weight loss drugs, such as GLP-1s, which condition the brain to want less food by inducing nausea and delaying stomach emptying. Kessler, who personally used these drugs, emphasizes that they are not miracle pills and require a comprehensive approach including diet and exercise. He also voices concerns about the potential for drug companies to encourage lifelong use and the limited accessibility of comprehensive care, including doctors and nutritionists, needed for safe and effective weight management. Kessler's new book explores the science behind achieving a healthy weight.</p>

Schumer described the move as corrupt and a national security threat, demanding Attorney General Pam Bondi testify before Congress to explain why the gift doesn't violate the Emoluments Clause. This action slows down the confirmation process, although Republicans hold a majority in the Senate.

          <p>Robyn Denholm, Tesla's board chair, has sold $198 million in Tesla stock over the past six months, raising questions about her confidence in the company's future. This New York Times article notes the sales occurred as Elon Musk, Tesla's CEO, took on a significant role in the Trump administration, dividing his attention. Tesla's quarterly profit has fallen to a four-year low, and car sales have declined partly due to consumer backlash over Musk's political activities. Denholm's spokesperson defends the stock sales, stating that Tesla directors are paid in a manner aligned with shareholder interests, and the value of director's options has increased due to Tesla's outperformance.</p>

The Trump administration refuses to facilitate his return, despite a Supreme Court order. The article argues that everyone in America has due-process rights, and the administration's refusal to bring him back for trial or legal removal raises questions about the evidence against him. The author asserts that the administration is not interested in the guilt or innocence of the men it is condemning to a Gulag in El Salvador. Rather, men like Abrego Garcia are seen by the administration as part of a class of people whose collective guilt as a population renders them subject to any abuse imaginable.</p>

          <p>Amani Golugwa, Deputy Secretary General of Tanzania's main opposition party CHADEMA, was arrested at Julius Nyerere International Airport while attempting to travel to a democracy conference in Brussels. Police confirmed the arrest, alleging Golugwa has a trend of leaving and returning to the country without following legal procedures. This arrest is the latest to target the opposition party in Tanzania, which is gearing up for elections in October. Human rights groups accuse the government of repressing the opposition, with CHADEMA chairman Tundu Lissu also arrested and charged with treason.</p>

Counter-terrorism police are leading the inquiry and treating the fires as suspicious.

          <p>A New York Times and Illinois Answers Project investigation reveals that many Illinois cities use "crime-free" housing laws to evict families for minor offenses, even without convictions. The laws, intended to target serious criminals, have been used to evict tenants for shoplifting, driving while intoxicated, and even calling 911 too often. Enforcement disproportionately affects low-income residents and people of color. A bill in the Illinois State Senate aims to limit evictions under these laws for those not convicted of a crime.</p>
