          <p>India's Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has maintained its policy rate at 5.5%, aligning with economic forecasts, as it thoroughly assesses the impact of earlier rate cuts. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra noted significant inflation moderation but cautioned about potential growth deceleration in the latter half of the fiscal year due to global trade uncertainties and US tariffs. The unanimous decision reflects a patient approach to future policy adjustments, especially considering a recent goods and services tax cut and unfolding trade-related challenges. This article suggests the RBI aims to allow previous monetary and fiscal measures to take full effect before further action. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt, in collaboration with ICE and the Oklahoma Highway Patrol, initiated "Operation Guardian," resulting in the apprehension of 120 undocumented immigrants, many found driving commercial vehicles with invalid licenses. Stitt criticized federal border policies, asserting the operation aims to expedite deportation for undocumented offenders, who reportedly cost the state significantly and are linked to various crimes. The plan expands ICE agreements and introduces a Rapid REPAT program to streamline deportation proceedings, emphasizing public safety and state-led law enforcement. This initiative underscores a proactive stance against perceived federal neglect in border enforcement.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer aims to modify the interpretation of international law, specifically Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, to prevent unsuccessful asylum seekers from blocking deportation. Such individuals currently claim protection based on potential inferior prison or healthcare conditions abroad. While emphasizing continued asylum for those genuinely fleeing persecution, Starmer argues existing laws must adapt to unprecedented mass migration challenges. This initiative follows the Home Secretary's plans to tighten rules for indefinite leave to remain, signaling a broader government push to reform immigration and deportation processes.</p>

          <p>European leaders are convening in Copenhagen for a high-security summit to address increasing Russian incursions into EU airspace and recent drone disruptions at Danish airports. Ten member states are actively supporting a "drone wall" initiative for rapid detection and neutralization of Russian drones, with Denmark implementing a civilian drone flight ban and stringent traffic restrictions. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz explicitly named Russia as a permanent threat, despite Kremlin denials.

          <p>AstraZeneca's decision to list American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) on Wall Street, though not a full delisting, has reignited concerns about major companies moving away from the London Stock Exchange (LSE). While AstraZeneca maintains its UK listing and headquarters, the move aims to attract a broader global investor base and access larger US capital pools, which are perceived as more dynamic. This follows a trend of other significant companies, like BHP Group and Flutter Entertainment, shifting primary listings or expanding presence in the US, often citing North American market dominance or cost-saving measures.

          <p>Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair is reportedly poised to join a committee led by Donald Trump to oversee Gaza, potentially marking his controversial return to Middle East diplomacy after a largely unsuccessful previous tenure. This prospect has generated widespread disbelief among Palestinian politicians and many within his own Labour Party, largely due to his contentious support for the 2003 Iraq invasion. Supporters, however, argue Blair's established trust among the US, Israelis, and Gulf states, alongside his Northern Ireland peace efforts, could make him a unique asset. Hamas has explicitly rejected any role for Blair, highlighting deep-seated suspicions regarding his perceived bias and past actions.</p>

This public health measure, previously delayed due to the cost-of-living crisis, aims to tackle rising obesity rates, particularly among children, with over a quarter of adults and a fifth of primary school children now classified as obese. Public health officials strongly support the move as a crucial initial step, arguing such promotions encourage overspending and impulsive, unhealthy purchases.

          <p>Despite the U.S. government shutdown, individuals with student loans are still required to make repayments, as these programs are funded through mandatory spending. However, borrowers seeking assistance from the Education Department may face delays, as most of its employees, including those in the Office of Federal Student Aid, are expected to be furloughed. The article notes that federal aid, such as Pell Grants and Direct Student Loans, will continue to be disbursed, and FAFSA applications will still be processed. However, new grants and the review of loan forgiveness applications could be impacted if the shutdown persists, creating uncertainty for some. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of young Americans are increasingly choosing blue-collar careers, such as electricians and plumbers, over traditional white-collar paths, driven by concerns about crippling student loan debt and the perceived threat of AI to entry-level college graduate jobs. Jacob Palmer, a 23-year-old running his own electrical company, exemplifies this trend, finding independence and financial success without a college degree. Surveys indicate that over 57% of Gen Zers worry about student loan debt, and 77% prioritize jobs resistant to automation. The article highlights a societal shift where skilled trades are gaining prestige and offering more secure career paths compared to some AI-vulnerable white-collar roles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A short U.S. government shutdown is unlikely to significantly impact air travel, as most Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration employees are deemed essential and must work without pay. However, a prolonged shutdown could lead to severe disruptions if these employees, facing financial pressure, call in sick or seek other jobs, potentially causing labor shortages and longer airport security lines. The U.S. Travel Association warns of a $1 billion weekly economic cost and exacerbated staffing issues for air traffic controllers, who are already in short supply. The article suggests that while immediate impacts are minimal, a lengthy impasse poses a significant threat to travel stability and industry operations.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown marks the latest in a series of funding lapses since 1980, driven by persistent political disagreements over spending and policy priorities. Historically, these shutdowns, which became more common after legal opinions in the early 1980s prohibited agencies from operating without funding, have varied in duration, from one day to 34 days. Presidents like Reagan and Clinton oversaw multiple shutdowns, often stemming from clashes over budget cuts or specific legislative priorities. The article provides a historical overview, noting that recent shutdowns, like the 2018-2019 instance, have resulted in billions in permanent economic losses and widespread impacts on federal workers and services.</p>

          <p>During a U.S. government shutdown, members of Congress continue to receive their salaries, a provision protected by the Constitution and permanent appropriations, ensuring their financial stability. This contrasts sharply with hundreds of thousands of federal employees, who face delayed paychecks or potential layoffs, regardless of whether their positions are deemed essential. While essential federal workers must report to duty without immediate compensation, and furloughed employees are guaranteed back pay by a 2019 law, contractors are not. The article highlights the stark disparity in financial security between lawmakers and the federal workforce during funding lapses, drawing attention to a contentious aspect of shutdowns.</p>

          <p>Despite the U.S. government shutdown, 74 million Social Security recipients will continue to receive their monthly checks, as these benefits are funded through mandatory spending, ensuring core stability. However, the Social Security Administration's (SSA) operational budget requires congressional approval, meaning some customer services, like benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and Medicare card replacements, may be temporarily halted. The SSA's contingency plan indicates nearly 90% of its workforce will remain on the job, prioritizing accurate and timely benefit payments. The article also notes a potential delay in the annual cost-of-living adjustment announcement if Labor Department data releases are affected.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government has shut down after lawmakers failed to agree on extending funding, stemming from a stalemate over health care tax credits and broader spending priorities. This impasse, where Democrats insisted on health care provisions and Republicans refused, led to the expiration of spending authority. As a result, hundreds of thousands of federal workers face furloughs or delayed pay, with essential employees continuing to work without immediate compensation. The article explains that shutdowns occur when Congress fails to pass appropriations bills, highlighting the significant economic and political costs, including billions in permanent losses from previous funding lapses.</p>
