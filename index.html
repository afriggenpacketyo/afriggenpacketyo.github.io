          <p>Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez are celebrating their wedding in Venice, Italy, with a three-day event estimated to cost between $64 million and $76 million. The wedding is expected to draw about 200 guests, including celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio, Kim Kardashian, and Ivanka Trump. However, the event has sparked protests from local residents and Greenpeace, who criticize the city for catering to wealthy tourists while neglecting the needs of its residents, highlighting concerns about rising housing costs and the impact of tourism. Despite the criticism, Venetian officials have defended the event, stating that it will not significantly disrupt daily life. The couple's wedding preparations and the local reactions showcase the complex dynamics between tourism, wealth, and community needs in Venice. Optimism for the city's ability to balance these concerns remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Siarhei Tsikhanouski, a Belarusian dissident recently released after five years in prison, spoke out against the Lukashenko regime, detailing the harsh conditions he and other political prisoners faced. Tsikhanouski described being denied access to lawyers, priests, and basic necessities, stating that political prisoners were treated worse than murderers. He also urged Donald Trump to help free the remaining 1,100 political prisoners in Belarus, emphasizing the need to continue fighting against Lukashenko to prevent the country from becoming a "desert." Tsikhanouski intends to reactivate his YouTube channel and publish files related to his criminal proceedings, while his wife, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, pledges to continue her fight for the release of all political prisoners and democratic elections. Tsikhanouski believes Belarus's liberation is tied to the collapse of the Putin regime.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump, en route to a NATO summit in the Netherlands, declined to commit to Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which stipulates that an attack on one member is an attack on all. When asked about his commitment, Trump stated that it "depends on your definition" of Article 5, raising concerns among NATO allies about the U.S.'s dedication to collective defense. He added that he is committed to being a friend to NATO leaders and helping them, promising to provide an exact definition later. Trump's remarks have sparked controversy given the summit's goal to signal unity against potential Russian aggression. This statement raises concerns about the stability of the alliance.</p>

St. Pierre emphasized that McGregor brings significant attention and revenue to UFC, making his fights beneficial for everyone involved. McGregor has been out of action for nearly four years since breaking his leg in a fight against Dustin Poirier in 2021, and his scheduled return against Michael Chandler at UFC 303 was canceled due to a broken toe. St. Pierre hopes that McGregor's comeback happens if it genuinely makes him happy and is what he wants to do, despite Dana White's opposition to hosting fights in stadiums, which McGregor desires.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson argued that the War Powers Act is unconstitutional, asserting that it violates Article 2 of the Constitution, which defines presidential powers. Johnson stated that President Trump's decision to order strikes on Iranian nuclear targets was within his powers under Article 2. He vowed that a pending resolution to bar U.S. military action in Iran under the War Powers Act will not pass the House. Representative Massie, who introduced the resolution, indicated that he would not advance it if the Iran-Israel ceasefire holds, and Trump criticized Massie for his opposition to the tax and spending bill.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, but voiced frustration with both countries, accusing them of violating the agreement shortly after it was intended to take effect. Despite initial breaches, the ceasefire appeared to hold after Trump intervened, including a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Trump criticized Israel for launching strikes just before the ceasefire was due to begin, stating that he was "not happy" with their actions. He also expressed frustration with Iran, stating that both countries "don't know what the f*** they're doing," emphasizing the long-standing conflict between them.</p>

          <p>Beginner gold investors should consider strategic steps before investing in gold, given its role as an income protector rather than a traditional income producer. Key decisions include whether to wait for a price drop, how much of the portfolio to allocate to gold, and assessing the portfolio's specific needs. Factors driving the price of gold suggest making these decisions sooner rather than later, potentially consulting with a financial advisor or gold investing company. The common gold investing threshold is often 10% of your overall portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>
