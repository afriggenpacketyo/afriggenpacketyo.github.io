        <p>Wholesale prices in February showed no change, contrasting with predicted increases.  The producer price index (PPI), a key inflation indicator, registered no growth after a revised 0.6% jump in January.  Economists anticipated a 0.3% rise. Core PPI (excluding food and energy) even decreased by 0.1%, while the core PPI excluding trade services rose 0.2%, both below expectations.  The report followed a 0.2% increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for February, indicating some easing of inflation pressures.  Year-over-year, headline PPI increased by 3.2%, and core PPI by 3.4%. Market reaction included reduced stock market losses and sustained higher Treasury yields.</p>
