          <p>Seven-time Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic successfully advanced to the second round after overcoming stomach issues in a four-set victory against Alexandre Muller. While top seed Jannik Sinner also secured a dominant win, the men's draw saw a major upset as third seed Alexander Zverev was defeated by Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech in a tense five-set match. Zverev's early exit marks him as the fourth top-10 men's player to be eliminated in the tournament's opening days, shaking up the competition's landscape.</p>

          <p>Warner Music Group has announced a major restructuring plan aimed at cutting annual costs by approximately $300 million, which will include a new round of layoffs. In a memo to staff, CEO Robert Kyncl stated that $170 million of the savings will come from "headcount rightsizing," though the exact number of affected employees was not specified. The move is part of a broader strategy to "future-proof" the company by reallocating resources toward artist development, A&R, and a new $1.2-billion joint venture with Bain Capital to acquire music catalogs.</p>

          <p>Collaborative design software company Figma has filed for an initial public offering, with plans to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "FIG." The move comes after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was terminated due to regulatory hurdles, which resulted in a $1 billion fee paid to Figma. The company's prospectus reveals strong growth, with revenue up 46% in the first quarter, as it joins a recent uptick in tech IPOs after a prolonged market slump. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This column reflects on the nature of long-term relationships through the lens of a road trip, humorously detailing the author's husband's tendency to argue with GPS directions and critique other drivers. The author posits that navigating these minor but persistent irritations is a crucial test for any partnership, akin to accepting a partner's fundamental, unchangeable traits. Ultimately, the piece concludes that marriage, like a long drive, involves navigating frustrations and wrong turns, but the only way forward is to accept the journey and "proceed to the route" together.</p>

          <p>The British government has won a key vote on its controversial benefits bill, but only after making significant last-minute concessions to quell a rebellion within its own party. Fearing a defeat, ministers agreed to delay stricter eligibility rules for the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) until after a review, effectively gutting one of the bill's main cost-saving measures. The chaotic process and multiple U-turns have been criticized as a "shambles" by MPs and have undermined the authority of party leadership while creating uncertainty for future spending plans.</p>

The move aims to protect public health and reduce smoking rates, particularly among young people, with violators facing fines up to €700. While smoking has been illegal in indoor public spaces since 2008, this expansion of the ban marks a significant cultural shift for a country where over 30% of adults still smoke, though café terraces remain a final refuge for smokers.</p>

Scientists and former government officials have called the removal dangerous, stating it amounts to tampering with facts and could increase risks to the public by hindering access to authoritative, peer-reviewed information on climate impacts. The White House has indicated the information will be moved to NASA's domain to comply with the law, but the reports were not immediately available there.</p>

          <p>Dating app Tinder is now requiring all of its users in California to undergo a mandatory facial scan to verify their identity. The "Face Check" feature prompts users to take a short video selfie, which is then used to confirm that their face matches their profile photos and to detect duplicate or impersonator accounts. This move is part of a broader effort by parent company Match Group to enhance safety, build user trust, and combat the rising prevalence of romance scams and fraudulent activity on its platforms.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Trump-Musk Feud Highlights Chilling Precedent of Using Denaturalization Against Political Foes</h2>

          <p>This opinion article frames the public feud between President Trump and Elon Musk as a concerning development with broader implications for American democracy. The author argues that Trump's suggestion of deporting Musk, a naturalized citizen, sets a dangerous precedent for weaponizing denaturalization against political enemies, a threat also leveled at NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. The piece warns that while targeting powerful figures is notable, the tactic could create a chilling effect, silencing millions of other naturalized citizens who might fear speaking out against the administration.</p>
