          <p>Zions Bancorporation experienced a $1 billion drop in valuation after disclosing it had made $60 million in loans that were unlikely to be repaid. The bank's subsidiary, California Bank & Trust, has filed a lawsuit alleging a "sweeping betrayal of trust," accusing borrowers of secretly subordinating the loans and eliminating the collateral. This disclosure triggered a 13% plunge in Zions' shares and stoked broader fears about the health of the regional banking sector, contributing to a significant downturn in the U.S. stock market.</p>

          <p>In a detailed explanation of his investment strategy, Warren Buffett outlines three main categories of assets. He cautions against currency-denominated investments like bonds, which are subject to government policy and inflation, and non-productive assets like gold, which generate no value on their own. Instead, Buffett champions the third category: productive assets such as farms or businesses, which are valued based on what they can produce over time. He emphasizes that the success of these investments is determined by their actual output, not by daily market fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A global movement is underway in major cities like New York, London, and Montreal to reclaim street space from cars for cyclists, making urban areas cleaner and safer. This transformation involves building protected bike lanes, redesigning intersections to improve visibility, and tweaking traffic signals to prioritize pedestrians and cyclists. The shift, amplified by the rise of e-bikes, is credited with reducing carbon emissions, saving residents money, and improving public health. These changes are fostering a more sustainable and livable urban environment for all residents.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece contends that the Supreme Court should affirm President Trump's executive order that denies birthright citizenship to children of undocumented immigrants. The author argues that the 14th Amendment's phrase "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" was not intended to apply to those in the country illegally, drawing parallels to historical rulings concerning Native Americans. The article posits that the current interpretation incentivizes dangerous border crossings and that Trump's order is a necessary step to address the nation's immigration crisis and restore sovereignty.</p>

          <p>A significant political divide has emerged within Generation Z, with young women identifying as the most left-leaning demographic in modern U.S. history, while their male peers trend more conservative. This article explores the reasons behind this gap, suggesting that issues like reproductive rights, economic inequality, and personal safety directly impact women's lives, making politics a matter of self-defense rather than abstract debate. Many of these women reject the 'liberal' label, feeling the Democratic party is too centrist and beholden to corporate interests, reflecting a deep-seated disillusionment with the current political system.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is expected to confirm Douglas Troutman, a chemical industry lobbyist, to lead the EPA's Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention. His appointment would mean that the top four positions in the office are held by former industry advocates, sparking alarm among environmental and public health groups. Critics point to Troutman's past efforts to repeal a California law requiring the disclosure of chemicals in cleaning products as evidence that his leadership will weaken consumer protections and prioritize corporate interests over public safety.</p>

          <p>President Trump has commuted the more than seven-year prison sentence of former New York Congressman George Santos, ordering his immediate release. Santos, who had pleaded guilty to wire fraud and identity theft, had been in federal prison since July. In his announcement, Trump claimed Santos had been "horribly mistreated" in prison, a sentiment echoed by Santos's attorney. The commutation, which is not a pardon, was met with criticism from fellow Republicans like Rep. Nick LaLota, who argued that Santos's crimes warranted a longer sentence.</p>

Furthermore, the study highlights a significant economic aspect of this trend, showing that the median household wealth of remarried individuals is substantially higher than that of divorced adults and is comparable to those in their first marriage.

          <p>This article analyzes the anti-Trump "Resistance" movement, proposing that its earnest and sometimes "cringe" idealism is a potent weapon against the cynicism inherent in authoritarian politics. It argues that while the movement's aesthetics, like pink hats, were mocked, its underlying belief in democracy fueled tangible successes, such as the 2018 midterm elections. The author suggests that in an era of political nihilism, sincere, unironic belief in civic values, however uncool it may seem, is a necessary and effective form of opposition. This approach counters a political climate that thrives on eroding conviction.</p>

          <p>Organizers are anticipating millions of demonstrators to participate in the second major "No Kings" protest across the United States. The movement, which opposes what it calls President Trump's monarchical behavior, cites growing concerns over immigration enforcement, environmental policy changes, and other administration actions. While Republican leaders have criticized the event as anti-American and some states have mobilized their National Guard, protest organizers are emphasizing their commitment to peaceful assembly. The event aims to build on the momentum of the first protests held in June, which drew an estimated 5 million people.</p>

          <p>Relations between China and Canada appear to be improving following a high-level meeting in Beijing between top Chinese diplomat Wang Yi and Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand. Wang stated that China is willing to restart dialogue and rebuild trust, calling Anand's visit a "fresh start" for the strained bilateral relationship. This diplomatic engagement is viewed by analysts as a result of a more pragmatic approach from Ottawa, aimed at stabilizing ties amidst broader geopolitical and trade tensions. Both sides acknowledged there is significant potential for cooperation between the two nations.</p>

          <p>President Trump's suggestion that federal forces may be sent to San Francisco to restore order has been met with widespread condemnation from local residents and political leaders. While acknowledging the city's challenges with homelessness and urban decay, many view the idea as a fascist overreach and an inappropriate use of the military. City officials countered Trump's claims of a crime-ridden "mess" by pointing to data showing significant reductions in crime rates. They asserted that San Francisco does not need or want federal intervention, framing the proposal as a vindictive political attack.</p>

          <p>California State Senator Scott Wiener is reportedly preparing a 2026 run for the congressional seat long held by 85-year-old Nancy Pelosi, setting the stage for a high-stakes political contest in San Francisco. Wiener's undeclared campaign ignites a debate on generational change within the Democratic Party and creates a competitive primary, as wealthy progressive Saikat Chakrabarti has already announced his candidacy. The move is viewed as a calculated one by Wiener, who needs to build a significant fundraising operation to compete, regardless of whether Pelosi decides to seek another term.</p>

          <p>Native American tribes in California's Owens Valley are intensifying their campaign to reclaim water rights from the city of Los Angeles, which has diverted the region's water for over a century.

Department of Water and Power maintains it manages the water sustainably, the tribes are seeking the return of both land and water rights to restore their environment and secure a viable sovereign homeland.</p>

Although he will remain a prince, he will no longer use his titles or honours. This move further diminishes his role after he had already stepped back from all public duties.</p>

          <p>Dominion Voting Systems, a company central to 2020 election conspiracy theories, has been sold and rebranded as Liberty Vote by its new owner, Scott Leiendecker. The public announcement adopted a partisan tone, promising to restore faith in elections with "100% American ownership" and paper ballots. However, in private communications to its county clients, the company assured them of continuity with the "same team, same support." This dual messaging has led to speculation about whether the acquisition is a genuine transformation or a strategic rebranding aimed at winning over conservative jurisdictions.</p>
