          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 09:35:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Trump has shortened the deadline for Russia to reach a peace agreement with Ukraine, reducing it from 50 days to approximately 10 to 12 days. Citing a lack of progress and disappointment in Vladimir Putin, Trump stated that the U.S. will impose significant "secondary tariffs" on Moscow's trading partners if a deal is not reached. This move intensifies pressure on Russia as its invasion of Ukraine continues, with Trump noting he has lost patience despite previous attempts to negotiate a ceasefire. The announcement was made in Scotland during a meeting with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When asked about Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's assertion that there is no starvation crisis in Gaza, former President Trump responded, "I don't know." He then pointed to television images of hungry children, suggesting the visuals contradict the claim, while also noting that the U.S. and other nations are providing aid. During the same meeting, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer described the situation as a humanitarian "catastrophe." The comments came as the Hamas-run health ministry reported more deaths from malnutrition in the region.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A real estate agent with over a decade of experience details numerous negotiation tactics for homebuyers beyond simply lowering the purchase price. The article suggests negotiating for seller concessions to cover closing costs, rate buydowns to lower mortgage interest, and the inclusion of personal property like furniture. Other negotiable items include specific repairs, rent-back agreements for sellers, and professional cleaning services, which can collectively save buyers thousands of dollars. The expert emphasizes that as the housing market shifts, buyers have more leverage to get creative with purchase terms.</p>

          <p>A 32-year-old woman in Crimond, Scotland, has been ordered to perform 134 hours of unpaid community work for allowing a girl under the age of 10 to drive a car. The woman, Sophie-Leigh Gemmell, admitted to culpable and reckless conduct after a video of the incident appeared on social media. The footage showed the barefoot child struggling to see over the steering wheel while driving in the dark during poor weather. The sentencing sheriff described her actions as "reckless in the extreme" and noted she was fortunate that no one was seriously harmed.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the second Trump administration has effectively ended the long-standing U.S. policy of promoting democracy and human rights abroad. The author points to the dismantling of programs at USAID and the National Endowment for Democracy, as well as a shift in State Department focus, as evidence of this change. This new approach, which prioritizes transactional relationships over values, is seen as emboldening autocrats worldwide, from Serbia to Southeast Asia. The piece concludes that the U.S. is no longer viewed as a global democratic model, creating a more perilous environment for pro-democracy movements.</p>

As part of the deal, the EU has agreed to invest an additional $600 billion in the U.S. and purchase $750 billion in American energy.

          <p>According to Harvard associate professor Alison Wood Brooks, active listening is a powerful but underutilized tool for gaining influence and likeability at work. The strategy involves more than just hearing someone; it requires demonstrating engagement by asking thoughtful follow-up questions or paraphrasing what was said. This simple technique showcases competence, builds trust, and demonstrates empathy, which can be crucial for career success. Research co-authored by Brooks found that simply asking more questions makes a person more likeable, a trait often correlated with positive performance reviews.</p>

          <p>NHS England has accused the British Medical Association (BMA) of taking an "increasingly hardline" stance by rejecting numerous emergency requests for striking resident doctors to return to work. During the current five-day walkout over pay, a system allows hospitals to request doctors cross the picket line if patient safety is at risk, but 18 of 27 such requests were denied. NHS officials expressed concern that the BMA's central committee is second-guessing the judgment of frontline doctors. The BMA countered that the NHS is stretching staff too thin by continuing non-urgent care during the strike.</p>

          <p>European wine and spirits producers are urging for a zero-tariff arrangement after being excluded from the initial framework of the new U.S.-EU trade deal. The main agreement sets a 15% tariff on most EU goods, but a decision on alcohol was deferred, creating uncertainty for the sector. Industry groups on both sides of the Atlantic are advocating for a "zero-for-zero" tariff policy, arguing that duties would harm businesses and consumers. The sector has already been under pressure from trade tensions and shifting consumption habits, making any new tariffs a significant burden. (not investment advice)</p>

The new model is built on "agentic" AI, which breaks down complex tasks into smaller sub-tasks for more accurate completion. Z.ai stated the model is smaller and can run on just eight of Nvidia's customized H20 chips designed for the Chinese market. This development continues the trend of Chinese companies rapidly advancing in the AI space, creating powerful and cost-effective models despite U.S. chip restrictions.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, former U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich argues that we are living in an "age of bullies," where powerful figures from politics to business act with fewer constraints. He cites examples from global conflicts to domestic policies that harm the vulnerable, asserting that this behavior erodes civility and the social fabric. Reich contends that living a moral life today requires active, collective resistance against brutality and the abuse of power. He calls for holding the powerful accountable and protecting the vulnerable as a fundamental duty of civilization and social justice.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's opposition parties, the KMT and TPP, are looking to build on recent political momentum after a recall vote against 24 KMT lawmakers failed. The vote, initiated by the ruling party's supporters, was seen as a significant setback for President William Lai Ching-te and has strengthened the "Blue-White" alliance between the two opposition parties. Analysts suggest the failed recall has re-energized the opposition and deepened their coordination. This outcome could position them favorably for the 2026 local elections and the 2028 presidential race.</p>

          <p>In an effort to address its declining population, China has launched its first nationwide childcare subsidy program.

This policy marks a significant shift towards direct financial support for households, a departure from previous piecemeal local incentives. However, economists suggest that while the move is a milestone, the subsidy amount is likely too small to significantly impact birth rates or household consumption in the short term.

          <p>This article explores the psychology behind being "too sensitive," explaining that it can stem from both innate temperament and past experiences like trauma or rejection. People with heightened emotional sensitivity perceive the world more intensely and may be more reactive to perceived slights, which often signal a threat to their "relational value." Experts suggest that this trait isn't inherently bad but can disrupt relationships if not managed. Coping strategies include recognizing the tendency to assume the worst and learning to communicate hurt feelings constructively.</p>
