          <p>Former President Donald Trump's visit to the Gulf region is shadowed by ethical concerns due to his family's active business projects in the area. The Trump Organization has several ventures in the Gulf, including the newly announced Trump International Hotel & Tower in Dubai and a $5.5 billion golf club in Qatar. Additionally, a $2 billion investment from an Abu Dhabi-based firm in the Trump family's cryptocurrency venture raises further questions. Ethics experts criticize these endeavors as potential conflicts of interest, noting the unprecedented leveraging of political power for personal financial gain.</p>

Although the council stated the slide was removed during the drafting process and never shown to children, experts and politicians questioned why such content was ever considered appropriate. The Welsh government emphasized that non-fatal strangulation is dangerous and illegal, and that resources provided to schools should make this clear.</p>

          <p>A Democratic congressman is calling for an ethics investigation into former President Donald Trump's plan to accept a $400 million jet from Qatar for use as Air Force One and later as a gift to his presidential library.

Trump has defended the deal, stating it would save the Defense Department money. Qatari officials say the potential transfer is under review by legal departments.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party has announced its plans to reduce immigration into the UK, aiming for a system that is "controlled, selective, and fair." Key measures include tightening visa requirements for skilled workers, expanding eligibility for high-potential individuals, and doubling the time immigrants must live in the UK before applying for permanent residency. The plans also involve abolishing a dedicated visa for social care providers and increasing English language requirements for work visas. While aiming to reduce net migration, Labour has not set an overall cap.</p>

          <p>OpenAI's new 4o image creation mode is the best AI for generating images, surpassing Midjourney in its ability to transform ordinary photos into art. To get good images from 4o, users should work around content filters by asking for styles reminiscent of specific artists and then requesting a "style transfer". Detailed prompting strategies, such as asking the AI to consider what makes an image evocative or challenging it on capturing an artist's genius, can significantly improve results. The article emphasizes the importance of structured thinking and multiple drafts for achieving quality AI-generated art.</p>

          <p>The spring sales of modern and contemporary art face challenges due to economic uncertainty and new tariffs, leading auction houses to recalibrate their strategies. With fewer high-estimate artworks and a decline in industry sales, auction houses are returning to basics and relying on conventional offerings. The success of bellwether artworks, including a Giacometti bust and a Mondrian painting, will indicate the health of the art market. Despite the challenges, auction houses remain optimistic about raising significant funds during the sales week.</p>
