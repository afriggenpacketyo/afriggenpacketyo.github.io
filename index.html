          <p>Taichi Kokubun, a member of the Japanese pop group Tokio, was removed from the TV program "The Tetsuwan Dash" following multiple compliance breaches. The decision, approved after a third-party probe, involved Kokubun accepting responsibility for his actions. Hiroyuki Fukuda, the network's president, cited privacy concerns for not elaborating on the breaches, which were not criminal. Kokubun has indefinitely suspended his activities and apologized for his "lack of awareness" and "inappropriate behavior," while the TV show will continue broadcasting. The entertainment industry in Japan faces increased scrutiny after recent sexual misconduct scandals at Fuji Television and Johnny & Associates. </p>

          <p>Pro-Palestinian activists broke into RAF Brize Norton, a UK airbase, and sprayed two military planes with red paint. Palestine Action claimed responsibility, stating they disabled the planes to protest Britain's military support for Israel. The Ministry of Defence condemned the vandalism and is working with the police on the matter. Lisa Nandy, a cabinet minister, called the break-in "deeply concerning," while Lord West, a former head of the Royal Navy, described it as "extremely worrying" for national security. Mark Francois, Shadow armed forces minister, said there were "serious questions for the MoD to answer" about how the protesters gained access to the airbase.</p>

Government borrowing reached its second-highest level for May since monthly records began in 1993, with borrowing at Â£17.7bn.

          <p>The United States is considering military force against Iran, echoing the lead-up to the Iraq War. The article argues that focusing solely on Iran's nuclear capabilities is misguided, as an attack could incentivize them to develop weapons.

Even if Iran were to develop nuclear weapons, the article suggests that the threat should not be inflated, and war is not the answer. The author contends that the U.S. should step back from the brink and prioritize American well-being over foreign conflicts.</p>

The drones can endure launch forces exceeding 3,000 times their own weight, reaching distances over 10 kilometers in seconds. The advance centers on a pyrotechnic ejection mechanism co-developed by the Shaanxi Applied Physics and Chemistry Research Institute, the Chinese air force, and defense contractor Norinco. The system separates the drone from its artillery shell mid-flight without electronic controls, saving power and extending loiter time.</p>

          <p>California's Attorney General has filed charges against real estate agents accused of price gouging after the January fires, but some critics say it's not enough. Thousands of complaints were submitted, and organizers documented skyrocketing rents, but government officials are seen as not doing enough. An activist organization is tracking over 10,000 active listings that may qualify as price gouging. The city attorney is also filing lawsuits, including against rental giant Blueground, and has issued cease-and-desist letters to owners and landlords.</p>

          <p>An ICE raid at a Home Depot in Hollywood has shattered the sense of refuge for the immigrant community that gathered there. Dozens of armed agents converged on the parking lot, arresting vendors, day laborers, and customers, including a U.S. citizen. Witnesses described chaotic scenes as people scattered, hid, and were apprehended by agents. The raid has caused trauma, separated families, and taken away the means to earn a living for many working-class immigrants.</p>

Two videos show alleged federal agents acting with disregard for decency and democracy. One incident involves an agent pointing a gun at a civilian taking a photo of an unmarked vehicle. Critics argue that the anonymity of these agents undermines trust and creates a climate of fear, while ICE claims the officers need to remain anonymous due to increased threats and attacks against them.</p>

          <p>Legal payouts by the city of Los Angeles for police misconduct, trip and falls, and other lawsuits have surged from $64 million a decade ago to $289 million this fiscal year. City officials attribute this rise to aging infrastructure, larger jury awards, and an increase in lawsuits. The city attorney's office, headed by Hydee Feldstein Soto, is exploring ways to manage the increasing costs, including seeking a cap on lawsuits against California cities. The rising payouts contribute to a nearly $1-billion budget shortfall, leading to layoffs and spending cuts.</p>

          <p>Despite the situation, there is an opportunity for diplomacy with Iran. The current administration is pitching the presidentâ€™s two-week timeline as a chance to let diplomacy play out. Officials have pitched the move to give the Iranians breathing room as necessary because of the heavy losses sustained among its senior leadership and nuclear policy experts who would be involved in the making and implementing of any deal. European diplomats are set to hold talks with Araghchi in Geneva over the weekend.</p>

          <p>A record number of people were forcibly displaced in 2024, according to the UN, with about 123 million people worldwide displaced from their homes by conflict, persecution, or other threats. Most of these people are internally displaced, while nearly 90% of refugees come from only 10 countries. The majority seek shelter in neighboring countries, and developing countries take in a disproportionate number of refugees. A significant gap exists between asylum requests and decisions, and displaced people often return to countries that remain unsafe.</p>
