          <p>Moorcroft Pottery, a Stoke-on-Trent firm known for its colorful pottery, has ceased operations after over 100 years, resulting in 57 job losses. Rising energy costs and declining sales were cited as factors contributing to the closure. The company, founded in 1897, had a history of royal patronage, with its designs being included in the Royal Collection. Local officials expressed disappointment and pledged support for affected employees, highlighting the challenges faced by manufacturers due to global economic pressures and illegal forgeries.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) maintained its policy rate at 0.5% for the second consecutive meeting, amidst concerns over U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs impacting the Japanese economy. While inflation has remained above the BOJ's 2% target for 36 months, allowing room for rate hikes, trade tensions complicate monetary policy normalization. The central bank stated it would continue to raise rates if economic and price forecasts are realized, but also noted that growth is likely to moderate. The BOJ expects inflation to range between 2-2.5% in fiscal year 2025 and 1.5 to 2% in fiscal year 2026.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Emma Brockes, in an article for The Guardian, argues that the UK's attempts to appease President Trump have been futile, positioning the UK in a lower tier for trade talks compared to other nations. The article draws parallels to Columbia University's experience, where concessions to Trump did not guarantee restored funding. Brockes suggests that belligerence may be more effective in dealing with Trump, as demonstrated by tech companies and business leaders. The commentary highlights the pathos of Britain's continued attempts to gain favor with Trump despite the vast power disparity between the two countries.</p>

          <p>China has lifted sanctions on several Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), a move seen as an attempt to improve relations with the EU amidst global trade uncertainty caused by President Trump's tariffs. The sanctions, imposed in 2021, had strained EU-China relations and stalled an investment deal. Experts suggest this is a strategic effort to foster trade discussions and secure new markets, although significant constraints remain, including Beijing's ties to Moscow. While the EU welcomes the gesture, it maintains its own sanctions related to human rights concerns in Xinjiang.</p>

          <p>In a New York Times article, Mackenzie Eaglen and Brady Africk argue that the U.S. military lacks sufficient personnel and materiel to fight a major war, despite possessing advanced equipment. They contend that the focus on high-tech weaponry has come at the expense of quantity and durability, leaving the armed forces ill-prepared for prolonged conflicts. The authors point to the situations in Ukraine, Israel, and Yemen as examples of modern warfare's demands, highlighting shortages in artillery shells, missiles, and recruits. They urge Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to prioritize resources that strengthen combat power and advocate for increased investment in ammunition, ships, and planes.</p>

          <p>European auto giants are experiencing a sharp decline in first-quarter profits, with many suspending or reducing full-year financial guidance, attributing the challenges to President Donald Trump's trade tariffs. The imposition of a 25% tariff on automotive imports into the U.S. has created uncertainty and volatility in the industry. While Trump has taken steps to ease some of these levies, analysts warn that the rapidly changing nature of his trade policies continues to impede long-term corporate investment decisions. Several companies, including Stellantis, Mercedes, and Volvo Cars, have taken actions such as withdrawing financial guidance and implementing cost-cutting measures.</p>

          <p>In the mushroom trial, the estranged husband of Erin Patterson testified that it was "very rare" for her to host social gatherings at home. Simon Patterson was invited to the fatal meal but declined to attend. Erin Patterson is charged with murder and attempted murder after serving a poisonous mushroom lunch to family members, resulting in three deaths. The prosecution alleges she invited the group under the pretense of a cancer diagnosis, while the defense claims she "panicked" after unintentionally serving poison.</p>
