          <p>Two women were killed at a Baptist church in Lexington, Kentucky, after a gunman, who had earlier shot and wounded a state trooper, fled to the location. The suspect was subsequently shot and killed by police. Officials identified the victims as Beverly Gum, 72, and Christina Combs, 32, and noted the shooter may have had a connection to them. The incident began with a traffic stop near the Blue Grass Airport, which escalated into a carjacking and the deadly confrontation at the church, leaving two other men wounded.</p>

          <p>A catastrophic flash flood in Central Texas has led to at least 132 confirmed deaths, with rescue teams still searching for over 160 missing people. The disaster, which occurred on July 4, was caused by the Guadalupe River swelling to unprecedented levels, with Kerr County and a girls' summer camp named Camp Mystic being the most severely affected areas. A federal disaster has been declared, but ongoing storms have hampered search efforts, and scrutiny has fallen on the adequacy of weather warnings and the lack of a local siren system.</p>

          <p>A large fire at the Gabriel House assisted living home in Fall River, Massachusetts, has resulted in the deaths of nine residents. Firefighters arrived to find heavy flames and people trapped in windows, ultimately rescuing many but confirming the fatalities, with one other person in critical condition. The cause of the fire is under investigation, though the building was equipped with sprinklers. The fire chief described the event as an "unfathomable tragedy" for the community and the families of the approximately 70 people who lived there.</p>

          <p>The European Union's trade commissioner, Maros Sefcovic, has stated that a proposed 30% tariff by the U.S. would make transatlantic trade nearly impossible, though he remains hopeful for a negotiated solution. The threat has created divisions within the EU, with France advocating for a strong response while Germany urges caution to reach a deal before the August 1 deadline. Sefcovic emphasized that while the EU prefers an agreement and felt one was close, the bloc is preparing "proportionate countermeasures" as a contingency for the tariffs on EU and Mexican imports.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has announced a hosepipe ban for 1.1 million people in parts of southern England, effective July 22, due to a lack of rainfall and high demand straining water supplies. The restriction prohibits activities like watering gardens and washing cars, with potential fines up to £1,000 for violations. The GMB Union criticized the move, highlighting that the company leaked 200 billion liters of water last year due to what it calls "crumbling infrastructure." Thames Water maintains that the measure is necessary and has encouraged all customers to conserve water.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Justice Department's Inspector General has uncovered thousands of instances of abuse involving restraints in federal prisons, including one case that led to a death. The investigation found that the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) violated its own policies by shackling inmates for prolonged periods, sometimes for days or weeks, and using restraints as a form of punishment. The report, which was limited by poor record-keeping, calls for clearer policies to prevent such abuses. In response, the BOP has agreed with the recommendations and committed to revising its practices.</p>

In the game against the Dallas Wings, Clark contributed 14 points and 13 assists to a 102-83 victory for the Fever.

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, who recently won the Democratic primary for New York City mayor, has centered his campaign on affordability, with a proposal for free childcare for children aged six weeks and older gaining significant attention. This policy resonates with many New York families struggling with daycare costs that average $26,000 a year, forcing some parents to reduce work hours or delay having more children. Advocates argue that universal childcare would boost the economy and improve equity, building on the success of the city's universal pre-K program, though it faces political and financial hurdles.</p>

Survivors and reporters from the 1987 event question why more effective warning systems were not implemented in the intervening decades, especially in an area known as "flash flood alley." While the nearby town of Comfort recently installed sirens that helped it evacuate safely, Kerr County, the epicenter of the recent tragedy, had failed to fund a similar system. This has intensified the debate over disaster preparedness and learning from past events.</p>

These problems disproportionately affect low-income communities and people of color.

The decline was driven by a continued drop in food prices, with food inflation registering at -1.06%. This better-than-expected data provides the Reserve Bank of India with more flexibility to continue easing its monetary policy, potentially through further interest rate cuts. Economists anticipate that strong crop production and a good monsoon season will help keep inflation low, boosting consumption and economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price has soared to a new all-time high, breaking the $120,000 mark, driven by significant inflows into bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and anticipation of favorable U.S. crypto legislation. On one recent day, bitcoin ETFs recorded $1.18 billion in inflows, signaling strong institutional interest. The rally comes as the U.S. House prepares for 'Crypto Week' to deliberate on bills that could provide a clearer regulatory framework for the digital asset industry, a move supported by the White House, further boosting investor confidence.

Wallace, who was recently diagnosed with autism, stated he does not wish to hide behind his diagnosis.

          <p>A ProPublica analysis frames the deadly Texas flash flood not just as a local tragedy but as a stark example of the escalating chaos caused by climate change. The article argues that a warmer atmosphere leads to more extreme weather events, making such disasters more common and costly. It criticizes the current administration for defunding climate research and disaster prevention programs at a time when they are most needed. The piece concludes that the world is now in an age of climate-driven discontinuity, where past weather patterns are no longer a reliable guide for the future.</p>

She explains that transitions are inevitable and often involve losing a sense of community and needing to redefine success. Krug advises that overcoming the fear of uncertainty is a skill that can be developed by embracing small, concrete steps toward new interests. She also highlights the importance of rituals to honor the past and suggests that when a decision feels 50/50, it is often best to move on.</p>
