        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes the difficulties associated with a potential U.S. military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities, particularly the Fordo plant, which is deeply embedded within a mountain. The article notes that only the U.S. possesses the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) "bunker buster" bomb and the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber capable of delivering it. Experts suggest that even with these weapons, multiple strikes might be necessary, and ground personnel may need to be deployed to ensure complete destruction. The article further considers the potential for Iran to retaliate against U.S. assets in the region, potentially escalating the conflict into a broader, protracted war, and concludes that while the bunker buster would have a profound psychological effect on the Iranians, it may not stop Iran's nuclear program entirely. Optimism is tempered by the complex military and political considerations.</p>

          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of second-degree murder in the death of her Boston police officer boyfriend, John O'Keefe, after a highly publicized trial. The jury also acquitted her of vehicular manslaughter and leaving the scene, but convicted her of driving while intoxicated, for which she received a one-year probation order. Read thanked her supporters and maintained her fight for justice for O'Keefe, while her father acknowledged the legal team and content providers who helped spread the word about the case.

          <p>The Supreme Court upheld a Tennessee law banning certain gender-affirming care treatments for minors, ruling 6-3 in U.S. v. Skrmetti. Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the majority, stated the law did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection guarantee, leaving policy questions to elected representatives. Justice Sotomayor dissented, arguing the law constituted sex-based classification and invited discrimination, potentially harming transgender children and their families. The ruling allows Tennessee to enforce its ban on puberty blockers and hormone therapy for transgender minors, sparking debate over medical treatments and discrimination.</p>

          <p>A keynote speech at UCLA's Humanities commencement ceremonies ignited controversy when the speaker, Caribbean Fragoza, donned a keffiyeh and declared "From the river to the sea," a slogan seen as a call for the eradication of Israel. The message emboldened the audience to boo Jewish Studies and Hebrew graduates. The author argues that the speech was filled with hatred and hyperbole, and that the keffiyeh is a political symbol. The author also describes how the students at other graduation ceremonies engaged in similar actions without reprimand, and that the descent of UCLA's commencements into ideological theater is a wake-up call.</p>

          <p>The FDA approved Gilead's lenacapavir injection (Yeztugo) for HIV prevention, offering a more convenient option than daily pills or bi-monthly injections. Clinical trials showed the injection virtually eliminated new HIV infections when administered every six months. While the annual list price is $28,218, Gilead plans to ensure accessibility through insurance coverage and assistance programs. Experts believe Yeztugo could significantly reduce new infections, particularly among marginalized communities where adherence to daily pills is challenging, however, the launch of the injectable drug faces potential threats, including the Trump administration's proposed cuts to federal funding for HIV prevention efforts.</p>

          <p>President Trump's handling of the conflict between Iran and Israel has exposed a bitter split within his circle, pitting isolationist and hawkish factions against each other. While Trump has often criticized "stupid endless wars," he has also maintained that Iran "can't have a nuclear weapon." This dilemma has led to public disagreements among his supporters, including criticisms from Tulsi Gabbard and Tucker Carlson, while loyalists like Marjorie Taylor Greene have defended Carlson. The debate centers on whether the U.S. should intervene militarily or remain uninvolved, highlighting the tension between Trump's "America First" doctrine and the perceived need to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear capabilities.</p>

          <p>Experts assess the potential environmental impact if the U.S. were to use a "bunker buster" bomb on Iran's Fordo Fuel Enrichment Plant. Because the plant processes uranium isotopes in gas form, experts suggest any contamination would likely remain localized due to the gas's heavy molecules. While the two main uranium isotopes present a low-level radiation hazard, the uranium hexafluoride gas could react with air to form hydrofluoric acid, posing a risk. However, the mountain's collapse from the strike would likely inhibit any environmental release.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve maintained its benchmark interest rate, signaling a "wait-and-see" approach amid mixed economic signals. While acknowledging solid labor market conditions and economic growth, the Fed expressed caution about the economic outlook, citing uncertainties related to the Trump administration's tariffs. The central bank anticipates two interest rate cuts by year-end, but economists remain divided on the timing. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the need to assess the impact of tariffs on inflation before adjusting rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A regulation mandating two-person crews on freight trains is being challenged for lacking data-driven evidence, relying instead on "common sense." The author argues that emotion-based regulation is destructive to the U.S. economy and represents a dangerous precedent where agencies can sidestep their legal responsibility to document market failures. The government's own data doesn't support the claim that two-person crews improve safety, and the mandate could divert funds from critical infrastructure investment and innovation. The author warns that such an approach could lead to regulatory overreach and stifle economic dynamism.</p>
