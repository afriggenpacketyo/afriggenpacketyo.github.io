            <p>Harvard University has refused demands from the Trump administration to eliminate its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs and ideological screening of international students. This stance jeopardizes nearly $9 billion in federal funding for the university. Harvard President Alan Garber defended the decision, emphasizing that no government should dictate the academic freedom of private universities. He argued that while some demands aimed to combat antisemitism, most represented direct governmental regulation of Harvard's intellectual environment, and the university will not comply.</p>

            <p>A 5.2-magnitude earthquake struck near San Diego, California, causing widespread shaking across Southern California and into Mexico. The quake, likely associated with the Elsinore Fault, was felt as far north as Los Angeles. While no immediate reports of injuries surfaced, residents reported feeling a violent jolt, and some experienced car alarms and falling bottles. Seismologists have stated that extreme damage is not expected, though older buildings may be vulnerable. Several aftershocks followed the initial quake, and Governor Gavin Newsom has been briefed as the state coordinates with local authorities.</p>

            <h2>Trump Tariffs Unlikely to Bring Supply Chains Back to U.S.</h2>

            <p>A CNBC Supply Chain Survey reveals that President Trump's tariffs are unlikely to result in a reshoring boom. Most companies surveyed believe the costs of bringing supply chains back to the U.S. would be prohibitive. Instead, companies are more likely to relocate supply chains to lower-tariffed countries. Automation is expected to play a significant role in any manufacturing returning to the U.S., with concerns about the labor market and the administration's strategy also cited as key factors.</p>

            <p>President Trump suggested that "homegrown criminals" in the U.S. could be deported to jails in El Salvador, echoing his administration's policy of deporting alleged gang members. He stated that the U.S. Attorney General is studying the laws to determine if this is possible. The comment was made during a meeting with El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele, highlighting the administration's hardline stance on immigration and crime. The Trump administration has been deporting alleged gang members to El Salvador since mid-March under the Alien Enemies Act.</p>

            <p>U.S. crude oil prices declined after OPEC reduced its demand growth forecast for the year, citing the impact of President Trump's tariffs. The cartel now expects demand to grow by 1.3 million barrels per day, a reduction from previous estimates. Earlier in the session, prices had risen due to Trump's decision to exempt key tech products from tariffs.
