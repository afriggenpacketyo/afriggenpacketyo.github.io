          <p>Israel's military has issued a full evacuation order for Gaza City, warning its residents to immediately move south towards Al-Mawasi, a designated humanitarian zone, as it plans to operate "with great force" within the city to eliminate Hamas. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu explicitly reiterated the warning, emphasizing the extreme danger of remaining. Despite the severe situation and evacuation warnings, a significant number of residents remain, citing reasons such as the inability to afford evacuation costs, a severe shortage of tent space in humanitarian zones, or uncertainty about their safety after evacuating. This critical directive follows approximately a week of intensified ground operations within Gaza City, aiming to provide comprehensive coverage of the military's objectives.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump posted an image referencing "Apocalypse Now" with a line threatening Chicago, just hours before the city's annual Mexican Independence Day parade commenced. The article humorously contrasts Trump's aggressive rhetoric with the peaceful, culturally rich celebration, which traditionally begins with four men on horseback, implying a significant disconnect between political grandstanding and local reality. This commentary highlights the often-performative nature of political statements and their reception within a diverse urban environment. The piece suggests that the "invasion" alluded to by Trump's post was, in fact, a vibrant community event, underscoring the city's resilience.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's administration has made "copper plans" available on ObamaCare exchanges to most Americans, a move touted to significantly reduce healthcare costs. Previously restricted to those under 30 or with rare hardship exemptions, these plans offer lower premiums with slightly higher out-of-pocket costs, potentially saving families thousands annually. The reform aims to address rising ObamaCare prices and expand coverage for uninsured individuals, especially healthier younger demographics, thereby stabilizing the market. This initiative is presented as a solution to ObamaCare's fundamental problems, offering more affordable options to millions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nepal's Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli resigned amidst escalating anti-government protests, which saw politicians' homes set ablaze and at least 19 people killed, including 17 in the capital, Kathmandu. Initially sparked by a controversial social media ban, the unrest continued even after the ban was lifted, revealing deeper frustrations among young protesters, many in school uniforms, over pervasive corruption and the authorities' brutal response. International bodies, including neighboring India and Western embassies, urged restraint and peaceful dialogue to find solutions. The protests highlight a widespread demand for peace and an end to systemic corruption, posing significant challenges to the country's political stability.</p>

          <p>India urged BRICS members to address its significant trade deficits with them, particularly China and Russia, while the bloc collectively rallied against U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar highlighted India's largest trade deficits being with BRICS partners, advocating for smoother trade flows and dedicated initiatives to boost exports among member states. This stance contrasted with Brazil and China, who took veiled swipes at Washington's trade policies, warning against "Hegemonism, unilateralism, and protectionism." Despite these trade tensions, India and the U.S. have shown signs of improving relations, recognizing their mutual strategic importance. (not investment advice)</p>

President Aleksandar Vucic congratulated the police on a "professionally executed job," labeling demonstrators "cowards and wretches," while an internal purge saw a Special Anti-Terrorist Unit commander removed for not showing "absolute control." Experts warn this signals a shift towards open repression, with authorities potentially preparing for more serious confrontations.

          <p>Dior's Shanghai subsidiary has been fined by Chinese police for illegally transmitting customer data overseas to its French headquarters without mandated security screening or explicit customer consent. The investigation followed media reports of a data breach and alerts to mainland Chinese users. Dior Shanghai failed to establish a standard contract for data export, obtain personal information protection certification, or implement essential security measures like encryption and anonymization for the collected personal information. This enforcement action underscores China's increasingly stringent cybersecurity and data privacy regulations, highlighting the challenges foreign companies face in complying with local laws regarding data handling.</p>

          <p>Thailand's Supreme Court ruled that former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra must serve his one-year jail sentence, deeming his previous transfer to a hospital unlawful. Thaksin, who spent less than a day in prison before being moved to a luxury hospital wing for six months, had his eight-year corruption sentence commuted to one year by the king. The decision addresses public criticism of privileged treatment for the powerful and influential Shinawatra family, whose daughter Paetongtarn was recently removed from office. Thaksin vowed to maintain his resolve for the country's benefit despite losing physical freedom.</p>

The author contends that these culture wars provide ideological justification for legislative changes that erode rights for vulnerable communities. The piece highlights how narrowing national narratives, such as portraying Britain as a besieged island, paves the way for policies like mass deportations. It calls for building cross-communal solidarities to resist this project, which aims to dismantle the social contract of the 20th century.</p>
