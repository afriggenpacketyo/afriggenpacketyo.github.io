          <h2>US Imposes Significant Tariffs on Solar Panels from Southeast Asia</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 02:49:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States is set to impose tariffs as high as 3,521% on solar panel imports from Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam following allegations of Chinese subsidies and unfair dumping practices. This decision, prompted by a request from major US solar equipment producers, aims to protect American operations. While beneficial for US manufacturers, these tariffs could increase costs for businesses and consumers who rely on cheaper solar products. The move comes amid broader trade tensions, with China vowing to retaliate against US tariffs with its own levies. Optimism score: 60</p>
