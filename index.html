          <p>A new case before the Supreme Court, *Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians v. Howe*, threatens to dismantle a key component of the 1965 Voting Rights Act (VRA). A lower court ruling, originating from a legal theory suggested by Justice Neil Gorsuch, argues that private citizens and groups cannot sue to enforce the law's protections against racial discrimination in voting. If upheld, this would leave enforcement solely to the Justice Department, a significant blow considering private lawsuits have accounted for the vast majority of successful VRA cases over the past four decades, effectively neutralizing the landmark civil rights legislation.</p>

          <p>The European Union is contemplating the use of its Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI), a powerful trade tool, in response to a potential 30% tariff on EU imports threatened by the Trump administration. This so-called "trade bazooka," created in 2023 but never used, would allow the EU to restrict US market access, limit investments, and impose counter-tariffs on goods and services. While last-minute negotiations are ongoing, the ACI represents a significant potential escalation in the trade dispute, serving as a deterrent and a last resort if diplomatic solutions fail to materialize before the August 1st deadline.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has emerged as a dominant political figure in Washington, eclipsing the influence of Apple's Tim Cook and Tesla's Elon Musk, particularly within the Trump administration. His successful lobbying against restrictions on AI chip sales to China highlights his growing clout, which is rooted in Nvidia's critical role in the global AI revolution. While Cook and Musk have faced challenges in their relationships with the administration, Huang's strategic arguments about maintaining US tech leadership have proven persuasive, though risks from future policy shifts and trade investigations remain a significant concern for the company.</p>

          <p>The projected cost for constructing the Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk has escalated to £38 billion, a substantial increase from the previous £20 billion estimate. This new figure, which officials state now accounts for inflation and risk, will add approximately £1 per month to UK household energy bills during its construction. The government has confirmed it will take a 44.9% stake in the project alongside private investors like Centrica. While supporters tout the long-term energy benefits and job creation, critics decry the soaring costs and the financial burden placed on the public.</p>

          <p>The UK government is introducing a new sanctions regime designed to target the global criminal networks behind small boat crossings in the English Channel. The measures will allow for asset freezes, travel bans, and financial restrictions on individuals and entities involved, including gang leaders, corrupt officials, and companies supplying boats. This policy is a central part of Prime Minister Keir Starmer's pledge to tackle illegal migration.

The WHO condemned the actions, demanding the release of its detained staff and emphasizing that such attacks cripple the entire humanitarian health response in the besieged territory.

          <p>UK government borrowing reached £20.7 billion in June, a £6.6 billion increase from the previous year and higher than anticipated, according to the Office for National Statistics. The rise was driven by increased spending on public services and soaring debt interest payments, which have nearly doubled due to inflation. This figure, the second-highest for June on record, intensifies the financial pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves. Analysts suggest that tax hikes may be necessary in the upcoming Autumn Budget to stabilize public finances and meet fiscal targets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists who monitor Earth's rotation have noted that recent days in July have been fractionally shorter than the standard 24 hours, a common phenomenon that has recently gained public attention. Experts explain that the planet's spin is constantly influenced by various factors, including the moon's gravitational pull, atmospheric winds, and movements in the Earth's liquid core. While the long-term trend shows Earth's rotation is slowing, short-term variations are normal. Understanding these subtle shifts is crucial for applications ranging from GPS navigation to scientific research, including the study of climate change's impact on redistributing Earth's mass.</p>

          <p>Harvard University is legally challenging the Trump administration in federal court, arguing that the cancellation of $2.6 billion in federal research funding is an illegal and politically motivated act of retaliation. The university claims the cuts were a response to its refusal to comply with federal demands regarding campus policies on antisemitism, admissions, and diversity. The government contends it has the authority to cancel grants with institutions that are not in compliance with presidential directives. The case is being closely watched as a major test of the administration's power to influence higher education through financial pressure.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's newly appointed Prime Minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, has indicated that she will likely pursue a new loan program with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) next month. The move is aimed at addressing the country's immense fiscal needs as it continues to defend against Russia's full-scale invasion. With global donors having only committed about half of the estimated $75 billion required over the next two years, fresh financing is critical. The discussions are expected as the current IMF program is set to expire in 2027 and the war's end is not in sight. (not investment advice)</p>

Farmer remains skeptical of the Trump administration's handling of the files and is disturbed by calls to pardon Maxwell.
