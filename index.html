          <p>China's power grid now utilizes a quantum-powered "diamond ring" to safeguard against catastrophic collapses by detecting grid instability in real time. Designed by the University of Science and Technology of China in collaboration with the State Grid Corporation, the device embeds nitrogen-vacancy quantum sensors, acting as a high-precision sentinel for power lines. This development follows incidents such as sweeping outages in Spain, Portugal, and France, as well as grid instability in China's Xinjiang region caused by solar and wind fluctuations. The "diamond ring" aims to address the challenge of weather-dependent unpredictability straining traditional monitoring systems as renewables increasingly dominate energy transitions.</p>

          <p>Miao Hua, a Chinese admiral and member of the Central Military Commission (CMC), is under investigation for "legal violations," suggesting more serious wrongdoings than initially reported. The CMC's political work department expelled Miao from the top legislature in March for "suspected serious violations of discipline and law."  Previously, Miao served as the head of the CMC's political work department, responsible for ideological control and personnel management within the Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army. The mention of "legal violations" suggests a potentially more severe accusation, although no further details have been disclosed due to the sensitive nature of military investigations in China.</p>

          <p>An opinion column asserts that Elon Musk's efforts to cut government spending have led to the decimation of U.S.A.I.D., resulting in an estimated 300,000 deaths, primarily among children. The article claims that while Musk aimed to save the government a trillion dollars, his actions may have created negligible savings and cost the government billions due to attacks on government personnel. White House officials deny that the cuts to U.S.A.I.D. have had fatal consequences, but reports from East Africa document suffering and death caused by the withdrawal of aid. The article highlights a major increase in patients with advanced H.I.V. symptoms in Kenya due to loss of access to antiretroviral medication and severe malnutrition at refugee camps on the border of South Sudan.</p>

          <p>Small business owners are experiencing a mix of relief and uncertainty as federal courts rule on Trump-era tariffs. Two federal courts have blocked President Trump's authority to unilaterally impose tariffs, leading to questions about potential refunds for businesses. However, the White House has vowed to appeal, leaving businesses hesitant to make further plans. Some businesses have already raised prices to offset tariff expenses, while others are seeking alternative manufacturers or renegotiating deals. The article highlights the challenges small businesses face in planning for the future amid the ongoing tariff disputes.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece explores how the therapy generation's redefinition of harm, abuse, neglect, and trauma contributes to the decision to remain childless. The author suggests that Americans have expanded these categories to include emotional and relational struggles previously considered unavoidable. This shift has led to a new, nearly impossible standard for parenting, where children expect parents to ensure their career success and mental well-being into adulthood. The article proposes that this heightened awareness of potential harm influences many millennials and Gen Z members to forgo parenthood.</p>

          <p>Andrew and Tristan Tate have been charged in Britain with sexual assault and other crimes. The charges, authorized in January of last year, involve multiple alleged victims and include sexual assault, actual bodily harm, human trafficking, and controlling prostitution for gain. The brothers, who have millions of followers on social media, were previously arrested in Romania on charges of participating in a criminal ring that allegedly sexually exploited women. The brothers deny all allegations, but Romanian courts have issued an order to extradite them to the U.K. once their case is concluded in Romania.</p>

Despite record levels of global tourism, the author argues that bigotry, prejudice, and narrow-mindedness remain prevalent.

While a New York court deemed the blanket tariffs illegal, an appeals court allowed them to continue, pending further arguments. The tariffs that the US court has ruled illegal do not include those on cars, which make up the bulk of what the UK exports to the US, and steel and aluminium, which are the other UK industries most affected. The ruling does block Trump's imposition of blanket tariffs of 10% on other UK goods entering the US - such as products like salmon and whisky.</p>

Much of the UK's saltmarshes have been lost to agriculture, but they act as natural flood defenses and are unsung heroes in nature's fight against climate change.
