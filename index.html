          <p>Multiple Arab and Muslim countries have denounced Israel's plan to launch a new military offensive and establish an alternative civil administration in Gaza City, calling it a "dangerous escalation" and a violation of international law. The United Kingdom announced an additional £8.5 million in aid for Gaza, demanding that Israel allow more supplies to enter the region to alleviate a severe humanitarian crisis. Meanwhile, the Hamas-run civil defense agency reported at least 10 deaths across Gaza, including civilians killed near an aid distribution point. The ongoing conflict and aid restrictions have led to dire shortages and chaotic scenes among desperate civilians.</p>

          <p>A Texas judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing Beto O'Rourke's political action committee, Powered by People, from financing the travel and lodging of Democratic state lawmakers who left Texas to block a Republican-led redistricting plan. Attorney General Ken Paxton, who filed the lawsuit, accused the PAC of bribery and deceptive fundraising. O'Rourke has responded with a countersuit, alleging that Paxton is attempting to suppress dissent and dismantle a major voter registration organization. The legal battle unfolds as Texas Republicans consider ousting the absent Democrats to proceed with a vote on new congressional maps.</p>

          <p>The Canyon Fire, burning near the border of Ventura and Los Angeles counties, has prompted evacuation orders for thousands of residents after growing from 30 to nearly 5,400 acres. Fueled by extreme heat and dry conditions, the blaze remains active, though firefighters have achieved 28% containment and reduced some evacuation orders to warnings. A Kern County firefighter sustained serious injuries when his truck rolled down a steep hillside while battling the fire. This is one of several active wildfires in California, where experts say climate change has contributed to longer and more destructive fire seasons.</p>

          <p>Dr. Vinay Prasad is returning to his position as director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research just over a week after his departure. Prasad, an oncologist and critic of U.S. COVID-19 policies, left the agency amid controversy surrounding the approval of a gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and intense criticism from far-right influencer Laura Loomer. His return, which occurred at the FDA's request, has been met with renewed attacks from Loomer. Prasad's initial appointment in May was followed by a tumultuous period involving scrutiny over the agency's decisions and his public statements.</p>

The demonstration, organized by Defend Our Juries, saw scores of activists display signs with messages like "I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action," leading to their immediate arrest. The government's decision to proscribe the group followed a break-in and vandalism at an RAF base in June. Protesters and civil liberties advocates argue the ban illegally restricts freedom of expression and is dangerously authoritarian.</p>

          <p>Bollywood's depiction of Kashmir has dramatically shifted over the decades, moving from a scenic paradise for romance films to a complex backdrop for stories of conflict, militancy, and identity. Early films used the region's beauty as an escape, but the armed insurgency of the late 1980s transformed its cinematic image into one of militarization and fear. More recent films, such as "Haider," have explored the psychological toll of the conflict on its people. Critics note that contemporary cinema often aligns with Indian government narratives, particularly after the 2019 abrogation of Article 370, reflecting a more nationalistic perspective.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has observed North Korea removing some of its propaganda loudspeakers from the inter-Korean border, a potential sign of de-escalation. This action follows South Korea's own move to dismantle its speakers, which had broadcast anti-Pyongyang messages and K-pop music across the border. The tit-for-tat psychological warfare campaigns had heightened tensions amid North Korea's advancing nuclear program. The move is seen as a reciprocal gesture after South Korea's new liberal government halted its broadcasts in a bid to improve relations, though Pyongyang has previously rebuffed diplomatic overtures from the new administration.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from her new memoir, former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has denied any conspiracy to ruin her predecessor and mentor, the late Alex Salmond. She writes that Salmond was unwilling to show contrition for his "inappropriate" behavior towards women and sought to destroy the Scottish National Party rather than see it succeed without him. Sturgeon describes the shock of learning about the allegations and her refusal to intervene in the investigation, which she says made the end of their political partnership inevitable. She characterizes Salmond's claims of a conspiracy as a fabrication from a man unprepared to reflect on his own conduct.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Friedrich Merz's decision to halt German arms exports to Israel for use in Gaza has created a rift within his own conservative CDU/CSU alliance. Some party members sharply criticized the move as a departure from Germany's long-standing foreign policy and its special responsibility toward Israel. However, the decision has also found support from other conservatives and the junior coalition partner, the Social Democrats, who argue that while they stand in solidarity with Israel, wrongs must be called out.

Under the plan, which is part of the archdiocese's bankruptcy proceedings, different types of abuse are assigned varying point values, with a sexual assault claim worth 75 points. The final monetary value of each point depends on the total settlement fund and the total points awarded across all claims. The proposal faces opposition from some survivors' attorneys, who are urging a "no" vote, potentially sending the cases back to individual lawsuits.</p>

          <h2>Mediterranean Sea Faces Mounting Environmental Crises from Pollution and Overfishing</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Mediterranean Sea is confronting severe environmental challenges, including plastic pollution, overfishing, and the impacts of climate change. Fishermen from Libya to Egypt report dwindling catches, blaming industrial trawlers and pollution from sewage for destroying marine life and their livelihoods. In response, countries like Egypt and Algeria are implementing national plans to protect coastlines, reduce plastic use, and better monitor fishing activities. While global agreements like the High Seas Treaty offer hope for ocean protection, local fishermen and activists remain skeptical, urging for more direct involvement and tangible resources to protect their marine environment.</p>

          <h2>A Historical Overview of Gerrymandering and the Republican 'Redmap' Strategy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a historical analysis of how partisan gerrymandering, particularly through the Republican 'Redmap' project, has reshaped American politics. Following the 2008 election, Republican strategists targeted state legislative races in 2010 to gain control of the redistricting process, successfully locking in a significant advantage in Congress and statehouses for a decade. This entrenchment allowed for conservative policies often at odds with majority public opinion. Despite grassroots reform efforts and some court victories, a 2019 Supreme Court decision declared partisan gerrymandering a non-justiciable issue, removing federal oversight and fueling the current redistricting battles in states like Texas.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly presented a posthumous Soviet-era award, the Order of Lenin, to the son of a senior CIA official who was killed while fighting with Russian forces in Ukraine. The award for 21-year-old Michael Gloss was given to President Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, during a visit to Moscow. Gloss's mother is Juliane Gallina, the CIA's deputy director for digital innovation. The CIA stated that Gloss, who was never a CIA employee, had been suffering from mental health issues. The event occurred as a summit between Trump and Putin was confirmed.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has subpoenaed New York Attorney General Letitia James to testify regarding her civil fraud investigation into President Donald Trump. James successfully sued Trump in 2023 for overvaluing his properties to secure favorable loans, a judgment he is currently appealing. James's office, which has also been subpoenaed over its investigation into the NRA, called the move a "weaponization of the justice system." Her lawyer described it as a blatant act of political retribution by the Trump administration, which has previously accused James of mortgage fraud without filing charges.</p>

          <p>Official documents reveal that radioactive water from the Royal Navy's Coulport nuclear weapons base leaked into Loch Long in Scotland due to repeatedly bursting old pipes. The files, obtained after a six-year freedom of information battle, indicate that the navy failed to properly maintain its water pipe network, leading to an "unnecessary radioactive waste" release containing low levels of tritium in 2019. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) stated the risk to the environment was of "no regulatory concern," and the Ministry of Defence asserted there were no unsafe releases, but Sepa also noted "shortfalls in maintenance."</p>

          <p>In response to President Trump's aggressive push for Republican gerrymandering in states like Texas, the Democratic party is adopting a more combative strategy, shifting from its previous "go high" motto to a "fight fire with fire" approach. Democratic governors in California, Illinois, and New York have signaled their intent to retaliate with their own redistricting efforts to neutralize any Republican advantage. This marks a significant tactical shift, with prominent figures like former Attorney General Eric Holder now advocating for Democrats to use gerrymandering to counter what they see as an authoritarian, anti-democracy effort.</p>

          <p>An abandoned 19th-century college campus in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, has been redeveloped into a 205-unit luxury apartment building called The Hartby. Developers Matt Linde and Udi Kore secured a 99-year ground lease and invested over $104 million to renovate the historic St. John's College site, which had been deteriorating since 1972. The project preserved original architectural elements like exposed brick and arched windows while adding modern amenities and a new wing. The building includes 62 affordable housing units, with market-rate apartments renting for between $3,130 and $6,950 per month.</p>

          <p>William Bengen, the financial advisor who created the well-known "4% rule" for retirement withdrawals, now suggests a revised figure of 4.7% for the most conservative retirees. His updated research incorporates a more diversified portfolio, including small-company and international stocks, which he argues allows for a higher safe withdrawal rate. Bengen notes that inflation is the greatest threat to retirees and suggests that for today's economic climate, a withdrawal rate around 5.25% to 5.5% could be appropriate, emphasizing the need for personalization.
