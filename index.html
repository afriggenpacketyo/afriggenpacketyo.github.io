          <p>A federal judge has blocked a Trump administration order that halted construction on the Revolution Wind farm off the New England coast. The Danish company Orsted announced it will resume work on the nearly completed project, which is set to power over 350,000 homes. The judge ruled that the Interior Department's stop-work order was likely arbitrary and unlawful, marking a significant setback for the administration's efforts to curtail the offshore wind industry. This legal victory allows the fully permitted project to proceed despite broader political opposition to renewable energy development.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut is making home equity loans more affordable for homeowners, who are currently sitting on record levels of equity. A typical $100,000 home equity loan now has a lower monthly payment compared to earlier in the year, although the decrease is not dramatic. The article breaks down the potential monthly costs for 10- and 15-year loans, comparing them to previous rates and also to variable-rate HELOCs. With further rate cuts anticipated, homeowners may find borrowing against their home equity an increasingly attractive option for accessing funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bruce Pearl, the head coach of Auburn University's men's basketball team, is reportedly set to retire before the 2025-26 season, with his son Steven expected to succeed him. The announcement has intensified speculation that Pearl may pursue a political career, potentially running for a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama. Pearl, who has been an outspoken supporter of Israel and former President Trump, has previously discussed the possibility of entering politics but questioned if he could make a greater impact there than as a coach. He led the Tigers to two Final Four appearances during his tenure.</p>

          <p>Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, has been removed as a patron or ambassador by six different charities after a 2011 email surfaced. In the message, she referred to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as her "supreme friend," seemingly contradicting her previous public statements denouncing him. Charities including the Teenage Cancer Trust and the British Heart Foundation have severed ties, stating her continued involvement was inappropriate.

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to formally announce a link between the use of acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, during pregnancy and the development of autism. According to reports, federal health officials will warn against its use in early pregnancy for non-fever conditions and also highlight a form of folate as a potential treatment. The planned announcement aligns with previous statements from President Trump and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. about uncovering the causes of autism. This move is anticipated despite major medical organizations maintaining that acetaminophen is safe when used as directed.</p>

          <p>A Guardian editorial contends that Donald Trump's recent statements, particularly his declaration of hating his opponents at the Charlie Kirk memorial, reveal a dangerous political approach. The article argues that his administration seeks not to criminalize hate speech, but rather to criminalize speech that it hates, creating a chilling effect on dissent. By blurring lines between truth and lies, such as with claims about Tylenol and autism, he erodes public trust in science for political gain. The editorial concludes that this strategy inverts the American model of free expression, selectively punishing foes while degrading the conditions for honest debate.</p>

The city is planning a $1.3 billion seawall to protect its historic downtown, but the project will not extend to lower-income, historically Black neighborhoods, leaving them more vulnerable. As frequent flooding becomes the norm, residents are experiencing property loss and anxiety, while new construction continues to pave over wetlands that once absorbed stormwater.

Costs are influenced by factors such as the chosen plan's coverage level, the beneficiary's age, location, and tobacco use.

          <p>Michelob Ultra has surpassed Modelo Especial as the best-selling beer in the U.S., according to new sales data. The light lager, owned by Anheuser-Busch, now leads in both retail channels and in bars and restaurants. This marks a significant turnaround for AB InBev, whose Bud Light brand lost the top spot two years ago following a conservative backlash. Modelo's decline coincides with challenges for its parent company, Constellation Brands, including tariffs and reportedly weaker spending from its core Hispanic consumer base, which has been impacted by immigration policies.</p>

          <p>A violent riot between rival gangs at a prison in Machala, Ecuador, has resulted in the deaths of 13 inmates and one guard. The clash involved firearms and explosives, and an unknown number of prisoners managed to escape during the chaos, though 13 have since been recaptured. The incident is the latest in a series of deadly confrontations within Ecuador's overcrowded and gang-controlled prison system. The violence underscores the country's ongoing struggle with powerful drug trafficking organizations, which have contributed to a state of "internal armed conflict" declared by the president earlier this year.</p>

          <p>Thousands of people participated in a day of strikes and protests across Italy in solidarity with Palestinians, leading to clashes with police in several cities. The largest demonstrations occurred in Milan and Rome, with reports of around 60 police officers injured during confrontations near Milan's central station. The protests, coordinated by trade unions, caused widespread disruption to public transport and universities. The events highlight ongoing political tensions in Italy over the government's stance on the Gaza conflict, which differs from other European nations like France that have moved to formally recognize a Palestinian state.</p>

          <p>The UK health and beauty chain Bodycare will permanently close all its remaining 56 stores by the end of the week, resulting in the loss of 444 jobs. The company's administrators announced that after failing to find a buyer, the business was no longer viable to continue trading due to stock shortages and high operating costs. Founded in 1970, the value-focused retailer struggled against intense competition from supermarkets, larger chains like Boots and Superdrug, and online sellers.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture under the Trump administration has announced the cancellation of its annual Household Food Security Report. The administration described the 30-year-old survey as "redundant, costly, politicized, and extraneous." Anti-hunger advocates and policy experts criticized the move, stating the report is a critical data source for understanding the scale of hunger in the U.S. and shaping effective policy. Critics suggest the cancellation is politically motivated, as it comes after policy changes that are expected to increase food insecurity, and ending the survey will obscure the impact of those changes.</p>

          <p>A magnitude 4.3 earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay Area early Monday morning, centered near Berkeley. The quake, which occurred just before 3 a.m., was widely felt across the region, waking many residents and causing shaking strong enough to knock items off shelves. While there were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries, the event prompted Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) to run trains at reduced speeds for safety inspections. The earthquake serves as a reminder of the seismic risks in the region and the importance of preparedness for a larger event.</p>

          <p>In a speech to the Economic Club of New York, newly appointed Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran made a case for aggressive cuts to the central bank's benchmark interest rate. He argued that current monetary policy is overly restrictive and risks harming employment, suggesting rates should be nearly two percentage points lower. Miran cited factors like changing immigration policies, easing rental costs, and tariff revenues as disinflationary pressures that justify a more significant rate reduction. His stance places him in dissent with the majority of his colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The price of gold has surged to a new record high, surpassing $3,700 per ounce, as investors seek a safe-haven asset amid economic uncertainty and await clues on future interest rate cuts. Gold typically performs well during periods of low interest rates and geopolitical instability. For investors looking to gain exposure, most experts recommend using an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the price of physical gold rather than buying bullion directly. Financial advisors generally suggest limiting gold to a small portion of a well-diversified portfolio, typically less than 3%. (not investment advice)</p>
