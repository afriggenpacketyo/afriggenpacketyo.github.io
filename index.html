          <p>New Jersey's first statewide transit strike in 40 years began Friday, leaving thousands of commuters scrambling for alternative transportation. The strike, initiated by the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, stems from a wage dispute with New Jersey Transit. Governor Philip D. Murphy apologized to commuters, blaming union leaders for rejecting a fair offer, while union representatives assert they've been working without a contract or pay raise for six years. Negotiations are expected to resume soon, but the strike's duration remains uncertain, causing widespread disruption and frustration among riders.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has extended its block on the Trump administration's attempt to deport Venezuelan migrants under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. The court's order maintains a previous injunction, preventing the removal of Venezuelans detained in Texas while they challenge their deportations. Justices Alito and Thomas dissented from the unsigned order. The ACLU argued that the administration's actions violated an earlier Supreme Court decision requiring adequate notice and habeas claims for those subject to the 1798 law, raising concerns about potential removals to a dangerous prison in El Salvador.</p>

          <p>Airlines, hotels, and analysts are forecasting a bleak tourism season in the United States due to unpopular policy decisions and trade tensions. Canadian travel to the U.S. has significantly declined, and major hotel chains are experiencing slower growth. Tourism Economics projects a notable decrease in international arrivals, attributing it to concerns about trade, rhetoric, and immigration policies. While arrivals from some European countries have rebounded, overall travel spending is softening, with more Americans opting for domestic trips due to economic fears.

The approval comes after concerns about unregulated blood tests for Alzheimer's, with the FDA seeking stricter oversight of laboratory-developed tests.

          <p>A military parade to mark the Army's anniversary next month — coinciding with President Trump's birthday — is estimated to cost between $25 million and $45 million, an Army spokesperson told CBS News. The price estimate encompasses the whole festival, including the events leading up to the parade. The parade in Washington, D.C., is expected to include over 100 vehicles and thousands of soldiers who will be housed in federal buildings. It could also involve 50 helicopters, prompting "extensive coordination" with the Federal Aviation Administration, the spokesperson said.</p>

          <p>The Illinois House passed legislation on Thursday requiring more thorough background checks before police officers are hired, less than a year after a Sangamon County Sheriff's deputy shot and killed Sonya Massey. Law enforcement agencies would not be allowed to make a final job offer for police officers without first inspecting all of their prior employment records. Anyone applying for a police officer job in Illinois would be required to authorize all previous employers, including other law enforcement agencies, to provide full employment records. The legislation was passed unanimously by the Illinois Senate last month, and will go to Gov. JB Pritzker's desk.</p>

          <p>Before zooming to Joliet for this weekend's Route 66 NHRA Nationals, a crew of drag racers — including "fastest female on earth" Brittany Force — made a pit stop in downtown Chicago.
