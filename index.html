        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Starbucks has announced a significant restructuring plan to address ongoing challenges, which includes eliminating approximately 900 non-retail positions and closing underperforming coffeehouses. According to an internal memo from CEO Brian Niccol, these changes are part of the "Back to Starbucks" plan aimed at enhancing customer experience and improving financial performance. While the company will close about 1% of its North American locations in fiscal year 2025, it also plans to renovate over 1,000 stores and resume growth in 2026. The company will provide severance packages to affected employees and aims to transfer others to nearby locations where possible.</p>

          <p>Amazon has agreed to a $2.5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, resolving allegations that the company used deceptive practices to enroll customers in its Prime subscription service and made cancellation difficult. The lawsuit, filed in 2023, claimed millions were tricked into signing up for the $139-a-year program. As part of the agreement, Amazon must provide clear disclosures about Prime's terms, obtain explicit consent before charging customers, and offer a straightforward cancellation process. The settlement was reached just three days into the trial, avoiding a lengthy court battle for the e-commerce giant.</p>

          <p>A new COVID-19 strain, named XFG or "Stratus," is causing a spike in cases across nine U.S. states, including New York and New Jersey. The World Health Organization has designated it a "variant under monitoring" after it was first detected in Southeast Asia and has since spread globally. While the CDC identifies XFG as the predominant variant in the U.S., health officials note its mutations allow it to better evade the immune system. However, the change is considered marginal, and symptoms for most vaccinated individuals remain mild, including fatigue, cough, and brain fog, with severe illness being rare.</p>

          <p>The individual who attacked the Dallas Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office reportedly left behind a note stating a desire to inflict "real terror" on federal agents. The FBI identified the sniper as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, who killed one detainee and critically injured two others before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. An investigation revealed evidence of significant pre-attack planning, including online searches for tracking ICE agents and messages engraved on ammunition. The incident has prompted heightened security at all ICE facilities and has been condemned by officials as a politically motivated act of targeted violence.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, numerous foreign e-commerce companies have flooded social media platforms with advertisements for unauthorized memorial merchandise. An investigation by The Guardian identified several China-based firms, such as Guangzhou Shiwei Network Technology, using deceptive tactics like listing fake U.S. addresses and falsely promising to donate profits to Kirk's family or organization, Turning Point USA. These companies are leveraging the politically charged event to drive sales of items like "Echo of Freedom" t-shirts, a practice experts describe as a lucrative form of disinformation and astroturfing that exploits moments of national division.</p>

          <p>Shares of nuclear power startup Oklo have dropped 15% in two days following significant stock sales by top executives and a cautious outlook from Goldman Sachs. The investment bank initiated coverage with a neutral rating, citing the company's full valuation and the risks associated with its business strategy. Oklo, which has seen its stock soar over 470% this year on enthusiasm for its potential to power AI data centers, has yet to secure a necessary license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or generate any revenue. The recent insider selling, including by the CEO and CFO, has added to investor concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Polish mountaineer Andrzej Bargiel has made history by becoming the first person to ski down Mount Everest from its 8,849-meter summit without using supplemental oxygen. The remarkable feat required him to spend 16 hours in the "death zone," the area above 8,000 meters where low oxygen levels pose extreme risks. This achievement is part of Bargiel's larger project to ski down the world's highest peaks. While a few ski descents of Everest have been completed before, none have been done continuously without the aid of bottled oxygen, marking a groundbreaking milestone in the world of high-altitude ski mountaineering.</p>

          <p>Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, is encountering significant backlash from fellow Labour Party MPs regarding his perceived ambitions to challenge Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer for leadership. Burnham has recently criticized the government and claimed that some MPs have encouraged him to run. However, a majority of Labour MPs contacted by the BBC expressed opposition, with some calling the idea "madness" and "self-indulgent" so soon after a general election. While a few backbenchers are supportive of Burnham's vision, the prevailing sentiment within the party appears to be against a leadership contest, urging him to focus on his role in Manchester.</p>

The prolonged shutdown has raised serious concerns about the financial stability of JLR's smaller suppliers, prompting the UK government to consider intervention measures.

The report highlights immediate financial impacts, such as billions in GDP losses from wildfires, which also contribute to rising electricity bills and health costs from smoke exposure.

          <p>New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft has agreed to sell an 8% minority stake in the NFL franchise in a deal that values the team at $9 billion. The buyers are reportedly Sixth Street Capital and investor Dean Metropoulos. Kraft originally purchased the team in 1994 for $172 million. According to sources, the money from the sale will remain on the team's balance sheet, pushing its post-money valuation even higher. The deal, which does not include the Kraft family's MLS team, the New England Revolution, is still pending approval from the NFL's finance committee.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey is expected to be indicted on criminal charges in a Virginia federal court in the coming days, according to a report from MSNBC. While the full extent of the charges is unclear, they are believed to be related to accusations that he lied to Congress in 2020. The potential indictment follows the recent resignation of the interim U.S. attorney for the district, who reportedly opposed bringing charges, and his replacement by a lawyer who has previously represented President Trump. Trump has long targeted Comey, whom he fired as FBI director during his first term.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell commented that by many measures, U.S. stock prices are "fairly highly valued," a sentiment that suggests the market may be overextended. While not a direct policy statement, his observation acknowledges that stock valuations, such as the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, are significantly above their historical averages. The S&P 500's current P/E ratio is trading at a 41% premium compared to its 20-year average, indicating that investors are paying more for corporate earnings than they have historically.

          <p>The United States government appears to be borrowing from China's playbook by adopting a more interventionist industrial policy, according to some economic analysts. This shift is seen as a response to escalating geopolitical tensions and concerns about supply chain vulnerabilities for strategic industries like defense technology and advanced electronics. Experts note that Washington is moving away from relying solely on market forces to ensure adequate domestic supply capacity for critical inputs such as semiconductors and essential minerals. This strategic change reflects a realization that a more direct government role is needed in the economic race with Beijing.</p>
