        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Data from the 2024-25 school year in England reveals a strong correlation between first-week attendance and overall school presence. Over half of pupils who were partially absent in the first week became "persistently absent," missing at least 10% of the term, compared to just 14% of those with full attendance initially. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson urged parents and schools to prioritize getting children in from the start of the new term to combat high absence levels, which have remained elevated since the pandemic. The government is implementing support hubs, though unions argue a more comprehensive strategy is needed to address the root causes of absenteeism.</p>

          <p>Chelsea and England defender Millie Bright has spoken about her decision to withdraw from the Euro 2025 squad, calling it the "best decision I have ever made." The 32-year-old captain cited the need for a mental and physical break after a demanding season where she led her club to a domestic treble. Bright revealed she felt on the verge of a breakdown and recognized she couldn't perform at her best, prompting her to prioritize her well-being over pleasing others. After undergoing knee surgery and starting counseling, she now feels "back to life" and prepared for the upcoming Women's Super League season.</p>

          <p>An opinion article highlights the decision by Nottinghamshire’s Reform-led council to ban reporters from the Nottingham Post and BBC, drawing parallels to Donald Trump's confrontational approach with the US press. The author argues this is part of a broader trend where right-wing politicians bypass traditional media, creating a narrative that pits them against an establishment "foil" for political gain. While acknowledging that figures like Trump and Nigel Farage still use mainstream media when it suits them, the piece questions whether such tactics will succeed in the UK political culture. The article suggests that dodging local scrutiny could ultimately backfire by raising questions about the party's competence.</p>

          <p>Dr. Sohan Dasgupta, a political appointee who led the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), has stepped down after a four-month tenure, declaring his "mission accomplished." During his time, Dasgupta pushed the U.S. foreign aid agency to shift its focus from traditional development goals towards strategic investments that benefit American national security and economic interests, particularly in countering Chinese influence. The MCC, created in 2004, provides large-scale grants for infrastructure to developing countries meeting governance standards. Dasgupta's leadership aligned the agency's work with the Trump administration's "America First" policy, emphasizing return on investment and strategic partnerships in regions with critical resources.</p>

          <p>Manchester United narrowly defeated Burnley 3-2 with a stoppage-time penalty, providing a crucial win for manager Ruben Amorim but highlighting persistent issues with the team's goalkeepers. Recent matches have seen costly errors from both Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana, leading Amorim to admit the team is in a moment where any shot near their box feels threatening. The manager defended his players, stating they are human and struggling with the pressure surrounding the club. The victory does little to ease concerns, as the team has yet to win consecutive Premier League games under Amorim and faces a difficult upcoming schedule.</p>

          <p>UCLA's football season began with a disappointing 43-10 loss to Utah at the Rose Bowl, exposing significant weaknesses on both sides of the ball. The defense struggled with tackling and failed to pressure Utah's quarterback, who accounted for nearly 300 yards of offense and led the Utes to convert 14 of 17 third downs. Offensively, new quarterback Nico Iamaleava had a difficult debut, and the running game was ineffective, with the team's mistakes described as "self-inflicted." The lopsided defeat marks a significant setback after the team's strong finish last season, raising questions about their readiness for the new campaign.</p>

          <p>An anti-war demonstration in Cologne, Germany, escalated into violence, resulting in injuries to dozens of protesters and twelve police officers. The march, organized by an alliance called "Disarm Rheinmetall," drew approximately 3,000 participants protesting the German arms manufacturer. According to police, some demonstrators wore illegal face coverings, set off pyrotechnics, and attacked officers, prompting the use of batons and tear gas. Protest organizers accused the police of kettling demonstrators and depriving them of water and medical care. The clashes highlight the tense atmosphere surrounding arms production and military policy in the country.</p>

          <p>Germany is marking the 10th anniversary of former Chancellor Angela Merkel's famous declaration, "wir schaffen das" ("we can do it"), which signaled the country's open-door policy to refugees in 2015. The decision led to the arrival of hundreds of thousands of displaced people and has since sparked profound changes in German society, culture, and politics. While data shows nearly two-thirds of refugees from that wave were employed by 2022, challenges remain, with migrants facing higher unemployment rates. The anniversary has reignited national debate, with current Chancellor Friedrich Merz distancing himself from the policy and emphasizing the need for controlled immigration and better integration.</p>

The drones are equipped with loudspeakers that blast sounds like AC/DC's "Thunderstruck," clips from movies, and live human voices to haze the predators and interrupt their hunts. This creative, nonlethal method is part of an ongoing effort to find ways for ranchers and the recovering wolf population to coexist. While initial results show success in scaring wolves away, the long-term effectiveness is still being studied, as wolves can become habituated to deterrents. The high cost of the technology also presents a barrier for widespread adoption by ranchers.</p>

This appears to contradict the prince's previous assertion that he cut off all contact with Epstein in December 2010.

          <p>Los Angeles City Councilmember Ysabel Jurado has publicly opposed plans for a new Home Depot in Eagle Rock, accusing the retailer of being complicit in federal immigration raids. Her statement follows a recent operation where federal agents apprehended day laborers and vendors in the parking lot of a Westlake Home Depot, one of several such raids since June. Jurado argued that Home Depot's silence on the repeated targeting of its locations makes the company complicit in what she called acts of terror. A Home Depot spokesperson stated the company is not notified of the raids and is required to follow all federal and local regulations.</p>

          <h2>Chicago Mayor Issues Executive Order to Counter Potential Federal Agent Deployment</h2>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order aimed at protecting residents' rights amid reports of a potential deployment of federal agents for immigration enforcement. The order seeks to bar city departments, including the police, from participating in federal actions that violate residents' rights and prohibits officers from wearing masks that conceal their identity. While largely symbolic, the move sends a clear message to the Trump administration that a militarized presence is unwelcome. The order directs city agencies to provide information on residents' rights and to regularly request federal data on immigration enforcement activities, reflecting growing tensions between the city and the federal government.</p>

Fuhrmann, however, went to the police and agreed to wear a wire, capturing Guglielmelli confirming he wanted his wife dead for a price of $80,000.

          <p>The USC Trojans started their 2025 football season with an overwhelming 73-13 victory against Missouri State at the Coliseum. Quarterback Jayden Maiava was highly efficient, throwing for 295 yards and two touchdowns before being rested at halftime. The offense was explosive, averaging over 10 yards per play and scoring on multiple long touchdowns, while the defense registered five sacks and a pick-six. The lopsided score, the most points USC has scored since 1930, allowed the team to give significant playing time to backups, including five-star freshman quarterback Husan Longstreet, who played the entire second half in the comfortable win.</p>

          <p>The 2013 death of Google executive Forrest Hayes from a heroin overdose on his yacht brought Alix Tichelman, an aspiring model he met on a "sugar daddy" website, into the spotlight. Surveillance video from the yacht captured Tichelman administering the fatal dose and then failing to call for help, instead gathering her belongings and leaving as Hayes was dying. Investigators used a sting operation to arrest her, posing as a potential client. Tichelman ultimately pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter, with prosecutors noting that while she did not intend to kill Hayes, her failure to render aid was criminal. The case also drew attention to the death of her former boyfriend from an overdose just months earlier.</p>

          <p>Verizon customers across the United States reported widespread cellphone outages on Saturday, with many devices being limited to "SOS mode" for several hours. The company acknowledged a "software issue" was impacting wireless service for some customers and stated its engineers were working quickly to resolve the problem. Reports of the outage peaked in the afternoon, with tens of thousands of complaints logged on the service tracking site DownDetector from coast to coast. In SOS mode, phones can still make emergency calls by connecting to other available carrier networks, but regular calls, texts, and data services are unavailable, causing significant disruption for users.</p>

          <p>Despite recent polls showing rising favorability, Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), is facing internal anxiety over who will succeed Chairman Eric Chu when he steps down in October. A new poll indicates the KMT's favorability rating has edged past that of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), whose public discontent has reached a new high. This presents a significant political opportunity for the KMT to regain ground. However, the party is currently preoccupied with a looming leadership contest, with the role of chairman being viewed by some as a "poisoned chalice" during a volatile period in Taiwanese politics.</p>
