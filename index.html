          <p>President Trump's associates and crypto entrepreneurs are re-entering the SPAC market, which had previously been a hot investment vehicle. These SPACs are inherently speculative, allowing people to raise money without a clear business plan, and they often target cryptocurrency or blockchain companies. The market has seen a resurgence due to the stock market's upswing, demand for crypto, and small investors seeking quick gains. The article cautions that this market is a gamble, as investors have no idea what the sponsors might buy, making it a speculative venture. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A TikTok trend suggests that a McDonald's Coca-Cola and fries combination, dubbed the 'McMigraine,' can alleviate headache symptoms. Doctors note that the caffeine and carbonation in Coke, along with the sodium and carbohydrates in fries, may provide temporary relief by constricting blood vessels, settling the stomach, and correcting electrolyte imbalances. However, they caution that this is not a cure and may worsen migraines for some individuals, recommending hydration and alternatives like matcha or green tea.
