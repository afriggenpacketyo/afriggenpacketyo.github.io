          <p>International Business Machines (IBM) experienced a significant stock drop despite reporting second-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. The company's software revenue grew by 10%, slightly missing analyst consensus, while consulting and infrastructure revenue both beat forecasts. CEO Arvind Krishna noted that some clients are acting cautiously due to geopolitical tensions, but expressed optimism about future M&A opportunities in a rational regulatory environment. IBM maintained its full-year guidance for revenue growth and free cash flow. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is planning a massive dam on the Yarlung Tsangpo river in Tibet, which could become the world's largest, producing three times the electricity of the Three Gorges Dam. While intended to meet local demand, a significant portion of the power is slated for external consumption, raising concerns in neighboring countries like India. Chinese observers suggest this project could enhance Beijing's influence over power-deficient nations in South Asia, including Nepal, Bangladesh, and Myanmar, by positioning China as a major regional energy provider.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article from Fox News discusses New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani's trip to Uganda, framing it as a political strategy to avoid scrutiny over his socialist and communist past. The author argues that the trip, officially for a wedding celebration, serves to hide Mamdani from the press and delay difficult questions, a tactic compared to hiding other controversial candidates. The piece suggests this strategy might succeed unless his opponents unite behind a single challenger to force him to campaign on his record.</p>

          <p>Tesla reported a sharp decline in both revenue and profit for the second quarter, with a 12% drop in revenue and a 16% slump in profits. Analysts attribute the downturn to CEO Elon Musk's political activities, which have tarnished the company's brand image, particularly among its key customer demographics. The article highlights that while Musk is focusing the company's future on robotaxis and AI, competitors are gaining market share and the recent elimination of federal EV credits poses another headwind for the company.

          <p>The word "OK" is one of the most universally recognized terms, originating as a joke in 19th-century America.

The term gained widespread popularity during President Martin Van Buren's 1840 reelection campaign, as his nickname "Old Kinderhook" aligned with the "O.K." initials. Its simplicity and versatility helped it spread globally, especially with the rise of telegraphy and its use by American soldiers abroad.</p>

While the National Association of Realtors supports reform, experts suggest that raising the existing exemption is more likely than a complete elimination of the tax. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the first six months of President Trump's second term, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is on track for its highest number of annual deportations since the Obama administration. Internal data shows nearly 150,000 deportations, projecting to over 300,000 for the year. While a significant increase, this figure remains far below the administration's stated goal of one million annual deportations, highlighting operational constraints. The agency has received a major funding increase and plans to hire 10,000 more agents to expand its enforcement efforts.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has issued a temporary ruling allowing President Trump to fire, without cause, three members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) who were appointed by President Biden. This action challenges a long-standing precedent, Humphrey's Executor, which protects the independence of certain regulatory agencies by limiting the president's removal power. The fired commissioners had sued, arguing their removal was unlawful, and a lower court had temporarily blocked the firings. The Supreme Court's decision, with the three liberal justices dissenting, allows the terminations to proceed while the case continues.</p>

          <p>Earth Overshoot Day, the date when humanity's resource consumption for the year exceeds the planet's ability to regenerate, has arrived on July 24, over a week earlier than last year. According to the Global Footprint Network, this acceleration is partly due to new data showing oceans absorb less CO2 than previously thought. The trend of overconsumption, visible in deforestation and biodiversity loss, has been ongoing since the 1970s. Experts call for a shift from an extractive to a regenerative economy, highlighting solutions like carbon pricing and renewable energy to push the date back.</p>

Despite filing felony cases against dozens, many have been dismissed or reduced to misdemeanors after grand juries refused to indict, an unusually rare outcome. Anonymous sources within the office claim Essayli is pushing prosecutors to bring cases regardless of their strength to align with directives from the Attorney General.

          <p>"Corn sweat" is the informal term for the moisture released by vast fields of corn through a process called evapotranspiration, which significantly increases humidity during hot, sunny weather. While a natural process for plants to cool themselves, the immense scale of corn cultivation in the Midwest can make heat waves feel more oppressive and dangerous, raising the heat index. This heightened humidity can offset the natural cooling effect of transpiration and prevent temperatures from dropping at night, increasing the risk of heat-related illnesses for vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes whether a 6-month certificate of deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account is a better option for a $10,000 deposit in the current economic climate. While a high-yield savings account offers flexibility, its variable interest rate is likely to decrease with anticipated rate cuts. A 6-month CD, conversely, offers a slightly higher, guaranteed interest rate, ensuring a predictable return for those who can afford to lock their money away for the term. The calculation shows the CD would likely earn more guaranteed interest over the six-month period. (not investment advice)</p>
