          <h2>Snap Shares Plummet Following Disappointing Guidance Due to Macroeconomic Headwinds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-29 16:43:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Snap experienced a 14% drop in shares after reporting better-than-expected first-quarter revenue but declining to provide guidance for the second quarter, citing macroeconomic uncertainties affecting advertising demand. The company's CEO, Evan Spiegel, noted headwinds at the start of the current quarter, leading to a cautious approach to investment relative to revenue growth. This decision reflects concerns over potential constraints on advertising spending amid evolving global trade conditions under President Trump's policies. Despite these challenges, Snap reported 460 million global daily active users and lowered its full-year adjusted operating expenses, but the lack of guidance unsettled investors.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed an executive order to soften some of the automotive tariffs his administration had recently implemented, responding to lobbying from automakers and policy groups concerned about the cumulative impact of multiple duties. The easing of tariffs aims to alleviate regulatory uncertainty and reduce costs for the car industry, with automakers like GM, Ford, and Stellantis expressing appreciation for the changes. However, companies continue to face significant cost increases, with GM having discontinued its 2025 guidance due to the tariff situation. The move signals an attempt to balance trade policies with the needs of the domestic auto industry.</p>

This new partnership would allow customers to earn and redeem loyalty points on a more extensive network, enhancing JetBlue's appeal to customers who frequently travel to destinations not currently served by the airline.</p>

CEO James Quincey emphasized responding to consumer behavior rather than sentiment and noted potential short-term choppiness tied to trade conflicts.

          <p>Starbucks reported weaker-than-expected earnings and a continued decline in same-store sales, but the company indicated that its turnaround strategy is showing early signs of success. CEO Brian Niccol emphasized improvements in marketing and service speeds as part of the "Back to Starbucks" plan, which aims to refocus on coffee and the customer experience. The company's operating margin fell due to increased labor costs and promotional spending, and global same-store sales declined by 1%, driven by lower transactions in the U.S. and flat sales in China. Despite the challenges, Starbucks plans to enhance its cafes and overhaul its innovation process to improve the customer experience.</p>

          <p>This article examines Elon Musk's influence within the Trump administration, particularly his role in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), where he leads efforts to cut government agencies and reduce the federal workforce. Musk's methods have faced legal challenges and criticism, despite support from Republican voters and President Trump. While promising substantial cost savings, DOGE's actual cuts have fallen short of initial targets, and some claims of savings have been disputed. The article also details DOGE's attempts to shut down agencies and access federal data, raising concerns about conflicts of interest with Musk's business ventures and potential overreach of authority.</p>

          <p>UPS revealed plans to eliminate 20,000 jobs this year as part of a cost-cutting initiative linked to delivering fewer packages for Amazon, its largest customer. The layoffs will impact over 4% of its workforce, with the company also intending to close 73 facilities by June 2025. Despite these reductions, UPS maintains a "strong" relationship with Amazon, stating that the decrease in package volume was a strategic decision to focus on revenue quality and profitability. The company is also navigating potential risks from shifts in global trade policy, which could affect its revenue, particularly on trade lanes between China and the U.S.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust case against Google has shifted its focus to artificial intelligence (AI), arguing that Google could leverage its AI products to strengthen its monopoly in online search. The DOJ contends that Google's control of search helps improve its AI, creating a cycle that maintains its dominance and blocks competitors. The government is proposing remedies that address all ways users access Google search, including its AI chatbot Gemini, and is seeking to force Google to open its search data to competitors to level the playing field.

          <p>The White House criticized Amazon for considering displaying the cost of President Trump's tariffs next to the price of some products on its e-commerce site, calling it a "hostile and political act." Amazon responded by stating that the idea was only considered for its Amazon Haul section and was never approved. The incident underscores the tension between the Trump administration and major tech companies over tariffs and trade policies. The White House maintains that the tariffs are aimed at bringing back manufacturing jobs to the U.S. and protecting economic security.</p>
