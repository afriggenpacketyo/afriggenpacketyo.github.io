        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. federal government is nearing a shutdown as Republican and Democratic lawmakers remain deadlocked over a funding agreement. The central point of contention is the Democratic push to include an extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits in any temporary funding measure. Republicans argue that such policy matters should be negotiated separately from the essential process of funding the government. Without a resolution, federal agencies will begin to halt non-essential functions, furloughing hundreds of thousands of workers and impacting various government services.</p>

          <p>Following the disruption of a massive telecommunications network that posed a threat to the UN General Assembly, federal agents have discovered an additional 200,000 SIM cards at a New Jersey location. This brings the total number of seized cards to over 300,000, part of a sophisticated system powerful enough to disable cell towers and send millions of texts per minute. Investigators believe the network has connections to Chinese actors and was used for encrypted communication by organized crime groups, drug cartels, and human trafficking rings.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's Department of Justice has filed a novel civil rights lawsuit against pro-Palestinian groups and activists, accusing them of violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act. This 1994 law has historically been used to protect reproductive health clinics from harassment. The lawsuit alleges that activists protesting an event promoting Israeli settlement property sales at a New Jersey synagogue engaged in physical assault and disruption. Legal experts note the move is striking, as the administration has curtailed FACE Act enforcement for abortion clinics while applying it to a house of worship for the first time.</p>

          <p>During the first game of the AL Wild Card series between the Detroit Tigers and Cleveland Guardians, a broadcast camera was destroyed by a 100-mph foul ball. In an at-bat against Tigers pitcher Tarik Skubal, Guardians hitter Angel Martinez fouled off a pitch directly back into the lens of a camera positioned behind home plate, shattering it. The game was briefly paused for cleanup, providing a memorable moment in a tense, high-stakes postseason matchup. The Tigers ultimately secured a narrow victory in the crucial opening game of the series.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government plans to resume processing initial applications for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which has been closed to new applicants for four years due to legal challenges. According to a Justice Department proposal filed in an ongoing lawsuit, new applications would be accepted in every state except Texas. For Texas residents, existing DACA recipients could maintain deportation protection but would no longer be eligible for work permits. The proposal offers potential relief for thousands of young immigrants, though the program's long-term future remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>In a speech to senior military leaders, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced a major overhaul of military standards aimed at ending what he termed "woke" culture. The new directives include raising physical fitness requirements to a single "male level," ending racial quotas for promotions, and eliminating diversity-focused initiatives. Hegseth argued these changes are necessary to restore the military's "warrior ethos" and combat readiness. The speech, followed by remarks from President Trump, signals a significant and controversial shift in Pentagon policy and leadership priorities.</p>

          <p>A personal essay reflects on the tragic shooting at a Michigan Latter-day Saint church, which occurred the same day the faith's leader, Russell M. Nelson, passed away at 101. The author contrasts the politically charged hatred that motivated the violence with Nelson's final years of ministry, during which he urgently called on his followers to be peacemakers and reject contention. The article explores the challenge of Christ's teaching to love one's enemies in an era of deep division, suggesting Nelson's message is a powerful, if unfashionable, prescription for a violent world.</p>
