          <p>Shares of space infrastructure company Rocket Lab experienced an 8% jump, continuing a significant rally that has seen the stock nearly double in two months. This growth is attributed to a series of successful launches and a new contract with the European Space Agency to launch navigation satellites. The company has been ramping up production, now building an Electron rocket every 15 days to meet rising demand in the competitive space industry. The firm's market value has now swelled to over $19 billion since its Nasdaq debut in 2021. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A small medical evacuation plane crashed at London Southend Airport, resulting in the deaths of all four people on board. The victims included a Dutch pilot, a co-pilot, and a 31-year-old German nurse, Maria Fernanda Rojaz Ortiz, who was on her first day as a flight nurse. The aircraft, a Beech B200 Super King Air operated by Zeusch Aviation, crashed and exploded on Sunday afternoon. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch has launched an investigation, stating it is too early to speculate on the cause of the tragic accident.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense has granted contract awards of up to $200 million to leading artificial intelligence companies Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, and xAI. The funding, managed by the Chief Digital and AI Office, is intended to accelerate the military's adoption of advanced AI capabilities for national security challenges. This move aligns with recent efforts by these tech giants to expand their government-focused services, such as Elon Musk's xAI launching "Grok for Government." The collaborations aim to develop AI agents across various mission areas within the defense agency.</p>

          <p>NBA legend Shaquille O’Neal has publicly criticized a new Bleacher Report list of the top 100 NBA players ever, calling the placement of his late teammate Kobe Bryant at number 11 "criminal." The list ranked players like Michael Jordan, LeBron James, and O'Neal himself ahead of Bryant. O'Neal has consistently ranked Bryant among the top three players in his personal lists, emphasizing their on-court success and deep, albeit complex, friendship. Despite their public feuds as teammates, O'Neal and Bryant maintained a mutual respect, which O'Neal highlighted in his speech at Bryant's 2020 memorial service.</p>

          <p>As the new school year approaches, students face the critical decision between federal and private student loans in a high-interest-rate environment. Federal loans are generally recommended as the first option due to their fixed rates, income-driven repayment plans, and forgiveness programs, which provide a crucial safety net. However, federal borrowing limits often don't cover the full cost of attendance, creating a funding gap. Private loans can fill this gap but typically lack the flexible repayment options of federal loans and have rates dependent on credit history, making them a tool to be used cautiously.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has asked the Fed's inspector general to review a costly renovation of its Washington, D.C. buildings following sharp criticism from the White House. The project, initially estimated at $2.5 billion, has faced accusations of mismanagement and excessive spending from President Trump and other officials. The Fed, which is self-funded and not reliant on taxpayer money, has defended the project as necessary to address safety issues like asbestos and bring the aging buildings up to modern code. The review aims to address concerns about potential fraud, waste, and abuse in the controversial expansion.</p>

          <p>A group of 24 Democratic-led states, with California at the forefront, has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for withholding $6.8 billion in congressionally approved education funds. The suit argues the administration's action is unconstitutional, as the money was intended for programs supporting English learners, migrant students, and after-school activities. The administration claims the freeze is due to a review of funds allegedly used for policies contrary to its agenda.

          <p>The U.S. Navy's next-generation attack submarine program, SSN(X), is facing a significant delay, with production now pushed back to 2040 from its original 2031 start date. The delay is attributed to escalating costs, with each vessel projected to cost between $6.7 billion and $8 billion, and budget constraints that are also slowing the production of current Virginia-class submarines. This setback raises concerns about the U.S. maintaining its undersea dominance and the strain on the industrial base, as only two U.S. shipyards can build nuclear-powered submarines. Lawmakers are now examining the long-term strategic and industrial implications of this deferment. (not investment advice)</p>

The piece speculates on the future of this demographic shift if the housing cost advantage in red states diminishes.

          <p>A devastating fire at the Gabriel House assisted-living facility in Fall River, Massachusetts, has resulted in the deaths of nine residents and injuries to more than 30 others. Firefighters arrived to a chaotic scene with residents trapped in the three-story building, requiring numerous ladder rescues. While the fire was contained to one wing, heavy smoke spread throughout the structure, which officials noted is often more deadly than the flames themselves. Authorities are investigating the cause of the fire, which the local fire chief described as an "unfathomable tragedy."</p>

          <p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has suspended his police minister, Senzo Mchunu, and announced the formation of an independent commission to investigate serious allegations of police corruption. The move follows public claims by a high-ranking police commissioner that Mchunu has links to organized crime and has interfered in investigations. The commission will examine the role of senior officials in aiding a sophisticated criminal syndicate that has allegedly infiltrated law enforcement. This action comes as a major test for Ramaphosa's government, which has pledged to combat endemic corruption within the state.</p>

          <p>Morgan Stanley has downgraded cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike's stock from overweight to equal weight, suggesting it is time to "take a breather" after a 50% rise since April. The bank cited the stock's high valuation, which it believes fully prices in near-term growth expectations. However, CNBC's Jim Cramer disagreed with the assessment, viewing the subsequent dip as a buying opportunity and expressing confidence in the company's long-term performance. Cramer remains optimistic about CrowdStrike's ability to retain customers and grow, especially after recovering from a major IT glitch last year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) being in effect for 35 years, prospective parents with disabilities still encounter significant discrimination from adoption agencies. The article highlights the story of Kelly and Larry Peterson, a couple with spina bifida, who were initially rejected by an agency that had a list of disallowed disabilities for adoptive parents. They eventually found a supportive agency and adopted a girl who also has spina bifida, believing their shared experience makes them uniquely qualified caregivers. Their journey underscores the ongoing barriers and biases that prevent qualified disabled individuals from adopting.</p>

The Republican-majority board voted to require voters to cast provisional ballots if certain identification numbers are missing from their registration, a move Democrats argue is unconstitutional and violates the National Voter Registration Act. The DNC claims the plan is a partisan effort to disenfranchise voters in the key battleground state. The state board maintains it is acting to comply with a court order and federal law.</p>

          <p>White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett has suggested that President Trump's tariff policies have not caused significant price inflation because of a rise in American "patriotism." Hassett theorized that Americans are choosing to buy domestic products, which has reduced demand for imports so much that it has offset the price-increasing effects of tariffs. He argued that this preference for American goods, spurred by the president's leadership, is why import prices have fallen despite the new duties. This explanation has been met with skepticism from other economists, who point to different factors like stockpiling and methodology issues. (not investment advice)</p>
