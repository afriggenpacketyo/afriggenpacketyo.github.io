          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has reaffirmed China's commitment to bolstering advanced manufacturing, a strategy that has been criticized by the U.S. and trade partners for exacerbating global trade imbalances. During a visit to Henan province, Xi told workers that self-reliance in advanced manufacturing is crucial for China's economy. This push for self-sufficiency, especially in high-tech sectors, could clash with the Trump administration's demands to address trade imbalances and state subsidies to Chinese companies. Experts anticipate that China is unlikely to scale back its manufacturing-led strategy, potentially leading to continued trade tensions with the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK is set to invest over £1 billion in developing technology that uses AI and drones to accelerate battlefield decision-making, as part of a strategic defense review. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) plans to implement a new Digital Targeting Web to better connect soldiers with information from satellites, aircraft, and drones. This initiative aims to enhance the speed and precision of identifying and engaging enemy targets, drawing lessons from the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The UK military has faced over 90,000 cyber-attacks in the past two years, leading to the creation of a new Cyber and Electromagnetic Command to oversee cyber operations and electronic warfare.</p>

          <p>After a U.S. Court of International Trade ruling blocked President Trump's sweeping tariffs, the administration is expected to seek alternative legal means to impose tariffs. The court ruled that the president had overstepped his authority by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Goldman Sachs analysts suggest the White House could use Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 or launch Section 301 investigations to circumvent the court's decision. The administration has swiftly appealed the ruling, indicating a determination to maintain its tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>US to Revoke Visas of Chinese Students with Communist Party Ties</h2>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the Trump administration will "aggressively revoke" visas of Chinese students with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or those studying in "critical fields." The State Department is also revising visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of future applications from China and Hong Kong. This move is expected to create anxiety across university campuses in the United States and could lead to retaliation from China. The lack of detail on the scope of the directive has fueled worries among the roughly 275,000 Chinese students in the United States.</p>

          <h2>Scholar Suggests Trump May Move Beyond Tariffs in China Strategy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Wu Xinbo, a Chinese scholar, Beijing should prepare for Washington to adopt alternative pressure tactics in future tariff negotiations, as the Trump administration recognizes the limitations of heavy tariffs. While Trump might continue using tariffs, he is likely to show more restraint after seeing their mixed results. Wu suggests that such measures could relate to science, diplomacy, and security. This shift in approach could indicate a more multifaceted strategy from the U.S. in its dealings with China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has criticized Israel's military conduct in Gaza, calling it "beyond comprehension." The Israeli government has been slow to respond, indicating that the remarks have had an impact. Merz's criticism followed an Israeli airstrike on a school sheltering displaced Palestinian civilians. The Israeli ambassador to Germany, Ron Prosor, responded by acknowledging Merz as a friend and claiming Israel was trying to save those kidnapped on October 7, 2023, provide aid for Gaza's remaining civilians and prevent a "terrorist regime" in Gaza. Experts believe that Merz's comments bear more weight because many Israelis are currently concerned over their country's growing isolation.</p>
