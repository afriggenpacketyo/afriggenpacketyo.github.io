          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended a planned military offensive into Gaza City, framing it as a necessary step to defeat Hamas and free the region from its control. He outlined goals that include demilitarizing the enclave and installing a non-Israeli civilian administration, all within a "fairly short timetable." The plan has sparked significant international condemnation and concern for the humanitarian crisis and the safety of remaining hostages. Following the announcement, heavy Israeli bombardment was reported in Gaza City, resulting in the deaths of several journalists, which the Israeli military later addressed.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's seas are experiencing their warmest start to the year on record, a trend linked to climate change that is causing significant shifts in marine ecosystems. This warming has led to the appearance of species not typically found in UK waters, such as octopus, bluefin tuna, and mauve stinger jellyfish, as observed by scientists and naturalists. While these new arrivals are notable, the rising temperatures are simultaneously threatening cold-adapted native species like cod. This phenomenon highlights the profound and rapid impact of climate change on the region's marine biodiversity and fishing industries.</p>

The incident occurred in the Guayas province, which is currently under a state of emergency due to rampant gang violence. Among the deceased was the nightclub's owner, who is the brother of the town's mayor. Authorities are investigating the motive for the shooting, which contributes to a significant increase in homicides in Ecuador this year, highlighting the country's severe security challenges.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a 5-4 defeat against the Toronto Blue Jays after their bullpen surrendered a late lead by giving up three solo home runs in the final innings. Despite a strong start from pitcher Tyler Glasnow and a solid offensive performance from Shohei Ohtani, the Dodgers' relievers could not secure the win. The team's struggles were compounded by their inability to capitalize on scoring opportunities, leaving the bases loaded in both the eighth and ninth innings. This loss, combined with a Padres victory, narrowed the Dodgers' lead in the National League West to just two games.</p>

          <p>In an unprecedented move, chipmakers Nvidia and AMD have reportedly agreed to give the U.S. government 15% of their revenues from specific chip sales to China.

According to the Financial Times, this is the first time a U.S. company has agreed to such a revenue-sharing deal to secure export permissions.

The changes aim to address a surplus of graduates, with up to three times more qualified individuals than available vacancies in some areas. Trusts will now be able to recruit staff based on anticipated needs, even before formal vacancies arise, and some support worker posts will be converted to midwifery roles. While nursing and midwifery colleges welcomed the move, NHS employer representatives raised concerns about how these new positions would be funded amid existing budget pressures.</p>

          <p>U.S. fashion designer Willy Chavarria and collaborator Adidas have issued apologies following criticism that their "Oaxaca Slip-On" shoe culturally appropriated a traditional Mexican design. The footwear was inspired by huaraches, leather sandals made by Indigenous artisans, but was reportedly produced in China without partnership or credit to the Oaxacan communities. The issue drew condemnation, including from Mexico's president, for what was seen as plagiarism. Both Chavarria and Adidas have expressed deep regret and stated their commitment to engaging in a respectful dialogue with the affected communities to repair the damage.</p>

          <p>Violence and pressure from Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank have sharply increased since the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023. This article from the BBC's Jeremy Bowen details how ultra-nationalist settlers, emboldened by supportive government ministers, are accelerating their campaign to displace Palestinian communities and expand settlements, viewing recent events as a turning point. Human rights groups and UN experts report a systemic pattern of intimidation, violence, and land dispossession, effectively extinguishing hopes for a Palestinian state. Settler leaders openly state their belief that Palestinians have no future in the land.</p>

          <h2>Historian Rana Mitter Argues China's Modern Identity Was Forged by World War II</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to historian Rana Mitter, the impact of World War II on the formation of modern China is frequently underestimated in both China and the West. The conflict, particularly the invasion by Japan, was a pivotal event that fundamentally reshaped Chinese politics, society, and culture. Mitter explains that the war shattered much of the country's pre-existing infrastructure and communications networks, which had been developing in the 1920s and 1930s. This widespread destruction forced China to essentially rebuild from the ground up in the post-war era, profoundly influencing its subsequent development.</p>

          <p>President Trump has demanded that homeless individuals in Washington, D.C., be moved out "IMMEDIATELY" and relocated far from the capital, amid suggestions of a federal takeover of the city's policing. In a series of social media posts, Trump announced a press conference to address what he terms rampant crime and squalor, vowing to make the capital beautiful again. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has pushed back, stating that violent crime is actually decreasing and has reached a 30-year low.

          <p>A federal judge in Hawaii has reinstated a ban on commercial fishing within the Pacific Islands Heritage marine national monument, overturning a recent directive from the Trump administration. The ruling blocks a letter from the National Marine Fisheries Service that had permitted fishing in areas previously protected by the Obama administration. The lawsuit, filed by environmental and Native Hawaiian groups, argued the administration violated federal law by bypassing the required public notice and comment period for changing such regulations. The decision is being celebrated as a major victory for marine conservation and the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's 2-2 draw and subsequent penalty shootout loss to Crystal Palace in the Community Shield showcased the potential and pitfalls of their revamped squad. Four new signings started, including record acquisition Florian Wirtz, who was outstanding in a free-roaming attacking midfield role, and goal-scoring debutant Jeremie Frimpong. However, the team also displayed defensive frailties, twice surrendering leads and looking vulnerable to counter-attacks, a problem also seen in preseason. The performance suggests that while the new-look team has spectacular attacking potential, manager Arne Slot still has significant defensive issues to resolve before the season begins.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has pushed back against allegations from Chinese state media that its H20 artificial intelligence chips represent a national security risk for China. An article affiliated with state broadcaster CCTV claimed the chips could be remotely shut down through a hardware "backdoor," a charge Nvidia vehemently denies, stating its products have no such feature. This dispute occurs amid escalating semiconductor tensions between the U.S. and China, even as Nvidia has resumed shipping the H20 chips, which were specifically designed to comply with U.S. export controls for the Chinese market.
