          <p>President Trump announced his administration's plan to reopen and expand Alcatraz as a prison for America's most ruthless and violent offenders, citing frustrations with "radicalized judges." The notorious former prison, located on an island near San Francisco, was originally opened in 1934 to house incorrigible inmates and showcase the federal government's commitment to stopping crime. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi questioned the feasibility of the plan, noting that Alcatraz is now a popular national park and major tourist attraction. The Bureau of Prisons stated it would comply with all Presidential Orders, though the practicality of the reopening remains unclear. Optimism score: 50</p>

          <p>The United States has denied Japan's request for a full exemption from "reciprocal" tariffs, including a 10% baseline levy, during recent negotiations. U.S. officials indicated they would only consider lowering the 14% country-specific tariff, which is currently suspended through early July. Japan has been seeking the removal of tariffs, emphasizing its contributions to the U.S. economy through investment and job creation. The U.S. also imposed a 25% additional tariff on key auto parts.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 08:03:41 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Social Security Administration has reduced the default withholding rate for new overpayment notices from 100% to 50% for Title II benefits, which include retirement, survivors, and disability insurance. This change comes after criticism that the 100% rate was too harsh, though experts warn that even a 50% clawback can still cause financial hardship for beneficiaries. Overpayments occur when beneficiaries receive more than they are owed, often due to reporting errors or agency processing delays. Beneficiaries have 90 days to request a lower withholding rate or a waiver of recovery. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pronatalist policies, aimed at increasing birth rates, are gaining traction, with some advisors to Donald Trump advocating for measures to encourage childbirth. However, experts argue that policies should embrace diverse family structures, rather than focusing solely on traditional married couples. Research indicates that the quality of relationships and acceptance from the outside world are more influential on a child's well-being than the specific household arrangement. Subsidizing assisted reproductive technologies, expanding family leave policies, and encouraging co-parenting among friends are suggested as ways to support various family types.

          <p>Critics like Ted Gioia argue that American culture is in decline, citing Hollywood's reliance on reboots, partisan culture wars, and the addicting effects of technology. Gioia suggests that music has become a rights-management business, discouraging true artistry, and that the arts are frozen in amber. Dean Kissick contends that the art world prioritizes identity politics over originality and skill. Jaime Brooks believes streaming has led to a glut of bad music, and that AI-generated songs will further devalue music as an art form. Optimism score: 40</p>

          <p>Despite sweeping Western sanctions, Russia's economy has shown surprising resilience, but that could change if the United States ramps up the pressure with secondary sanctions. Analysts are assessing how Russia's economy will respond to the threat of secondary sanctions, which would target third countries and entities doing business with Russia. Russia's payment channels face shutdown, and it is difficult to predict how deeply new secondary sanctions under a second Trump administration would affect Russia's economic partners.
