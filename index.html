          <p>Seven men were found guilty at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court of sexually exploiting two teenage girls in Rochdale between 2001 and 2006. The victims, who had troubled home lives, were groomed from the age of 13 and treated as "sex slaves," expected to engage in sexual activity whenever and wherever the men wanted. The abusers worked on market stalls or as taxi drivers, plying the girls with drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes, and providing them with places to stay. Mohammed Zahid, the gang leader, was known as "Boss Man" and gave free underwear from his lingerie stall to the complainants in exchange for regular sexual activity with him and his friends.</p>

          <p>Israel initiated "Operation Rising Lion," launching airstrikes targeting Iranian nuclear facilities, military commanders, and scientists, aiming to neutralize Iran's perceived threat. In response, Iran launched over 100 drones at Israel, which Israel claims to be intercepting. The United States denied involvement in the Israeli strikes, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio warning Iran against targeting U.S. interests or personnel. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte urged de-escalation, stating a nuclear conflict was "not close," despite the ongoing attacks.</p>

          <p>President Trump's planned military parade on the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary, featuring thousands of soldiers and military equipment, contrasts with George Washington's approach to public celebrations. Washington resisted grand military displays, prioritizing the principles of a constitutional republic based on the will of the people. In 1789, Washington attended a parade in Boston that honored not only the military but also the city's artisans and tradespeople, emphasizing values of liberty, industry, and moral obligations. Concerns are being raised about the use of the military for personal purposes and the potential for a leader to use the army to flex their own might.</p>

          <p>President Trump is attempting to establish a new religious right that prioritizes American nationalism over traditional religious values, drawing parallels with Soviet Russia's relationship between the state and the Russian Orthodox Church. This movement emphasizes loyalty to the nation and its perceived values, displacing traditional religious practices with America First alternatives. The composition of Trump's Religious Liberty Commission, dominated by evangelicals and conservative members of other faiths, reflects this shift. This new coalition is united by a shared sense of cultural siege, willing to set aside theological concerns for the sake of their nation-building project.</p>

The court found the government was aware some families would no longer afford private school fees but was entitled to prioritize revenue for public services.</p>
