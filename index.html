        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major League Baseball is finalizing substantial new media rights deals with ESPN, NBC, and Netflix, which are expected to significantly alter how fans access games. NBC is set to acquire Sunday night and Wild Card playoff games for approximately $200 million annually, while Netflix will secure rights to the Home Run Derby for about $50 million a year. ESPN will reportedly receive a new $550 million package, encompassing digital out-of-market games and rights to five local teams. These agreements, designed to expand MLB's reach and financial partnerships, are a strategic move in response to the changing media consumption habits and traditional television's declining viewership.</p>

          <p>Convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell, during a highly unusual two-day interview with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, denied the existence of a Jeffrey Epstein client list or any blackmail scheme. Maxwell, serving a 20-year sentence, claimed she never witnessed or heard of inappropriate acts by high-profile associates like Donald Trump or Bill Clinton. Despite her conviction for aiding Epstein's trafficking, she maintained her innocence, stating she only introduced Epstein to adult women and never recruited underage individuals. The interview, conducted under limited immunity, aimed to uncover information about other potential co-conspirators, but yielded no incriminating details from Maxwell regarding prominent figures.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Ábrego García, a Salvadoran national who was wrongly deported earlier this year, has been released from criminal custody in Tennessee and is en route to rejoin his family in Maryland. A magistrate judge ordered his release as he awaits trial on human smuggling charges, which his lawyers have dismissed as "preposterous" and "vindictive." Ábrego García, who initially fled gang violence and had a federal protection order against deportation, was sent to El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison, where he alleges physical and psychological torture. His legal team successfully orchestrated his return and blocked further deportation, with his criminal trial anticipated to begin in January 2027.</p>

Despite support from numerous relatives, the board deemed him unsuitable for release, emphasizing that while family forgiveness is important, it doesn't automatically grant parole suitability.</p>

          <p>Ether (ETH) experienced a significant surge, trading near its record high, immediately following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's annual address from Jackson Hole. Powell's comments, suggesting that the "shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance," were interpreted as dovish by traders, leading to a "panicked repositioning" in the crypto market. This resulted in approximately $120 million in short liquidations for ETH within an hour, pushing its price further upward. The market reaction also saw shares of ether-focused companies like Bitmine Immersion and SharpLink Gaming jump, indicating a renewed momentum for crypto assets aligned with potential easing of monetary policy.</p>

          <p>A San Bernardino man was arrested on suspicion of sexual assault after allegedly luring an 11-year-old girl into his van by posing as an animal control officer. The girl was searching for her missing dog when Guillermo Cascante, 57, reportedly approached her in an ambulance-style van. Once inside, Cascante allegedly used a handgun to threaten and then sexually assault her while driving around, eventually dropping her off. Deputies located his vehicle and made an arrest, booking him on charges including kidnapping and lewd acts with a child. Authorities believe there may be other victims and plan to release photos of Cascante and his vehicle to the public.</p>

Israeli Prime Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, dismissed the report as an "outright lie," claiming Israel prevents starvation and the report ignores humanitarian steps.

          <p>The federal electric vehicle (EV) tax credit, worth up to $7,500, is set to expire on September 30, but the IRS has provided a crucial clarification for car buyers. Shoppers can still qualify for the credit if they enter a binding contract to purchase a vehicle before the deadline, even if delivery occurs afterward. A payment, including a nominal downpayment or trade-in, is also required before September 30. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for those buying vehicles from out-of-state or ordering unmanufactured cars, potentially boosting EV sales in the short term before the credit's full termination by the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>The Texas Senate is poised to vote on a controversial Republican-backed redistricting bill designed to create five new GOP-leaning congressional districts, following its passage in the House. This move, reportedly urged by President Trump, aims to bolster the GOP's narrow House majority ahead of the 2026 midterms. Texas House Democrats previously fled the state to deny a quorum, protesting the plan's alleged undermining of fair representation. In response, California Governor Gavin Newsom introduced a counter-redistricting plan, aiming to flip five Republican seats to Democratic, framing it as a necessary measure to "fight fire with fire" against perceived election rigging.</p>

          <p>The movie "Splitsville," directed by and co-starring Michael Angelo Covino and Kyle Marvin, attempts to satirize modern marriage and male friendship but ultimately falls short of its comedic aspirations. The plot follows Carey, whose wife wants a divorce, leading him to seek solace with friends in an open relationship, resulting in complicated jealousies. While outwardly a satire of bourgeois aspirations, the film is primarily focused on the absurdities of male friendship, often indulging in the very impulses it seeks to parody. Despite elevating performances from Adria Arjona and Dakota Johnson, the movie suffers from a self-regarding tone and an overly outlandish fight scene, struggling to deliver on its deeper meaning.</p>

The IPC's rare classification, meeting stringent criteria for extreme food shortages and malnutrition, highlights a "man-made disaster" exacerbated by Israel's blockade and bombardment. However, the article argues that despite international attention and ample resources, the core issue is a lack of political will, not a scarcity of aid or awareness.

          <p>Vivian Ayers Allen, a Pulitzer-nominated poet and the esteemed mother of Debbie Allen and Phylicia Rashad, has passed away at the age of 102. A visionary writer, her 1957 book-length poem "Hawk" foreshadowed space travel just weeks before Sputnik's launch, earning renewed recognition from NASA in 2024. Ayers, who founded a literary magazine and arts literacy program, was a librarian and the first full-time Black faculty member at Rice University. Her children fondly remember her as an inspiring matriarch who nurtured their artistic talents and instilled in them the belief in their creative potential, fostering an environment rich with intellectual and artistic discourse.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated a cautious openness to possible interest rate cuts in his Jackson Hole speech, citing "sweeping changes" in policy and a "shifting balance of risks." While noting a resilient economy and strong labor market, Powell highlighted rising downside dangers and the potential for tariffs to reignite inflation, a stagflation scenario the Fed aims to avoid. He stated that current restrictive policy allows the Fed to "proceed carefully" and that adjusting the stance "may warrant" cuts, sending stocks soaring. Powell also reaffirmed the Fed's commitment to its 2% inflation target and underscored the critical importance of the central bank's independence from political demands.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that air pollution from oil and gas operations causes over 90,000 premature deaths annually in the U.S., along with hundreds of thousands of illnesses, disproportionately affecting communities of color. The research attributes more than 10,000 pre-term births to fine particulate matter and 216,000 childhood asthma cases to nitrogen dioxide emissions from the sector. While Indigenous and Hispanic populations are most impacted by exploration and extraction, Black and Asian communities bear the brunt of processing and refining emissions, particularly in areas like "Cancer Alley." The study, based on 2017 data, suggests current impacts are likely higher due to increased production, underscoring the severe health and environmental justice issues tied to fossil fuels.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As U.S. credit card debt surpasses $1.2 trillion and delinquencies climb, credit card forbearance is emerging as a temporary relief option for struggling borrowers. Forbearance allows individuals to pause or reduce payments for a limited period, potentially including fee waivers and interest relief, though interest may still accrue. Qualification typically requires proof of genuine financial hardship, such as job loss or unexpected expenses, and a history of on-time payments. For those who don't qualify, alternatives like debt management plans, consolidation loans, balance transfers, or even bankruptcy can provide pathways to regain control of escalating debt.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that Canada will remove many of its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, aiming to reduce trade tensions. This decision follows a call with President Trump and aligns Canada's tariffs with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) by ending levies on compliant goods, effective September 1. However, Canada will maintain 25% tariffs on American autos, steel, and aluminum, mirroring existing U.S. tariffs on these sectors. The move is expected to re-establish free trade for the majority of goods between the two nations, despite ongoing challenges in negotiating trade agreements for key industries like auto and metals.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack voiced hesitation about lowering interest rates, emphasizing that inflation remains a significant threat despite market enthusiasm for potential cuts. Hammack, while acknowledging Chair Jerome Powell's openness to policy easing, stressed the need to maintain a "modestly restrictive stance" to bring inflation back to the 2% target, which has been exceeded for four years. She also noted her personal belief that the "neutral" interest rate is higher than many other Fed officials perceive. Hammack's comments highlight a differing perspective within the Fed, cautioning against accommodative policies that could reignite inflationary pressures.</p>

          <p>Kimbal Musk, brother of Elon Musk, publicly stated that Elon "deserves to be paid" amid Tesla's ongoing legal battle over its CEO's compensation package. Elon Musk currently receives no salary or cash bonuses from Tesla, compensated solely through performance-based stock options. Tesla's board recently granted Elon an "interim" pay package of 96 million shares, worth approximately $29 billion, which vests in two years if he continues in a key executive role. This award came after a Delaware judge revoked a previous $56 billion package, prompting an investment group to question the new package's approval without shareholder vote, highlighting ongoing corporate governance concerns.</p>

          <p>The UK government has agreed to pay £2.9 million in compensation to over 7,700 Kenyans affected by a fire caused during a British military training exercise four years ago. The out-of-court settlement concludes a lengthy legal battle where claimants reported property loss and health complications from smoke inhalation. A British High Commission spokesperson called the 2021 Lolldaiga conservancy fire "extremely regrettable" and noted the UK's efforts to resolve the claims. While the lawyer praised the outcome, some clients felt the sums were insufficient, and proving health damages was challenging due to lost evidence and other smoke sources. The UK military continues exercises in the area, contributing to the Kenyan economy despite past controversies involving soldier conduct.</p>
