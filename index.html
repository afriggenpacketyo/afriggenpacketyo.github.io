        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve stated it would adhere to any court ruling regarding President Donald Trump's attempt to remove Board of Governors member Lisa Cook. The Fed emphasized that governors serve long, fixed terms and can only be removed 'for cause,' a safeguard ensuring monetary policy decisions are based on data and long-term national interests. Cook's attorney confirmed she would challenge the action in court, asserting Trump lacks the authority for such a removal. This development highlights a significant constitutional and institutional clash over the central bank's independence.</p>

          <p>Short-term Treasury yields fell while long-term yields rose following President Trump's announcement of his intent to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. Investors reacted to the perceived erosion of Fed independence, anticipating potential future rate cuts, which made long-term bonds less attractive. Cook's attorney stated she would challenge the removal, arguing Trump lacks authority. The market also processed stronger-than-expected durable goods orders and consumer confidence data, with attention now turning to the upcoming personal consumption expenditures price index for inflation clues.

          <p>The Trump administration is resuming 'neighborhood checks' for U.S. citizenship applicants, a practice dormant since 1991, to intensify vetting efforts. This involves on-the-ground investigations by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services officials, potentially including interviews with neighbors and coworkers. The directive aims to ensure applicants meet good moral character and constitutional adherence requirements. Critics argue this policy creates an intimidating atmosphere, while the administration defends it as necessary to combat fraud and uphold immigration standards, reflecting a broader tightening of legal immigration processes.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump declared his administration seeks 'nothing less than $500 million from Harvard' to restore billions in federal funding, amid an ongoing feud over the university's handling of antisemitism. Harvard previously sued the administration for unlawfully cutting $2.6 billion in research funding in alleged retaliation for its stance on pro-Palestinian protests. Reports of a potential settlement involving a $500 million payment have emerged, though Harvard's president disputes the accuracy, insisting on resolving the matter through courts and prioritizing academic freedom. This highlights the administration's unprecedented efforts to reshape higher education.</p>

          <p>Dominic Casciani of the BBC analyzed the Reform UK party's ambitious plan to tackle 'uncontrolled illegal migration,' including mass deportations and human rights law changes. The party aims to deport 500,000-600,000 people within a parliamentary term, requiring the construction of secure facilities for 24,000 individuals monthly, estimated to cost £12 billion. Casciani raises concerns about the feasibility, cost, and legal challenges, noting previous failed attempts to fast-track removals and potential conflicts with the European Convention on Human Rights.

          <p>Cracker Barrel's stock experienced a jump after President Donald Trump weighed in on the controversial rebranding, suggesting the company revert to its old logo and capitalize on the 'free publicity.' Trump's Truth Social post, following his son's criticism and a stock dip, coincided with a more than 5% gain in Cracker Barrel shares. The company had previously apologized for its new simplified logo but indicated it would continue with the change. This event underscores the significant market influence of public commentary from prominent figures.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans to seek the death penalty for suspected murderers in Washington D.C., describing it as a 'preventative' measure. This statement was made during a cabinet meeting amidst a deployment of National Guard and federal law enforcement to the capital to combat crime, a strategy Trump has hinted at expanding to other cities. Washington D.C. currently lacks a death penalty, having repealed it decades ago, and most residents oppose capital punishment. The president's proposal faces significant legal and public opinion challenges in the city.</p>

          <p>Top Pentagon officials are considering whether the U.S. government should acquire equity stakes in leading defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, according to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. This follows the Trump administration's recent acquisition of a 10% stake in Intel stock. Lutnick indicated President Trump is rethinking how the U.S. finances its defense capabilities, suggesting the current system is a 'giveaway.' The move signals a major potential overhaul of Pentagon appropriations and a greater government role in the private economy, drawing criticism from some conservatives who warn against cutting free market principles.</p>

          <p>A column by Jonah Goldberg critiques the Republican Party's perceived hypocrisy and President Trump's actions as a slide towards tyranny, arguing that partisans are abandoning established constitutional norms. Goldberg highlights several controversial actions by the Trump administration, including deploying armed troops in D.C., acquiring an equity stake in Intel, raiding a critic's home, and attempting to dictate election conduct. The article suggests that while Democrats criticize these actions, a cycle of escalating transgressions risks destroying the foundational rules and norms of American politics, regardless of which party is in power.</p>

          <p>For savers with $100,000, choosing between a Certificate of Deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account involves weighing fixed versus variable interest rates.

Calculations show that for shorter terms, high-yield savings might slightly outperform, but for longer terms like one year, a CD could offer a marginally higher, guaranteed return.
