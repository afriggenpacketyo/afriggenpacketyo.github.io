          <p>President Trump delayed the threatened 50% tariffs on all European Union imports into the US until July 9, following a "very nice call" with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen. Von der Leyen announced the tariff delay, stating it would allow more time for negotiations, and affirmed Europe's readiness to move ahead with trade talks swiftly. This decision marks a reversal from Trump's earlier warning that he would impose the tariffs on June 1 because discussions with the EU were "going nowhere."
