            <h2>CDC Study Reveals Increase in Autism Rates Among Children</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-17 11:08:18 EDT</div>

            <p>A recent CDC study indicates that autism rates have risen to over 3% among children, with some states reporting as high as 1 in 20 boys diagnosed. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has cited these figures as evidence of a growing autism "epidemic," a claim disputed by experts who point to broadened definitions and improved screening. The CDC report also notes higher prevalence among Asian, Black, and Hispanic children compared to White children, potentially due to disparities in preterm birth and lead poisoning. The CDC initially planned to release the report earlier this year but delayed its publication amid communications restructuring, also barring agency experts from media briefings.</p>

            <p>President Trump has again publicly pressured the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, even hinting at the potential "termination" of Chairman Jerome Powell. This criticism followed Powell's remarks about the administration's tariffs posing a challenge to the central bank's efforts to manage inflation and stimulate economic growth. Trump's comments sparked concerns about the Fed's independence, particularly after Powell acknowledged the potential for "stagflation" due to tariff-induced inflation. Senator Elizabeth Warren has warned that the markets will crash if Trump is able to fire Powell. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Footage captured by the U.S. Navy shows unidentified flying objects (UFOs) rising from the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California. Witnesses reported the aircraft, lacking wings or tails, were able to outpace and outmaneuver known terrestrial technology. While the Pentagon states that the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office has no record of the incident, the footage bears similarities to the 2004 "Tic Tac" sighting by USS Nimitz. An expert believes that the phenomenon has been here for a long time, that it is nothing to worry about, and that congress is trying to get people past the stigma so we can know and understand what is this technology, who is operating it and what is the intent.</p>

Joe Johnson in 1987 and Ken Doherty in 1998 came closest to breaking the curse, but lost at the final hurdle. Luca Brecel's defense ended in the first round in 2024.</p>

            <p>Campaigners are expressing concerns that the UK Supreme Court's ruling on the definition of a woman could have "dire consequences" for the safety and well-being of transgender individuals. The ruling, which defines "woman" as biological sex under equalities law, has raised fears of restricted access to facilities and services for trans people. Scottish Greens MSP Maggie Chapman stated that the trans community now worries that "people are coming after their right to exist." Critics argue that the ruling undermines progress made in trans rights and could lead to further discrimination.</p>

            <p>Ukraine is demanding the unconditional return of Ukrainian children forcibly deported to Russia, estimating that nearly 20,000 children remain in Russia after being illegally deported. Russia is accused of erasing the children's identities by changing their names and IDs, especially those forced into adoption. Ukraine considers the return of these children a "red line" for any peace negotiations. The Trump administration had previously cut funding for a Yale University lab investigating the deportations, impacting data collection on Russia's war crimes.</p>

She alleges indifference and injustice led to prolonged moral decline, including pain, fear, and harassment. The WTA expressed sympathy for Tsurenko's challenges but voiced disappointment over her decision to take legal action.</p>

            <p>A growing number of left-leaning individuals are embracing the "prepper" lifestyle, preparing for potential societal collapse due to climate change and other crises. Unlike traditional right-wing preppers who focus on individual survival and armed defense, these individuals prioritize community building, mutual aid, and emotional resilience. They emphasize the importance of understanding network effects, building local connections, and accepting the emotional challenges of facing catastrophe. The shift reflects a growing recognition that climate breakdown requires a different approach to preparedness than traditional survivalist tactics.</p>

Heyer had reportedly been in talks with Roblox for licensing the dance, but her lawyer claims Roblox used it without a signed agreement.

The court ruled that "sex" refers to biological sex, not gender identity, which could impact legal protections for transgender individuals. While the ruling emphasizes continued protection for trans people, it has raised concerns about access to single-sex spaces and services.

Led by Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representatives Judy Chu and Linda Sánchez, the effort highlights Democratic scrutiny of Trump's economic policies.</p>

            <p>Prolonged school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic had far-reaching and detrimental effects beyond learning loss, including stress, depression, and isolation for millions of families. While the initial closures were understandable, the lack of a comprehensive plan to address the consequences and reopen schools led to catastrophic outcomes. Warnings about the potential harms of school interruptions were ignored, and the implementation of remote learning failed to meet the needs of many students, particularly those with disabilities. Political pressures and the influence of teachers' unions further complicated the reopening process.</p>
