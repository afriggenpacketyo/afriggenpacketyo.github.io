          <p>President Trump celebrated the congressional passage of his major domestic policy package, which he referred to as a "big, beautiful bill." He touted the legislation as the largest of its kind, highlighting its extensive tax cuts, and significant funding for border security and the military. Trump predicted the bill would stimulate record economic growth, comparing the country's future trajectory to a "rocket ship." The president announced he would officially sign the bill on Independence Day, accompanied by a celebratory flyover from the U.S. Air Force, framing the event as a symbol of Republican unity and American prosperity.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Veterans, military families, and legal experts are warning that the Trump administration's deployment of troops to U.S. cities like Los Angeles erodes democratic norms and harms service members. Advocates argue the mission, intended to quell protests and support ICE actions, places troops in situations for which they are not trained, pitting them against American citizens. A retired lieutenant colonel described the situation as "making America militarized again," expressing fears that it pushes the military dangerously close to violating the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars federal troops from civilian law enforcement. The deployment also strains military families and places undue stress on soldiers.</p>

          <h2>Data Shows Sharp Rise in ICE Detention of Immigrants Without Criminal Records</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 21:04:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent data reveals a significant shift in U.S. immigration enforcement, with the sharpest growth in the detention population being immigrants with no criminal convictions. According to the Deportation Data Project, approximately half of the 56,000 people currently in ICE custody fall into this category. This trend marks a departure from the administration's stated focus on violent criminals, as analysis shows the number of non-criminal detainees has nearly doubled since May. The policy is upending the lives of long-term residents like Pastor Maurilio Ambrocio, who was recently deported to Guatemala after 30 years in the U.S. despite having no criminal record.</p>

          <p>A massive explosion and subsequent fire at a fireworks warehouse in Yolo County, California, has left seven people unaccounted for. The incident occurred at the Devastating Pyrotechnics facility, injuring two others and sparking multiple grass fires that burned approximately 80 acres. Family members have identified some of the missing, including three relatives who were working at the site. Investigations revealed the company possessed a state license for fireworks but lacked the required local permits to store them on the agricultural property. The ATF is assisting in the investigation as emergency crews continue to manage the hazardous scene.</p>

          <p>Budgetary and personnel cuts at the National Park Service (NPS) are raising significant safety concerns as the summer visitor season begins. At popular sites like Maryland's Assateague Island National Seashore, lifeguard towers are shuttered, leaving beaches unguarded. The cuts stem from a Trump administration hiring freeze and the layoff of about 1,000 NPS employees. An advocacy group reports the NPS has lost 24% of its permanent staff since the administration took office, leading to shortages in seasonal positions like lifeguards. Local officials and conservation groups fear the lack of staff puts visitors in serious jeopardy.</p>

In response, the EPA accused the employees of "unlawfully undermining" the administration's agenda and stated it has a "zero-tolerance policy" for such actions.

          <p>A new CBS News/YouGov poll conducted ahead of the Fourth of July finds that most Americans who display the U.S. flag do so out of a sense of patriotism. While many believe others fly the flag for political reasons, a majority of respondents do not display it themselves to make a political statement. Seeing the flag primarily connotes patriotism and support for the military to most people. However, the poll notes a partisan divide, with Republicans more likely than Democrats to fly the flag to express patriotism and to make a political statement.</p>

The report states the Home Office shows "little curiosity" about the system's operation and still relies on unanalyzed airline passenger records.

          <p>The Bank of England's invitation for public input on new banknote designs has generated thousands of creative and varied suggestions. While historical figures have been the standard for over 50 years, the public has proposed themes ranging from nature and maritime heritage to classic television characters and vintage trains. Popular ideas include the Angel of the North, famous ships like the SS Great Britain, and even nostalgic TV shows like "Fawlty Towers." This public consultation offers a chance to refresh the nation's currency with images that reflect a broader sense of British culture, history, and identity beyond notable individuals.</p>

          <p>Although not its direct author, the sweeping tax and spending bill recently passed by Congress strongly reflects the governmental vision of Russell Vought, a key figure in the Trump administration. Vought has been instrumental in shaping a strategy to remake the federal government, and the new legislation embodies this push. The bill's focus on significant tax cuts, deregulation, and restructuring of federal safety net programs aligns with Vought's long-advocated principles. This article explores how his influence has been pivotal in translating these conservative ideals into one of the most significant pieces of domestic policy in recent years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of President Trump's recent tariff implementations reveals a complex and uncertain impact on the U.S. economy. While the stock market has rebounded after an initial drop, vulnerable sectors like retail and auto manufacturing are still hurting. Goods imports surged before dropping, but remain higher year-over-year, with future trade flows dependent on whether the administration extends its pause on the most aggressive tariffs. Economists warn that it is too soon to dismiss inflation fears and note early signs of a consumer spending pullback, creating a "wait-and-see" mode for an economy facing significant policy instability.

          <p>One year after taking power with a large majority, Keir Starmer's Labour government has faced significant challenges in implementing its ambitious agenda for change. BBC correspondents analyzed progress in six key areas, noting a mixed record. While the government has managed its relationship with the U.S. and reset ties with the EU, it faces criticism for caution on foreign policy. Domestically, economic growth has been minimal, net migration remains high, and major reforms to social care have been delayed. U-turns on welfare policy and struggles to meet teacher recruitment targets highlight the difficult balance between campaign promises and governing realities.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Marine Corps is deploying approximately 200 service members to Florida to provide logistical and administrative support to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This move is part of a broader Trump administration strategy to utilize the military in its immigration crackdown, with up to 700 personnel approved for deployment in several states. According to U.S. Northern Command, the Marines will perform non-law enforcement duties and are prohibited from direct contact with detainees. This deployment follows similar controversial uses of military personnel, including at the U.S.-Mexico border and in Los Angeles during immigration-related protests.</p>

          <p>In a 7-2 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the Trump administration can remove eight noncitizens who have been held at a military facility in Djibouti. The ruling clears the way for their deportation to South Sudan, a country with which they have no known connections. This decision overturns a lower court's order that had blocked their removal, which the administration had criticized as "defiance." The case represents a significant victory for the administration's policy of deporting immigrants to third countries, a practice that has drawn legal challenges and criticism over due process concerns.</p>

He argued that the legislation would be devastating for children, seniors, and working-class Americans, stating that "people will die" as a result of its healthcare cuts.

Massie cited the legislation's significant projected increase to the national debt as his reason for opposition, a stance consistent with his previous votes. Fitzpatrick, who had supported an earlier version, changed his vote due to Senate amendments that he believed would negatively impact Medicaid for his constituents in his swing district. Their dissent highlights a rare break from party unity on a key piece of the administration's agenda, drawing both criticism and attention.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear two cases this fall concerning state laws that ban transgender women and girls from participating in female sports at publicly funded schools. The cases, originating from Idaho and West Virginia, will test the constitutionality of these bans, which now exist in 27 states. Supporters argue the laws ensure fair competition, while opponents claim they are discriminatory and violate the Constitution and Title IX. The decision to take up the cases thrusts the court back into a major cultural and political flashpoint, with significant implications for the rights of transgender individuals nationwide.</p>

Despite previously vowing to oppose harmful cuts, Valadao supported the bill, citing negotiated concessions for rural hospitals and agriculture.

Executives also allegedly asked for the main character to be more "masculine."
