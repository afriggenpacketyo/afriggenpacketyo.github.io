          <p>This Fox News opinion piece analyzes the threat posed by Iran and its proxies, particularly Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis, emphasizing their stated intentions to harm Israel and the U.S. The article argues that preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons is crucial to protect against these groups, which have a history of terrorism and anti-Semitic rhetoric. The author highlights instances of Iranian-sponsored terror plots within the U.S., underscoring that the threat is not confined to the Middle East. A weakened Iran would prevent its proxies from acquiring destructive power and protect both Israel and the U.S.</p>

          <p>A bride was fatally shot and a 13-year-old was wounded during a wedding party in Goult, France, early Sunday morning. Masked gunmen opened fire as the bride and groom were leaving the party, resulting in the bride's death and the death of one of the attackers, who was run over by the couple's car. An investigation for "murder and attempted murder by an organized gang" has been opened by the Avignon prosecutor's office. Investigators are exploring the possibility that the shooting was related to a settling of scores.</p>

          <p>This article from *The Atlantic* argues that Donald Trump's strikes on Iranian nuclear sites represent a decisive action against a dangerous nuclear program. The author contends that a nuclear-armed Iran would pose a significant threat to Israel and the broader region, potentially triggering nuclear conflict. Trump's approach is characterized as a precise, limited use of force with the threat of further action if Iran retaliates. The author suggests that Iran is a weaker state than many perceive, with vulnerabilities in its air defenses, security apparatus, and economy, and that the strikes have significantly set back Iran's nuclear capabilities.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance stated that the U.S. is "at war with Iran's nuclear program," not with Iran itself, following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Vance claimed that the strikes have substantially set back Iran's nuclear program, potentially by years. While he couldn't definitively confirm the complete destruction of Iranian nuclear facilities, he asserted that Iran is much further away from developing a nuclear weapon. Vance also addressed the possibility of Iranian retaliation, stating that the U.S. would respond with "overwhelming force" if necessary.</p>

He acknowledged a small chance of a best-case scenario but cautioned that history suggests a less favorable outcome is more likely.

          <p>This article details how Americaâ€™s strikes on Iran have amplified debates in Tehran regarding the country's future and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's leadership. Prior to the U.S. intervention, Iranian figures had begun formulating plans for a post-Khamenei Iran, involving a leadership committee to negotiate with the U.S. Some insiders believe sidelining Khamenei is more likely now, while others are less optimistic about securing peace. The extent of the damage from the strikes is disputed, but the mood among Iranian circles close to the regime is divided between seeking a deal with Trump and fighting back, potentially leading to Khamenei's downfall.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is expected to post record-low results in Sunday's Tokyo assembly election. Tomin First no Kai, a regional party established by Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike, is likely to become the biggest force in the assembly. The election is seen as a bellwether for the July House of Councillors race, with key issues including inflation, political funding scandals, and child-rearing policies. The LDP's setback is reminiscent of past Tokyo assembly races that foreshadowed national political shifts.</p>

          <p>This article examines potential responses from Iran following U.S. airstrikes on its nuclear sites, outlining three strategic courses of action: retaliating hard and soon, retaliating later, or not retaliating at all. The piece details possible targets for immediate retaliation, including U.S. bases in the Middle East, naval warships, and economic targets like the Strait of Hormuz. It also considers the option of a delayed surprise attack and the potential consequences of each choice, emphasizing the importance of regime survival in Iran's decision-making process. The article suggests that Iran must decide whether to escalate the conflict or negotiate, giving up nuclear enrichment.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Middle East ended mostly higher on Sunday after the United States entered the war between Israel and Iran. Stocks in Tel Aviv reached an all-time high, while Gulf markets showed limited reaction. Saudi Arabia's Tadawul closed down slightly, while Qatar and Bahrain gained modestly. Egypt's EGX30 was the major gainer in the region, closing significantly higher. Analysts suggest that the Gulf's call for appeasement and condemnation of Israeli aggression has helped isolate it from the conflict, minimizing short-term market impact. The market may be pricing in the removal of the Iranian threat.</p>

The author contends that bypassing Congress deprives citizens of representation and the ability to hold their representatives accountable. They contrast this with the 2002 authorization for the Iraq War, which, despite being a mistake, allowed for public debate and accountability. The author expresses concern that removing official channels for citizens to effect change can be radicalizing and leaves the public with no recourse.</p>
