          <p>American golfer Scottie Scheffler won his first British Open championship, finishing four strokes ahead of the competition at the 153rd iteration of the tournament. The 29-year-old shot a final round 68 at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland to secure the victory. This marks Scheffler's second major tournament win of 2025, following his victory at the PGA Championship earlier in the year. The win leaves him needing only a U.S. Open title to complete the career Grand Slam in professional golf.</p>

          <p>A lesser-known landmark in Washington, D.C., the Clara Barton Missing Soldiers Office Museum, preserves a significant piece of American history. The museum is located in the building where Clara Barton, founder of the American Red Cross, led a revolutionary effort following the Civil War. From this office, she and her team worked to identify and locate over 22,000 missing or deceased Union soldiers, providing closure to countless families and establishing a precedent for such humanitarian work.</p>

          <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance is reportedly planning to take his family on a holiday to the Cotswolds in England next month. The destination has drawn notice given Vance's past critical statements about the UK and Europe, including a comment that London was "not English any more" and accusations that European governments are suppressing free speech. The trip comes as Vance, author of "Hillbilly Elegy," has adopted a more confrontational stance toward traditional U.S. allies.</p>

          <p>Scottish ultra-runner Anna Rutherford delivered a stunning performance, winning the inaugural 100-mile Rat Race from Northumberland to Edinburgh. The 43-year-old mother-of-three finished the grueling course in just over 17 hours, more than two hours ahead of the closest male competitor and five hours ahead of the next woman. Her dominant victory was so profound that she had already returned to her home in Peebles by the time the rest of the 600-person field began crossing the finish line.</p>

          <p>Employment experts suspect that artificial intelligence is playing a much larger role in recent corporate layoffs than companies are publicly admitting. While official announcements often cite broad terms like "reorganization" or "optimization," analysts believe these are frequently euphemisms for replacing human jobs with AI technology, especially in roles related to customer service, content creation, and HR. Companies are likely using vague language to avoid public and employee backlash while strategically moving toward a more automated workforce.</p>

Luis Leon, who was granted U.S. asylum in 1987, was detained by ICE officers in June. His family was later falsely told by someone claiming to be a lawyer that he had died, only to discover from a relative that he was alive but hospitalized in Guatemala, a country to which he has no connection.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has notably shifted to a more aggressive and confrontational social media strategy, directly targeting President Trump and his allies with sharp and sometimes crude language. This pivot from a traditional "when they go low, we go high" approach is a deliberate tactic, according to Newsom's advisors, aimed at punching back against what they view as bullying and misinformation. The new posture has dramatically increased Newsom's online engagement and has fueled speculation about his potential presidential ambitions.</p>

The attack marks a significant escalation in Ukraine's ability to strike deep within Russia, occurring as both sides have publicly mentioned a potential return to peace talks.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that traditional methods of measuring the U.S. labor market, such as the monthly jobs report and unemployment rate, are becoming obsolete. Given the rise of the gig economy, remote work, and the "over-employed" holding multiple positions, the author contends that tracking the number of jobs is no longer a relevant metric. The article proposes a shift to measuring the health of the labor market by tracking the inflation-adjusted income of the working-age population, which would provide a more accurate picture of economic well-being.</p>
