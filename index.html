          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has reportedly terminated at least 20 Justice Department officials, including prosecutors and support staff, connected to former Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigations into Donald Trump. Sources indicate that this move follows an earlier ousting of most senior prosecutors involved in the probes. The firings, identified through a "weaponization working group," have allegedly created a climate of fear among the DOJ's career employees. This action is seen as part of a broader purge within the department, affecting even staff with minor roles in the previous investigations.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old U.S. citizen from Tampa, Florida, was beaten to death by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank, his family reported. Saifullah Kamel Musallet was visiting relatives and was killed during a confrontation while protecting his family's property in the town of Sinjil. His family alleges that settlers blocked an ambulance from reaching him for over three hours and has called for a U.S.-led investigation into the incident. The U.S. State Department has confirmed the death and is providing consular assistance, while referring inquiries about the investigation to Israeli authorities.</p>

          <p>Police in the United Kingdom have arrested 71 people at demonstrations protesting the government's decision to proscribe the activist group Palestine Action as a terrorist organization. The arrests, primarily for showing support for a banned group, occurred in London, Cardiff, and Manchester. The proscription makes membership or support for Palestine Action a criminal offense punishable by imprisonment. The move followed an incident where activists damaged military aircraft, but critics argue the government is misusing anti-terror legislation against a protest group focused on criminal damage.</p>

          <p>A wildfire in Arizona, named the White Sage Fire, has grown to over 19,100 acres and prompted the evacuation of the Grand Canyon National Park's North Rim.

A second nearby fire, the Dragon Bravo Fire, has also advanced, forcing all North Rim residents to evacuate immediately.

The Fed clarifies that the project modernizes historic buildings and denies the construction of new VIP dining rooms, directly refuting Vought's assertions.

          <p>The United Kingdom's third heatwave of the year peaked on Saturday, with temperatures hitting 33C (91.4F) in Ross on Wye. The extreme heat was widespread, with Scotland recording its warmest day of the year and Northern Ireland its hottest in nearly three years. The conditions have led to amber heat health alerts, wildfire warnings in Scotland, and hosepipe bans for millions in England. The heat has also caused travel disruptions and the cancellation of some sporting events, highlighting the growing impact of extreme weather across the entire country.</p>

          <p>Over 1,300 employees were laid off from the U.S. State Department on Friday as part of a major restructuring by the Trump administration, representing a 15% cut to domestic staff. Many veteran diplomats and civil servants with decades of specialized experience were shocked to find they were being terminated, with some having prepared critical policy briefings just days prior. The layoffs have gutted entire offices, including those focused on human rights and science, leading to concerns about a significant loss of institutional knowledge and the disruption of U.S. foreign policy.</p>

          <p>Two fathers in England have initiated a campaign to ban smartphones in schools, threatening legal action against the government. They argue that the current guidance, which lets headteachers decide on phone policy, is unlawful and fails to protect children from harmful content and cyberbullying. The campaigners have sent a formal letter to the Education Secretary, signaling their intent to seek a judicial review. They believe a complete ban on smartphones, allowing only basic "brick phones" for communication, is the only way to ensure a safe school environment for children.</p>

          <p>A preliminary report into the fatal Air India Flight 171 crash has revealed a chilling discovery from the cockpit voice recorder. Just seconds after takeoff, both fuel-control switches were moved to the "cut-off" position, starving the engines of fuel. The recording captures one pilot asking the other why they did it, with the other denying it, creating a deep mystery. Investigators are trying to determine if this was an intentional act or a catastrophic, uncommanded failure. The finding has baffled aviation experts, as the crash killed 260 people in Ahmedabad, India.</p>

          <p>A collectibles shop in New Bedford, Massachusetts, was robbed of more than $113,000 worth of rare Pokémon cards. The thief broke into 1st Edition Collectibles early Tuesday morning and stole a targeted selection of high-value vintage cards, including a Skyridge Crystal Charizard. Surveillance footage showed a masked individual, and the owners believe the thief knew exactly which items to take as no prices are displayed in the store. The stolen cards are serialized, which the owners hope will aid in their recovery and the identification of the suspect.</p>
