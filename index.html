          <p>Donald Trump and the Justice Department have jointly requested a delay in the oral arguments for his appeal of the $83 million defamation case brought by E. Jean Carroll. Trump's legal team argues they should be allowed to appeal the court's rejection of having the government substitute for Trump in the case before the arguments proceed. The Justice Department contends that some of Trump's alleged conduct fell within his presidential duties, thus warranting government defense. The 2nd Circuit previously upheld a separate $5 million damage award to Carroll. The legal maneuvering continues in this high-profile case.</p>

The decision to ban the group will make membership illegal. This action reflects the government's response to recent pro-Palestinian activism.</p>

          <p>This article explores the potential monthly payouts from a $100,000 annuity purchased at age 65, noting that while it won't replace a full salary, it can provide meaningful supplemental income in retirement. Factors such as gender, interest rate environment, type of annuity, payout structure, and health status can impact the monthly payment. Currently, a 65-year-old man can expect around $652 per month, while a woman can expect about $627, and a joint life annuity pays approximately $570. Locking in an annuity now, while interest rates are relatively high, could be advantageous. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Credit card interest rates are increasing despite the Federal Reserve holding interest rates steady, reaching the highest levels since December. The average annual percentage rate (APR) is now just over 20%, with new cards averaging 24.3%. Card issuers are mitigating their exposure against borrowers who may default, contributing to the rate increases. Experts advise consumers to avoid carrying a balance to avoid high interest charges. The trend of rising APRs is expected to continue in the coming months.</p>

          <p>This article explores the potential for war with Israel to trigger regime change in Iran, noting that the Islamist regime has been using the conflict to rally support. However, the regime's inability to protect its top officials has raised questions about its ability to protect the country. While some believe a political vacuum could emerge if the regime weakens, others emphasize the lack of concrete plans and viable structures within the opposition. The article also touches on the role of patriotism and the West's divided stance on Iran.</p>
