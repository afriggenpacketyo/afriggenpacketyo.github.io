          <p>This article outlines the current average interest rates for 15-year and 30-year mortgages and refinancing options in a difficult housing market defined by high rates and limited inventory. It provides context on how a strong credit profile can help secure more favorable terms for prospective homebuyers and those looking to refinance. The report also notes that borrowers may see some relief if the Federal Reserve decides to pause its interest rate hikes, which could help stabilize the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A review of current savings interest rates reveals a significant gap between the national average and the rates offered by high-yield savings accounts, which can be over ten times higher. The article explains that online banks typically offer the best rates due to lower overhead costs, making them an accessible option for building an emergency fund. It advises consumers to compare different high-yield accounts, considering both interest rates and potential fees to maximize their savings growth over time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article provides the current market price of gold and offers a detailed explanation of the various factors that influence its valuation. As a traditional safe-haven asset, gold's price is affected by supply and demand, global economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical uncertainty. It also notes that currency movements, particularly the strength of the U.S. dollar, and the policies of central banks play a significant role in the precious metal's short-term price fluctuations.

          <p>As President Trump prepares for a visit to his golf course in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, local sentiment remains deeply divided. Some neighbors and activists criticize his treatment of local property owners and the environmental impact of the development, planning protests to voice their opposition. Conversely, others in the community acknowledge the economic benefits, such as job creation, that the world-class golf links have brought to the area. This highlights the complex legacy of Trump's business ventures in his mother's homeland.</p>

          <p>The latest round of Gaza ceasefire talks in Qatar has ended abruptly, with the U.S. negotiating team returning home for consultations. U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff stated that Hamas's response to proposals showed a "lack of desire to reach a ceasefire," placing the blame for the breakdown on the group. As diplomatic efforts falter, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza continues to deepen, with aid agencies reporting that children are now starving to death due to the ongoing blockade.</p>

          <p>Manchester City has agreed to a £27 million deal to bring goalkeeper James Trafford back to the club from Burnley.

Trafford, who was instrumental in Burnley's promotion to the Premier League, is now set to challenge Ederson for the number one spot at the Etihad Stadium, signaling City's confidence in his development.</p>

The entire population of over 2 million people is experiencing acute food insecurity, with hundreds of thousands on the brink of famine, and the healthcare system has effectively collapsed with no hospitals remaining fully functional.</p>

          <p>A campaign to remove artificial food dyes from products in the U.S., championed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is gaining significant ground. The U.S. dairy industry recently pledged to eliminate all artificial dyes from ice cream by 2028, following similar commitments from major food manufacturers. While research indicates the dyes affect only a small, sensitive portion of children, the shift presents major logistical and marketing challenges for an industry reliant on vibrant, artificial colors.</p>
