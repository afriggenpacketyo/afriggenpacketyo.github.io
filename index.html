          <p>House Republicans advanced a tax bill featuring trillions in tax breaks as part of Donald Trump's economic package, passing it through the House Ways and Means Committee. The bill includes raising the SALT deduction cap to $30,000 for those with a modified adjusted gross income of $400,000 or less. The full House vote is anticipated soon, though the legislation may face significant alterations in the Senate, and House Ways and Means Republicans will continue to work closely with President Trump and House colleagues to get the One, Big, Beautiful Bill that delivers on the President's agenda to his desk as soon as possible.</p>

          <p>India has asserted its technological advantage over Pakistan's weaponry, particularly noting the use of Chinese defense systems by Pakistan during recent clashes. According to New Delhi, the Indian Air Force successfully bypassed and jammed Pakistan’s Chinese-supplied air defense systems during Operation Sindoor, launched in response to an attack in Kashmir. Amid international pressure, India and Pakistan have agreed to a ceasefire, though India describes it as a temporary pause. The statement from India claimed that on the morning of May 8, the Indian Armed Forces targeted air defence radars and systems at multiple locations in Pakistan, and an air defence system in Lahore was neutralized.</p>

          <p>Republicans are once again targeting Medicaid with proposals that include work requirements and increased cost-sharing for enrollees, aiming to cut program costs which have risen to nearly $900 billion annually. However, these efforts face increased opposition due to higher Medicaid enrollment, particularly in red states, making cuts politically challenging. Public opinion polls show strong opposition to major Medicaid cuts, including among a majority of Republicans. The proposed changes could cause millions to lose health coverage, but Republicans are facing pressure from Trump voters who rely on Medicaid.</p>

The proposal also includes a $100 monthly premium for Medi-Cal enrollees aged 19 and up with "unsatisfactory immigration status," starting January 1, 2027. These measures are attributed to economic slowdown and weakened state revenues due to Trump's tariff policies and higher-than-expected healthcare utilization.

While traditional economic indicators suggest a thriving economy, many Americans are struggling to maintain a minimal standard of living.

          <p>Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy defended President Trump's potential acceptance of a Qatari-offered jet, shifting blame to Boeing for delays in providing a new Air Force One. McCarthy emphasized the need for a new presidential plane, noting the current ones are roughly 40 years old. He suggested Boeing lease another plane to the president, including the Qatari jet, to mitigate concerns about accepting a gift. The comments come amidst debate over the ethics and national security implications of accepting the gift from Qatar.</p>

Relatives expressed joy at the decision, while the Los Angeles County District Attorney maintained his opposition to their release, arguing they have not taken full responsibility for their crimes.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the immediate release of Indian academic Badar Khan Suri from ICE detention, stating the detention was against the public interest. Khan Suri, legally studying in the U.S., was targeted for his pro-Palestinian activism. The judge ruled the government did not provide sufficient evidence for its claims. The Trump administration had ordered Khan Suri's detention, alleging his father-in-law had ties to Hamas and citing his social media posts supporting Palestine.</p>

          <p>A Republican-backed bill moving forward in the House proposes a number of new tax cuts, including making Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent and adding other reductions. The bill includes a new $4,000 deduction for people 65 and older, increases the standard deduction for all taxpayers, extends and increases the Child Tax Credit, and eliminates the 1099-K reporting rule. It also eliminates taxes on tips and overtime pay, and allows car loan interest to be deducted. Some Democrats have opposed the bill for its proposed cuts to Medicaid and food stamps, part of the GOP's goal to find $880 billion in savings to help pay for the tax cuts.</p>
