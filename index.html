            <p>In Seligman, Arizona, a rancher's dog named Buford is being celebrated for finding and rescuing a 2-year-old boy, Boden Allen, who had wandered nearly seven miles from his home and spent the night alone in the desert. The Yavapai County Sheriff's Office reported that Allen was missing for about 16 hours, during which there were mountain lion sightings in the area. Buford, an Anatolian Pyrenees, found Allen on the rancher's property, and the boy was returned to his distraught parents in good health, suffering only minor cuts, scrapes, and mild dehydration.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is planning to overhaul the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to facilitate construction in areas inhabited by endangered species, aiming to boost economic growth by easing environmental regulations. One potential change involves repealing the definition of 'harm,' which currently protects endangered species' habitats. Critics argue that weakening the ESA could lead to the eradication of species due to activities like logging and mining, while supporters claim the law is overly burdensome and impedes development. The ESA, enacted in 1973, has been credited with saving numerous species, including the bald eagle and American alligator.</p>

The state's governor, Gavin Newsom, contends that the tariffs are unlawful and seeks to block their enforcement, marking the first legal challenge of its kind by a state.</p>

            <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is alerting patients to the presence of counterfeit Ozempic, a popular diabetes drug used off-label for weight loss, in the market. The FDA and Novo Nordisk, the drug's manufacturer, have identified "several hundred units" of the counterfeit drug outside the approved supply chain. Consumers and medical professionals are urged to check their Ozempic for lot number PAR0362 and serial numbers starting with 51746517. This is not the first warning about counterfeit Ozempic, as the FDA alerted the public to thousands of counterfeit doses in 2023.</p>

            <p>The Huntington Park City Council's decision to remove Councilmember Esmerelda Castillo over residency concerns has sparked controversy. The city launched an investigation, concluding she was not a resident and removing her without her knowledge.

Amidst the legal fight to regain her seat, current and former council members are also embroiled in a corruption probe over alleged misuse of public funds.</p>

            <p>President Trump's tariffs on imports from China and China's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods could lead to increased deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. If China reduces its imports of U.S. soybeans, it will likely purchase more from Brazil, driving up demand for Brazilian soy and incentivizing deforestation to create more land for soy plantations. This increased demand, combined with efforts to weaken environmental regulations in Brazil, could undermine climate goals and threaten Indigenous communities.</p>

            <p>Kilmar Ábrego García, a Maryland man, was mistakenly deported to a mega-prison in El Salvador by the Trump administration, who claimed he had gang ties. A judge has demanded his return, but El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele has refused to send him back. Despite the government's admission of an "administrative error," they continue to allege gang affiliation, which Mr. Ábrego García's family and lawyers dispute. The situation has become a political battle, with Democrats pushing for his return and Trump officials defending the deportation.</p>
