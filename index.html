          <p>The Defense Department announced the deployment of 2,000 additional National Guard troops to Los Angeles amid the Trump administration's ongoing immigration crackdown, leading to contentious protests. U.S. Northern Command stated the troops were activated under Title 10 to protect federal functions, personnel, and property, but California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the move as political theater diverting resources from critical wildfire work. Newsom has filed a lawsuit challenging the deployment, arguing it's a power grab placing California National Guard troops under federal control without his permission, which prompted a legal battle in the courts, with an appeals court hearing arguments over Trump's authority under Title 10. The situation underscores the tension between federal immigration policies and state concerns over resource allocation and sovereignty.</p>

          <p>China is anticipated to take an active role in mediating a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, amidst escalating strikes between the two nations. President Xi Jinping has urged all parties to de-escalate the conflict and expressed China's willingness to play a constructive role in restoring stability in the Middle East. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has engaged with his Iranian and Israeli counterparts, condemning Israel's attack while offering Beijing's assistance in resolving the conflict.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Karen Read, accused of killing her boyfriend John O'Keefe, may have strategically used media interviews to influence the jury in her retrial, according to a legal expert. Jurors are considering a lesser charge of operating under the influence (OUI), which Read may have admitted to in video clips played in court, potentially as a calculated risk to avoid a life sentence for second-degree murder. Despite the common advice for defendants to avoid speaking to the media, Read has engaged in numerous interviews, providing the jury with an alternative conviction option. The jury's questions during deliberations suggest they are grappling with the intent required for the more serious charges, leading to speculation about a possible compromise verdict.</p>

The G7 aims to develop a road map for standards-based markets for critical minerals by year-end, reflecting extraction, processing, and trade costs, while also increasing investment in responsible projects.

Lander's office stated he was taken into custody while observing court and escorting individuals to prevent ICE arrests, while Lander himself accused the Trump administration of targeting Democratic cities to provoke conflict.

Despite heightened rhetoric, U.S. negotiators believe Iran is in a weakened position and may be compelled to return to negotiations, potentially leading to a high-level meeting led by Special Envoy Steve Witkoff. The U.S. military is deploying additional assets to the region for defensive purposes, but also to keep options open for assisting Israel's ongoing offensive. A key question is whether the U.S. will deploy B-2 stealth bombers capable of carrying Massive Ordnance Penetrator bunker-buster bombs.</p>

The candidates for governor, Democrat Abigail Spanberger and Republican Winsome Earle-Sears, were selected prior to Tuesday. Virginia's statewide elections, held the year after a presidential election, are seen as indicators of voter sentiment and potential shifts in national politics.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's stance on Iran has exposed a bitter split among his supporters, with some advocating for military intervention alongside Israel and others urging the US to stay out of the conflict. Republican congressman Thomas Massie introduced a bill to block Trump from engaging US forces in unauthorized hostilities with Iran, reflecting concerns about involving the US in another Middle Eastern war. Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson has criticized Republican "warmongers," while Trump loyalist Marjorie Taylor Greene defended Carlson, highlighting the tensions between isolationist and hawkish factions within the Republican party.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the Trump administration from enforcing an executive order requiring Americans to select their gender assigned at birth on new passports. The ruling allows individuals applying for new passports, renewing expired ones, or changing their name or sex designation to choose the gender they identify with. The judge found that the policy discriminated against transgender Americans and failed to provide a rationale related to an important governmental interest. The Justice Department has appealed the ruling, while the White House has criticized the decision as an attempt to push radical gender ideology.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering joining Israel in striking Iranian nuclear facilities, including the underground uranium enrichment site at Fordo, according to sources familiar with the matter. Fordo, buried almost 300 feet beneath a mountain, is believed to be key to Iran's nuclear program. While some advisers support the move, there is not full agreement on how to proceed. Trump has stated that the U.S. has "complete and total control of the skies over Iran" and knows the whereabouts of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, raising questions about the U.S.'s level of involvement in the conflict.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court heard arguments in California's challenge to President Trump's deployment of the National Guard, with judges signaling potential limits on their power to rule against the president's authority. The case revolves around Trump's decision to federalize the state's National Guard troops amid protests over immigration enforcement in Los Angeles. The court questioned the extent to which it could review the president's decision to deploy troops and whether a governor's consultation is required before such a deployment. The judges did not issue a ruling, but acknowledged that another hearing is set by the lower court judge.</p>
