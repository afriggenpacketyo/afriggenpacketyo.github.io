          <p>The PKK, an outlawed Kurdish group, declared that it is laying down arms and disbanding, marking an end to its 40-year insurgency against Turkey. The group stated that it has "completed its historical mission" and will pursue Kurdish rights through democratic politics, following a call from jailed leader Abdullah Ocalan. This move comes as the PKK faces increased pressure from the Turkish military and shifts in regional dynamics, while President Erdogan seeks support from pro-Kurdish parties for his re-election bid. The decision could lead to new political dialogues and greater Kurdish rights, pending Turkey's democratic transition.</p>

          <p>As President Trump prepares for his first overseas visit to the Gulf region since regaining the White House, his family's business ventures in the area are raising ethical concerns. The Trump Organization has several active projects in the Gulf, including a new Trump International Hotel & Tower in Dubai and a $5.5 billion golf club in Qatar. Ethics experts worry about potential conflicts of interest as Trump meets with regional leaders who could influence the success of these ventures, despite the Trump Organization's claims of ethical measures to address such concerns.</p>

He points out that Missouri voters mandated Medicaid expansion in 2020 and that many residents rely on the program for healthcare. Hawley insists that cutting Medicaid is morally wrong and politically unwise, as it contradicts President Trump's promises to protect social insurance programs and would negatively impact his constituents. The Senator advocates for policies that support working families, such as capping prescription drug costs and providing tax cuts.</p>

          <p>Contributing Opinion writer Julia Belluz explores the complex issue of chemicals in ultraprocessed foods and their potential health effects. In the United States, thousands of additives are allowed in food, often without rigorous testing for long-term health impacts. The regulatory pathway known as GRAS allows companies to self-certify the safety of many chemicals, leading to concerns about transparency and potential risks. Unlike Europe, the U.S. doesn't routinely re-examine chemicals already on the market, raising questions about the safety of ingredients in common foods and their potential contribution to chronic diseases.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Congressional Republicans are proposing a significant overhaul of the federal student loan program, aiming to simplify repayment options for future borrowers. The plan would sunset most current repayment plans and offer a binary choice: a standard plan with fixed payments or a repayment assistance plan tied to income. The new repayment assistance plan would cap payments at 10% of adjusted gross income and waive remaining interest, but it would also eliminate the $0 payment option and prevent borrowers from switching plans later. This overhaul is part of a broader Republican reconciliation package.</p>

Microplastics can enter our bodies through food prepared and stored with plastic items, such as cutting boards and containers. While the FDA states that current evidence doesn't show a risk, some research suggests possible links between microplastics and health problems. Experts recommend gradually reducing plastic use in the kitchen by switching to wooden cutting boards, glass containers, and reusable cloth bags to minimize exposure.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Food scientists have discovered that chilling cooked white rice and pasta can transform digestible starches into resistant starches, a super nutrient with numerous health benefits. Resistant starch improves gut health, lowers inflammation, enhances insulin sensitivity, and aids blood sugar management. The process involves cooking the rice or pasta and then refrigerating it for at least six to eight hours, which alters the sugar chains, making them indigestible. This simple kitchen trick can turn "naughty" carbs into healthier options, offering a way to increase fiber intake and improve overall metabolic health.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump defended plans to accept a luxury Boeing aircraft as a gift, reportedly from Qatar's royal family, to replace Air Force One. He described the plane as a temporary "gift" to the Defense Department, while critics raised concerns about potential violations of gift rules and conflicts of interest. The US constitution prohibits government officials from accepting gifts "from any King, Prince or foreign State." Qatar has said reports describing the jet as a gift "are inaccurate.</p>

          <p>China and the US have agreed to a 90-day pause to the deepening trade war that has threatened to upend the global economy, with reciprocal tariffs to be lowered by 115%. The 90-day lowering of tariffs applies to the duties announced by Donald Trump on 2 April, which ultimately escalated to 125% on Chinese imports, with Beijing responding with equivalent measures. With the 115% deduction, Chinese duties on US goods will be lowered to 10%, while the US tax on Chinese goods will be lowered to 30%.</p>
