          <p>Australia's ANZ bank has issued an unconditional apology after some employees were mistakenly notified of their termination through an automated email asking for their company laptops back. The error occurred during a restructuring of the bank's retail business, and the email was sent before managers could speak to the affected staff personally. The Financial Sector Union condemned the incident, describing the company's process as chaotic and causing "panic and distress" among workers. The bank has since halted the emails and held meetings to address the situation directly with its employees.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to acquire a 10% stake in Intel has drawn criticism from conservatives and economists who fear it undermines free-market principles. The move, intended to boost domestic semiconductor production and counter China, is viewed by some as a step toward state capitalism and cronyism. Supporters within the administration argue that the government deserves a return on its investment, which utilizes funds from the Biden-era CHIPS Act. However, critics question the wisdom of investing in a struggling company and warn of potential political interference in corporate decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Twenty years after its devastation, this article examines the meteorological journey of Hurricane Katrina, which formed from a tropical depression over the Bahamas in August 2005. It details the storm's rapid intensification in the Gulf of Mexico, where it reached Category 5 strength before weakening slightly prior to its second and third landfalls. The analysis highlights the catastrophic 24-to-28-foot storm surge that breached the New Orleans levee system, leading to widespread flooding and making it one of the deadliest and costliest hurricanes in U.S. history.</p>

          <p>The 2025 college football season begins with unprecedented excitement, featuring three games between top-10 opponents in its opening week. All eyes are on the University of Texas, where Arch Manning, the highly-touted descendant of football royalty, takes over as the starting quarterback. This season also reflects the sport's shifting landscape, with conference consolidation leading to more powerhouse matchups, a new system for paying players directly, and revised College Football Playoff criteria that place a greater emphasis on strength of schedule.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following recent school shootings, child development experts are advising parents and educators on how to talk to children about such traumatic events. They recommend starting by asking what a child has already heard to understand their specific fears, rather than making broad, potentially untrue reassurances. Key strategies include being truthful, maintaining daily routines to provide a sense of security, limiting exposure to repetitive media coverage, and for older children, helping to channel feelings of anger or anxiety into constructive action and advocacy.</p>

Paetongtarn is the fifth Thai prime minister to be removed by the court in 17 years, a decision that could trigger fresh political turmoil in the country.</p>

However, his time was also marked by controversy, including a multi-match ban for criticizing referees and initiating legal proceedings against a rival club for alleged "racist statements," which they denied.</p>
