        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump has initiated a libel lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch, Dow Jones & Co., and two Wall Street Journal reporters. The suit, filed in a Florida federal court, stems from an article alleging Trump sent a "bawdy" letter to Jeffrey Epstein for his 50th birthday in 2003. Trump has vehemently denied the letter's authenticity, calling it a "FAKE letter" and a "Scam" on his Truth Social platform. He stated he looks forward to deposing Murdoch as part of the legal proceedings.</p>

          <p>A complex prisoner swap has resulted in the freedom of ten Americans who were detained in Venezuela. The deal involved the U.S., Venezuela, and El Salvador, with the latter returning 252 Venezuelan nationals from a high-security prison in exchange for the Americans and dozens of Venezuelan political prisoners. Secretary of State Marco Rubio credited President Trump's leadership for securing the release, stating every wrongfully detained American in Venezuela is now free. The exchange was described by officials as a delicate, "down-to-the-wire" humanitarian deal that did not involve sanctions relief.</p>

          <h2>Political Commentary Questions Congressional Republicans' Support for White House Legislation</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis from The Atlantic questions the motivations of Republican members of Congress who publicly express concerns about White House legislative priorities but ultimately vote in favor of them. The article highlights senators like Josh Hawley and Lisa Murkowski, who criticized aspects of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" but provided the crucial votes for its passage. This behavior is framed as an abdication of legislative responsibility, effectively ceding power to the executive branch. The commentary suggests this trend reflects a fear of political backlash and a misunderstanding of Congress's constitutional role.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that approximately two-thirds of Americans are in favor of the United States returning to the moon and eventually sending astronauts to Mars. Support is particularly strong among younger Americans who did not witness the original moon landing. The 1969 lunar mission is still widely viewed as a worthwhile achievement and a source of national pride. The survey suggests that the public generally believes the space program contributes to both technological advancements and a positive national identity, with these views holding across party lines.</p>

          <p>A new law signed by President Trump introduces a $250 "visa integrity fee" for many nonimmigrant visitors to the United States, including international students and temporary skilled workers. The fee, part of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," is effective for the current fiscal year and will be adjusted for inflation annually. While the fee is potentially refundable if visa holders comply with all terms, the mechanism for collection and reimbursement has not yet been established. Immigration advocates argue this and other new fees create significant financial hurdles for legal immigration pathways.</p>

          <p>A jury has ordered the city of Los Angeles to pay $48.8 million to Kamran Hakimi, a man left in a coma after being hit by a city sanitation truck in a crosswalk. The driver made an unsafe right turn, and though the city admitted liability, it disputed the extent of the damages, arguing Hakimi's comatose state minimized his suffering. Hakimi's attorneys criticized the City Attorney for refusing to settle the case, contributing to escalating legal payouts for the city. The verdict includes $25 million for future pain and suffering for the 61-year-old father of five.</p>

The bulk of the recently discussed files originate from a 2015 civil lawsuit that was settled in 2017, with records being unsealed in stages since 2019.

          <p>The U.K. Foreign Office has imposed sanctions on 18 Russian military intelligence officers and three GRU espionage units for conducting a "sustained campaign of malicious cyber activity." The sanctioned individuals are accused of targeting U.K. media, infrastructure, and political institutions, as well as involvement in a deadly strike in Mariupol, Ukraine. Foreign Secretary David Lammy stated the spies were working to destabilize Europe and that the U.K. would not tolerate these hybrid threats. The move coincides with the EU announcing its own new round of sanctions against Russia.</p>

          <p>An NPR report highlights the severe downstream environmental consequences in Thailand caused by the expanding production of rare earth minerals in neighboring Myanmar. China, which dominates the global market for these critical minerals used in modern technology, sources a significant portion from Myanmar. The mining operations there are reportedly leading to pollution and other environmental problems that affect Thailand's ecosystem. This situation illustrates the complex and often hidden environmental costs associated with the global supply chain for high-tech components, creating cross-border tensions over resource extraction.</p>

          <p>The newly signed Genius Act establishes the first major federal regulations for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar. The law, which passed with broad bipartisan support, aims to provide consumer protections and clear operational rules for issuers. This framework allows traditional financial institutions like banks and credit unions to enter the market by issuing their own stablecoins. Proponents argue the law will foster innovation in payments, making transactions faster and cheaper while strengthening the dollar's role in the digital economy.</p>

          <p>Following the news that CBS is canceling "The Late Show," President Trump celebrated the show's demise and personally targeted its host, Stephen Colbert. On Truth Social, Trump called Colbert a "complete and total loser" with no talent and suggested that ABC's Jimmy Kimmel, who he claimed has "even less talent," would be next to be fired. The cancellation has drawn criticism from other late-night hosts and Democratic politicians, some of whom suggest the move was politically motivated by CBS's parent company, Paramount, to appease the administration.</p>

          <p>The cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" is being analyzed as a symbolic end for the era of late-night political comedy that rose to prominence with Jon Stewart's "The Daily Show." While CBS cited financial reasons, the timing, following Colbert's criticism of parent company Paramount's settlement with Trump, has fueled speculation about political pressure. The article argues that the genre, once seen as a vital and edgy form of critique during the Bush years, has struggled to maintain its urgency and cultural bite, becoming an institution itself rather than a challenger.</p>

In contrast, spending on premium cabin airfare and high-end hotels remains strong. The company reaffirmed its full-year guidance despite investor concerns over competition in the premium card market.
