          <p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff faced significant backlash after suggesting President Trump should deploy federal troops to San Francisco for public safety, leading prominent tech investor Ron Conway to resign from the Salesforce Foundation board. Conway, a long-time Democratic donor, cited a fundamental misalignment of values, while Benioff's comments were amplified by right-wing figures like Elon Musk, who characterized downtown San Francisco as a "drug zombie apocalypse." Benioff later attempted to clarify his stance, emphasizing local responsibility for safety, but the controversy persisted. California Governor Gavin Newsom and San Francisco leaders publicly rejected the idea of federal troops, asserting that crime rates were declining. This article highlights the broader political and social tensions surrounding urban governance and corporate influence.</p>

          <p>Appleby Blue Almshouse, a modern housing complex in Southwark, South London, designed to combat loneliness among over-65s, has won the prestigious Royal Institute of British Architects' (Riba) Stirling Prize for Britain's best new building. The complex features 59 affordable flats and communal facilities, including a roof garden, courtyard, and community kitchen, built on the site of an old care home. Judges praised architects Witherford Watson Mann for creating "high-quality" and "thoughtful" spaces that foster an "aspirational living environment," diverging significantly from traditional older people's housing. This article celebrates the project's innovative approach to social housing and its recognition as a benchmark for design vision and originality in architecture.</p>

          <p>The fourth episode of "The Celebrity Traitors" generated buzz for a challenge where celebrities mimicked banshee shrieks, which became a social media highlight due to amusing subtitles. Viewers particularly praised Celia Imrie's efforts and facial expressions, calling her "the funniest person to have ever existed." However, the main talking point remained the celebrities' ongoing inability to identify a Traitor, leading to frustration among critics and viewers. TV sports presenter Clare Balding was ultimately banished after receiving seven votes, only to reveal she was, in fact, a Faithful. This article highlights the show's blend of comedic moments and dramatic betrayals, as the Traitors continue to outwit the Faithfuls.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications, which applies only to new petitions.

          <p>President Trump's unusual admission of authorizing CIA covert operations in Venezuela raises questions about the scope and implications of such actions. Experts suggest the authorization could grant the agency broad leeway, including lethal strikes against suspected drug traffickers or broader operations aimed at destabilizing or toppling the Maduro regime, drawing parallels to historical interventions in Latin America. While specific plans remain unclear, past presidential findings have led to varied covert actions, from providing lethal aid to insurgencies to regime change efforts. This article delves into the potential forms these operations could take, such as paramilitary strikes or influence operations, and the complex, often negative, historical track record of such interventions in the region.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has continued to block President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops in the Chicago area, ruling that the administration failed to justify its actions under Title 10 federal law.

This decision maintains the Guard troops under federal control but prevents their deployment within Illinois, marking a significant legal setback for the Trump administration's use of federal authority in response to protests.

          <p>U.S. cybersecurity company F5 saw its stock sink 10% after disclosing a system breach by a "highly sophisticated nation-state threat actor," later attributed to China-backed hackers. The attacker gained long-term access to F5's BIG-IP product development environment, infiltrating source code and undisclosed vulnerabilities. The breach, which lasted over 12 months using malware called Brickstorm, prompted an emergency directive from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) for all federal agencies to apply the latest F5 software update. This article highlights a significant cybersecurity incident, its impact on a major tech company, and the broader implications for national security given the involvement of state-backed actors and the potential for catastrophic system compromise.

          <p>Americans are facing a dramatic surge in robocalls and robotexts, reaching an average of 2.56 billion calls monthly and 19 billion texts annually, marking the highest levels in six years. A U.S. PIRG Education Fund report reveals that sophisticated scams, often impersonating the IRS, banks, or package delivery services, are proliferating despite safeguards, with AI making them easier to deploy. Victims are losing significant amounts, averaging $3,690 per scam call. This article highlights the growing consumer nuisance, the substantial financial toll of these predatory messages, and the mixed success of regulatory efforts like the TRACED Act in combating the evolving tactics of scammers, as less than half of phone companies have installed mandated software.</p>

Concerns also exist about protein powders, as Consumer Reports found more than two-thirds of tested products contained unsafe levels of lead. This article provides expert advice on appropriate protein intake, recommending 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight for most adults, emphasizing the benefits of whole foods over supplements for general health, and highlights potential risks associated with unregulated products.</p>

          <p>European carmakers are bracing for significant production disruptions due to a trade and intellectual property dispute involving chipmaker Nexperia, caught between China and the Dutch government. Nexperia, owned by China's Wingtech, warned it could not guarantee chip deliveries after the Dutch government took control, citing technology transfer concerns. This move followed U.S. pressure and export control restrictions on Wingtech, which was placed on the U.S. entity list. This article highlights the vulnerability of the European auto sector to geopolitical tensions, as Nexperia's essential, albeit not highly sophisticated, chips are crucial for vehicle manufacturing, and the dispute could cause further strain on an already challenged industry.

          <p>Apple's new "Live Translation" feature for AirPods, advertised as a hands-free interpreter, struggles with real-world conditions like high ambient noise and regional language variations. An article reviewer found the beta feature frequently interrupted by "AMBIENT SOUND LEVELS ARE HIGH" warnings, and provided inaccurate translations for Mexican Spanish terms like "rajas" and "cempasúchil," optimizing instead for Spain's Spanish. The tool also requires manual interaction, disrupting natural conversation flow and creating awkward social situations. This article critiques the feature's performance, highlighting the gap between its seamless promotional video and actual user experience, and raises broader questions about AI translation's ability to capture the cultural nuances of language beyond mere dictionary definitions.</p>

          <p>The University of Southern California (USC) has rejected a controversial education compact offered by the Trump administration, which sought to align universities with a conservative vision of higher education in exchange for priority federal research funding. Interim President Beong-Soo Kim cited concerns that tying research benefits to such commitments would, over time, undermine the very values of free inquiry and academic excellence the compact purported to promote. The compact demanded adherence to a two-sex gender definition, restricted foreign student enrollment, and mandated tuition freezes, among other politically charged requirements.

Grijalva's signature would be the decisive 218th needed to force a House vote on the bipartisan petition to release the files. Johnson claims the delay is due to the government shutdown and denies political motivation, despite previously swearing in other new members during similar circumstances. Democrats and advocates for the Epstein files are furious, with Arizona's Attorney General threatening legal action.

Applying intelligence analytic methods, the report concludes with "moderate to high confidence" that the U.S. is moving towards "competitive authoritarianism," characterized by manipulated elections and weakened checks and balances. The assessment cites actions like pardoning January 6 rioters, purging officials, prosecuting political opponents, and deploying troops to U.S. cities as evidence of accelerating democratic decline.

The privately funded project, inspired by Paris's Arc de Triomphe, is part of his broader vision for the capital, which includes a gilded White House makeover and clearing homeless encampments. Developing such a monument on federal land is complex, typically requiring congressional approval and years of process through bodies like the National Capital Planning Commission, making its completion by next year's anniversary unlikely.
