          <p>In Kerrville, Texas, a family-owned restaurant named Billy Gene’s is providing free, home-cooked meals to first responders managing the catastrophic flood crisis. The owners expressed their gratitude for the emergency personnel, stating that offering food is their way of supporting the community during this difficult time. This act of kindness highlights the local spirit of resilience and mutual support as the community grapples with the disaster's aftermath. The restaurant itself was not damaged, but it is helping an employee who lost their home in the flood.</p>

          <p>A 27-year-old man from Michigan was shot and killed by law enforcement after he opened fire on a U.S. Border Patrol station in McAllen, Texas. The suspect, armed with a rifle and wearing tactical gear, fired dozens of rounds at the building, injuring two police officers and a border patrol employee. Authorities have not yet determined a motive for the attack, which occurred near the McAllen airport. The FBI has taken over the investigation, and police believe there is no further threat to the community.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has reportedly allowed a rule requiring passengers in standard screening lines to remove their shoes to expire at some U.S. airports. While the change appears to be a phased rollout, travelers at several major airports have reported not having to remove footwear. This adjustment brings the standard screening process closer to the expedited TSA PreCheck experience, which already permits leaving shoes on. The TSA stated it is continuously exploring ways to improve the passenger experience while maintaining strong security.</p>

After returning, Cruz toured the damage at Camp Mystic, calling it heartbreaking and emphasizing the need for a retrospective review of the warning systems. He dismissed accusations of politicizing the tragedy, particularly those linking the disaster's severity to Trump administration budget cuts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Officials from NOAA confirmed that the local weather office had increased staffing during the event and issued warnings hours in advance.</p>

          <p>Samsung Electronics has projected a 56% decrease in its second-quarter operating profit, falling significantly short of market expectations. The decline is largely attributed to the company's difficulties in the competitive artificial intelligence sector, particularly in supplying high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips to industry leader Nvidia. Competitors like SK Hynix have gained a stronger foothold, while Samsung's efforts to get its latest HBM chips certified by Nvidia have reportedly faced delays.

          <p>In the wake of the deadly Texas floods, scrutiny is falling on the effectiveness of emergency warning systems and the accuracy of weather forecasts. While local officials claim the rainfall exceeded predictions, records show the National Weather Service issued escalating warnings in the hours before the disaster. Questions are being raised about why more wasn't done to evacuate residents, especially given the area's history of flooding. The debate also includes whether staffing and budget cuts at the NWS under the Trump administration may have impacted the agency's ability to coordinate with local emergency managers.</p>

          <p>Former Russian Transport Minister Roman Starovoit died by suicide just hours after being dismissed from his post by President Vladimir Putin. Officials reported his body was found with a gunshot wound in a Moscow suburb. His dismissal occurred amid major air travel disruptions in Russia and reports that he was implicated in an embezzlement investigation related to state funds for military fortifications. Starovoit, the former governor of the Kursk region, had been partially blamed for security failures during a recent Ukrainian incursion into the area.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The devastating flash flood in Texas serves as a stark warning for California, which faces similar dangers from extreme weather events, according to experts. Researchers note that low-lying areas along California's rivers and creeks are hazardous, and past floods have proven deadly. While California may have stronger regulations restricting construction in high-risk floodways, the state's geography and the increasing intensity of storms due to climate change create significant risks. The Texas tragedy underscores the need for improved risk awareness and timely action in vulnerable communities across the country.</p>

          <p>Seraphine, the maternity fashion retailer famously worn by Catherine, Princess of Wales, has ceased trading and entered administration. The company, which had a flagship store in London and was stocked by major retailers, faced significant trading challenges due to rising costs and fragile consumer confidence. The majority of its 95 employees have been made redundant as administrators explore options for the business and its assets. The collapse marks a sharp downturn for a brand that gained international popularity after being seen on royalty.</p>

          <p>Market analyst Jim Cramer advised investors not to overreact to President Trump's latest tariff announcements, suggesting they are likely a starting point for negotiations rather than a fixed policy. He argued that the administration has a history of postponing or reducing tariffs and that the ultimate goal is to increase U.S. exports, not just build domestic plants. While acknowledging the market's negative reaction to the news, Cramer believes the tariffs may not significantly impact inflation or the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions, and he cautioned against major selling.

          <p>Dozens of federal officers in tactical gear, some on horseback and in armored vehicles, descended on the MacArthur Park neighborhood of Los Angeles in a large-scale operation. Local leaders, including Mayor Karen Bass, condemned the action as a "political stunt" and an intimidation tactic aimed at the historic immigrant community. The show of force, which involved about 90 California National Guard troops, reportedly caused fear and disruption, with children at a nearby daycare being ushered inside for safety.

          <p>A report has highlighted that Texas Senator Ted Cruz, prior to the deadly floods in his state, inserted language into a Republican spending bill that cut funding for NOAA's weather forecasting research. This action has drawn sharp criticism, especially as Cruz was on vacation in Greece when the disaster struck. Critics argue that gutting funding for the very systems meant to warn the public of extreme weather makes such events more deadly. Cruz has dismissed these claims as "partisan finger pointing," while the White House has called any blame placed on the administration a "depraved lie."</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock value plummeted by 6.8%, wiping nearly $80 billion from its market capitalization, as investors reacted to CEO Elon Musk's announcement of a new political party. There is growing concern that Musk's increasing involvement in politics, which has included both support for and antagonism toward Donald Trump, will serve as a major distraction and potentially damage the Tesla brand. Analysts noted a sense of exhaustion among shareholders who prefer the CEO to focus on the company's business operations rather than engaging in polarizing political activities.
