          <h2>UN Sounds Alarm Over Global Surge in Vaccine-Preventable Diseases</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-24 01:11:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The WHO, UNICEF, and Gavi have jointly warned of a concerning rise in vaccine-preventable diseases, including measles, meningitis, and yellow fever, attributing the increase to funding cuts, misinformation, and humanitarian crises. Measles cases have seen a significant resurgence, rising by 20% to 10.3 million in 2023, with a likely continuation of this trend. Gavi is appealing for $9 billion in funding to protect 500 million children by 2030, as vaccine funding faces massive cuts, exacerbated by misinformation and crises like the war in Gaza. The decrease in vaccinations threatens to reverse decades of progress in global health, especially as the US President Donald Trump has drastically cut humanitarian aid to various agencies since taking office this year.</p>

          <p>Kyiv was struck by a deadly Russian missile and drone attack, resulting in at least nine fatalities and 60 injuries, including children, according to the city's mayor. Falling drone wreckage ignited several fires, and there are concerns that people are trapped under the debris of a destroyed residential building. Blasts were also reported in Kharkiv, injuring at least two people, marking an escalation in the conflict's impact on civilian areas. This attack occurred shortly after US President Donald Trump accused Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky of hindering peace negotiations by rejecting Russian control of Crimea.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Campaigners are calling for individuals convicted of murder, manslaughter, or stalking to be confined to specific zones after their release from prison. This proposal arises from victims' experiences, where exclusion zones around their homes felt restrictive to their own freedom. While the Ministry of Justice asserts that exclusion zones prevent offenders from approaching victims, some experts raise concerns about potential human rights breaches. The proposed approach aims to prioritize victims' safety and well-being while balancing the rights of offenders, prompting debate on the proportionality and necessity of such restrictions.</p>

          <p>Public criticism of Hamas is increasing in Gaza, with residents expressing defiance against the group, which has ruled the strip for almost 20 years, blaming Hamas for the ongoing crisis. Despite the dangers of speaking out, protesters are demanding Hamas' removal, citing the toll of repeated conflicts with Israel. The situation has been exacerbated by Hamas' suppression of dissent, including instances of abduction, torture, and killings of critics, indicating a potential shift in the group's authority. Civilians, pushed to the brink by Israeli bombardment, are seemingly losing their fear of Hamas, signaling a significant development in the region's dynamics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jeffrey Frankel, a Harvard professor, suggests the odds of a US recession are as high as 60% for the coming year, citing indicators like an inverted yield curve, declining consumer confidence, and pessimistic business forecasts. Prediction markets are also showing increased odds of a recession. While unemployment remains low, other measures like purchasing managers' indices and real-time GDP estimates suggest a potential downturn. Frankel advises caution, stating that based on current information, the US economy may be heading for a recession due to trade tensions and policy uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's promise to disengage the U.S. military from Middle East conflicts is challenged by an escalating military campaign in Yemen, led by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The operation, aimed at halting Houthi attacks on Red Sea commercial ships, has failed to restore regular traffic and is drawing the U.S. into a costly and potentially escalatory spiral. The financial burden includes expenses for aircraft carrier strike groups, B-2 bomber airstrikes, and antimissile interceptors, with the military operation expected to reach $2 billion in May. A recent deadly attack on an oil terminal and the downing of U.S. drones highlight the challenges and risks of the ongoing campaign.</p>

          <p>Indonesia has committed to maintaining "balanced and constructive" relationships with both China and the United States, signaling a careful neutrality in its foreign policy. Following high-level defence and foreign policy talks in Beijing, Indonesia aims to preserve its strategic flexibility and reinforce its role as a regional power broker. The first 2+2 dialogue between China and Indonesia's foreign and defence ministers marked the 75th anniversary of their diplomatic relations. This approach underscores Indonesia's diplomatic balancing act amid the strategic competition between the US and China.</p>

          <p>A recent Fox News poll indicates that President Donald Trump's approval rating is declining, falling behind that of his recent predecessors at a similar point in their terms. Trump's approval rating stands at 44%, compared to higher ratings for Joe Biden, Barack Obama, and George W. Bush at the same stage. The poll attributes the decline to economic issues, with only 38% approving of Trump's handling of the economy, and disapproval rates high for inflation and tariffs. Other polls, including those from Reuters/Ipsos and Pew, also show a decrease in Trump's approval rating.</p>
