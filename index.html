          <p>Hamas has proposed a new Gaza ceasefire deal involving the release of nine hostages in exchange for a 60-day truce and the release of Palestinian prisoners by Israel. This proposal comes as Israel launched a major new offensive in the Gaza Strip, resulting in significant casualties. The proposed deal would also allow for the entry of 400 aid trucks per day and the evacuation of medical patients from Gaza. Israel has demanded proof of life and detailed information about all remaining hostages, and has not yet responded publicly to the proposed deal, but has stated it would not withdraw troops from Gaza or commit to an end to the war.</p>

President Trump plans to speak with both Putin and Zelenskyy, and Rubio believes a face-to-face meeting between Trump and Putin is essential for progress.

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has signaled that a youth mobility scheme could be included in a new agreement with the EU, but insists it would not reinstate pre-Brexit freedom of movement. The proposed scheme would allow young people to move abroad for up to two years on a reciprocal basis. Critics like Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch have expressed concerns that the scheme could lead to "free movement through the back door." An agreement is expected to be announced at a summit between the UK and the EU, although details regarding eligibility and caps on numbers are still being negotiated.</p>

          <p>Paleontologists have discovered the fossilized remains of a 500-million-year-old, three-eyed predator named Mosura fentoni, nicknamed the "sea moth." The creature, about the length of an index finger, possessed a pencil sharpener-like mouth lined with teeth and intimidating claws. The discovery provides new insights into animal life during the Cambrian period. Researchers found that Mosura was more complex than previously understood, featuring a segmented body with gills similar to modern arthropods. The well-preserved fossil also revealed the creature's open circulatory system.</p>

          <p>The audio recording of former President Joe Biden's interview with Special Counsel Robert K. Hur has been released, revealing memory lapses and unsteady responses. The recording, published by Axios, shows Biden struggling to recall dates and details, supporting Hur's conclusion that he would be perceived as a "sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory." The release puts Democrats in an uncomfortable position after previously vouching for Biden's sharpness and command. The audio also includes digressions and instances where Biden's lawyers step in to provide dates and details.</p>

          <p>Erling Haaland's Wembley Stadium goalscoring drought persisted as Manchester City lost the FA Cup final to Crystal Palace. During the game, Haaland passed up the opportunity to take a penalty, instead handing the ball to Omar Marmoush, who missed the spot-kick. Manager Pep Guardiola stated the decision was based on the players' feelings in the moment. Former Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney suggested the pressure of taking a penalty at Wembley might have been too much for Haaland.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has criticized Russia for sending a delegation of low-level negotiators to peace talks in Istanbul, with President Zelenskyy stating that real progress won't happen until he meets with Putin directly. Despite the lack of a ceasefire agreement, both sides agreed to exchange 1,000 prisoners of war. Ukrainian officials accused the Russian delegation of making unacceptable demands, including troop withdrawals. Experts suggest that Russia is not ready for serious talks due to its advantage on the front lines and that any potential rapprochement is more likely in the fall.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has chided the Trump administration for its aggressive deportation policies, emphasizing the importance of due process for immigrants. The justices criticized the administration's attempt to provide only a day's warning to Venezuelan immigrants facing deportation under an 18th-century wartime law. The ruling underscores the legal principle that immigrants should have the opportunity to challenge their deportations, particularly when the administration claims extraordinary powers to remove them. Legal scholars have hailed the court's support for due process while expressing concern that such support was even necessary.</p>
