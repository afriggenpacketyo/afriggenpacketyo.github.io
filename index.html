          <h2>UK Energy Bills Set to Decrease Slightly in July</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-23 03:26:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem has announced that energy bills in England, Scotland, and Wales will decrease by 7% in July, marking the first drop in a year, which translates to a ¬£129 annual saving for a typical household. While this reduction is welcome news, charities emphasize that many individuals still struggle with energy costs, collectively owing suppliers around ¬£4 billion. The price cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. The decrease is attributed to a fall in international wholesale gas prices, though prices remain higher than previous years and customer debt continues to be a significant issue.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has criticized Sir Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron, and Mark Carney for allegedly emboldening Hamas following the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington DC. Netanyahu accused the leaders of buying into ‚ÄúHamas propaganda‚Äù and suggesting their condemnation of Israel's actions in Gaza contributed to the tragedy. He also claimed the formation of an independent Palestine would allow radicals sent from Iran ‚Äútake over‚Äù the territory and ‚Äúdestroy the Jewish state‚Äù. British officials have rejected Netanyahu's claims, emphasizing their condemnation of the murders and advocating for a ceasefire and humanitarian aid to Gaza.</p>

          <p>Tensions have escalated in the South China Sea as China deployed water cannon against Philippine vessels near Sandy Cay. The Chinese coastguard claims the Philippine vessels illegally entered waters near Subi Reef and Sandy Cay in the Spratly Islands. According to the coastguard statement, the Philippine vessels landed personnel on Sandy Cay and, ignoring repeated warnings, ‚Äúdangerously‚Äù approached a Chinese ship as it was carrying out regular law enforcement operations, resulting in the collision. China urges the Philippines to cease infringing actions, while asserting its rights protection and law enforcement activities in the disputed waters.</p>

          <p>Eastern Australia is grappling with massive floods caused by incessant rain, leading to inundated streets, isolated towns, and destroyed homes, with parts of New South Wales being the most affected. The storms have brought over six months' worth of rain in just three days, prompting the government to declare a natural disaster and allocate additional resources to the impacted areas. The death toll has risen to four, with tens of thousands of people remaining stranded and rescue and recovery efforts underway. Experts suggest that these extreme weather events are linked to climate change, with abnormally warm oceans contributing to more intense rainfall.</p>

          <p>The US Mint is preparing to halt penny production following President Donald Trump's directive to abolish the coin, which he deems "so wasteful." The decision, supported by the US Treasury, anticipates annual savings of $56 million in reduced material costs. Made from zinc with a copper coating, the penny costs almost four cents to produce, yet is underutilized, according to the Treasury. Advocates for eliminating the penny cite its high production cost and limited utility, while others emphasize its value in charity drives and cheaper production cost compared to the nickel coin.</p>

          <p>A decision by the Trump administration to revoke Harvard's ability to enroll international students could significantly affect the university's sports teams. The Department of Homeland Security cited an unsafe campus environment due to ‚Äúanti-American, pro-terrorist agitators‚Äù as the reason for the revocation. Many of Harvard's sports teams, such as the men's heavyweight crew, men's hockey, and men's squash, have a high percentage of international players. Harvard is working to provide guidance to students, calling the action unlawful.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed to explore holding a face-to-face meeting in June on the fringes of the Group of Seven summit in Canada, with both expressing hope that a preceding round of ministerial-level tariff negotiations will be "productive." During a roughly 45-minute telephone conversation, Ishiba and Trump also agreed on the need to achieve "win-win" bilateral relations through the tariff negotiations. Japan has been urging the United States to rethink its tariff policy due to concern about its impact on the export-driven Japanese economy.</p>
