          <p>The Chinese central government is requiring local administrations to justify any annual increase in company fines exceeding 20%, aiming to curb illegal investigations and profit-seeking behaviors targeting private enterprises. This directive is part of a broader economic recovery effort initiated in March, addressing issues like arbitrary fines, inconsistent enforcement standards, and abuse of power, which are major concerns for businesses. Hu Weilie, Chinaâ€™s vice-minister of justice, emphasized the campaign's success hinges on truly correcting these problems through real-time nationwide statistical analysis of enforcement activity, focusing on unusual increases in punitive fees. The Justice Ministry hopes this initiative will foster a more stable and predictable business environment.</p>

          <p>Internal documents obtained by The Guardian depict a crisis within the Department of Veterans Affairs, marked by canceled contracts, hiring freezes, and staff departures. The Danville VA medical center closed its acute care unit due to nurse resignations, while Orlando faced a backlog of unread radiology exams. Senator Richard Blumenthal described the agency as "rash and reckless," citing the dismissal of 2,500 workers and the cancellation of contracts. Veterans expressed frustration over delayed appointments and lost jobs, fearing a decline in the agency's trusted services, and a rally is planned in Washington D.C. to address these issues.</p>

The case could threaten coverage for preventive services under the Affordable Care Act, impacting millions. Critics like Kae Greenberg warn that restricting access to preventive healthcare, particularly for LGBTQ+ individuals, could have deadly consequences.

          <p>President Trump has repeatedly claimed record-breaking military recruitment figures, attributing the success to his reelection. However, military data indicates that enlistments began rebounding before the election, with experts crediting Biden-era recruitment reforms. While enlistments have increased year-over-year, they remain below previous peaks, and the Army adjusted its goals after falling short in prior years. Experts highlight the impact of programs like the Army's Future Soldier Prep Course and a recent pay increase for junior enlisted troops as key factors in the recruitment improvements, rather than solely partisan politics.</p>

          <p>A proposed federal voucher program in the Republicans' tax bill aims to use federal tax credits to fund private school tuition, potentially benefiting wealthy donors and altering the landscape of education. The plan rewards charitable donations to Scholarship Granting Organizations (SGOs) with dollar-for-dollar tax credits, creating an incentive for donors to contribute stock and avoid capital gains taxes. While proponents argue it offers families educational choice, critics like Hilary Wething call it a tax shelter for the wealthy, as vouchers would be available to households earning up to 300% of an area's median income. The plan raises concerns about private schools' ability to reject students with disabilities and the potential for tuition hikes, mirroring experiences in states with voucher programs.</p>

          <p>Electric grills are gaining popularity as a climate-friendly alternative to traditional fossil fuel grills, offering convenience and cost savings. Switching to electric grills reduces reliance on propane and charcoal, aligning with electrification efforts to transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources. Manufacturers are now producing full-size electric grills capable of reaching high temperatures, appealing to younger consumers and apartment dwellers. While some chefs remain skeptical about replicating traditional grilling flavors, electric grills provide consistent heat and precise temperature control, making them suitable for cooking vegetables and achieving perfect grill marks.</p>

Senate Republicans have raised concerns about the bill's impact on the national debt and are calling for steeper spending cuts. While Senate Republicans aim to pass Trump's legislative agenda, they intend to leave their mark on the package by addressing objections. The potential retooling of the bill could complicate its passage in the House, as Republicans aim to pass the bill through both chambers by July 4th.</p>

The meme coin, which bears Trump's name, saw its value fluctuate significantly, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest as Trump and his family are active participants in the crypto industry. Critics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, denounced Trump for allegedly using the presidency to enrich himself through crypto, while the White House defended the event as promoting innovation. The event has drawn scrutiny due to Trump's evolving stance on cryptocurrency and his family's involvement in the crypto exchange World Liberty Financial.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Florida has suggested that President Trump possesses the authority to impose tariffs unilaterally, citing the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 and a 1970s court case. Despite this view, Judge T. Kent Wetherell II transferred a lawsuit challenging the tariffs to the Court of International Trade in New York. The decision marks the first time a federal judge has indicated that Trump's tariffs fall within his presidential authority. The ruling draws on a precedent from a case involving a Japanese zipper company suing the Nixon administration over tariffs, affirming the president's power to regulate imports.</p>
