          <p>The Trump administration's new tariffs have surprisingly included remote Antarctic territories like the Heard and McDonald Islands, home to penguins and seals, and largely untouched by human activity for nearly a decade.  This move, part of a broader trade retaliation scheme, has drawn criticism and sparked concerns about the global reach of the tariffs.  Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese expressed astonishment, highlighting the far-reaching implications of the policy.  The tariffs impact various Australian territories, alongside others like Svalbard and the Falklands.</p>
