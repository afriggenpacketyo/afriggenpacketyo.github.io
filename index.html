          <p>Filmmaker Ken Burns has described the American Revolution as one of the most significant events in world history, arguing it fundamentally 'turned the world upside down' by creating the concept of a citizen rather than a subject. In an interview, he emphasized that while the original promises of the Declaration of Independence did not include all people, its inspirational words have since driven progress for marginalized groups. Burns, promoting his upcoming documentary, also contended that embracing the complicated and flawed stories of historical figures enriches the nation's history and makes it accessible to everyone.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Yolo County, California, have confirmed the discovery of human remains at the site of a massive explosion and fire at the Devastating Pyrotechnics warehouse. The incident, which occurred on Tuesday, left seven individuals unaccounted for, and officials have not yet made a positive identification of the remains. The investigation has revealed that the company was operating without the necessary local permits to store fireworks on the agricultural property. The federal Bureau ofAlcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is now assisting with the ongoing investigation into the tragic event.</p>

          <p>Economists are raising alarms over President Trump's latest tax and spending bill, which the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects will add $3.4 trillion to the federal deficit over ten years. Experts warn that the country is already on an 'exploding debt path,' and this legislation could accelerate the risk of a financial crisis. They caution that increased national debt leads to higher interest rates for consumers on mortgages and car loans, while also limiting the government's ability to respond to future emergencies. Some fear this could trigger a 'doom loop' of rising rates and debt, potentially forcing painful austerity measures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two brothers are on trial for allegedly assaulting three police officers at Manchester Airport, an incident which prosecutors say began with a confrontation inside a Starbucks. Mohammed Fahir Amaaz, 20, is accused of headbutting and punching another man in the coffee shop before he and his brother, Muhammad Amaad, 26, resisted arrest in the terminal's car park. The prosecution claims the brothers used a 'high level of violence,' resulting in one officer suffering a broken nose. The defendants deny the allegations and are claiming self-defense, with the trial set to continue next week.</p>

The measure creates a new deduction for tipped employees, though it is set to expire in 2028 and has varying income eligibility caps depending on the final bill version. While the White House touts it as a significant benefit for the working class, critics argue it will not help the lowest-earning workers who already have no federal tax liability. Labor advocates suggest that raising the federal minimum wage would be a more effective way to support low-wage workers. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A cardiologist with over two decades of experience treating heart attacks has identified five types of food he advises against feeding children to promote lifelong health. These include microwave popcorn with chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts high in added sugar, processed meats like bacon and hot dogs, sugary cereals, and deep-fried foods. The doctor emphasizes that these foods contribute to inflammation and poor metabolic health, laying the groundwork for chronic diseases in adulthood. Instead, he recommends healthier alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain yogurt with fruit, lean proteins, and whole foods.</p>

Ethereum's co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, noted that institutions value the network for its stability and dependability, not just speed. This shift towards utility suggests Ethereum is solidifying its position as the trusted back-end plumbing for the future of finance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of five Democratic state lawmakers was denied entry to a new, controversial immigration detention facility in Florida, just one day after the first detainees arrived. The remote jail, dubbed 'Alligator Alcatraz' by President Trump, was established through a partnership between the state and the federal government to support the administration's immigration crackdown. The lawmakers condemned the denial of access as an 'abuse of power' intended to hide potential human rights violations. The facility is part of a broader effort in Florida to increase immigration enforcement through local law enforcement partnerships.</p>

While some soldiers report acceptance within their units, others face discrimination and threats with little legal recourse. A key issue is the lack of legal recognition for same-sex partnerships, which denies partners rights in medical emergencies or in case of a soldier's death.

          <p>As competitive eaters like Joey Chestnut consume massive quantities of food in contests, health experts warn of the potential short-term and long-term consequences. A 2007 study showed that a competitive eater's stomach can distend into a 'massively distended, food-filled sac' with little ability to contract normally. Potential long-term effects include a permanently stretched stomach and impaired gastric emptying. In the short term, the massive intake of calories, sodium, and fat from dozens of hot dogs can cause gastrointestinal distress, spikes in blood pressure, and in extreme cases, choking or esophageal tears.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is facing criticism from Jewish advocacy groups after using the antisemitic term 'Shylocks' during a speech in Iowa. While discussing tax changes in his new spending bill, Trump used the slur, which originates from a villainous Jewish character in Shakespeare's 'The Merchant of Venice,' to describe moneylenders. The Anti-Defamation League called the president's language 'extremely offensive and dangerous,' underscoring how conspiracies about Jews remain entrenched. When questioned, Trump claimed he was unaware of the term's antisemitic connotations and interpreted it simply as a word for a predatory lender.</p>
