          <p>An angel investor who provided crucial early funding for the multi-billion dollar AI voice startup ElevenLabs said he committed to the investment within 30 minutes of meeting co-founder Mati Staniszewski in 2022. At the time, voice AI was an overlooked sector, and most venture capitalists were hesitant to invest. The investor, Carles Reina, was drawn to Staniszewski's deep technical knowledge and his vision for solving the problem of robotic-sounding AI voices before a product had even been built. His early bet paid off, as ElevenLabs is now valued at over $6 billion and is a leader in text-to-speech technology.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has begun a five-day tour of Asia, with scheduled stops in Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea for crucial diplomatic engagements. The trip's centerpiece is an anticipated meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea, aimed at de-escalating a contentious trade war between the two economic superpowers. While traveling, Trump also expressed openness to meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un for the first time since 2019, though US officials have stated no such meeting is currently planned. The tour includes participation in the ASEAN and APEC summits, where various regional security and trade issues will be addressed.</p>

          <h2>Dodgers' Week-Long Layoff Questioned as Potential Factor in World Series Game 1 Loss</h2>

          <p>Following the Los Angeles Dodgers' 11-4 defeat to the Toronto Blue Jays in the World Series opener, questions have arisen about whether a week-long break negatively impacted the team's performance. The Dodgers, who swept their championship series, appeared out of sync, particularly their pitching staff, which struggled with command and velocity. While manager Dave Roberts dismissed the layoff as a factor, historical precedent shows that teams with extended rests have often struggled in the World Series. The loss marks the first time the Dodgers have trailed in a postseason series this year, putting pressure on them to regain their form.</p>

          <p>A large-scale police operation is in progress to locate an Ethiopian asylum seeker who was erroneously released from HMP Chelmsford. The man, Hadush Kebatu, had been sentenced to 12 months in prison for sexually assaulting a schoolgirl and was scheduled to be transferred to an immigration detention center for deportation. Instead, he was set free and is now believed to be at large in London, prompting sharp criticism of the government from opposition leaders. The Justice Secretary expressed outrage over the "unacceptable" error, and the Prison Service has suspended an officer while an urgent investigation is conducted.</p>

          <p>Argentinian President Javier Milei is confronting significant political challenges as the country heads into parliamentary elections. His radical economic "shock therapy," while successful in curbing hyperinflation, has caused severe social side effects, including a deep recession, a 20% drop in real wages, and the closure of thousands of small businesses. This has led to plummeting approval ratings and dissent even from within his own party, with former allies accusing him of ignoring the middle class. The opposition Peronist party is gaining momentum, setting the stage for a closely contested election that will be a crucial test of Milei's austerity-focused project. (not investment advice)</p>

Teammates and his coach describe him as a "cheat code" who can create scoring opportunities from nothing. Having grown up in Lancashire before moving to Australia at 17 to pursue his career, Farnworth is now set to play a pivotal role in front of a home crowd.</p>

          <p>The complete demolition of the historic East Wing of the White House to make way for a new, privately funded $300 million ballroom has drawn widespread criticism from presidential historians and alumni. Originally built in 1902 and expanded in 1942, the East Wing served as the base for the first lady's staff and the public entrance for guests. Despite initial promises that existing structures would remain, the entire wing was torn down for the 90,000-square-foot project. Critics have condemned the move as treating a public, historic asset like private property, while the Trump administration has defended the demolition, calling the wing a "cheaply built add-on."</p>

President Vladimir Putin has long identified the issue as a national priority, but recent trends have been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, financial uncertainty, and an exodus of young people. In response, the government is promoting "traditional family values" through a series of restrictive laws, including measures that discourage abortion and ban the promotion of a "child-free ideology."

While major immediate breakthroughs are not expected, the visit itself marks a carefully calibrated move to restart dialogue and cooperation. This will be Xi's first visit since 2014, a time considered a high point in Beijing-Seoul relations that led to a free-trade agreement. The diplomatic landscape has since shifted, particularly regarding issues like the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, making this visit a crucial opportunity to gauge the future direction of the relationship.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Pew Research Center reveals that the Latino population in the United States has grown to 68 million, almost doubling since the year 2000. This demographic now constitutes one in five Americans and accounted for over half of the nation's total population growth during that period. The report highlights that U.S. births have been a primary driver of this increase and that the Latino population is the youngest among major racial and ethnic groups, with a median age of 31. California and Texas are home to the largest Latino populations, and a growing majority are proficient in English.</p>

          <p>Officers discharged their weapons at a U-Haul truck that was reversing toward a police line outside a U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda, California. The incident occurred during a day of protests against a planned immigration enforcement surge in the Bay Area, for which the base was to be a staging area. According to the Coast Guard, the driver failed to comply with commands to stop, and officers fired when the vehicle's actions posed a direct threat. The driver, who was wounded, was later taken into custody for a mental health evaluation, and the FBI is now leading the investigation.</p>

          <p>The Royal Household Bureau of Thailand has announced the death of Queen Mother Sirikit at the age of 93. The former queen, who was the wife of the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej and mother of the current King Vajiralongkorn, had been largely out of the public eye for years due to poor health. Her marriage to King Bhumibol spanned nearly seven decades, during which she became a revered public figure. Thailand's National Mother's Day is celebrated on her birthday, August 12th, honoring her role as the "Mother of the Thai Nation."</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico have asked a U.S. appeals court to block a Trump administration order that would force them to dissolve their nine-year-old joint venture. The U.S. Department of Transportation mandated the termination of the partnership, which allows the airlines to coordinate on flights between the U.S. and Mexico, citing anticompetitive effects. The airlines argue the order is "arbitrary and capricious," warning that its implementation would cause severe disruptions, lead to the cancellation of up to two dozen routes, and eliminate nearly $800 million in annual consumer benefits. They are seeking an emergency stay while the court reviews the case. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is sending the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier to the waters off South America, significantly escalating US military presence in the region. This move follows a series of recent American strikes against suspected drug-trafficking boats, which the Trump administration has linked to Venezuelan gangs and designated as a conflict against "narco-terrorists." The deployment, involving thousands of additional personnel, has fueled speculation about US intentions, including potential actions against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who has accused Washington of fabricating a pretext for war. The administration has drawn legal parallels between this crackdown and the post-9/11 war on terror.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health has confirmed the county's first death from West Nile virus in 2025. The patient, a resident of the San Fernando Valley, was hospitalized with a neurological illness caused by the mosquito-borne disease. This year, 14 infections have been recorded in the county, with half occurring in the San Fernando Valley, an area that has experienced drought conditions. Recent scientific studies suggest that droughts can increase the risk of West Nile transmission by concentrating infected birds and mosquitoes around limited water sources, potentially leading to higher infection rates among humans.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is drafting plans to auction new offshore oil and gas drilling leases in coastal areas that have been off-limits for decades, including waters off California, the Carolinas, and New England. According to internal documents, lease sales could begin as soon as 2026, reversing previous policies that protected these regions from drilling. The proposal has already drawn strong bipartisan opposition from coastal state governors and lawmakers, who cite the significant environmental and economic risks posed by offshore drilling. This move signals a major push to expand fossil fuel production.</p>
