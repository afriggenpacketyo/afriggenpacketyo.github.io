          <p>Marcel Ophuls, the German-born filmmaker renowned for his myth-shattering war documentaries, particularly "The Sorrow and the Pity," has died at the age of 97. His landmark film challenged the notion of widespread French resistance to Nazi occupation during World War II, interviewing ordinary citizens to reveal complex truths about collaboration and resistance. The film, initially banned from French television, sparked controversy and critical acclaim, paving the way for revisionist historical accounts of wartime France. Ophuls continued to direct documentaries, including the Oscar-winning "HÃ´tel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie," exploring themes of hypocrisy and collective guilt. The article reflects on Ophuls's life, his family's flight from Nazi Germany, and his complex relationship with France, where he became a naturalized citizen and made his most significant contributions to cinema.</p>

          <p>The trial of Issa Al H., a Syrian man accused of a mass stabbing in Solingen, Germany, is set to begin, focusing attention on Germany's asylum policies and security measures. Al H. faces charges of murder, attempted murder, and membership in the "Islamic State" terrorist organization after allegedly attacking revelers at a city festival. The case has ignited political debates about migration and internal security, particularly after it was revealed that Al H.'s deportation to Bulgaria had stalled due to bureaucratic issues. The new German government has since implemented stricter asylum policies, including expanded pre-deportation detention and strengthened border controls, in response to the attack.</p>

          <p>King Charles III is visiting Canada, a move seen as underscoring Canada's sovereignty amid past suggestions by U.S. President Trump about annexing the country. Prime Minister Mark Carney invited King Charles to deliver the speech from the throne, outlining the government's agenda. The visit emphasizes Canada's distinct national identity and constitutional monarchy, differentiating it from the United States. While Canadians are largely indifferent to the monarchy, Carney aims to highlight the differences between the two nations, although the new U.S. ambassador downplays the need for such messages.</p>

          <p>Southeast Asian leaders convened in Kuala Lumpur to address the impact of new U.S. tariffs on regional economies. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim expressed concern over the strain on the global trading system due to the tariffs. ASEAN leaders are seeking to negotiate collectively with Washington and have warned that unilateral tariffs pose complex challenges to the region's economic growth. The summit agenda also includes discussions on the ongoing civil war in Myanmar and East Timor's accession to ASEAN.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has revoked tenure from Harvard Business School professor Francesca Gino following allegations of research misconduct. This decision effectively ends Gino's lifetime employment protections and represents a severe disciplinary action by the university. The allegations, first raised by Data Colada, led to an investigation that concluded Gino was responsible for falsifying data. Gino maintains her innocence and has filed a lawsuit against Harvard, raising questions about the fairness of the process and the harshness of the penalties imposed on her.</p>

          <p>Four former Volkswagen executives have been convicted of fraud for their roles in the emissions-cheating scandal that rocked the auto industry a decade ago. The executives were found guilty of conspiring to conceal excess diesel emissions from regulators, leading to multiyear prison sentences for two and suspended sentences for the other two. The scandal, which discredited diesel technology, has cost Volkswagen more than $30 billion in fines and legal fees.

          <p>Human sexuality is diverse, and no one chooses their sexual orientation, which develops during puberty through an interplay of biological and psychosocial factors. Sexual orientation is not hereditary, but hormones and chemicals in the body, such as pheromones, may play a role. Our sexual preference does not change as we age, and conversion therapy has been proven unsuccessful. It is important to have an unprejudiced debate about sexual diversity, especially in societies where sexual minorities are excluded and persecuted.</p>

          <p>A Lowy Institute report indicates that developing countries are due to make record debt repayments to China in 2025, primarily on loans extended during the peak of the Belt and Road Initiative. A significant portion of these repayments is owed by the world's poorest countries, potentially jeopardizing their health and education spending. The report suggests that China will be more focused on debt collection than lending for the remainder of the decade. The shift comes as Western governments remain internally focused, with declining aid and waning multilateral support.</p>

The top 1% owns nearly one-third of America's combined wealth, and the top 0.1% owns a significant portion of that.
