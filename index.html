          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 02:33:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy showed no growth in July, following a 0.4% expansion in June, aligning with economists' expectations and adding pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves before the Autumn Budget. Production output declined by 0.9%, while services and construction saw slight increases, signaling a potential economic slowdown in the latter half of 2025. This economic deceleration poses challenges for the Finance Minister as she prepares fiscal plans for 2026, with the Bank of England balancing fiscal uncertainty and inflation. The central bank is expected to maintain steady rates after an August cut, closely monitoring the situation ahead of its November meeting which comes before the budget. The UK economy is expected to experience limited growth in the coming months, and the Autumn Budget will present an opportunity to introduce policies that support long-term growth.

          <p>Amazon's Project Kuiper is gaining traction in the satellite internet market, securing its first contract with JetBlue to provide in-flight WiFi starting in 2027, challenging SpaceX's Starlink. While Starlink currently has a significant lead with thousands of satellites in orbit, Amazon's Kuiper project is rapidly expanding its constellation. The satellite internet market is poised for growth, with projections indicating the launch of approximately 70,000 LEO satellites between 2025 and 2031, potentially benefiting billions lacking internet access. The competition between Amazon and SpaceX is expected to drive innovation and expand internet access, particularly in remote and underserved areas, with potential implications for 6G communications.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Over 300 South Korean workers detained in an immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia have returned to South Korea, sparking concerns about US investment. The workers' departure was briefly delayed due to a request from President Trump, raising questions about potential hesitancy among Korean firms to invest in the US. South Korea is actively negotiating with the US for visa options to facilitate Korean worker deployment, with the foreign ministry seeking congressional support for a new visa category. Hyundai's CEO anticipates a delay in the factory's opening due to the raid, with South Korean media expressing concerns about the potential chilling effect on business activities in the United States.</p>

Rising costs are attributed to a record number of children in care, the increasing complexity of their needs, and a profit-driven market, with private care providers making significant profits.
