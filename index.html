          <p>Israel is observing the second anniversary of the October 7th Hamas attack, which resulted in 1,200 deaths and 251 hostages, with solemn memorial events. These commemorations highlight deep national divisions over the government's handling of the subsequent war in Gaza and the ongoing hostage crisis. International pressure for a ceasefire is intensifying, with the U.S. and key Arab nations backing a new peace proposal as indirect negotiations continue in Egypt. The conflict, which has led to over 66,000 deaths in Gaza, continues to cast a heavy shadow over the nation's mourning.</p>

          <p>Tesla has released an updated version of its full self-driving supervised technology, though investor attention is focused on a potential major product reveal teased for October 7th. Speculation is rampant that the company may finally unveil its long-awaited lower-cost model or the next-generation Roadster, as it has not released a new vehicle since the Cybertruck in late 2023. The announcement comes as Tesla seeks to shift its narrative towards robotics and self-driving capabilities amid a slump in auto sales, which has been attributed to increased competition and consumer backlash against CEO Elon Musk.</p>

          <p>The Treasury Department has appointed Frank Bisignano, the current Commissioner of the Social Security Administration, to also serve as the CEO of the IRS. This unprecedented dual leadership role has sparked concern among policy experts and consumer advocates about potential conflicts and a lack of stability at a critical time for both agencies. Critics worry about the commingling of sensitive data and whether one leader can effectively manage two massive organizations, potentially harming services for millions of Americans who rely on them. The appointment comes as the IRS grapples with major tax law changes and staffing shortages. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of minerals explorer Trilogy Metals skyrocketed over 225% after the White House announced it was taking a 10% stake in the company through a $35.6 million investment. The move is part of a federal initiative to develop domestic sources of critical minerals, such as copper and cobalt, located in Alaska's Ambler mining district. This partnership reverses a Biden-era decision that had blocked the Ambler Road project, signaling a renewed federal commitment to resource development in the state. The project aims to secure domestic supply chains and reduce reliance on China for essential minerals used in defense and energy infrastructure.</p>

          <p>With the official jobs report delayed by the government shutdown, investment firm Carlyle has released its own analysis indicating that U.S. employment growth was nearly flat in September. The firm's proprietary data suggests a gain of only 17,000 jobs, a figure that aligns with other private-sector reports pointing to a significant hiring slowdown. Despite the anemic payroll numbers, Carlyle's data also revealed some positive economic indicators, including a 2.7% annualized GDP growth rate and a notable acceleration in business investment.

          <p>Real Madrid forward Vinicius Junior is currently in exceptional form, but his future with the club is increasingly uncertain as contract extension talks beyond 2027 have stalled. This hesitation is reportedly linked to understanding his role alongside star Kylian Mbappe and under new coach Xabi Alonso. The article highlights the immense pressure Vinicius faces in Spain, where his on-field expressions of joy and frustration are often policed and met with racist abuse from spectators. Despite his success, he continues to navigate a hostile environment, symbolizing a new generation of athletes who refuse to remain silent against discrimination.</p>

          <p>Startups are remaining private for significantly longer periods, with the median age for a company going public now at 13 years, up from 10 years in 2018. This trend is largely attributed to the massive influx of alternative capital from sources like private equity, venture capital, and sovereign wealth funds, which now exceed $12 trillion globally. This abundance of private funding provides startups with sufficient capital for growth without the regulatory burdens and short-term pressures of the public market. Consequently, companies are more mature and have substantially larger revenues by the time they eventually pursue an IPO. (not investment advice)</p>

The hearing also focused on the administration's handling of files related to deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, with Democrats accusing the DOJ of a cover-up.

The author reflects on the physical and spiritual decay observed, questioning if divine power can exist amid such profound human suffering and addiction. Drawing parallels to Jesus's work with the sick and outcast, the piece argues that the solution to such crises is fundamentally spiritual, requiring mercy and outreach rather than just policy changes.

This article explores the contentious theory that fears over increasing racism are a key factor, as Black individuals may be consciously or unconsciously choosing not to have children in a hostile environment. The author notes that Black fertility rates decelerated more sharply during the Trump administration and that political rhetoric and policies targeting diversity initiatives exacerbate these concerns. This trend has profound social and political implications for the Black community and the nation's future.</p>

          <p>Following Congress's failure to pass a funding deal, a government shutdown is forcing active-duty U.S. service members to continue their duties without receiving their paychecks. While civilian defense employees deemed essential will also work, others will be furloughed, with all pay delayed until the shutdown ends. Legislation that would have ensured military pay during a shutdown, the "Pay Our Troops Act," did not pass in time.

          <p>As a government shutdown begins, hundreds of thousands of federal employees face furloughs or are required to work without immediate pay. However, members of Congress and the President will continue to receive their salaries due to constitutional provisions and permanent appropriations that separate their compensation from the annual funding battles. While essential federal workers will eventually receive back pay once funding is restored, congressional staffers' pay is also delayed.

          <p>Dell Technologies saw its stock climb 5% after the company raised its long-term revenue and profit growth expectations during an analyst meeting. The computer maker now projects annual revenue growth between 7% and 9%, a significant increase from its previous 3% to 4% forecast, and expects earnings per share to grow by at least 15%. Dell attributed the optimistic outlook to the unprecedented pace of technological change, particularly the surging customer demand for AI infrastructure, including servers, storage, and networking solutions. The company is a key partner for Nvidia, building and selling computer systems that utilize its advanced AI chips. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tomaino Hermine Patricia Ndam Njoya, the mayor of Foumban, has been announced as one of 12 candidates running for president in Cameroon, challenging the four-decade rule of incumbent Paul Biya. As only the third woman to run for the presidency in the country's history, her candidacy is seen as a significant development, supported by a growing number of women's organizations. Ndam Njoya, who took over the leadership of the UDC party from her late husband, is campaigning on a platform of "Freedom. Justice.

          <p>A medical helicopter crashed on Highway 50 in Sacramento, leaving its three crew members—a pilot, a nurse, and a paramedic—with critical injuries. The REACH helicopter was returning from a hospital drop-off when it experienced an in-air emergency, ultimately crashing in the middle of the freeway. Remarkably, no vehicles on the busy highway were involved in the incident, a fact officials described as "mind blowing." Bystanders and first responders worked together to free one crew member who was trapped under the wreckage before all three were transported to local hospitals for treatment.</p>

          <p>As the government shutdown continues with no resolution in sight, analysts suggest that the upcoming October 15th military pay date could be a critical event forcing a compromise between the White House and Congress. The political cost of failing to pay the 1.3 million active-duty service members may be too high for either party to bear, potentially leading to a temporary funding bill. While prediction markets indicate a high probability that the shutdown will last beyond this date, pressure is expected to mount significantly. If this deadline passes without action, it could signal an even more prolonged and intractable stalemate. (not investment advice)</p>

CEO Michael Arougheti highlighted that this "retail revolution" is a response to investors seeking diversification away from increasingly concentrated public markets. Ares, which already manages over $50 billion in retail-targeted vehicles, refutes the narrative that weaker deals are funneled to individual investors, arguing that both retail and institutional clients often receive allocations in the same high-quality investments. The firm is capitalizing on this trend by expanding its product development and client education efforts globally. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the outlook for 2026 has been drastically cut to just 0.5% growth, as the WTO anticipates a cooling global economy and the full impact of widespread trade tariffs being felt.
