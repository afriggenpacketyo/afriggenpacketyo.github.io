The company cited growing macroeconomic and policy uncertainties, which are particularly impacting its business in China. Despite beating third-quarter estimates for earnings and revenue, the guidance for the next quarter fell short of analyst expectations. The company noted a large backlog of pending export license applications with the U.S. government, assuming none will be issued in the near term, contributing to the cautious outlook.

On the "New Heights" podcast, she explained that Reid, who has a long-standing friendship with her father, vouched for Kelce after he publicly expressed interest in her. Swift noted that many people close to Kelce reached out to her contacts, speaking highly of him, which she found unusual and touching. This network of support, rooted in Reid's connection with her family, helped lay the groundwork for their romance.</p>

          <p>The District of Columbia has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration and Attorney General Pam Bondi, challenging the federal government's move to take control of the city's police force. The suit argues that the administration's order to end local policies limiting cooperation with federal immigration authorities is an unlawful attempt to divest the city of control over its own law enforcement. D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb is seeking a court order to vacate the directive, warning it could create operational chaos and endanger public safety by upending the police department's command structure.</p>

The international community is closely watching the talks, which could influence the trajectory of the conflict, European security, and global alliances. While the White House stated a desire to explore all options for a peaceful resolution, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European allies express concern over potential concessions to Russia.

          <p>A recent Zillow analysis reveals that while the median price for a mansion in the U.S. has risen to $1.4 million, there are still a few metropolitan areas where homes over 5,000 square feet can be bought for under $1 million. Cities such as Buffalo, New York; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Cleveland, Ohio, offer these large properties at more affordable prices compared to coastal markets where mansion values can exceed $4.5 million. This trend reflects broader real estate affordability, with less expensive markets in the Midwest and South providing more space for the money.</p>

The issue escalated after protests, some involving violence, occurred following the arrest of a resident on charges of sexual assault. The judge's order will remain in place until a final ruling is made on the council's application next week.</p>

          <p>A jury has found Labour councillor Ricky Jones not guilty of encouraging violent disorder after he was filmed calling for far-right activists' throats to be cut during an anti-racism rally. Jones argued his remarks were not meant to be taken literally and were directed at activists who had allegedly hidden razor blades behind stickers on a train. The verdict, reached after brief deliberations, has drawn criticism from some political figures who contrasted it with other cases involving inflammatory online posts, raising questions about consistency in the justice system.</p>

          <p>At 21 years old, Jacob Bethell is set to become the youngest man to ever captain an England international cricket team. He will lead an understrength Twenty20 squad for a tour of Ireland in September, as many of the team's regular all-format players are being rested. The decision is seen as a significant show of faith in the young all-rounder's leadership potential, despite his limited playing time this summer and lack of senior-level captaincy experience. His appointment breaks a record held since 1889 by Monty Bowden.</p>

          <p>Vivergo Fuels, the largest bioethanol plant in the UK, will start closing its operations after the government declined to provide a rescue package for the sector. The company, along with the UK's other major bioethanol producer, Ensus, had warned that their businesses were no longer viable following a US-UK trade deal that removed tariffs on imported ethanol. The government stated that providing taxpayer funds was not in the national interest and would not solve the industry's long-term issues. The closure will result in redundancies and could affect thousands of jobs in the supply chain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the European Union and China mark 50 years of diplomatic relations, Beijing is expressing growing concern over the EU's shifting position on Taiwan. While all EU member states officially adhere to the "one-China" policy, several have recently expanded ties with Taipei. European nations are increasingly reinterpreting this policy to distinguish it from Beijing's "one-China principle," which asserts sovereignty over the island. This trend, coupled with the EU's broader "de-risking" strategy towards mainland China, is seen by Beijing as a challenge to a key diplomatic red line.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of the potential candidates President Donald Trump is considering to replace Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chair. The list includes nearly a dozen individuals, from former Fed officials and economists to market strategists. While their views vary, a common theme among many is the need to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rate. Some candidates, like former Governor Kevin Warsh, have called for significant "regime change" at the central bank, while others have criticized a lack of transparency or intellectual diversity in its decision-making processes.

          <p>U.S. shoppers are continuing to purchase jewelry at a strong pace, providing a bright spot for brands like Pandora amid weaker sales in Europe and China. Pandora reported an 8% rise in U.S. sales for the second quarter, highlighting the American market as an outlier in global consumer trends. This strength is also seen in the luxury sector, with Cartier-owner Richemont posting similar gains. However, jewelry brands face challenges from potential tariffs, a weakening dollar, and rising prices for precious metals like silver and gold, which could impact future consumer demand.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve widely expected to cut interest rates in September, savers with maturing certificates of deposit (CDs) should act proactively to secure favorable returns. This article advises savers to shop around for the best available rates at different banks, as some may still be offering competitive yields. It also suggests re-evaluating one's budget to potentially lock in a larger sum for a longer term before rates fall further. Communicating plans with the current bank is crucial to avoid having funds automatically roll over into a new, lower-rate CD.</p>

          <p>On his "EntreLeadership" podcast, financial personality Dave Ramsey addressed a caller earning up to $200,000 a year from a home-based online business whose wife wants him to get a "real job." The caller explained that his wife, a teacher, feels overwhelmed by their combined responsibilities, which also include a retail store. Ramsey called her suggestion "ridiculous and insulting," affirming that self-employment is a real job. He then advised the couple to decide whether to sell the retail store or have the wife quit teaching to focus on growing the store's modest profits.</p>

          <p>The relationship between President Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, once characterized by Trump's praise for the Russian leader, has grown more complex and tense ahead of their Alaska summit. During his first term, Trump often expressed admiration for Putin, but Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine has led to a noticeable shift in his tone. Recently, Trump has expressed frustration and disappointment, calling Putin's actions "crazy" even while maintaining some U.S. support for Ukraine. This evolution from perceived rapport to public criticism forms a critical backdrop for their high-stakes meeting to discuss the war.</p>

          <p>The federal building at 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan, which houses offices for the Department of Homeland Security and ICE, was evacuated after an unknown white powder was discovered. The FDNY and hazmat units responded to a report of the substance found in five letters within the building's mailroom. At least two people were exposed, but authorities stated there was no remaining threat to employees or the public. Preliminary testing found no dangerous substances, and the letters are being sent to the FBI for further analysis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that when liberal politicians and journalists downplay the severity of crime in Washington, D.C., they create a political opening for Donald Trump. The author contends that while city-wide crime statistics may show improvement, violent crime remains a grim reality in the city's poorer, majority-Black neighborhoods. By dismissing legitimate fears as Republican talking points, progressives risk alienating residents who experience this violence firsthand. The author suggests that Trump's federal takeover of D.C. police, while cynical, resonates with voters who feel their safety concerns are being ignored by local leaders.</p>

          <p>This analysis posits that President Trump's federal takeover of law enforcement in Washington, D.C., is simultaneously a farcical display of power and a dangerous authoritarian precedent. On one hand, the deployment has appeared aimless and ineffective, failing to create a tool of meaningful political repression. On the other hand, it normalizes the abuse of emergency powers and could be a trial run for similar actions in other cities, particularly in response to future protests. The article suggests that while the current execution is incompetent, the key question is whether the administration could become more effective at wielding such power with practice.</p>

The mother, Sarah Shaw, was detained by Customs and Border Protection when re-entering the U.S. from a brief trip to Canada after it was discovered her travel permit had expired, though her work permit was valid. Her attorney argues that border officials had the discretion to grant her humanitarian parole but instead chose to detain both her and her son, who had valid documents, highlighting the administration's stringent immigration enforcement.</p>
