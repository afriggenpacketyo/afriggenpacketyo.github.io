          <p>A year after being violently attacked at a concert in Düsseldorf, Deutsche Welle reporter Adonis Alkhaled is still awaiting resolution from the police investigation. The assault, allegedly carried out by men appearing to be bodyguards for Syrian singer Al Shami, drew widespread condemnation but has seen slow progress. Despite Alkhaled providing evidence, including the potential identity of an attacker, the investigation into unknown suspects for malicious injury and defamation remains ongoing, prompting criticism from his lawyer about the lack of concrete results.</p>

          <p>An agreement in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein to formalize unpaid leave for Muslim employees and students on two major Islamic holidays has triggered a public debate fueled by misleading media headlines. The regulation does not grant "extra holidays" but extends a long-standing practice of religious accommodation, similar to provisions for Christian and Jewish holidays in other states. Legal experts clarify that this move simply affirms existing rights under Germany's constitutional protection of religious freedom, aiming for equality and integration.</p>

          <p>An anarchist group's online call for a "laser party" to disrupt federal helicopters over a Portland ICE facility has created a serious public safety issue, forcing a major hospital to reroute air ambulances. Oregon Health & Science University confirmed that helicopter providers declined to land on its rooftop helipad due to the danger posed by lasers, potentially delaying critical care for patients. The Department of Homeland Security condemned the act, emphasizing that aiming a laser at an aircraft is a dangerous federal crime and vowing to prosecute those involved.</p>

          <h2>Chinese-Dutch Team Discovers How Single Cell Can Regenerate Into Brand New Plant: Study</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists in China and the Netherlands say they have discovered how a single plant cell can regenerate into an entirely new plant by flipping two genetic switches. Researchers at Shandong Agricultural University and BGI-Research in China collaborated with peers at Radboud University in the Netherlands and published their findings in the peer-reviewed journal Cell last month. The formation of an embryo from a single cell is one of the most profound processes in biology, they wrote. This ability was thought to belong only to fertilised eggs. But in plants, differentiated somatic cells – referring to all the cells other than sperm and egg cells – can regain this ability and initiate embryogenesis under appropriate conditions. This phenomenon is known as somatic or non-reproductive embryogenesis.</p>

          <p>A collaborative team of scientists from China and the Netherlands has made a significant breakthrough in plant biology, identifying the mechanism that allows a single plant cell to regenerate into a new plant. Their research, published in the journal *Cell*, reveals that flipping two specific genetic switches can induce this process, known as somatic embryogenesis. This discovery demystifies a profound biological phenomenon previously thought to be exclusive to fertilized eggs, opening new possibilities for plant cultivation and genetic research.</p>

          <p>A new television series from Chinese state broadcaster CCTV, titled "Silent Honour," is breaking new ground by dramatizing the history of Communist Party espionage activities in Taiwan. Historically, the party has been quiet about these covert operations, as many of them ended in failure with agents being captured and executed by the Kuomintang after 1949. The 39-episode drama, which premiered on China's Martyrs' Day, signals a shift in Beijing's willingness to publicly commemorate these spies and their ill-fated missions on the island.</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Argues Democracies Must Insulate Climate Policy from Political Cycles</h2>

          <p>This opinion article argues that while global investment in clean energy is growing, the progress is threatened by a crisis of political will in democratic nations. It points to the cancellation of major clean energy projects in the U.S. and the retreat of investors as evidence that populist pressures are eroding long-term climate policy. The author contends that politicians are increasingly framing climate action as incompatible with affordability, systematically dismantling the very frameworks needed for a successful transition and calling for stronger mechanisms to protect climate goals from political erosion.
