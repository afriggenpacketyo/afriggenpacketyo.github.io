          <p>Elon Musk has strongly criticized President Trump's major tax-and-spending legislation, labeling it a "DEBT SLAVERY bill" for its record five-trillion-dollar increase to the debt ceiling. He vowed to use his resources to fund primary challengers against any fiscal conservatives who vote in favor of the measure. Musk's opposition also stems from provisions that roll back clean energy credits, which directly impacts his company, Tesla. He also called for the formation of a new political party focused on the American people.</p>

          <p>The Republican spending bill advancing through Congress poses a significant threat to reproductive rights, going beyond defunding Planned Parenthood. The legislation would also incentivize ACA insurance providers to drop abortion coverage and make deep cuts to Medicaid, affecting broader healthcare access. These measures come three years after the overturning of Roe v. Wade, at a time when abortion numbers are actually increasing due to the prevalence of medication abortion. Critics argue the bill's goal is to make abortion inaccessible nationwide, even in states with legal protections.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is proceeding with votes on President Trump's extensive spending and tax-cut bill, aiming to pass it before the July 4th holiday. The legislation, which extends Trump-era tax breaks and authorizes $5 trillion in new borrowing, faces unified opposition from Democrats who criticize its cuts to healthcare coverage for millions of Americans. It has also created fractures within the Republican party, with some conservatives objecting to the massive increase in national debt and its impact on programs like Medicaid.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis from the Yale Budget Lab indicates the Republican "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" would disproportionately benefit wealthier Americans while financially harming the lowest earners. The report finds that proposed cuts to social programs like Medicaid and SNAP would cause the bottom 20% of households to lose an average of $700 annually. Conversely, the top 20% would see their income increase by an average of $5,700 per year, primarily due to the bill's tax cut extensions. These findings align with other non-partisan analyses of the legislation. (not investment advice)</p>

This article compares the interest earnings between short-term Certificates of Deposit (CDs) and money market accounts. Calculations show that for 3-month and 6-month terms, a CD currently offers a slightly higher return. However, for a 9-month term, a money market account could yield more, assuming its variable rate remains stable. Savers must consider the guaranteed fixed rate of a CD against the flexible but variable rate of a money market account, especially with potential Fed rate cuts looming. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's High Court has dismissed a legal challenge from human rights campaigners aimed at halting the export of British-made components for F-35 fighter jets used by Israel. The court ruled that it lacked the constitutional authority to intervene in what it deemed a sensitive political and executive matter. While the UK government has suspended some direct arms licenses to Israel, it argued that withdrawing from the multilateral F-35 program would endanger international peace and security. Campaign groups like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch condemned the ruling.</p>

          <p>On a recent podcast episode, Joe Rogan expressed deep concern about what he describes as a dangerous trend of government-influenced censorship on social media. Citing information from Elon Musk about behind-the-scenes activities at Twitter, Rogan argued that the government was actively silencing posts, which he views as a threat to free expression. He fears that if this control tightens, it could stifle public protest and lead the country toward a form of dictatorship. Rogan emphasized his passion for this issue, positioning it beyond partisan politics.</p>

          <p>Financial advisor Dave Ramsey has offered unconventional advice for aspiring homeowners struggling to save for a down payment. He suggests that temporarily pausing contributions to retirement accounts like a 401(k) or IRA is an acceptable short-term strategy to accumulate funds for a home more quickly. However, Ramsey strongly warns against borrowing from or cashing out existing retirement funds, as this can trigger taxes and penalties while damaging long-term growth. This advice is aimed at those finding it difficult to balance saving for both retirement and homeownership simultaneously. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill" contains provisions that could severely curtail the growth of renewable energy in the United States. The legislation aims to phase out subsidies for wind and solar while imposing new taxes on projects using Chinese components, which dominate the supply chain. According to an analysis by the Rhodium Group, these measures could slash new clean energy capacity by over 72%, leading to higher electricity costs for consumers. This could also inadvertently harm the U.S. artificial intelligence industry, which requires vast amounts of new, quickly deployable energy that renewables provide.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines several timely reasons why opening a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) could be a smart financial move for homeowners in July. With average home equity at a record high, HELOCs offer an accessible way to borrow large sums, and interest rates have fallen significantly since last year. The approval process can be quicker than for unsecured loans, and the variable rates are advantageous as the Federal Reserve is expected to issue further rate cuts. Additionally, a HELOC's flexibility allows borrowers to pay interest only on the funds they use. (not investment advice)</p>
