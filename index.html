          <p>A federal judge in Boston has issued a preliminary injunction, preventing the Trump administration from firing half of the Department of Education's workforce and transferring federal student loan management to the Small Business Administration. Judge Myong Joun, a Biden appointee, criticized the administration's claim that the changes aimed to improve efficiency, stating they would make it impossible for the department to fulfill its mandated functions. The ruling marks the first time a federal judge has deemed the administration's changes to the Department of Education unlawful, effectively stopping the effort to fire over 2,000 employees and implement President Trump's executive order to close the department. The judge emphasized that while Trump can remove executive officers, he cannot dismantle entire federal departments created by Congress.</p>

          <p>According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), net migration to the UK nearly halved in 2024, dropping to 431,000 from 860,000 the previous year, marking the largest numerical drop on record. This decrease is attributed to a decline in individuals arriving for work and study, influenced by policy changes enacted by the previous Conservative government. There was also a significant reduction in dependents accompanying those entering the UK on work and study visas, which was a key objective of the last Tory home secretary. The Home Office has also sped up processing asylum claims, leading to more individuals either being granted refugee status and entering the workforce or being slated for removal, while several senior Conservative figures sought to take credit for the drop in net migration.</p>

          <p>A homeowner in Norway woke up to find a 443-foot container ship, the NCL Salten, had run aground just meters from his house. The ship had sailed onto the shore near Trondheim for reasons yet unknown, causing damage to a heating pipe in the homeowner's cabin. The homeowner, Johan Helberg, was alerted by a neighbor who had been ringing his doorbell and called him when he did not answer. None of the 16 crew members were injured, and Norwegian police are investigating the incident. The CEO of the shipping company noted that the same ship had run aground twice before in previous years.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a new missile defense project called the "Golden Dome for America," aimed at protecting the U.S. from foreign missile threats. The multilayered system would deploy next-generation technologies across land, sea, and space, including space-based sensors and interceptors. It aims to detect and destroy missiles ahead of launch, intercept them early in flight, halt them midcourse, and stop them in the final moments of approach. China has criticized the plan as increasing the risk of militarizing space and fueling an arms race. While the initiative is still in the conceptual stage, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated the space-based components alone could cost $542 billion.</p>

          <p>North Korea's attempt to launch its second navy destroyer in a month failed, resulting in significant embarrassment for leader Kim Jong-un, who deemed it a criminal act and threatened punishment for those responsible, according to a New York Times article. The incident involved a "serious accident" during the launch of a new 5,000-ton destroyer in Chongjin, where the ship lost balance, tearing holes in its hull and ending up on its side in the water. Kim Jong-un criticized officials for carelessness and irresponsibility, ordering the destroyer's restoration by the next Workers’ Party meeting in June, viewing the matter as a political issue tied to the state's prestige. Despite traditionally concealing such failures, North Korea has occasionally publicized mishaps under Kim's leadership to tighten his control.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is significantly reducing funding for STEM education research at the National Science Foundation (NSF), with over half of the terminated grants since April supporting programs that train students in science, engineering, and math, as reported in a New York Times article. These cuts, totaling $773 million, are viewed by experts as part of a broader attack on education and diversity, equity, and inclusion (D.E.I.) initiatives. Projects aimed at engaging students with autism in engineering and creating hands-on programs for Indigenous youth have been canceled. Critics argue that de-prioritizing STEM education will harm the quality of training for future scientists and concentrate research at larger universities with alternative funding sources.</p>

Republicans argued that California's requirements threatened the auto industry, while Democrats warned of serious health effects. The vote, taken despite warnings from the Government Accountability Office and the Senate Parliamentarian, has been criticized as an abuse of the Congressional Review Act and a challenge to California's regulatory power.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives has passed a bill that includes stricter Medicaid work requirements, which could cause millions of Americans to lose health coverage, according to a New York Times article. The legislation mandates that childless adults without disabilities prove they worked, volunteered, or attended school for 80 hours in the month before enrollment. Experts estimate this change, along with other Medicaid cuts, could leave 7.6 million people uninsured, as many eligible individuals may struggle to meet the strict paperwork standards. While supporters argue the requirement encourages contribution to society, opponents contend it primarily serves to cut costs by removing eligible individuals from the program.</p>

          <p>The suspect in the fatal shooting of two Israeli Embassy employees outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., has been identified as 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez of Chicago, according to a CBS News article. Rodriguez allegedly shot and killed the victims as they were leaving the museum and chanted "free, free Palestine" during his arrest. The suspect had been seen pacing outside the museum before the shooting and was apprehended by museum security. An X account believed to belong to the suspect showed a history of pro-Palestine activism and inflammatory posts about Israel. The shooting is being investigated as a hate crime.</p>
