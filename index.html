          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal was downgraded to a depression after making landfall in South Carolina, but it brought significant rainfall and flooding to the Carolinas. Flood watches were issued for parts of North Carolina and Virginia, with the Haw River in Chatham County surging to near-record levels. The storm caused road collapses and stranded motorists, though no immediate injuries were reported by officials. The event occurs during what NOAA predicts will be an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season, with dangerous surf conditions expected to persist along the coast for several days.</p>

          <p>President Trump has dismissed Elon Musk's plan to launch a new political party as a "ridiculous" idea that would only add to political confusion. Musk announced the formation of the "America Party" on social media, aiming to challenge what he calls the Republican and Democratic "Uniparty." This public feud marks a significant break between the former allies, reportedly stemming from Musk's strong opposition to Trump's recent tax and spending bill, which ended tax breaks for electric vehicles. Trump also used his own social media platform to call Musk's recent behavior a "train wreck."</p>

          <p>During a summit in Rio de Janeiro, leaders from the expanding BRICS group of developing nations condemned President Trump’s unilateral tariff policies, voicing concerns over their impact on the global economy. In a direct response, Trump threatened to impose an additional 10% tariff on any country that aligns with what he termed the bloc's "Anti-American policies." The summit was also notable for the physical absence of China's President Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin, who is wanted for arrest by the International Criminal Court.</p>

          <p>A new clinical trial has demonstrated that a single gene therapy injection can significantly reverse a form of genetic hearing loss caused by a faulty OTOF gene. The treatment, which delivers a healthy copy of the gene directly to the inner ear, improved hearing in all 10 participants, with children showing the most dramatic results. Researchers from Sweden’s Karolinska Institutet reported that the therapy was safe and well-tolerated. This success offers hope for developing similar treatments for other common genetic causes of deafness.</p>

          <p>The ongoing threat of US tariffs is forcing companies to fundamentally reorganize their global supply chains, moving production out of China to countries like Vietnam and India. The article profiles an American toymaker whose import taxes surged under the new duties, prompting a costly and complex shift in manufacturing to remain viable. Similarly, Canadian businesses face a double impact from US tariffs and their own country's retaliatory measures, disrupting operations and forcing strategic changes to sourcing and product offerings.

          <p>As the first part of a final report on the Post Office Horizon IT scandal is set to be released, victims are expressing their need for accountability and justice. The report will focus on the human impact and the status of compensation for the thousands of sub-postmasters who were wrongly prosecuted due to faulty software. One victim, who was wrongly imprisoned for 18 months, stated he needs to see "someone to be punished" for the devastating loss of his business, home, and reputation in what is considered a major miscarriage of justice.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the two decades since the 7/7 London bombings reveals a significant evolution in the UK's counter-terrorism capabilities, but also a far more complex threat landscape. The 2005 attacks exposed intelligence failures and prompted MI5 and police to develop a more integrated, national system for identifying and disrupting plots. However, the rise of "do-it-yourself" attacks inspired by groups like ISIS and the far-right, fueled by online radicalization, presents new challenges that constantly test the state's sophisticated security apparatus.</p>

          <p>A police superintendent, who was a 23-year-old constable in 2005, has recounted her experience as a first responder during the 7/7 London terrorist attacks. Initially dispatched for a suspected fire, she describes the "pinch-in-the-stomach moment" she understood the situation was a major attack as injured people fled the Tube stations. Her account details the harrowing experience of entering the tunnels to rescue victims, carrying the severely injured on makeshift stretchers, and the shock that set in after seeing her own uniform stained with blood.</p>

          <p>The devastating flood at Camp Mystic has sent shockwaves through generations of Texas's elite, for whom the camp was a cherished institution. For nearly a century, the Christian girls' camp on the Guadalupe River hosted the daughters of presidents, senators, and oil barons, including the family of President Lyndon B. Johnson. The camp's current director, a member of the family that has run it for generations, was among those who died in the deluge, reportedly while trying to save the young campers in his care.</p>

          <h2>Texas Officials and National Weather Service at Odds Over Flood Forecast Adequacy</h2>

          <p>In the wake of the deadly Texas floods, a dispute has emerged between some state officials and the National Weather Service over the clarity and accuracy of the storm forecasts. While the NWS asserts it issued timely flood watches and warnings, some local officials, including the Kerr County Judge, claim no one anticipated a "water wall of almost thirty feet high." Meteorologists note the difficulty of predicting such rare and complex weather events with precise location and intensity, highlighting a tragic gap between a technical forecast and public comprehension of the potential devastation.</p>
