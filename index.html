          <p>In a surprise result, Labour's Davy Russell won the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse by-election, defeating the SNP candidate. The SNP acknowledged the need to analyze the defeat and adjust their strategy for future elections. Reform UK finished third, pushing the Conservatives into fourth place, while Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar hailed the victory as proof that pollsters were wrong. Russell pledged to amplify the voices of the people at Holyrood, criticizing the SNP for failing to deliver for constituents, and the SNP's loss came after the first minister said the by-election was a ‚Äútwo-horse race‚Äù between his party and Reform.</p>

          <p>Dr. Najmussama Shefajo, a prominent OB-GYN in Afghanistan, warns of a looming maternal health crisis due to the Taliban's ban on women attending nursing and midwife training courses. Her clinic is overwhelmed with patients after the ban, and she suffers from migraines due to the increased pressure and the inability of poor patients to pay. Shefajo continues to train student nurses by employing them at her clinic, circumventing the ban. She believes that if current policies remain in place, the number of deaths will increase, potentially leading to a future where there are no female healthcare providers in Afghanistan.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is experiencing significant staffing shortages, with nearly 20% of human food inspection positions vacant. This decline is attributed to departures encouraged by cost-cutting efforts and a government-wide hiring freeze. While the FDA claims to be meeting its inspection obligations, officials express concern about worsening attrition, especially in critical areas like infant formula plants. The job of an FDA investigator has become more challenging due to additional hurdles in budget approval processes, leading to delays and increased administrative tasks.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order aimed at reducing national security and public safety threats posed by drones in the United States. The order establishes a task force to detect and identify drones and crack down on unlawful uses like spying and drug smuggling.
