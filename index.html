          <p>A Russian street fighting organization, Streets Fight Club (SFC), has expanded into the U.S. with assistance from American white supremacists and neo-Nazis, while also raising funds for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The group promotes violent bareknuckle events, often featuring fighters displaying extremist symbols, on social media platforms like Instagram and YouTube. This article reveals that SFC's US offshoot involved prominent figures from the 'active club' movement and Patriot Front, raising concerns about the recruitment and training of violent far-right extremists.

          <p>ASUS's new ROG Xbox Ally X handheld gaming PC is selling out rapidly, even as Microsoft's broader Xbox gaming strategy faces criticism and price hikes for its Game Pass service.

However, it notes limitations, such as streaming Xbox library games over Wi-Fi rather than running them natively, and its less ergonomic design.

          <p>Experts are questioning the traditional '1% rule' for mortgage refinancing, which suggests waiting for at least a one percentage point rate reduction to offset closing costs. With mortgage rates dropping and further cuts anticipated, this article indicates that smaller rate reductions can now be beneficial, especially for those with high loan balances or recent mortgages. The decision to refinance depends on individual finances, current loan terms, and the potential to remove mortgage insurance.

Unlike larger corporations, smaller companies have fewer resources to absorb increased costs, leading to significant financial strain and stifled innovation. This article highlights how these struggles, detailed through several business owner accounts, could be an early warning sign for the wider economy in 2026.

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration from firing federal workers during the ongoing government shutdown. The judge criticized the administration's approach as 'ready, fire, aim' and suggested the cuts appeared politically motivated and without sufficient consideration for human cost. This article highlights that the ruling comes amidst union lawsuits arguing the firings are an abuse of power. The decision aims to prevent further job cuts until a hearing on a permanent injunction is held later this month.</p>

          <p>US airports, including Denver, Newark, and Burbank, experienced significant flight delays due to a shortage of air traffic controllers, exacerbated by the ongoing government shutdown. Federal officials have noted an increase in facilities with low staffing levels, leading to reduced takeoffs and landings to maintain safety. This article highlights the National Air Traffic Controllers Association's warning about the aviation system's fragility and the urgent need for accelerated training and hiring. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy confirmed a 'slight tick up' in sick calls among controllers, contributing to the travel disruptions.</p>

          <p>While hundreds of thousands of federal employees face delayed pay or potential layoffs during the government shutdown, members of Congress continue to receive their salaries. This article explains that lawmakers' pay is funded by a permanent appropriation and protected by the Constitution, meaning it is not subject to annual funding renewals. Most members earn $174,000 annually, a rate unchanged since 2009. The president also continues to be paid, but their aides and staffers are subject to furloughs, underscoring a stark difference in financial security during a funding lapse.</p>

          <p>A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass annual appropriations bills, forcing federal agencies to cease non-essential functions. This article explains that the Antideficiency Act mandates this halt, with exceptions for operations protecting life and property, and constitutional responsibilities. Unlike previous shutdowns, the current administration has directed agencies to consider permanent mass layoffs, in addition to furloughs, for programs lacking alternative funding. While essential employees work without pay until funding is restored, the shutdown can disrupt various services, from national parks to immigration hearings, with potential long-term economic costs.</p>
