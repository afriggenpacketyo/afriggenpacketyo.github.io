          <p>David Richardson, the acting director of FEMA, reportedly made a remark during a staff meeting indicating he was unaware hurricane season had begun, leading to internal confusion. A DHS spokesperson stated it was a joke and that FEMA is prepared for the season, despite concerns about staff cuts and reduced preparations. Richardson stated there would be no changes to the agency's disaster response plans, sticking with the old plan, and he does not want to interfere with the FEMA advisory council established by President Trump and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem. The incident has raised concerns about the agency's readiness for what is expected to be an above-normal hurricane season. The director's comment has caused confusion and reignited concern about his familiarity with FEMA's operations.</p>

The attack in Colorado has contributed to a sense that simply existing in public as a Jewish person is increasingly dangerous.</p>

          <p>Shigeo Nagashima, a celebrated figure in Japanese baseball and recipient of the People's Honor Award, has died at the age of 89 due to pneumonia. Nagashima, known as "Mr. Giants," was a key player and later manager for the Yomiuri Giants, contributing to their dominance in Japanese baseball during the 1960s and 1970s. His retirement in 1974 was a major national event, and his famous speech at the ceremony became part of Japanese popular culture. Nagashima's legacy extends beyond sports, as he is fondly remembered as a symbol of Japan's rapid economic growth era.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is temporarily halting its plan to garnish Social Security benefits for individuals who have defaulted on their student loans. This decision provides older student borrowers with additional time to become current on their debt and avoid reduced benefit checks. The administration cited its commitment to protecting Social Security recipients who often rely on fixed incomes. The pause is a reversal of the administration's earlier announcement to resume collection activity on student loans.</p>
