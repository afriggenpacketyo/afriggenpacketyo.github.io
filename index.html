          <p>Sectarian violence between Druze and Bedouin groups has persisted in southern Syria's Suweida province, despite a ceasefire announcement from the interim president. Over 900 people have been reported killed, with atrocities attributed to all sides and government forces accused of participating in attacks on the Druze. The United States has demanded an end to the "sexual assault and slaughter," while Israel has intervened militarily to protect the Druze community, complicating regional dynamics and peace efforts.</p>

          <p>Following devastating floods in Texas, officials in Kerr County have significantly revised the number of missing persons from nearly 100 down to just three. This reduction is attributed to extensive follow-up work by local, state, and federal agencies who verified that many individuals initially reported missing were safe. Despite this positive development, the overall death toll from the statewide flooding remains high at 134, with 107 of those fatalities occurring in Kerr County.</p>

          <p>Recent congressional clawbacks of $1.1 billion in federal funding for public media are posing an existential threat to small, rural radio stations. Operations like Allegheny Mountain Radio, which serves remote communities in West Virginia and Virginia, rely on Corporation for Public Broadcasting funds for over half their budget. These stations provide essential local news, emergency information, and community connection in areas with limited internet and cell service, but now face potential staff cuts or shutdowns.

          <p>This opinion article argues that the persistent failure to achieve peace in conflicts like those in Gaza, Ukraine, and Syria stems from a deeper crisis of a fractured "permanent moral order." The author, Simon Tisdall, suggests that a collapse in universally accepted ethical standards and the rise of moral relativism make peaceful settlements nearly impossible, leaving only coercion and manipulation. He posits that this moral decay, exemplified by political figures and public apathy, allows atrocities to continue and must be reversed by recommitting to shared responsibilities.</p>

          <p>A driver intentionally rammed a vehicle into a crowd of people waiting outside a Hollywood nightclub early Saturday, injuring 30 individuals, with at least seven in critical condition. Police identified the driver as 29-year-old Fernando Ramirez, who allegedly made a U-turn before the crash; he was subsequently attacked by bystanders and shot by an unknown assailant who fled the scene. Authorities are investigating the crash as an assault with a deadly weapon and the subsequent shooting as a separate crime.</p>

Her defense claimed the shooting was a tragic accident that occurred while the couple was playfully reenacting a Bugs Bunny cartoon, with Linda believing the gun was unloaded based on her husband's Elmer Fudd-like comment, "No more buwwets." After an initial mistrial where the jury was deadlocked, a second trial, which focused less on the bizarre cartoon defense, resulted in a second-degree murder conviction and a sentence of 40 years to life.</p>

          <h2>UK Government's 'Great British Energy' School Solar Panels Were Made in China</h2>

          <p>The first solar panels installed in English schools under the government's new Great British Energy initiative were manufactured by two Chinese firms, Aiko and Longi. This has drawn criticism from some MPs due to allegations of forced labor in China's solar panel supply chains, particularly in the Xinjiang region. While GB Energy stated its contracts comply with modern slavery rules, the situation highlights the UK's reliance on cheaper Chinese panels and the ethical complexities of building a green energy infrastructure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Drivers at Edinburgh Airport are increasingly parking in nearby lay-bys and side streets to avoid the official drop-off zone's fees, which can be as high as £6 for a ten-minute stay. This behavior is a response to rising "kiss-and-fly" charges at many UK airports, which contrasts with most major EU airports that offer free drop-offs. While the airport provides a free zone further from the terminal, many, including those with mobility issues, find it inconvenient, leading to a cat-and-mouse game on the airport's approach roads.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In occupied areas of Ukraine, Russia is conducting a systematic campaign to erase Ukrainian identity and indoctrinate children with pro-Russian, militaristic ideologies. This effort involves forcing children to participate in patriotic parades, using a Russian-only curriculum that justifies the war, and enlisting Russian teachers to relocate to occupied territories. Organizations like the state-sponsored Yunarmia (Youth Army) provide military-style training to children as young as eight, part of a broader strategy that international bodies have condemned as brainwashing.</p>

          <h2>Debate Emerges in UK Over Shortening School Summer Holidays</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 19:05:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is growing in the UK over whether the traditional six-week school summer holiday should be shortened and redistributed throughout the year. Proponents argue a shorter break could reduce learning loss, ease childcare and food cost burdens on working parents, and potentially lower holiday prices. However, many teachers oppose the idea, citing the need for a long break to recharge and plan, while others worry that a compressed summer window could intensify the scramble for time off and further inflate travel costs.</p>

          <p>The global transition to green technology, particularly electric vehicles, is driving a massive demand for lithium, but its extraction is causing severe environmental damage in Chile's Atacama Desert. The process of pumping vast quantities of brine from beneath salt flats is depleting water resources in the drought-prone region, harming local ecosystems, shrinking lagoons, and threatening the livelihoods of indigenous communities. While mining companies are exploring less impactful technologies, locals are skeptical and fear irreversible damage to their ancestral lands.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is advocating for a cultural shift to encourage savers to move money from low-interest cash accounts into stocks and shares, arguing the benefits of investing are often overshadowed by risk warnings. The government plans new ad campaigns and targeted messages to savers, but has paused on potential cuts to the cash Individual Savings Account (ISA) tax-free allowance. Experts note a significant gender gap in investing and caution that a poorly timed push could backfire if new investors face immediate market losses. (not investment advice)</p>
