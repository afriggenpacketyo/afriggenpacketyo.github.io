          <p>The People's Bank of China (PBOC) plans to establish an "international operations centre" for the digital yuan to enhance the renminbi's global influence, according to Governor Pan Gongsheng. This initiative is part of eight financial policies announced at the Lujiazui Forum in Shanghai, which also include piloting structural monetary policy tools in Shanghai. These measures are being implemented amid growing trade and technology tensions with the United States, driving China's efforts to promote overseas adoption of the yuan and strengthen Shanghai as a global financial hub. The trials will incorporate refinancing schemes for foreign trade enterprises and an expanded green finance programme. Optimism surrounding the yuan's future impact is moderate given the global economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The opening of the HS2 high-speed rail line in the UK is expected to be delayed beyond 2033, according to sources familiar with the matter. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander is expected to inform Parliament that the project cannot be delivered on schedule and within budget, citing a "litany of failure" that has led to missed deadlines and escalating costs. Two reviews into HS2 will be released, detailing the project's shortcomings and lessons for future infrastructure endeavors. The original plan envisioned high-speed rail links between London and major cities in the Midlands and North of England, but the project has encountered numerous challenges and cost increases since its inception. The prospect of the project being delayed has caused a dip in optimism. </p>

          <p>New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, also a Democratic mayoral candidate, was arrested by ICE agents at a federal immigration court while observing court proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) claims Lander assaulted law enforcement and impeded a federal officer, but charges against him were later dropped. Lander stated he was taken into custody while escorting a defendant out of court to prevent ICE arrest, while DHS asserts Lander undermined law enforcement safety for a "viral moment." The incident has sparked outrage, with officials like Gov. Kathy Hochul condemning the arrest as a sorry day for New York and the country. The arrest followed similar incidents involving other Democratic politicians at immigration-related events, which has sparked criticism that these arrests were politically motivated. </p>

Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears. Virginia's elections are closely watched as indicators of national sentiment before midterm elections, with analysts assessing voter attitudes toward President Trump and the Republican-controlled Washington. While Democrats have history on their side, the state has become more competitive, making the upcoming elections crucial.

          <p>Divisions have emerged among President Donald Trump's supporters regarding whether the US should join Israel in attacking Iran or remain uninvolved. Trump is reportedly considering assisting in targeting Iran's nuclear facilities, leading to conflict between the isolationist and hawkish factions within his party. Some Republicans, like Congressman Thomas Massie, are siding with Democrats to block unauthorized military engagement with Iran. Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson has criticized Republican "warmongers," prompting a rebuke from Trump, while others like Marjorie Taylor Greene have defended Carlson, highlighting the deep rifts within the party.

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the State Department from enforcing an executive order requiring Americans to select their gender assigned at birth on new passports.

The executive order, issued by President Trump, reversed a policy under the Biden administration that allowed self-selection of gender and included an "X" for non-binary individuals. The ACLU sued the Trump administration, claiming the policy was discriminatory. The ruling has been praised by LGBTQ+ advocates and criticized by the White House, with the Justice Department appealing the decision.

          <p>The G7 summit in Canada, hosted by Mark Carney, was overshadowed by the war between Israel and Iran and President Donald Trump's early departure. Despite these disruptions, Carney emphasized the summit's focus on long-term resilience over short-term efficiency. The summit addressed the conflict in the Middle East, with leaders urging de-escalation, and discussed support for Ukraine, though a joint statement was not issued. Other outcomes included agreements on artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and critical minerals. The summit's ability to address key issues despite challenges has resulted in a moderate rise in optimism. </p>
