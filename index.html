          <p>The latest Henley Passport Index names Singapore's passport as the most powerful in the world, granting its citizens visa-free access to 193 countries. This marks a consistent top performance for the nation, while Japan and South Korea hold the second position. The report highlights a continued downward trend for the United States and the United Kingdom, which have fallen to 10th and 6th place, respectively. The index, which assesses travel freedom based on data from the International Air Transport Association, shows a strong dominance of European and key Asian countries in the top tiers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to U.S. tariffs on transshipments, particularly through Vietnam, Chinese companies are being encouraged to deepen their economic integration within Southeast Asian nations. An economist from the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office suggested that firms should become more ingrained in local economies to build long-term stability and mitigate the impact of unpredictable U.S. trade policies. This strategy aims to create more resilient supply chains as Chinese exports currently face an average U.S. tariff rate of 42 percent. The advice emphasizes businesses making autonomous decisions to protect themselves from escalating trade tensions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares for major Japanese auto manufacturers, including Toyota and Honda, experienced significant gains after reports that the U.S. would lower auto tariffs from 25% to 15%. Toyota's stock jumped nearly 12%, while others like Mazda and Mitsubishi saw even larger percentage increases, reflecting the industry's relief. The auto sector is a critical component of Japan's economy, and recent months had seen a sharp decline in vehicle exports to the U.S. under the higher tariff rate. This development provides short-term assurance for an industry facing intense international competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An explosion at the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's Biscailuz Center Training Academy has resulted in the deaths of three deputies. The deceased, identified as detectives Joshua Kelley-Eklund, Victor Lemus, and William Osborn, were described as elite experts on the Arson Explosives Detail. The incident, which occurred in the facility's parking lot, represents the department's largest single loss of life since 1857. While the investigation is ongoing, preliminary reports suggest the blast may have happened while the deputies were working to render safe a grenade that had been recovered from a separate location the previous day.</p>

          <p>A sheriff's deputy in Jacksonville, Florida, has been suspended following the online circulation of a video showing him punching a driver during a traffic stop. The driver, William McNeil Jr, posted footage of the officer smashing his car window and pulling him out of the vehicle. Police later released bodycam footage showing McNeil refusing to exit the car after being stopped for alleged traffic violations. While a state prosecutor found no criminal misconduct by the officers, the sheriff's office has initiated an internal review and placed the involved deputy on administrative duties pending its outcome.</p>

Scott, who signed a large contract in the offseason, exited a recent game after feeling a stinging sensation in his forearm. While his performance has been inconsistent, losing him for the year would be a major blow to a bullpen already dealing with multiple injuries. The situation underscores the team's need to acquire another high-leverage reliever before the upcoming trade deadline to bolster their pitching staff.</p>

          <p>A man who allegedly drove his car into a crowd outside an East Hollywood nightclub has been charged with 37 counts of attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon. The incident occurred after the suspect, Fernando Ramirez, was ejected from the Vermont Hollywood nightclub. He is accused of returning and plowing his vehicle into dozens of people, injuring at least 36 individuals, eight of them seriously. Authorities called it a miracle that there were no fatalities. After the crash, bystanders pulled Ramirez from the car and assaulted him before police arrived.</p>

          <p>The civil war in Sudan has escalated as the oil-rich Kordofan region emerges as a new major front line between the national army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).

Recent attacks in the region have resulted in hundreds of civilian deaths, shifting focus to this battleground. The conflict, which has raged for over two years, has already displaced approximately 12 million people and caused immense devastation across the nation.</p>

          <p>One month after deadly Israeli airstrikes targeted Tehran's Evin Prison, transferred inmates are reporting inhumane conditions in other detention centers. Families of prisoners describe severe overcrowding, lack of beds, poor sanitation with insect infestations, and limited access to basic amenities in facilities like Fashafouyeh Prison. The original attack, which Israel claimed targeted intelligence operations, killed 80 people and was labeled a war crime by Iran. Human rights groups state the subsequent treatment of prisoners, including mixing political detainees with violent criminals, violates international standards and exacerbates their suffering.</p>

          <p>The Hershey Company has confirmed it will implement a "low double-digit" price increase across its candy portfolio to combat the unprecedented rise in cocoa costs. The price of cocoa has skyrocketed due to a global shortage caused by poor weather conditions and disease in West African growing regions, as well as chronic underinvestment in farms. Hershey stated the price change is unrelated to tariffs and is a direct reflection of rising ingredient costs. The company also plans to focus more on products that are less cocoa-intensive as part of its strategy to become a broader "snacking powerhouse."</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Trump administration is engaged in a deliberate effort to remove women from senior leadership positions within the U.S. military. The author cites the recent reassignments of several high-ranking female officers, including the first female head of the U.S. Naval Academy, as part of a pattern. The piece contends that these moves align with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's previously stated views questioning the role of women in the military. The author concludes that this is sending a chilling message that women are not welcome in top roles, undermining military readiness.</p>

          <p>A panel of federal judges in New Jersey has declined to permanently appoint Alina Habba, a personal lawyer for Donald Trump, as the state's U.S. Attorney, effectively ending her tenure. Habba had been serving in an interim capacity, but her nomination faced strong opposition from the state's Democratic senators, who criticized her for a lack of prosecutorial experience and for pursuing politically motivated cases. The judges appointed her deputy, career prosecutor Desiree Leigh Grace, to the role, though the Justice Department immediately announced Grace's removal in a move condemned by Democrats as undermining judicial independence.</p>

          <p>Residents of Edinburgh's historic Royal Mile are raising concerns about "overtourism," citing the proliferation of 72 tourist-focused gift shops along the famous thoroughfare. Locals argue that the dominance of these shops, alongside a surge in holiday lets, has displaced essential businesses like grocers and doctors' offices, making the area less livable for families. While tourism supports over 40,000 jobs in the city, the dramatic increase in international visitors has led to a decline in the local primary school's roll and a feeling among residents that their community is being eroded by commercial pressures.</p>
