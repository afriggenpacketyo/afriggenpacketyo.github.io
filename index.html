          <p>President Trump has reaffirmed his stance that U.S. Steel should be controlled by the United States. This statement comes amid ongoing discussions about the potential deal with Nippon Steel. The reiteration underscores the administration's focus on maintaining domestic control over key industries. This is likely aimed at assuaging concerns about foreign ownership of critical infrastructure and resources. The statement is made amidst ongoing discussion about a deal between Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel. The political environment surrounding this deal is delicate, given Trump's prior opposition and the need to balance economic interests with national security considerations. </p>

          <p>In Strasburg, Colorado, a three-year-old boy named Bridger bravely helped his great-grandmother, Sharon Lewis, after she suffered a serious fall. Lewis tripped and hit her head on a concrete step, leaving her unable to get up and bleeding. Bridger, left alone with his great-grandmother, had to navigate a dark and unlit path to retrieve her phone from the car. Overcoming his fear of the dark, Bridger whispered to himself, "Don't be afraid," and successfully retrieved the phone, enabling Lewis to call for help. The incident has inspired Bridger's family to embrace a more fearless attitude, with his mother pursuing a career in special education and getting "Don't be afraid" tattooed on her arm. </p>

Disability and health advocates are criticizing the proposal, arguing it could result in people losing coverage and force older adults and people with disabilities into extreme poverty.

This announcement comes after teasing a "planned partnership" between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, which Trump characterizes as an investment and partial ownership controlled by the United States. The deal includes vital protections to ensure that all steel workers will keep their jobs and all facilities in the United States will remain open and thriving, including a $5,000 bonus for every worker at U.S. Steel. </p>

          <p>Defence Secretary John Healey has indicated that UK defence spending is projected to rise to 3% of GDP by 2034. This projection aligns with the Prime Minister's plans to increase defence spending to 2.5% by April 2027, with a longer-term ambition to reach 3% by 2034, contingent on economic conditions. The strategic defence review, set to be published, will outline priorities for military and security spending, assuming the 3% target is the trajectory for spending. New funding for defence will be partially sourced by reducing UK overseas aid from 0.5% to 0.3% of gross national income. </p>

The center advises consumers to thoroughly vet business operators and avoid buying from websites that sell rice at unrealistically low prices.

          <p>PBS has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration challenging his executive order targeting public broadcasting. The lawsuit accuses the administration of unlawfully interfering in the operations of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and committing multiple violations of the First Amendment. Trump signed the executive order instructing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to "cease direct funding to NPR and PBS" on his way to Florida aboard Air Force One on May 1. The White House claims the two news organizations "have fueled partisanship and left-wing propaganda with taxpayer dollars." </p>

Macron's speech comes amid a regional tour that has also taken him to Vietnam and Indonesia, where he has sought to bolster France's defense cooperation with other nations. Macron warned that the unpredictability of the new tariff approach and the end of a rule-based order for trade will impact the nations' economy and their ability to fund the defense efforts. </p>

The author suggests that people may be dreading parenthood because they've held their own parents to unreachable standards, standards that they themselves would struggle to meet.
