          <p>Former President Trump took to Truth Social to suggest that his negative remarks about Taylor Swift have diminished her popularity since she endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump previously expressed his dislike for Swift after she backed Harris in the 2024 election, and questioned her liberal political views. This occurred during Trump's overseas trip where he met with Arab leaders and announced economic deals. Swift has occasionally entered the political arena, endorsing candidates who oppose Trump, including Joe Biden in 2020 and Phil Bredesen in his 2018 Senate race. Optimism surrounding this event is moderate, as it reflects ongoing political divisions and the intersection of celebrity culture with politics.</p>

British Airways initially insisted she had not traveled, leading the BBC to book her another expensive flight home.

          <p>Ten inmates, including a convicted murderer, escaped from the Orleans Parish Justice Center in New Orleans after creating a hole in a cell wall. Sheriff Susan Hutson believes the inmates received assistance from individuals within the department, leading to the suspension of three employees. The inmates tampered with a locked cell door and exited through a loading dock, scaling a wall and running across an interstate. One escapee has been apprehended, but the remaining nine are considered armed and dangerous, prompting criticism of the Sheriffâ€™s Office for security lapses and delayed public notification.</p>

The proposal, included in the California Department of Toxic Substances Control's draft Hazardous Waste Management Plan, faced scrutiny over potential toxic dust and groundwater contamination. State officials argued the existing rules made disposal difficult and expensive, but the board ultimately sided with concerns about public health and environmental protection.

          <p>Moody's Ratings downgraded the United States' sovereign credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing the increasing burden of financing the federal government's budget deficit and the rising costs of rolling over existing debt. This decision aligns Moody's with Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings, which had previously downgraded the U.S. The rating agency pointed to the failure of successive administrations to address large fiscal deficits and growing interest costs. The downgrade is expected to marginally increase the yield investors demand for U.S. Treasury debt and could dampen sentiment toward U.S. assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Moody's downgraded the United States' credit rating, citing rising debt levels and political dysfunction in Washington. This downgrade means that all three major credit rating agencies no longer give the U.S. their highest rating.

The move could lead to higher borrowing costs for consumers, though past downgrades have had limited economic impact. The report also referenced the push to renew tax cuts adopted under President Trump, which Republicans are struggling with on Capitol Hill.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement that the U.S. would lift sanctions on Syria took senior Treasury Department officials by surprise.

Syria's transitional government has been lobbying for sanctions relief to address economic challenges and rebuild the country. This decision reflects a potential shift in U.S. foreign policy toward Syria, driven by Trump's vision for peace and stability in the Middle East.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent diplomatic activities, including business deals in the Gulf, lifting sanctions on Syria, and brokering ceasefires, suggest a shift towards a mercantilist foreign policy focused on trade rather than interventionism. Trump's approach emphasizes commerce and national interests, with less focus on ideology or values. However, the effectiveness and long-term implications of this approach remain uncertain, as highlighted by ongoing conflicts and global market instability. The shift may also be influenced by a desire to clear the diplomatic decks for the primary focus on China.</p>
