          <p>An investigation reveals that dopamine agonist drugs, like Ropinirole, prescribed for Parkinson's disease and Restless Leg Syndrome, are linked to severe side effects including hypersexuality, compulsive gambling, and paranoia. The article details several distressing cases, such as a man who began spying on his wife and later sexually assaulted care home staff, tearing his family apart. Despite long-known risks and a 2003 GSK study finding a link to "deviant" behavior, critics argue that warnings on medication leaflets remain inadequate and that doctors are still failing to properly inform patients of these potentially devastating consequences.</p>

          <p>A strike by thousands of Republic Services sanitation workers, represented by the Teamsters union, is causing significant public health and nuisance issues in several American cities. Workers are demanding better pay and benefits, citing the high cost of living, while the company accuses the union of illegal tactics and an unwillingness to compromise. The strike highlights the leverage sanitation workers hold, as accumulating waste in the summer heat creates foul odors and pest problems, pressuring municipalities and the company to resolve the dispute. Negotiations have stalled in some areas, leaving residents and businesses to deal with the ongoing consequences.</p>

          <p>An explosion at a training facility in East Los Angeles that killed three deputies from the Arson Explosives Detail was caused by the detonation of a grenade they believed to be inert. Authorities have now revealed that a second grenade, recovered at the same time from a Santa Monica garage, is missing. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and the ATF are leading a search for the missing explosive and have warned the public not to touch any such device they might find. The incident, the department's largest loss of life since 1857, has prompted an immediate change in policy to treat all recovered explosives as live.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is reportedly planning to remove all 16 members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). According to a source familiar with the plans, Kennedy views the influential panel, which recommends which preventive services like cancer screenings must be covered by insurance, as being too "woke." While HHS stated that no final decision has been made, the move aligns with the administration's "Make America Healthy Again" mandate. The potential dismissal has raised concerns, as a recent meeting of the task force was abruptly canceled without explanation.</p>

          <p>China is moving forward with its plans for next-generation nuclear energy, having completed the conceptual design for a commercial fourth-generation gigawatt-level fast neutron reactor. The reactor, named CFR-1000, is now awaiting final approval and is anticipated to be operational after 2030. This development places China alongside other major nuclear powers like Russia and the United States, which are also developing advanced reactors to create more fuel-efficient and sustainable power sources. The announcement was made at an event in Fuzhou, attended by key officials from China's national energy and atomic authorities.</p>

          <p>A tragic bus accident in the Junin region of central Peru has resulted in the deaths of at least 15 people and left approximately 30 others injured. The double-decker bus, which was traveling from Lima to La Merced with over 60 passengers, veered off the road and fell into a ravine, landing on its roof near a river. Such incidents are unfortunately common in the country, with poor road conditions, excessive speed, and driver recklessness often cited as primary causes for thousands of traffic fatalities annually. Authorities are currently investigating the specific cause of this fatal crash while managing the aftermath.</p>

The bounties, ranging up to $125,000, target individuals accused of violating Beijing's national security law.

          <p>NASA is facing a significant exodus, with nearly 4,000 employees, representing over one-fifth of its workforce, having applied to leave the agency through a government-wide deferred resignation program. This potential staff reduction comes as the agency grapples with a proposed 25% budget cut for fiscal year 2026 and a recent leadership crisis, including a withdrawn nomination for its administrator. The departures would shrink NASA's civil servant workforce from approximately 18,000 to 14,000. Despite the upheaval, NASA maintains that safety remains its top priority as it aims to become a more streamlined organization for future exploration missions.</p>

Chicago's mayor and Illinois' governor praised the ruling, affirming their stance that the city is safer when local law enforcement focuses on local needs rather than participating in federal immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society is exploring the legacy of the Hollywood blacklist, which began in 1947 with the House Un-American Activities Committee's investigation into alleged Communist influence in the film industry. The exhibit focuses on the "Hollywood Ten," a group of writers and directors who were jailed and blacklisted for refusing to testify, and how the anti-Communist fervor expanded to ruin the careers of many others. It showcases how blacklisted individuals like Dalton Trumbo wrote under pseudonyms to continue working. The exhibit raises enduring questions about free speech, political persecution, and the protection of democracy when faced with unpopular ideas.</p>

          <p>A Whittier man has been arrested on federal charges for allegedly running a romance scam that defrauded multiple victims of more than $2 million. Prosecutors claim Christopher Earl Lloyd used dating apps like Tinder and Hinge to meet people, then convinced them to invest in fraudulent opportunities by fabricating a persona of a successful financial manager. He allegedly used fake contracts and investment schedules to collect money via cash, wire transfers, and payment apps. Lloyd is charged with 13 counts of wire fraud and one count of money laundering, with authorities alleging he used some of the stolen funds to purchase a Lexus.</p>

          <p>An article explores how Donald Trump utilizes golf not just as a pastime but as a significant tool for business, networking, and diplomacy. Unlike past presidents who used the sport for diversion, Trump's time on the course is often transactional, providing a private venue to build relationships with political allies, business leaders, and foreign dignitaries. The piece recounts anecdotes of his fierce competitiveness and describes how his ownership of high-profile courses like Turnberry in Scotland is part of his brand-building strategy. While his passion for the game is clear, golf for Trump is also a means of conducting affairs away from public scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell was granted a limited form of "proffer immunity" for her two-day, nine-hour interview with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, according to sources. This legal protection allowed her to answer questions about the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking network without her statements being used against her, a common step when prosecutors seek cooperation. Maxwell's lawyer stated she answered questions about roughly 100 different people and that no promises were made in return. The high-level meeting is unusual for a convicted trafficker and comes as the Justice Department faces pressure to be more transparent about the Epstein case and President Trump's connections to it.</p>

          <p>Wildlife biologists in Texas are engaged in a critical mission to save the state's dwindling bighorn sheep population, which has been decimated by disease over the last five years. In a carefully planned rescue, dozens of healthy sheep were captured from the last disease-free herd and airlifted over 200 miles to an isolated, safe mountain range. A recent follow-up visit revealed the success of the relocation, with biologists finding a growing herd that now includes newborn lambs. The effort is being hailed as a "monumental" success, offering a beacon of hope for the survival of this iconic native species in the region.</p>

This diplomatic failure occurs as the humanitarian crisis intensifies, with the UN and other agencies reporting that children are starving to death due to Israel's blockade. UNICEF noted a 180% increase in acute malnutrition among children since February, highlighting the catastrophic conditions faced by civilians as the war grinds on.</p>

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight from Burbank to Las Vegas executed a sudden, rapid descent to avoid a potential mid-air collision, an event that injured two flight attendants. Passengers reported being lifted from their seats during the dramatic maneuver, which the pilot later explained was a response to a collision warning and a near-miss with another aircraft, identified as a privately owned Hawker Hunter fighter jet. The flight continued to its destination and landed safely, but the incident has prompted an FAA investigation. This marks the second near-miss involving a commercial airliner in the US in a week, raising further concerns about aviation safety.</p>

          <p>A health and wellbeing article explores whether popular daily health targets, such as drinking eight glasses of water or taking 10,000 steps, are rigid requirements or flexible guidelines. Experts suggest that while benchmarks are useful, individual needs vary and strict adherence isn't always necessary; for instance, thirst is a reliable guide for hydration for most people. However, for goals like getting seven to nine hours of sleep, specialists advise there is little room for compromise due to its profound impact on long-term health. The consensus is that incorporating a healthy outlook into daily life is more beneficial than stressing over hitting exact numerical targets for every metric.</p>

          <p>A scientific revolution is underway in women's sports, focusing on how female physiology impacts athletic performance and injury risk. Researchers are studying topics once considered taboo, such as how breast biomechanics affect running stride and the role of properly fitted sports bras. Other areas of focus include the impact of the menstrual cycle on performance and anxiety, and why female athletes have a higher susceptibility to certain injuries like ACL tears. This shift away from treating female athletes as "mini-men" is leading to better support, tailored training, and a more open dialogue, ultimately improving both elite performance and participation in sports.</p>

While the boxes contain sufficient calories for survival through items like pasta, lentils, and flour, experts warn they lack essential micronutrients. This could lead to "hidden hunger" and diseases like anemia and scurvy over time, and the contents are ill-suited for young children.

The move comes as the national debt has surpassed $36 trillion and is projected to continue growing significantly.
