        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An NHS Lothian psychiatrist in Scotland aims to open a clinic by the end of the year offering ketamine as an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for patients with severe, treatment-resistant depression. This initiative follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that provides ketamine-assisted therapy, which costs Â£6,000 for four infusions and psychotherapy. While ketamine is not officially licensed for depression treatment, it can be used 'off-label' by doctors; however, the Royal College of Psychiatrists has urged caution regarding its use. Professor Andrew McIntosh believes ketamine could offer additional hope to patients who have not responded well to traditional treatments, suggesting it may enhance brain plasticity or alter brain connections, but the exact mechanism remains unclear.</p>

          <p>Despite the U.S. military's recent engagement in the conflict between Israel and Iran, global markets have largely remained stable, with the MSCI World index experiencing only a slight decline. Strategists suggest that the market views the attack on Iran as a relief, with minimal risks of the conflict spreading regionally, though the gravity of the situation is not dismissed. Safe-haven assets like the Japanese yen weakened, while gold prices saw a minor dip; the dollar index rose slightly. Investors are closely monitoring potential countermeasures from Iran following the U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities; however, so far the markets have brushed off the escalation.</p>

The victim was transported to a local hospital and is expected to make a full recovery. Authorities described the scene as "hectic" due to the large number of people in the area for the celebrations, and an investigation into the incident is currently underway.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has signaled some support for the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, viewing them as a demonstration of Washington's determination to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya stated that de-escalating the situation regarding Iran's nuclear activities is of utmost importance. While traditionally maintaining amicable ties with Iran, Japan acknowledges the U.S. has been actively pursuing dialogue on the Iranian nuclear issue amid challenging circumstances. Japan continues to express its strong hope for the resumption of dialogue between the United States and Iran, pledging diplomatic efforts in cooperation with the international community to promote peace and stability in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Gabriel and Sebastian Shemirani share their story of losing their sister, Paloma, to cancer after she refused chemotherapy due to their mother's anti-medicine conspiracy theories. Their mother, Kate Shemirani, was a nurse who was struck off for spreading misinformation about COVID-19 and promoted alternative therapies, influencing Paloma's decision to reject conventional treatment. The brothers hope to prevent similar deaths by raising awareness about medical misinformation and urging social media companies to take stronger action. Cancer specialists warn that anti-medicine views are becoming more mainstream, potentially causing harm as vulnerable individuals opt for unproven alternative treatments.</p>

          <p>Western leaders are calling for diplomacy amid the escalating conflict involving the US, Israel, and Iran, but they are criticized for failing to address the underlying causes and for their perceived bias towards Israel. Despite public anger and alarm, mainstream liberal parties are seen as offering a feeble response, essentially acting as passengers in Israel's war. The article argues that this inertness stems from a political establishment that lacks a moral compass and prioritizes tribal supremacy over international law and human rights. The author contends that western leaders' pronouncements on diplomacy ring hollow, as they continue to support a status quo that favors Israel, thereby undermining their own integrity and authority.</p>

          <p>At the upcoming NATO summit in The Hague, member states are expected to set ambitious defense spending goals, potentially requiring Germany to allocate 5% of its GDP to defense by 2032. This significant increase would place heavy demands on the Bundeswehr, necessitating additional troops and advanced military capabilities amid ongoing tensions with Russia. While Chancellor Friedrich Merz supports these measures, some within his coalition government express skepticism, citing concerns about the economic impact and questioning the security policy justification. Experts emphasize that increased investment in the armed forces is crucial for Germany's national security, particularly in light of potential reductions in the US military presence in Europe.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has urged China to persuade Iran not to close the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial global shipping route. This appeal comes after Iranian state media reported parliament's approval of a plan to close the Strait, though the final decision rests with the Supreme National Security Council. Any disruption to the Strait could severely impact the global economy, particularly China, which is the largest buyer of Iranian oil. Rubio emphasized that closing the Strait would be "economic suicide" for Iran and urged other countries to consider the broader economic consequences.</p>

          <p>New York City is implementing ranked choice voting in its upcoming Democratic mayoral primary election, a system where voters rank multiple candidates in order of preference. This system aims to ensure that even if a voter's top choice doesn't win, their other rankings still contribute to the final outcome. If no candidate secures a majority of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed to the voters' second choices, continuing until a winner emerges. While this system can lead to broader support for the elected candidate, it also presents challenges in terms of transparency and predictability, potentially leading to questions about the accuracy of the results.</p>

          <p>China's defense ministry announced the establishment of three new military academies, sparking significant interest among young Chinese citizens. The announcement, viewed over 8 million times on social media, reflects a growing desire to serve the country. However, the ministry clarified that the total number of new recruits will remain consistent with previous years, indicating a restructuring rather than an expansion. These changes are part of ongoing efforts to modernize the military education system and enhance war preparation capabilities, also removing the requirement for military academy students to have three years of work experience before they can become commanders.</p>

          <p>Okinawa marked the 80th anniversary of the end of the Battle of Okinawa, a fierce WWII ground battle between Japan and the United States, with a ceremony to honor the over 200,000 military and civilian lives lost. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Okinawa Gov. Denny Tamaki attended the service at the Peace Memorial Park in Itoman, where the final stage of the battle was fought. Tamaki emphasized the importance of passing on the lessons of the battle to future generations, while also highlighting the prefecture's ongoing burden in hosting U.S. military bases, a source of local discontent due to noise, pollution, and crimes committed by American service members.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has asserted that the term "obliteration" accurately describes the damage inflicted on Iran's nuclear facilities during recent U.S. strikes, despite some officials being more cautious in their assessments. Gen. Dan Caine, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, confirmed "severe damage and destruction" to facilities at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, but stopped short of declaring Iran's nuclear capabilities "obliterated." Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated that precision munitions struck their intended targets effectively. The UN nuclear watchdog chief also adopted a cautious stance, while reports suggest some enriched uranium had been moved prior to the strikes.</p>

Republicans had also sought to reclaim over $1 billion allocated for EV purchases and charging infrastructure.

Experts warn of a possible oil price shock comparable to that seen during the Ukraine war, with prices potentially reaching $100 per barrel. The situation is exacerbated by threats to block the Strait of Hormuz, a critical artery for global oil trade. While the market reaction has been less aggressive than initially anticipated, industry watchers believe the situation introduces a new era of uncertainty for oil markets.</p>
