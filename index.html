        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Broadcom's stock value increased by over 10% after the company revealed a new $10 billion order for custom artificial intelligence chips from a fourth major, unnamed customer. Analysts from several firms, including Mizuho and Cantor Fitzgerald, speculate the client is the AI startup OpenAI, following reports of a co-designed chip. This significant order has boosted the company's revenue forecast for the upcoming year, when shipments are set to begin. The news underscores Broadcom's growing prominence alongside Nvidia in the competitive AI hardware market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A congressional investigation by House Republicans has found that the Pentagon funded hundreds of research projects in collaboration with Chinese universities and institutes linked to China's defense industry. The report from the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party argues these partnerships have allowed China to leverage U.S. research for military advancement. Many of the involved Chinese entities were reportedly blacklisted by the U.S. government, raising concerns about national security risks. The report calls for better safeguarding of American research to protect the nation's technological dominance.</p>

          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage fell significantly to 6.29%, marking the largest one-day drop in over a year and the lowest rate since October of the previous year. This sharp decline followed the release of a weaker-than-expected August employment report, which influenced market sentiment. For a homeowner purchasing a median-priced home, this rate drop could translate to a monthly payment reduction of nearly $170. While the decrease provides relief for potential buyers, analysts question if it is substantial enough to reinvigorate housing market demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Commission has fined Google €2.95 billion for violating EU competition laws by abusing its dominant position in the advertising technology sector. Regulators found that Google unfairly favored its own online ad display products and its advertising exchange, AdX, to the detriment of rival services, publishers, and advertisers. The Commission has ordered Google to cease these anti-competitive practices and has warned of potential structural remedies, such as selling parts of its ad tech business, if changes are not made. Google has stated it will appeal the decision, calling the fine unjustified.</p>

          <p>This opinion article critiques the Democratic strategy of labeling nearly every controversial action by President Trump as a deliberate distraction from his past association with Jeffrey Epstein. The author argues that this approach diminishes the seriousness of Trump's more authoritarian tactics, such as deploying the National Guard in cities or challenging the Secret Service protection of political rivals. By consistently framing these events as mere deflections, Democrats risk implying that the actions themselves are not significant threats. The piece suggests this focus on distraction may reveal a lack of a more effective opposition message.</p>

To fund these, Reform claims it can save £30 billion per year by scrapping net-zero carbon emission policies and an additional £50 billion by cutting government waste.

          <p>With the Powerball jackpot reaching an estimated $1.8 billion, an analysis of lottery data reveals how a winner's location can dramatically affect their net winnings. After federal taxes, which reduce the prize significantly, state income taxes can take another large cut.

In contrast, states with high income taxes, such as New York, would result in the lowest after-tax payout for the winner. The current jackpot is the second-largest in U.S. history.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With global equities at all-time highs, financial analysts suggest investors should consider strategies to protect their portfolio gains from potential market volatility. A weak August jobs report has increased expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut, but underlying economic uncertainty and persistent inflation pose risks. Experts advise re-evaluating over-concentration in mega-cap tech stocks, which dominate major indexes like the S&P 500. They recommend diversifying by shifting some capital into defensive sectors and value stocks that have not participated as strongly in the recent market rally. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) has laid off nearly 100 employees in recent months, a direct result of significant cuts in its federal funding. This workforce reduction includes 34 staff members who were notified of their termination this week. The move follows a congressional vote in July that eliminated $1.1 billion allocated to public broadcasting, creating widespread financial uncertainty for PBS's 350 member stations. In response to the financial pressure, PBS also announced a 21% budget cut and a reduction in the dues paid by its local stations.</p>

According to a report from NAIOP, net absorption of industrial space dropped by 11.3 million square feet in the second quarter. This downturn is attributed to economic uncertainty driven by changing tariff policies and high inflation, which has caused businesses to pause expansion plans. While a recovery is projected for 2026, demand is expected to remain flat for the rest of the current year. (not investment advice)</p>

This change modifies the $10,000 cap that was implemented as part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The SALT deduction, which primarily benefits taxpayers in high-tax states, allows those who itemize to deduct state and local income and property taxes from their federal tax liability.
