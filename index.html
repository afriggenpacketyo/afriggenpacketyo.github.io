He described enduring dire conditions, including poor sanitation, constant hunger, and fear of Israeli bombings, while being moved between apartments and tunnels in Gaza. Ben Ami, who was released in a prisoner exchange, emphasizes that seeing news of widespread support in Israel gave him and other hostages hope. He now pleads for a deal to release the remaining 48 captives, stating he cannot truly be free in his soul until they are all returned home.</p>

          <p>For the first time in history, renewable energy sources became the world's leading generator of electricity in the first half of this year, according to a report by the energy think tank Ember. The growth in solar and wind power was significant enough to meet all new global electricity demand, even causing a slight decrease in fossil fuel usage. However, the report highlights a global divide, with developing nations like China and India leading the clean energy transition, while developed countries, including the US and EU, increased their reliance on fossil fuels. The International Energy Agency has also halved its forecast for renewable growth in the US due to administration policies. (not investment advice)</p>

The move, which caused ICE's shares to rise, signals a growing mainstream acceptance of prediction markets, which are seen as a competitor to the sports gambling industry. Polymarket's CEO, Shayne Coplan, stated the partnership would combine ICE's institutional scale with Polymarket's consumer focus to create new products for modern investors. The platform was recently approved for launch in the U.S. and also secured an investment from a firm backed by Donald Trump Jr. (not investment advice)</p>

Their initial encounter went viral after Combs posted on Facebook about the polite and humble young man who helped her, unaware he was a top NFL draft pick. Before a recent game against the Kansas City Chiefs, the two met on the field, embracing and taking a photo together. Hunter had previously described the interaction as simply him "being me," treating an older person with the same respect he shows his grandparents.</p>

          <p>The Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded to John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret, and John M. Martinis for their foundational work in quantum mechanics, specifically demonstrating macroscopic quantum tunneling in electrical circuits. Their discoveries have been crucial for the development of modern quantum technologies, including the creation of superconducting qubits, which are the basis for powerful quantum computers. The Nobel committee highlighted that this research paves the way for a new generation of technology, from mobile phones to advanced computing.

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Netanyahu's Prolonging of Gaza War Was a Successful Political Strategy</h2>

          <p>An analysis suggests that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, facing immense domestic and international pressure, may have successfully navigated a period of extreme political vulnerability by prolonging the war in Gaza. For months, it was widely alleged that he extended the conflict to maintain his grip on power and avoid potential jail time from corruption trials and accountability for the October 7 security failures. The recent U.S.-brokered peace plan, which he initially resisted, now appears to be a political victory for him regardless of its success, as it allows him to claim credit for bringing hostages home or blame Hamas if it fails. This strategy has seemingly allowed him to survive numerous crises that have threatened to end his long political career.</p>

          <p>Across Germany, various events were held to mark the second anniversary of the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel, reflecting the country's staunch support for Israel rooted in historical responsibility. Commemorations in Berlin included reading victims' names at the Brandenburg Gate, where 1,000 empty chairs were placed in remembrance. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz warned of a new wave of antisemitism in the country since the attack and called for solidarity with Jewish communities. Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul described the day as one of "darkness" for Israel but also acknowledged the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, stating they have the same right to life and dignity.</p>

Other anticipated topics include the recent indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, deadly strikes on suspected drug boats off Venezuela, and the release of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein.

          <p>Following Israeli-U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities and the imposition of crippling "snapback" sanctions by European powers, Iran is left with a series of poor strategic choices. The article analyzes several paths: surrendering nuclear ambitions, which is unlikely given the fate of leaders like Qaddafi; accelerating its nuclear program towards a bomb, risking further isolation; expanding its ballistic missile and drone capabilities, which proved only partially effective; or deepening alliances with Russia and China, who have proven to be unreliable partners. A final option involves a historic compromise, abandoning revolutionary ideology for economic development, a path favored by some elites but opposed by hard-liners, leaving the nation's future uncertain.</p>

Citing "rising antisemitism on our streets," Starmer described holding protests on this date as "un-British" and disrespectful, arguing that some have used the occasion as an excuse to attack British Jews. His comments come amid heightened security for Jewish communities following a recent deadly attack on a synagogue in Manchester.

          <p>As the war between Israel and Hamas enters its third year, the conflict continues with systematic and destructive force, alongside new diplomatic efforts for peace. Since the October 7, 2023 attack, Israel's campaign to destroy Hamas has led to widespread devastation in Gaza, with over 67,000 Palestinians killed and the majority of buildings damaged or destroyed. The conflict has also broadened, with Israeli military actions in Lebanon, Syria, and Iran, supported by U.S. weapons and intelligence. Now, a 20-point peace plan proposed by the Trump administration, which envisions a transfer of power to a technocratic Palestinian government, is being negotiated in Egypt, offering a potential but complex path to end the fighting.</p>

Each pine marten, a native species roughly the size of a cat, has been fitted with a radio collar to allow researchers to monitor their progress and adaptation to the new environment. Conservationists say the return of this "critical" species will help restore balance to the woodland ecosystem and serves as a positive sign that nature can be successfully restored.</p>

The piece warns that embracing synthetic actors would flatten the art form into a bland, controllable asset, robbing cinema of its power to inspire empathy. It calls for drawing a line where technology serves storytellers rather than replacing them, to protect the human core of filmmaking.</p>

The performers discuss how the play celebrates the often-overlooked work of hair braiders while also tackling deep themes like immigration, the "American dream," and the political scrutiny faced by their communities. They note that the play's humor serves as a "balm" for the challenging political realities its characters, and the audience, navigate.</p>

          <h2>New Documentary by Raoul Peck Examines George Orwell's Enduring Relevance in the Modern World</h2>

          <p>Filmmaker Raoul Peck's new documentary, "Orwell: 2+2=5," uses George Orwell's own words to create a powerful warning about contemporary political realities. The film, which premiered at Cannes, avoids traditional talking heads, instead pairing narration of Orwell's writings with modern imagery of authoritarianism, surveillance, and propaganda. Peck, known for "I Am Not Your Negro," argues that Orwell's concepts of "Newspeak" and "doublethink" are more relevant than ever in an era of political polarization and AI-driven disinformation. The documentary aims to show how authoritarian ideas can slowly creep into society, redefining language and reality to serve those in power.</p>

          <p>The family of David Adler, a 33-year-old activist from Southern California, is anxiously awaiting his release after he was detained by Israeli naval forces as part of the Gaza Sumud Flotilla. Adler was one of over 450 participants on a convoy attempting to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza when the boats were intercepted in international waters. He is now being held in an Israeli prison, and his family has had no direct contact with him. A group of California Democratic officials has sent a letter to the State Department urging immediate action to secure the release of Adler and 20 other U.S. citizens who remain in custody.</p>

          <p>Firefighters in Descanso, a rural area of San Diego County, conducted an unusual rescue of a goat that had become wedged between two minivan-sized boulders. The goat, a beloved farm animal, had fallen from its favorite napping spot and was tightly pinned. The Cal Fire crew, trained in specialized rescue techniques, used pressurized air bags capable of lifting 160,000 pounds to gently push the rocks apart. They were then able to coax the animal out, which emerged with only a minor injury. The farm's children were overjoyed to be reunited with their goat, which helps prevent wildfires by grazing on flammable brush.</p>

          <p>California has secured another legal victory against the Trump administration, with a federal judge blocking the president's attempt to deploy the California National Guard to Portland, Oregon. This ruling is the latest in a series of successful lawsuits filed by the state against the administration, with Attorney General Rob Bonta stating that California has won in 80% of its 42 cases so far. These legal battles have restored billions in funding and slowed administration policies on issues like immigration and civil rights. The column argues that while Governor Gavin Newsom is the public face of the resistance, Bonta's legal team is effectively using the court system to provide a crucial check on federal power.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management are planning to round up hundreds of wild horses near California's Mono Lake, citing significant environmental damage to the area's delicate ecosystem. The horse population has grown to over three times what the land can sustain, leading to the degradation of wetlands, bird habitats, and the lake's iconic tufa formations. While environmentalists and ranchers support the removal, animal welfare advocates and local Indigenous tribes are opposed, with some suing the government to halt the plan. The conflict highlights the complex challenge of managing wild horse populations while protecting sensitive natural landscapes and balancing competing interests.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A critical analysis of the recent drug pricing deal between the Trump administration and Pfizer suggests it is more beneficial to the pharmaceutical company than to American consumers. While touted as a "massive win," the deal's core components—offering "most favored nation" prices to Medicaid and creating a "TrumpRx" discount website—are unlikely to significantly lower out-of-pocket costs for most patients. In exchange for these modest and largely symbolic price reductions, Pfizer secures a three-year exemption from potentially costly tariffs on imported drugs. The arrangement allows the administration to claim a political victory on drug prices while Pfizer protects its bottom line, as reflected by a subsequent rise in its stock price.

          <p>California has enacted a new law that mandates streaming services to control the volume of their commercials, ensuring they are not significantly louder than the programming content. The legislation, signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, extends the principles of the federal CALM Act, which already applies to broadcast and cable TV, to streaming platforms like Netflix and Hulu. The bill was reportedly inspired by the common frustration of parents whose sleeping babies were awakened by blaring ads. It aims to create a more consistent and less jarring viewing experience for consumers within the state by regulating advertisement loudness.</p>

The "de minimis" rule, which previously allowed goods valued under $800 to enter the country duty-free, was eliminated, and consumers are now often responsible for paying the new tariffs upon delivery. While some large retailers have integrated the costs, many smaller overseas businesses have not, leaving delivery companies like UPS to collect the fees from frustrated customers.

The compact demands shifts on issues like admissions, diversity, and free speech, and would require the university to accept a government definition of gender.

          <p>A new report on Los Angeles County's response to recent catastrophic firestorms reveals that the county has failed to fix critical problems identified after the 2018 Woolsey fire. The investigation into the Palisades and Eaton fires found a persistent lack of staff training, unclear chains of command, and outdated protocols, which led to significant delays in issuing evacuation orders. These same issues were highlighted in the post-Woolsey report, which experts say points to a larger, systemic failure to learn from major disasters. Critics argue that these "groundhog day" after-action reports often result in minor technical recommendations without addressing the fundamental lack of clear responsibility and coordination among county agencies.</p>
