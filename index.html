          <p>Susan Monarez, the former CDC director, testified before a Senate committee, asserting that she was fired for refusing to endorse Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s vaccine policy changes without scientific evidence. Monarez stated that Kennedy wanted her to pre-approve vaccine recommendations from a newly formed advisory panel and dismiss career scientists, which she declined to do. Kennedy has disputed Monarez's account, claiming she admitted to being untrustworthy, while Monarez maintains she was upholding scientific integrity. The controversy has raised concerns about political influence over public health decisions and the composition of the CDC's advisory committee, which is set to discuss vaccine recommendations. Optimism is low given the accusations of political interference in scientific matters.</p>

          <p>Nvidia and Microsoft are among major US tech firms committing billions in investment to the UK, with Nvidia predicting the country will become an "AI superpower." Microsoft's $30 billion spending package is its largest ever outside the US, forming part of a broader "Tech Prosperity Deal" between the UK government and US tech giants. The investments will focus on building AI infrastructure, including data centers and a new supercomputer in Essex, with Google also promising £5 billion for AI research and infrastructure. While some warn of an AI bubble, tech leaders emphasize the potential for AI to drive economic growth and productivity, particularly in healthcare and public services. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security is blaming what it describes as dangerous political rhetoric for a surge in assaults against ICE agents, following the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. DHS claims that inflammatory language demonizing immigration enforcement is fueling violence, citing a 1,000% increase in assaults against ICE law enforcement. The department specifically pointed to comments from Democratic lawmakers and officials who have compared ICE to slave patrols or the Gestapo. The DHS is calling on the media and leftist groups to stop demonizing DHS law enforcement, asserting that such rhetoric incites violence. This has caused concern of an escalation of political tensions and violence.</p>

          <p>Kenya's public pension and health insurance systems are facing a major crisis due to widespread fraud, leaving many citizens without the security they were promised. An Auditor General's report revealed over 260,000 cases of fraudulent activities targeting pension schemes, resulting in the loss of over $515 million between 2013 and 2020. Health insurance schemes have also been targeted, with 35 hospitals accused of stealing over $804 million from the health tax fund. The government has promised to digitize the pension payment system to combat fraud, but public confidence remains low due to past failures and ongoing corruption.</p>

          <p>A Yale School of Public Health study reveals that Russia is subjecting abducted Ukrainian children to "forced militarization" in at least 210 facilities across Russia and Russian-occupied Ukraine. The children are reportedly being indoctrinated with pro-Russian, anti-Ukrainian narratives and, in some cases, trained in combat and paratrooper skills. Some facilities are even engaging children in the production of military equipment, including drones, for Russia's armed forces. The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Vladimir Putin and Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova for the unlawful deportation and transfer of Ukrainian children. The issue of abducted Ukrainian children will be raised during the U.N. General Assembly meeting.</p>

          <p>Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle responded to United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby's assertion that the deep discount model in the U.S. is dead, calling it "cute." Biffle defended Frontier's lower unit costs and its focus on customers seeking affordable flights, arguing that there is an oversupply issue in the United States. Kirby had predicted that Spirit Airlines, the largest U.S. discounter, would go out of business, but Biffle maintains that Frontier caters to a different market segment. Both Frontier and United are vying for Spirit's customers as the latter struggles financially.</p>

          <p>The European Commission is considering plans to restrict trade with Israel and impose sanctions on extremist ministers in its government in response to the Gaza war. The proposed measures would suspend trade-related provisions of the EU–Israel Association Agreement, potentially stripping Israeli goods of privileged access to European markets. However, the measures face significant hurdles, requiring approval by a qualified majority of member states for trade restrictions and unanimity for individual sanctions. Israel has dismissed the proposals as "morally and politically distorted," vowing to respond in kind to any actions taken against it. The measures' future is uncertain due to divisions among EU member states.</p>

However, it may not be worthwhile for those with already low rates, short-term selling plans, or who are close to paying off their loans. It is important to consider closing costs and break-even points before making a decision, and assess whether a fixed-rate home equity loan or variable-rate HELOC is the better option.

Critics argue that the broad language used by ICE could lead to federal charges for actions traditionally classified as resisting arrest or protest activities.

          <p>President Trump's "no tax on tips" deduction offers financial planning opportunities, but experts advise against making major moves yet. The provision allows certain workers to deduct up to $25,000 in qualified tips per year from 2025 through 2028. However, eligibility is complex, depending on occupation and whether one is a W-2 worker or self-employed. Experts say that further clarification is needed to understand which occupations qualify and how the official list will interact with the SSTBs, which are specified service trade or business.

          <p>A drone attack on Kyiv and the appearance of drones over Polish territory have highlighted the threat posed by the rapid advancement of autonomous aerial vehicles. Drones offer a cost-effective advantage for militaries, but defense against them is a constant challenge. Techniques to neutralize drones include spoofing, RF jamming, and conventional munitions. However, analysts suggest that a multi-layered approach to defense is needed, combining RF interference, conventional weapons, and laser or microwave technology. Investing in defensive measures is a priority for NATO members, particularly in light of Russia's advancements in drone technology.</p>

The 139-foot ship was last seen in January 1929, and is believed to have sunk in a storm with 21 men aboard. The wreck site was discovered in 2022 and identified in July 2025, with distinctive features like a double drum trawl winch and steam engine aiding in confirmation.

          <p>The HBO miniseries Task, created by Brad Ingelsby, contrasts sharply with his previous work, Mare of Easttown, by presenting a world dominated by men and institutions. The show explores themes of masculinity, rage, and forgiveness through the stories of an FBI agent and a trash collector. Unlike Mare, where women held positions of power and authority, Task depicts a world where women are marginalized and often victimized. The series delves into the inner workings of institutions like the FBI and a biker gang, highlighting the consequences of patriarchal structures.</p>
