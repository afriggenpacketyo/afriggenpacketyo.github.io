            <h2>Malaysian Durian Sales Soar in China Driven by Demand for Natural Ripening</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-20 01:31:07 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Malaysian durian exports to China are experiencing a significant surge due to increased consumer preference for fresh, naturally ripened fruit. Improved logistics and a steady supply are contributing to this growth, with Malaysian suppliers expecting a 30% increase in exports this year. Unlike Thailand and Vietnam, Malaysian durians are typically allowed to ripen on the tree before being harvested, which is highly valued by Chinese consumers. Dole Asia Holdings has noted that fresh durians are among the fastest-growing fruits imported into China, creating substantial opportunities for Malaysian growers.</p>

            <p>Despite Russian President Vladimir Putin's announcement of an Easter truce in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Russian attacks were ongoing. Putin declared a 30-hour ceasefire, but Zelensky accused Moscow of attempting to create a false impression of a ceasefire while continuing offensive maneuvers. Zelensky said Ukraine would reciprocate a genuine and unconditional cessation of hostilities, and reiterated Ukraine's willingness to extend a truce beyond the proposed 30 hours, while emphasizing that Russia's actions must match its words given a history of broken promises. The UK Foreign Office urged Putin to demonstrate his seriousness about peace by ending the invasion entirely.</p>

The recent depreciation of the yen has boosted inbound tourism to Japan, increasing demand for this type of accommodation.

            <p>Eddy Massaad, CEO of Swiss Butter, credits the brand's success to its unique steak sauce and the company's resilience, stemming from its Lebanese origins. The original Beirut restaurant was destroyed in the 2020 Beirut blast, but reopened just 30 days later. Swiss Butter has since expanded, opening 10 restaurants in a year, including a London location. Massaad aims for 100 locations within five years, driven by a return to comfort food dining experiences. The restaurant's "secret" sauce, created by Massaad’s chef brother, contains 33 ingredients and has become its hallmark.</p>

The statue will be on display until February 2026 and is part of a broader effort to attract "anime pilgrims" to the area, following similar campaigns by local railway companies. These campaigns center around Tenryu Futamata Station, which served as a model for a location in the 2021 movie, and include Evangelion-themed trains and stamp rallies. The mayor hopes to partner with other locations with ties to the series, such as Hakone and Ube.</p>

            <p>The Indiana legislature has passed a bill to establish a commission to explore adjusting the state's border with Illinois, signaling the first step in a long-shot effort. This comes as some Illinois counties seek to separate from the Chicago area due to political differences, with the heavily Democratic Chicago area dominating the state government. However, any boundary change would require approval from the Illinois government and the U.S. Congress, which is unlikely given opposition from Illinois officials. Similar efforts are underway in eastern Oregon, where some counties want to join Idaho.</p>

            <p>Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has accused opponents of the UK's net-zero targets of spreading "nonsense and lies." He asserts the government will reinforce its environmental agenda, arguing that transitioning to green energy is crucial for social justice and national security. Miliband contends that reliance on fossil fuels led to market instability and price surges following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. While the UK is legally committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, critics argue the policy risks jobs in traditional industries. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has cautioned against bankrupting the country in pursuit of net zero.</p>

            <p>Chinese researchers have successfully detonated a hydrogen-based explosive device in a controlled field test, triggering devastating chemical chain reactions without using any nuclear materials. The 2kg bomb generated a fireball exceeding 1,000 degrees Celsius for over two seconds, using a magnesium-based solid-state hydrogen storage material. The device, developed by the China State Shipbuilding Corporation, uses magnesium hydride to release hydrogen gas, which then ignites into a sustained inferno. This technology could have implications for both civilian and military applications.</p>
