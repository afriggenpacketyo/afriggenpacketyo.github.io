          <p>An opinion piece suggests that eliminating taxes on overtime pay could significantly benefit Republicans in the midterm elections by appealing to working-class voters. The author recounts anecdotes of workers expressing strong support for tax-free overtime, arguing that it would provide a tangible financial benefit and encourage productivity. The article contrasts this with tax cuts on tips, which primarily benefit those in stepping-stone jobs, while overtime pay impacts millions in family-sustaining positions. It concludes that Republicans who champion tax-free overtime could gain substantial political capital.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece discusses the case of a brain-dead pregnant woman in Georgia being kept on life support due to state law, highlighting the issue of reproductive control over women's bodies. The author argues that this situation reflects a broader effort to reduce women to their reproductive capacity, citing draconian laws and pronatalism. The piece also emphasizes the disproportionate impact on Black women, who face higher risks during childbirth and have a history of gynecological experimentation. The author concludes that a person’s agency should be respected whether they’re conscious or not.</p>
