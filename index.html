Liu, who had voluntarily signed up and been assigned to an armed police force, repeatedly requested to leave after joining the army. As a result, he is now banned from civil service, state-owned enterprises, overseas travel for two years, and faces a fine of 38,000 yuan (US$5,300). The penalties are intended to emphasize the importance of military service and deter others from dodging their obligations.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept across northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, causing near-zero visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue warnings. The storm, which created a dramatic scene in Chicago, was caused by strong winds lifting dry soil from parched farmland. This event marked the first time the Weather Service office in Romeoville had issued a dust storm warning for Chicago. The article notes that similar conditions led to a deadly 72-vehicle pileup in 2023, and the current storm is considered unusual due to the extreme dryness of the soil in the region.</p>

          <p>The UK's Eurovision entry, Remember Monday, finished in 19th place despite strong vocals and staging. The article suggests that the song itself, a mix of musical styles, may have been the reason for the poor result. While the professional juries recognized the clever British touches, the song may have been too busy for viewers. The staging was well-executed but lacked the scale of other performances. The article concludes that the UK laid good foundations and should not be too down on its chances at Eurovision in the future.</p>

Walmart had warned that prices on various items, including bananas and car seats, could increase despite softened tariffs on China. Trump insisted that foreign producers and retailers should absorb the additional expenses to maintain his economic agenda, which aims to create more domestic manufacturing jobs.

While Gove does not believe another referendum is currently necessary, he cautioned against complacency and emphasized the importance of demonstrating that the UK union is working. Gove's comments align with SNP leader John Swinney's call for "demonstrable support" for independence, akin to the 1997 referendum for a Scottish parliament.

          <p>A recent Kyodo News survey reveals that 81% of people in Japan feel "more uneasy than hopeful" about U.S. President Donald Trump's second term, primarily due to concerns about the impact of tariffs. The survey, conducted between March and April, indicates that 42% of respondents cited the threat tariffs pose to free trade as a reason for their unease. Despite this, some respondents praised Trump's leadership and his stance against China. The survey also shows a slight decrease in the proportion of people prioritizing relations with the United States over China.</p>

          <p>The UK and EU are negotiating key points before their first bilateral summit since Brexit, focusing on defence deals, trade barriers, and mobility. The UK is taking a sector-by-sector approach to try reduce costly trade barriers with the EU. Many EU-UK negotiating hours have gone into agreeing a plant and animal health deal, known as an SPS agreement. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hopes for a reset of relations, but faces challenges due to red lines and Eurosceptic sentiment. A youth mobility scheme, allowing young EU citizens to work in the UK, is also under discussion.</p>
