This strategic shift has positioned Huawei as a major competitor to American chip leader Nvidia, particularly within China and emerging markets.</p>

          <p>Financial analysts are increasingly viewing the Singapore dollar (SGD) as a quasi-safe-haven currency, particularly within Asia, due to Singapore's strong institutional framework and stable policymaking. While it exhibits defensive traits during market turbulence, its path to global status like the U.S. dollar or Swiss franc is hindered by its smaller market size and managed exchange rate policy. Experts believe that while it may not be the next primary safe haven, it serves as an important diversification tool for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An execution date of August 19 has been set for Kayle Bates, a 67-year-old man on Florida's death row.

          <p>Canada is currently experiencing its most severe measles outbreak since the disease was declared eliminated in 1998, with case numbers significantly higher than in the United States. The surge, centered in provinces like Alberta and Ontario, is primarily attributed to low vaccination rates and rising vaccine hesitancy, particularly within some close-knit communities. Public health officials are struggling to contain the spread of the highly contagious virus and stress the importance of the MMR vaccine.</p>

          <h2>Market Analyst Argues for Stock Market Optimism Despite Looming Tariff Deadlines</h2>

          <p>Financial commentator Jim Cramer argues that despite fears over looming tariff deadlines, there are ten key factors buoying the stock market. He points to strong corporate earnings, substantial economic stimulus from tax cuts in the "big beautiful bill," and massive investment in infrastructure like data centers and the electric grid. Cramer suggests these pro-business conditions have created a strong foundation for the economy that outweighs the risks of trade disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is reviving the Pensions Commission to address a looming retirement savings crisis, as new analysis warns that future pensioners could be worse off than today's. The Department for Work and Pensions found that nearly half of working-age adults, particularly the self-employed and low earners, are not saving into a private pension. The commission will aim to build a national consensus on how to boost private pension savings and avoid future hardship.</p>

          <p>A new CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that public support for President Trump's deportation program has fallen to a net-negative rating. A majority of Americans now believe the administration is not prioritizing dangerous criminals for deportation and want the government to focus more on lowering prices and inflation. The poll suggests that while the president's base remains supportive, the broader public has growing doubts about his administration's priorities and policies.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' struggles continued as they were swept by the Milwaukee Brewers, losing 6-5 and extending their losing skid to 10 of their last 12 games. The defeat was compounded by an injury to star first baseman Freddie Freeman, who suffered a left wrist contusion after being hit by a pitch. While X-rays were negative, the injury adds to the frustration for the slumping team, which has been outscored 71-36 during the downturn.</p>
