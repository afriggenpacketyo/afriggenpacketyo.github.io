          <p>Germany's government is proposing a "Bau-Turbo" law to expedite housing construction and combat a severe shortage of affordable homes. The legislation aims to streamline approval processes and reduce bureaucracy, potentially saving billions of euros annually. While the construction industry welcomes the move as an opportunity, critics and environmentalists express concerns about rushed projects and the loss of green spaces, questioning if it will be an effective short-term solution.</p>

          <p>Elbridge Colby, a high-ranking Pentagon official, is championing a strategic shift to prioritize countering China, even at the expense of U.S. commitments in other regions like Europe and the Middle East. This "America First" national security approach has made him a divisive figure, drawing both praise from some within the Trump administration and criticism from traditional GOP hawks and allies. His evolving strategy reflects a belief that the U.S. is unprepared for a potential conflict with Beijing and must consolidate its resources to deter it.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, a pastor who fled religious persecution in Iran expresses his shock and fear over the current U.S. immigration enforcement tactics, which he says remind him of Tehran's regime. He describes how members of his Farsi-speaking Christian congregation in Los Angeles, who are seeking asylum, have been detained by masked officers and face deportation to a country where their faith could get them killed. The pastor pleads for a more merciful approach, highlighting the terror felt by his community.</p>

The virus has impacted over 75% of the state's dairy farms since 2024, leading to sick cattle and reduced output. While the dairy industry says the aid is crucial for survival, advocacy groups argue the subsidies support industrial-scale operations that may contribute to the spread of such diseases.</p>
