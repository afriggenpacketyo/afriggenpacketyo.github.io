          <p>England wing Immanuel Feyi-Waboso is set to make his comeback against a France XV on Saturday after a six-month absence due to a dislocated shoulder sustained in December. Bath flankers Ted Hill and Guy Pepper will also start, following their contributions to Bath's Premiership final victory over Leicester. Joe Carpenter will play at full-back, and Seb Atkinson will be at 12, both awaiting their first cap, though the match isn't classified as a Test. George Ford and Jamie George will co-captain the side, while Alex Coles earns a spot in the second row after last appearing for England last summer.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts say high-yield savings accounts can still be worthwhile in the current economic climate, offering considerably better returns than traditional savings accounts. They are particularly useful for short-term financial goals and emergency funds, providing safety and liquidity. While interest rates on these accounts fluctuate with the Federal Reserve's rate, they remain competitive, with some still offering rates of 4% or higher. However, these accounts should not replace long-term investments like stocks, which offer higher potential growth, and certificates of deposit (CDs) may be considered as an alternative for short-term savings, though they require funds to be locked up for a set term (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights, Michael O'Flaherty, has raised concerns with Germany's Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt regarding the handling of protests related to the conflict in Gaza. O'Flaherty cited reports of excessive force used by police against demonstrators, including minors, emphasizing that law enforcement must adhere to principles of non-discrimination, legality, necessity, and proportionality. The commissioner also addressed restrictions on events and symbols, noting that governments have limited grounds to restrict political speech unless it incites violence.

          <p>International calls for restraint appear to be ignored as tensions intensify between Iran and Israel, with the world watching to see if the U.S., under President Trump, will directly intervene with military strikes on Iran. The Kremlin warned that U.S. intervention would trigger a "terrible spiral of escalation," while Russia expressed concerns about nuclear catastrophe. Germany's chancellor stated Israel was doing the "dirty work" for other countries by striking Iran's nuclear sites. Trump remained noncommittal about potential U.S. attacks, stating that the next week would be "big" and he would make a final decision at the last possible moment.</p>

          <p>More individuals filing for bankruptcy are burdened by retail credit card debt, exacerbated by record-high interest rates. Store credit cards typically carry higher interest rates due to the perceived risk associated with cardholders' lower credit scores. These rates reached an all-time high of 30.45% in September, following banks' anticipation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau capping credit card late fees, a measure that ultimately did not take effect. The proportion of bankruptcy filings involving retail credit card debt has risen faster than overall new filings since 2021, indicating the increasing financial strain on consumers (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Retirement experts caution seniors to carefully consider annuities, as economic uncertainties heighten concerns about retirement security. Common mistakes include not understanding fees, such as surrender charges and withdrawal penalties, and choosing the wrong type of annuity for their needs. Immediate annuities are best for guaranteed income now, while indexed annuities offer growth with downside protection, and fixed annuities suit those wanting predictable, conservative growth. Failing to designate a beneficiary can prevent benefits from passing to loved ones, and withdrawing excessive funds early can trigger fees and reduce future income (not investment advice).</p>

The lawsuit alleges the policy unconstitutionally discriminates against U.S. citizens, particularly those from out-of-state.

          <p>This article reflects on the hollowness of Juneteenth as a federal holiday, arguing that it has become an instance of hypocrisy amidst a national retreat from racial egalitarianism. The author notes that after a brief period of optimism following George Floyd's death, the country has moved further away from racial justice. Policies and structures that made progress possible are being dismantled, with attacks on affirmative action, civil rights protections, and voting rights. The author suggests that the Democratic Party underestimated the backlash against racial progress, leaving Juneteenth as a symbolic gesture amidst a broader erosion of racial equality.</p>

          <p>India's aspirations for global leadership are being challenged by strained relationships and instability in South Asia, testing its Neighborhood First policy. While India aims to be a top power on the international stage, its focus on outward relationships with the US, Europe, and East Asia has led to neglect of its regional neighbors. Economic instability and political fragility threaten South Asia, with countries like Afghanistan, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh facing significant challenges. China is expanding its influence in the region, highlighting the need for India to foster closer ties with its neighbors to achieve sustainable growth and security.</p>

          <p>The future of HPV vaccination in the U.S. is uncertain after the dismissal of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the appointment of new members, some of whom have spread misinformation about vaccines. The ACIP was expected to vote on whether to recommend a single dose of the HPV vaccine and to strengthen recommendations for vaccination starting at age 9. The HPV vaccine is highly effective in preventing infection and disease, but uptake in the U.S. is lower than desired. The new ACIP may soften existing guidelines or remove vaccine recommendations, potentially impacting insurance coverage and healthcare provider practices.</p>

          <p>Afghan refugees in Iran are facing increased danger due to intensifying Israeli strikes, leaving them trapped in a country that is no longer safe, with no viable option to return home.

Millions of Afghans who sought refuge in Iran now face renewed uncertainty and pressure from officials. Refugees are experiencing restrictions on movement, harassment, and abuse, with some already killed in strikes.

          <p>Hurricane Erick made landfall in Mexico's western state of Oaxaca early Thursday as a Category 3 storm, with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph. The storm threaded the needle between the resorts of Acapulco and Puerto Escondido, tearing into a sparsely populated stretch of coastline. The storm is expected to rapidly weaken as it moves inland and is likely to dissipate late Thursday or early Friday. President Claudia Sheinbaum said all activities in the region were suspended, and people were urged to stay in their homes or move to shelters.</p>

          <p>An additional 2.7 million households in Britain will receive Â£150 off their energy bills this winter as the government changes the rules for the Warm Home Discount. The qualification about property size, type, and home energy score is being scrapped, benefiting almost a million households with children. The cost of expanding the Warm Home Discount will be covered by energy companies and could potentially be passed on through the standing charge, though the government says any rise will be offset by savings made by cutting energy companies' expenditure and addressing problem debt. Debt charities and energy groups have welcomed the move.</p>
