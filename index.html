          <p>New estimates from The Senior Citizens League and policy analyst Mary Johnson suggest that Social Security beneficiaries could see a 2.5% increase in their benefits in 2026, mirroring the adjustment made in 2025. This cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) aims to help monthly checks keep pace with inflation, with the official change announced by the Social Security Administration in October based on third-quarter inflation data. The estimate is subject to change, with potential impacts from President Trump's tariff policies, though recent consumer price index data showed limited impact from these policies. A 2.5% COLA increase would be considered about average, according to Johnson. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Harvey Weinstein was convicted on one count of engaging in a criminal sex act but acquitted on a second count in his sex crimes retrial in New York, involving accusations from Mimi Haley and Kaja Sokola, respectively. The Manhattan jury was unable to reach a verdict on the third count of sexual assault involving Jessica Mann, and will resume deliberations on Thursday. Weinstein, 73, pleaded not guilty and has maintained that his sexual encounters were consensual, with the defense arguing the women used him for connections. The retrial occurred after Weinstein's initial 2020 conviction was overturned on appeal.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government's budget deficit increased to $316 billion in May, bringing the year-to-date total to $1.36 trillion, which is 14% higher than the previous year.

While tax revenue rose 15% in May and is up 6% annually, expenditures increased 2% monthly and 8% from a year ago.

          <p>An uneasy calm settled over Los Angeles after a night of curfew, with nearly 400 people arrested following protests against U.S. President Donald Trump's immigration raids. The Los Angeles Police Department reported arrests for failure to disperse, curfew violations, and assault, while federal prosecutors charged two men for throwing Molotov cocktails at police officers. National Guard troops and Marines have been deployed to assist in quelling the unrest, sparking a political clash between Trump and California Governor Gavin Newsom, who accuses the president of an "assault" on democracy.

          <p>Senate Democrats are requesting details about a multibillion-dollar transaction involving the Trump family's crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, and a pool of investors, including foreign nationals. Senators Warren and Merkley have raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, particularly regarding the launch of a stablecoin tied to a sitting President. The senators are seeking financial records related to a $2 billion investment in World Liberty by MGX, an Emirati firm, and the involvement of Binance, a major crypto exchange. The increased scrutiny comes as the Senate prepares to vote on the GENIUS Act, which would establish a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>R&B singer R. Kelly's attorneys have filed an urgent request for his release from federal prison, alleging a serious threat to his life. The motion claims that three Bureau of Prisons officials attempted to recruit another inmate to murder Kelly, who is serving concurrent 30- and 20-year prison terms for racketeering, child sexual exploitation, and sex trafficking. The claim includes a sworn statement from a terminally ill inmate, Mikeal Glenn Stine, who alleges he was offered a chance to escape custody in exchange for assassinating Kelly. Kelly's attorneys argue that his continued incarceration while his life is in jeopardy constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 42 state attorneys general, led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, is urging Meta to address the rise of investment scams on Facebook. The scams fraudulently use images of famous figures like Warren Buffett to lure retail investors into pump-and-dump schemes. The attorneys general argue that Meta's review systems are consistently evaded by criminals, resulting in millions of dollars in losses for users. James emphasized the need for Meta to step up its review of ads to prevent these fraudulent activities. (not investment advice)</p>
