          <h2>Treasury Secretary Predicts Trade War De-Escalation with China</h2>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated at a private investor summit that he anticipates a "de-escalation" in the trade war between the U.S. and China in the near future, citing the unsustainability of current tariff levels. Bessent's remarks, made during a closed-door meeting, led to a surge in stock prices as markets reacted positively to the prospect of easing tensions between the two economic superpowers. He believes this potential de-escalation would provide relief to global markets, which have been strained by the ongoing trade disputes. This news suggests a potential shift in the U.S. trade strategy, aiming for a more stable economic relationship with China.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, a recent Morgan Stanley survey reveals that American consumers remain loyal to the iPhone, with high upgrade intention rates and strong adoption of Apple Intelligence. The survey suggests that Apple's software and hardware advancements could accelerate device replacement cycles and create incremental services revenue opportunities, even amidst tariff uncertainty. Apple is actively diversifying its supply chain, including increasing production in India and airlifting iPhones to the U.S., to mitigate tariff risks. However, analysts caution that these efforts may not fully offset the potential impact of tariffs, especially if the Trump administration insists on domestic manufacturing.

          <p>A recent CNBC survey indicates that nearly half of Americans hold a negative view of Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk, with concerns that Musk's political activities are alienating potential buyers. The survey highlights a polarization, with Democrats and independents viewing Musk negatively, while Republicans hold a more positive view. Interestingly, many potential EV customers are more positive about electric vehicles in general than they are about Tesla specifically. This suggests that Tesla's brand image may be hindering its ability to capitalize on the growing demand for electric vehicles.</p>

The agreement, already drafted, faces potential disruption if Trump imposes tariffs on pharmaceuticals, a major UK export.

Critics argue that this change could increase Medicare spending and raise drug prices, while supporters contend that it could encourage investment in small-molecule drug development.

          <p>The Supreme Court justices seemed inclined to grant parents a constitutional right to opt their children out of public school lessons that conflict with their religious beliefs, particularly regarding "LGBTQ-inclusive" storybooks in Montgomery County, Maryland. The case, Mahmoud vs. Taylor, centers on whether schools can require students to participate in lessons on gender and sexuality that violate families' religious views. The conservative justices raised concerns about the school board's decision to revoke opt-out options, suggesting a potential extension of religious liberty rights to parents with children in public schools. Nearly every state has laws allowing parents to opt out of sex education classes, which raises the question of whether these books fall under the same category.</p>

          <p>The case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man mistakenly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, raises questions about due process and government overreach. While the government claims Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang and a terrorist, evidence linking him to violent crimes remains thin. The administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to bypass legal protections for immigrants has drawn criticism. The core issue is whether the government can bypass due process rights, even for illegal immigrants, and whether it must rectify its error in sending Abrego Garcia to a potentially unsafe prison.</p>

A broader economic recession combined with the U.S.-China trade tensions could further reduce Meta's advertising revenues.
