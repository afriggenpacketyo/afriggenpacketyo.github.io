          <p>President Trump is standing by his claim that U.S. strikes "obliterated" Iran's nuclear sites, despite a preliminary intelligence report suggesting the damage only set back Tehran's program by a few months. Trump defended his description at the NATO summit, stating that Israel is preparing a report that will support his assessment. He also asserted that Iran was unable to move its uranium stockpile before the strikes. Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth echoed Trump's claims, asserting that the Iranian nuclear program is obliterated based on the devastation underneath the Fordo facility. The article discusses the controversy surrounding Trump's statements, contrasting them with initial intelligence assessments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to resume distributing funds for EV chargers to 14 states, challenging the administration's pause on the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program. The judge granted a preliminary injunction, stating that the administration's actions disrupted projects already underway and hindered states' ability to meet carbon emission targets. The Department of Transportation stated they will assess legal options, arguing the Biden-Buttigieg NEVI program guidance was a disaster. The ruling highlights the separation of powers, as the funds were allocated by Congress and should be administered by the executive branch, not withheld based on policy preferences.</p>

          <p>NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte referred to President Trump as "Daddy" during a NATO summit, following Trump's use of strong language regarding the Israel-Iran conflict.

Trump responded positively to the nickname, interpreting it as affectionate. Rutte defended his use of the term, praising Trump and describing him as a "good friend", also giving praise to Trump's decision to strike Iran and the ceasefire.</p>

Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, is accused of transporting migrants without legal status, charges he denies. The judge questioned the merits of the smuggling claims, but acknowledged that Abrego Garcia will likely be deported, highlighting the complexities of immigration enforcement.</p>

Mamdani's victory has raised concerns about the potential impact on the profit profile of multi-family rental properties. Analysts have estimated that a significant portion of Flagstar's multi-family loan portfolio is exposed to New York rent regulations. (not investment advice)</p>
