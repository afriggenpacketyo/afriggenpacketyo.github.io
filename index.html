        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In her new memoir, "107 Days," Kamala Harris reflects on her 2024 presidential campaign, attributing her loss in part to insufficient time and friction with then-President Joe Biden's staff. She recounts a distracting pre-debate phone call from Biden, which she felt was self-serving and rattled her moments before facing Donald Trump. The book also reveals her first choice for a running mate was Pete Buttigieg and details her vetting process for other candidates, as well as her regret over a damaging gaffe made during an appearance on "The View."</p>

          <p>After nearly six years of imprisonment, British-Egyptian pro-democracy activist and blogger Alaa Abdel Fattah has been freed and reunited with his family following a presidential pardon in Egypt. His release was reportedly prompted by a request from the National Council for Human Rights, citing humanitarian concerns. Abdel Fattah, a key figure in the 2011 uprising, was serving a five-year sentence for "spreading false news," a conviction widely condemned by international human rights organizations as politically motivated.</p>

          <p>This opinion article analyzes Europe's struggle to define its foreign policy towards China, having historically followed Washington's lead but now facing an unpredictable United States. The author argues that Europe is caught between competing pressures, needing to de-risk its economy from Chinese overcapacity while also relying on Chinese green technology for its climate goals. With the war in Ukraine serving as a core security interest, China's alignment with Russia further complicates Europe's strategic calculus, leaving it without an easy path forward.</p>

          <p>Zheng Yongnian, a prominent academic at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, is urging China to develop its own unique foreign relations knowledge system, distinct from dominant Western concepts like realism and liberalism. He argues that for too long, China's global role has been interpreted through a Western lens, and a new, China-centric framework is needed to more effectively articulate its foreign policy. This call aligns with Beijing's broader push for greater intellectual autonomy and global influence.</p>

          <p>The Detroit Lions defeated the Baltimore Ravens 38-30 in a Monday night upset, driven by a powerful rushing attack and a stifling defense that sacked quarterback Lamar Jackson seven times. Detroit's offense controlled the game with long, methodical drives, outrushing Baltimore 224 to 85 yards. Running backs Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery each contributed two touchdowns, sealing a significant road win for the Lions and handing the Ravens a rare primetime loss on their home field.</p>

          <p>Disney has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to the air, nearly a week after the late-night show was suspended following comments Kimmel made about the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The company stated the initial suspension was to avoid inflaming a tense situation, but after "thoughtful conversations" with Kimmel, the decision was made to bring the show back. The incident had sparked a national debate on free speech, drawing criticism from Hollywood figures and First Amendment advocates.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a landmark case that could reshape the president's authority over independent federal agencies, after temporarily allowing President Trump to fire a commissioner from the Federal Trade Commission. The court will reconsider a nearly century-old legal precedent, Humphrey's Executor, which has historically shielded such agencies from direct presidential control and partisan interference. The outcome could significantly alter the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches.</p>

          <p>Following the White House's announcement regarding acetaminophen and autism, medical professionals and researchers have strongly pushed back, labeling the claims as irresponsible and based on "cherry-picked" scientific data. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists reiterated that acetaminophen remains one of the only safe pain relievers for pregnant women. Experts also warned that untreated fever during pregnancy poses known health risks to a fetus, making the administration's advice potentially harmful and confusing for expecting parents.</p>
