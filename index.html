          <p>This article outlines three significant errors savers should avoid when managing Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts, especially with a potential Federal Reserve rate cut looming. The primary mistakes include spending too much time shopping for the highest rate and missing the current peak, failing to monitor the changing rate climate, and allowing existing CDs to automatically roll over into new accounts with likely lower returns. By avoiding these pitfalls, savers can better protect and maximize their earnings in a shifting economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article details three primary ways Americans can inadvertently lose or have their Social Security benefits reduced, a critical issue for the millions who rely on this income for retirement. The key scenarios include earning above a certain limit while claiming benefits before full retirement age, having benefits garnished to pay federal debts like taxes or student loans, and no longer meeting specific eligibility requirements, such as a change in marital status for those receiving spousal benefits. It also suggests alternative income strategies like annuities to ensure financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Thomas Massie has filed a discharge petition in an attempt to compel a full House vote on legislation requiring the Justice Department to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein. This procedural move, which requires 218 signatures, aims to bypass House leadership, who have been accused of stalling on the issue. The bipartisan effort, co-sponsored by Democrat Ro Khanna, reflects growing pressure from lawmakers and the public for greater transparency following the late sex offender's case and the DOJ's internal review.</p>

          <p>With only 14 legislative days remaining, U.S. lawmakers have returned to Capitol Hill facing a critical deadline to prevent a government shutdown as federal funding expires at the end of the month. A short-term funding bill is expected, but partisan divisions over spending levels and policy riders complicate negotiations. In addition to the fiscal cliff, Congress is also contending with other contentious issues, including the federalization of the D.C. National Guard, confirming presidential nominees, and the push to release the Jeffrey Epstein files.</p>

          <p>An international coalition of more than 85 climate scientists has published a comprehensive review criticizing a recent Department of Energy report on greenhouse gases as being "full of errors" and scientifically unsound. The experts argue the administration's report, which concluded that warming is less damaging than believed, cherry-picks data and misrepresents scientific literature to support a pro-fossil fuel agenda. This scientific rebuttal is part of a growing trend where experts are independently countering what they perceive as misinformation from government agencies.</p>

Furthermore, mortgage rates are influenced by multiple factors beyond the Fed's policy, including the performance of the 10-year Treasury yield, which means a single cut may have a muted effect on borrowing costs.

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has criticized the new 39% tariff imposed by the U.S. on various Swiss imports, labeling the duties as "exorbitantly high." Speaking alongside Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter, Merz stated that while Germany would not directly intervene, the European Union and Switzerland share "aligned interests" in reducing the tariffs. The Swiss President acknowledged that as a non-EU member, Switzerland is ultimately responsible for resolving the issue itself, highlighting the complexities of navigating U.S. trade policy.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa has announced that she will not seek a third term in 2026, a decision that will open up a key Senate seat in the upcoming midterm elections. Ernst, who was the first female combat veteran to serve in the Senate, stated that her choice was made after extensive prayer and reflection. Her retirement sets the stage for what is expected to be a competitive race, though Democrats will face a challenge in a state that has trended strongly Republican in recent years.</p>

          <p>The highly anticipated transfer of Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi to Liverpool fell through on deadline day despite a club-to-club agreement being reached. The deal collapsed because Palace was unable to secure a suitable replacement defender in time, forcing them to pull out of the arrangement just hours before the deadline. While a setback for Guehi, his status as an England international with just one year left on his contract means he can sign with a new club as a free agent next summer, likely securing a more lucrative deal.</p>

The split separates the company's sauces and shelf-stable meals from its North American staples like Oscar Mayer, as the business continues to struggle with changing consumer tastes.
