          <p>Activists planning to sail an aid ship to Gaza reported that their vessel, The Conscience, was attacked by drones in international waters off the coast of Malta, with the activists seemingly accusing Israel of being behind the attack. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, which organized the ship, said the attack occurred early Friday, causing a fire and power loss. Maltese authorities confirmed a fire onboard and stated that it was brought under control with no casualties, though the number of activists onboard varies between reports. The NGO has called for Israeli ambassadors to be summoned to answer for the alleged violation of international law. Optimism score is 30.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK party achieved a narrow victory in a parliamentary special election in Runcorn and Helsby, signaling a potential shift in British politics towards a more polarized, multi-party system. Sarah Pochin of Reform won by a mere six votes, seizing a seat previously held by Labour. The victory highlights growing voter frustration with both the Labour and Conservative parties, fueled by economic dissatisfaction and tensions over immigration, particularly concerning the housing of migrants in local hotels. The article indicates that Reform's gains could significantly impact Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party and further weaken the Conservatives. Optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>This article argues that modern society continues to exploit horses through dangerous and violent racing practices, despite the historical debt humanity owes them. The author, reflecting on their past involvement in the racing world, expresses a sense of wrongness about the brutal reality of American racing, where horses are routinely run to death for profit and entertainment. The article criticizes the racing industry's claims of improved safety measures as insufficient and calls for an end to the sport, advocating for a more empathetic and decent treatment of horses. The author illustrates how the horse's contributions are often dismissed, emphasizing the need to recognize the animal's sacrifices. Optimism score is 20.</p>

          <p>Marks & Spencer (M&S) is working "day and night" to manage a cyber attack that has forced the temporary shutdown of its online operations.
