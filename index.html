          <p>Leicester City is under investigation by an independent commission after allegedly breaching financial regulations during their time in the Championship in the 2023-24 season, according to the article. The Premier League initially couldn't punish the Foxes for breaching profit and sustainability rules in the 2022-23 season due to their relegation. The commission will also assess alleged failures to provide accounts and cooperate with Premier League inquiries. Leicester intends to cooperate with the investigation now that the Premier League's jurisdiction has been established. This follows their relegation to the Championship for the second time in three years.</p>

          <p>Yuri Grigorovich, a renowned Russian ballet choreographer and artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet from 1964 to 1995, has died at the age of 98, as reported in the article. He is celebrated as one of the greatest choreographers of the 20th century, revitalizing male dance and redefining Soviet ballet with productions like Ivan the Terrible and Romeo and Juliet. Grigorovich's departure from the Bolshoi in 1995, amid contract disputes, led to an unprecedented dancers' strike in the theatre's history. His work was deeply rooted in classical ballet traditions, influenced by his uncle, Georgy Rozai, who studied under Vaslav Nijinsky.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration considered acquiring a luxury Boeing 747-8 from Qatar to serve as Air Force One while awaiting delayed Boeing projects, according to the New York Times article. The idea evolved from a potential purchase to a proposed gift from Qatar, raising ethical concerns and questions about long-term financial sense. The plane, once used by the Qatari royal family, was shown to Trump in Florida, leading to intense acquisition talks. However, retrofitting the plane for presidential use would be costly and time-consuming, potentially delaying its availability beyond Trump's term, raising questions about the feasibility and purpose of the deal.</p>

Migration expert Benjamin Etzold believes the recent election campaign debate was too heated and focused on Germany's perspective, ignoring the global dimension of displacement. The report also slams Chancellor Friedrich Merz's plans to tighten border controls, arguing that such measures are often ineffective and drive migrants to more dangerous routes, benefiting human traffickers.

The ruling lifts a hold placed by a California judge that kept Temporary Protected Status (TPS) in place for Venezuelans, despite the initial TPS grant in 2021 due to humanitarian crises in Venezuela. The Trump administration wanted to end protections and work permits for migrants with TPS in April 2025, more than a year before they were originally supposed to end in October 2026.

          <p>This Fox News opinion piece argues that Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump share ideological similarities, despite stylistic differences. Both men positioned themselves against the political establishment and embraced conservative ideas centered on the individual. Reagan, like Trump, challenged the status quo, advocating for policies such as tax cuts, a strong national defense, and pro-life stances. The author contends that both leaders resonated with blue-collar voters and possessed a strong sense of humor, while emphasizing their commitment to acting on conservative principles. The article suggests that the Republican Party has embraced a cluster of issues brought forth by Reagan and pursued by Trump, all centered on the importance of the individual.</p>

          <p>A Texas showerhead salesman's experiment revealed the challenges for 'Made in the USA' products, as customers overwhelmingly chose cheaper, imported options, according to the article. Despite President Trump's efforts to encourage domestic manufacturing through tariffs, customers showed little interest in paying more for domestic versions. The experiment highlights the difficulty in competing with lower-priced imports and the struggles faced by companies trying to manufacture in the U.S. The uncertainty surrounding trade policies further complicates planning for business owners, making it difficult to prioritize domestic manufacturing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's imposition of sweeping tariffs on imports, collecting these taxes has proven difficult due to overwhelmed and understaffed federal agencies, according to the article. Experts say exporters are becoming more adept at evading tariffs, particularly through practices like transshipping, where products are routed through third countries. The lack of resources at U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) further complicates enforcement, especially with the new tariff on low-value packages from Chinese e-commerce platforms. Business owners have proposed legislation to fund a DOJ task force to prosecute trade fraud cases, but face challenges amid government-wide hiring freezes and budget cuts.</p>

          <p>NASA engineers successfully revived a primary roll thruster on Voyager 1 after it had been dormant for two decades, averting a potential loss of contact with the spacecraft, the article reports. The decision to revisit the primary thrusters came as the backup system showed signs of potential failure, with concerns about fuel line residue buildup. With a critical ground-based radio antenna scheduled to go offline for upgrades, engineers risked activating the dormant thruster, despite the potential for a catastrophic explosion. The successful test ensures the spacecraft's antenna remains pointed at Earth, extending its operational lifespan, as the Voyager team aims to celebrate the spacecraft's 50th anniversary in 2027.</p>

          <p>Israel has recovered thousands of documents and personal effects belonging to Eli Cohen, a famous Israeli spy executed in Syria in 1965, according to the New York Times article. The trove includes documents, photographs, and handwritten letters from Cohen's time undercover in Syria. The Mossad worked with an allied foreign government to retrieve the archives. The announcement comes after President Trump's meeting with the president of Syria, Ahmed al-Shara, in Saudi Arabia. While the goal of recovering Cohen's remains remains elusive, the recovered items were received as a unifying moment in Israel.</p>
