          <p>Google is hiring Varun Mohan, CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior R&D staff, in a significant move amid the escalating AI talent competition. The deal involves Google paying $2.4 billion for non-exclusive licensing of Windsurf's technology and for employee compensation, though it is not an acquisition of the company itself. This strategic hiring follows similar talent acquisitions by competitors like Microsoft and Meta and underscores the high value placed on specialized AI expertise in the tech industry. Windsurf will continue to operate independently under a new interim CEO.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's value surged to a new record, briefly exceeding $121,000, driven by substantial inflows into bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On a single day last week, these ETFs saw inflows of $1.18 billion, indicating strong institutional interest. Analysts suggest this momentum from long-term institutional buyers could propel the cryptocurrency's price even higher in the near future. The rally is also supported by the anticipation of clearer U.S. regulatory frameworks for digital assets, with Congress set to deliberate on new crypto-related bills. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June, surpassing forecasts, largely due to strong demand from non-U.S. markets like Southeast Asia and the European Union. A temporary tariff truce with the United States also helped slow the decline in shipments to America. While imports saw a modest 1.1% increase, this marked the first import growth of the year, signaling a potential shift in domestic demand. These figures highlight China's ongoing efforts to diversify its trade partners in response to U.S. tariff policies and ongoing economic negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union is navigating a period of intense economic pressure from both the United States and China. This week, EU trade ministers will formulate a response to President Trump's recent announcement of a 30% tariff on all EU-made goods. While France is pushing for strong countermeasures, the European Commission has indicated a desire to extend the suspension of retaliatory actions to allow for more negotiation. The situation underscores the EU's challenging position as it tries to maintain its economic stability while being caught between the world's two largest economies.</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 1.4% in the second quarter, narrowly avoiding a technical recession after contracting in the previous quarter. This growth was primarily driven by a strong performance in the manufacturing and construction sectors, beating economists' expectations. However, Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry remains cautious, highlighting significant uncertainty and downside risks in the global economy for the latter half of the year due to unclear U.S. tariff policies. The positive data comes ahead of an upcoming monetary policy decision by the nation's central bank. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australia is navigating a complex foreign policy challenge by strengthening its defense and maritime cooperation with the Philippines while managing its crucial trade relationship with China. As part of an expanding strategic partnership, Australia recently donated patrol boats to the Philippines and is doubling its investment in joint maritime security programs. This move reflects a shared motivation between Canberra and Manila to enhance regional security. Analysts note this diplomatic balancing act is crucial as Australia and the Philippines prepare to mark 80 years of diplomatic relations in 2026.</p>

          <p>A significant trend is emerging in Chinese higher education, with students increasingly choosing technology-focused fields like information technology and vehicle engineering for their university studies. This shift away from previously popular majors such as international trade reflects China's national push to bolster its technological capabilities amid intense competition with the United States. The state-driven system is funneling students into these strategic disciplines, which are seen as representing the future of industrial development and offering strong career prospects. This change is reshaping the landscape of academic priorities for a new generation.</p>

          <p>According to Kwon Ping Ho, founder of the Banyan Group luxury hotel chain, the modern tourist is vastly different from those of 30 years ago. He observes that younger travelers, already jaded with conventional tourism, are seeking deeper, more authentic experiences that involve interaction with local communities rather than just sightseeing. Ho also notes a shift toward "rainbow tourism," with a more diverse, multi-directional flow of travelers from developing nations. This evolution demands that the hospitality industry move beyond one-size-fits-all offerings to provide more creative and personalized travel opportunities.</p>

Since July 14, 1795, observers have manually recorded data, a tradition that continues today alongside automated systems. This unbroken sequence provides an invaluable resource for climate science, documenting long-term changes and historic weather events like the "Night of the Big Wind" in 1839. The observatory also contributed to meteorology with the invention of the four-cup anemometer for measuring wind speed.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte following his announcement of a plan to send more defensive weapons, including Patriot missiles, to Ukraine. The strategy involves the U.S. selling weapons to European NATO allies, who would then transfer their existing, U.S.-made equipment to Kyiv more quickly. The meeting comes as bipartisan pressure grows in Congress for legislation that would impose heavy sanctions and tariffs on Russia and any countries supporting its war effort. This approach aims to bolster Ukraine's defense while also generating business for U.S. defense contractors.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced plans for a significant increase in France's defense spending, warning that European liberty faces its greatest threat since World War II. Citing a pivotal moment in geopolitics and the threat from "imperialist policies," Macron called for doubling the military budget by 2027, three years ahead of the original schedule. The proposal, which requires government approval, would raise the defense budget from €32 billion in 2017 to €64 billion. This move aligns with a broader NATO commitment to increase defense spending among member nations.</p>

Despite struggles from the bullpen and some slumping hitters, the Dodgers' potent offense ultimately secured the win.

          <p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, long admired by international populists for his "illiberal" playbook, is facing a significant political challenge at home. A new opposition party, Tisza, led by former government insider Peter Magyar, has gained substantial support by focusing on domestic issues like the poor state of hospitals and schools. While Orban has built his power by targeting migrants and LGBTQ rights, polls now show his Fidesz party trailing Tisza. This shift suggests his focus on culture wars may be losing traction against pressing concerns about corruption and a stagnating economy.</p>

Under an 81-year-old treaty, Mexico is required to send a certain amount of water from the Rio Grande to Texas, but it is currently in arrears. The Trump administration has threatened tariffs and sanctions if Mexico does not fulfill its obligations. Farmers in Chihuahua, Mexico, where reservoirs are at critically low levels, argue they cannot give what they don't have, while Texan farmers say they are being denied water that is rightfully theirs.</p>
