          <p>The United States has issued a warning based on "credible reports" that Hamas is planning an imminent attack on civilians in Gaza, which would constitute a serious violation of the current ceasefire agreement. The State Department has informed other guarantors of the peace deal, including Egypt and Qatar, and stated that protective measures will be taken if the attack proceeds. Hamas has denied the allegations, accusing Israel of supporting rival armed groups to destabilize the region as it attempts to reassert control. This development raises tensions amid the fragile truce, which has seen the release of hostages and prisoners.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has reportedly conducted a long-range drone strike on a major gas processing plant in Russia's Orenburg region, causing a fire and partial damage to the world's largest facility of its kind. This attack is part of Ukraine's broader strategy to disrupt Russia's energy infrastructure and limit its war funding. The strike follows a series of overnight drone exchanges, with Russia launching 62 drones at Ukraine and Ukrainian forces targeting southern Russian regions. Meanwhile, reports suggest Russian President Putin has moderated territorial demands in a call with President Trump, offering to exchange parts of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson for full control of Donetsk.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police are "actively" examining media reports alleging that Prince Andrew attempted to use his police protection detail to obtain personal information about his accuser, Virginia Giuffre. The claims suggest he asked an officer to investigate her shortly before a newspaper published a photo of their first meeting. This development comes as Andrew relinquishes his remaining titles, including Duke of York, following years of scandal related to his association with Jeffrey Epstein. Prince Andrew has consistently denied all allegations against him.</p>

          <p>In an act of open defiance, the Chinese unit of Dutch chipmaker Nexperia has instructed its employees to ignore directives from the company's headquarters in the Netherlands. A letter sent to staff asserted that Nexperia China is an "independent" entity and that workers should only follow orders from local management, effectively staging a corporate revolt. This move escalates a control dispute between the Dutch parent company and its Chinese owner, Wingtech Technology, which acquired Nexperia in 2019. The letter reassures employees that their salaries are paid locally and rejecting external instructions will not be a breach of contract.</p>

          <p>An Ohio man, Connor Weston, faces criminal charges after he disrupted a Wikipedia conference in New York City by storming the stage with a gun. He reportedly pointed the weapon at his head and the ceiling, threatening to kill himself while wearing a sign that identified him as a "non-offending pedophile." Conference organizers, including safety team member Richard Knipel, successfully tackled the man and disarmed him before police arrived, preventing any injuries. The incident led to the cancellation of the day's events, which resumed the following day, with organizers being praised for their heroic actions.</p>

          <p>Several major companies, including Accenture, Lufthansa, and Salesforce, have recently announced significant job cuts, publicly attributing the restructuring to the integration of artificial intelligence. However, some industry experts and academics are skeptical, suggesting that AI is being used as a "good excuse" or a "scapegoat" for traditional downsizing. Critics argue that many of these firms overhired during the pandemic and are now using the AI narrative to conceal miscalculations while conducting necessary market corrections. Research from Yale and the New York Fed indicates that AI has not yet caused widespread job disruption, with more firms using it for retraining than for layoffs.</p>

          <p>A long-running investigation, aided by secret filming from a 2016 BBC program, has resulted in the conviction of 14 individuals involved in a £28 million timeshare fraud. The scheme, run by a company called Sell My Timeshare (SMT), targeted over 3,500 elderly victims who were desperate to exit their timeshare contracts. Instead of helping them, the company used high-pressure tactics to sell them useless "credits," funding a lavish lifestyle for its owners. The man behind the operation, Mark Rowe, was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years, bringing a measure of justice to the victims nearly a decade after the initial exposé.</p>

          <p>Fred Done, the co-founder of betting company Betfred, has warned that all 1,287 of its UK shops could be forced to close if the government implements a significant tax hike on the gambling industry. He stated that such a move would jeopardize 7,500 jobs and represents the "biggest threat" he has seen in his 57-year career. The warning comes as Chancellor Rachel Reeves considers increasing taxes on betting firms, a proposal supported by former Prime Minister Gordon Brown to fund child poverty reduction. Done argues that higher taxes would eliminate profitability and push customers towards untaxed offshore betting sites. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>North Korea is actively pursuing stronger relationships in Southeast Asia, highlighted by high-level visits from Vietnamese and Laotian leaders to Pyongyang for the 80th anniversary of its ruling party. The visit by Vietnam's Communist Party General Secretary, To Lam, was the first by a Vietnamese leader in 18 years and resulted in agreements to boost cooperation in defense and healthcare. Analysts view these engagements as a diplomatic win for the isolated and heavily-sanctioned North Korean regime. These relationships may also provide Pyongyang with corridors to bypass international sanctions, with Laos reportedly allowing North Korean laborers to work in the country.</p>

          <p>Over the past four decades, China has made significant progress in combating desertification at the Baijitan National Nature Reserve in Ningxia, a frontline against the advancing Mu Us Desert. Through extensive sand control and afforestation efforts covering over 45,000 hectares, the reserve has pushed the desert back by more than 20 kilometers. This has protected the regional capital of Yinchuan and vital agricultural lands along the Yellow River. The project has stabilized vast areas of drifting sands, reducing the desert's total size in the region from nearly 108,000 hectares to just over 1,300 hectares preserved for research.</p>

          <p>Despite a significant summer spending spree, Liverpool's recent struggles may be linked to the departure of right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold to Real Madrid. An analysis of their play shows the team is missing his unique on-ball quality, particularly his ability to use his weaker foot and execute long, switching passes to break down defensive presses. Current right-back options have been less effective in building play through the center, forcing creative midfielders like Florian Wirtz to drop deeper and away from more impactful attacking positions. The team's rate of switching play has fallen dramatically, making them more predictable and easier to defend against.</p>

          <p>It is common for sexual frequency and desire to decrease in long-term relationships, a phenomenon driven by both psychological and hormonal changes. According to therapists, the initial passion fueled by certain hormones gives way to the hormone oxytocin, which promotes bonding but can dampen sex drive. For heterosexual women, a "gender orgasm gap" and a tendency for their pleasure to be deprioritized can also lead to reduced desire over time. Experts emphasize that open communication about needs, maintaining non-sexual physical affection, and making dedicated time for intimacy are crucial for couples to navigate this normal relationship phase.</p>

          <p>A "No Kings Day" protest in downtown Los Angeles escalated on Saturday evening, leading police to declare an unlawful assembly and use tear gas and other nonlethal rounds to disperse crowds. Tensions flared near the Metropolitan Detention Center, a federal facility that has become a focus of anti-ICE sentiment. Demonstrators accused the LAPD of escalating the situation after what had been a peaceful day of citywide rallies against the Trump administration's policies. Police issued a dispersal order for the area, but as of late evening, no arrests had been reported in connection with the standoff.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As rising temperatures and extreme weather place the United Kingdom's native trees under significant stress, Forestry England has released a list of thirty species better suited to thrive in a future, warmer climate. The list includes familiar trees like oak and birch, as well as non-native species such as coast redwood and Corsican pine, to promote more diverse and resilient forests. Recent heatwaves have caused tree deaths, and experts warn that trees cannot naturally migrate or adapt quickly enough to the rapid pace of human-driven climate change. This strategy, known as assisted migration, aims to future-proof the nation's woodlands.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese President William Lai has announced plans to develop a "T-Dome," a sophisticated, multilayered air defense network to protect the island from potential missile and drone attacks by mainland China. The proposal, inspired by Israel's Iron Dome, aims to safeguard critical infrastructure and population centers using advanced technologies like AI. Lai pledged to accelerate its development with increased defense spending. However, the announcement reportedly surprised Taiwan's own defense establishment, as the project was not mentioned in the latest National Defence Report and has no funding allocated in the upcoming budget.</p>

          <p>Japan is reportedly on the verge of appointing its first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, after her ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) reached a coalition agreement with the opposition Japan Innovation Party. The alliance became necessary after the LDP's long-standing coalition with the Komeito party collapsed, throwing the nation into political turmoil. According to local media, the new coalition will ensure Takaichi receives enough votes in parliament to secure the premiership. The Japan Innovation Party is not expected to take cabinet positions initially but will support her leadership.</p>
