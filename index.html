          <p>A Senate committee report released one year after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump outlines significant security failures by the U.S. Secret Service. The investigation found a "disturbing pattern" of communication breakdowns and negligence, including unfulfilled requests for additional security resources like countersnipers prior to the Butler, Pennsylvania rally. The report, led by Senator Rand Paul, argues that the tragedy was preventable and criticizes the subsequent lack of accountability for the officials involved. It also accuses the former Secret Service director of providing false testimony to Congress.</p>

          <p>Years before a flash flood killed at least 27 children, many buildings at Camp Mystic in Texas were reportedly removed from official FEMA flood risk maps following successful appeals by the camp. According to media reports citing official records, the camp, located in a low-lying area, was initially designated as being at high risk in 2011. This re-designation likely allowed the camp to bypass stricter building regulations and flood insurance requirements. The revelations raise serious questions about the vulnerability of the camp and the regulatory processes preceding the tragedy.</p>

          <p>A Spanish government official has stated that recent violence between migrants and residents in the southeastern town of Torre Pacheco was fueled by far-right groups on social media. The unrest, which resulted in five minor injuries and one arrest, reportedly followed an attack on an elderly man. Officials said they detected online posts inciting a "hunt for migrants," leading to groups armed with batons roaming the streets.

          <p>Amid the geopolitical power struggle with China over rare earth metals, recycling electronic waste is emerging as a crucial strategy for the United States. Next-generation recycling companies are developing innovative ways to extract valuable materials like neodymium, gold, and copper from discarded electronics such as laptops and smartphones. This "urban mining" offers a way to build a more resilient domestic supply chain, reducing dependence on foreign sources, particularly China, which currently dominates the market. The approach is gaining strategic importance as trade policies and global tensions disrupt traditional supply lines. (not investment advice)</p>

The exercises are a key indicator of Taiwan's military readiness and its strategic posturing. Beijing's reaction will be closely watched as a measure of the current state of cross-strait tensions and regional stability.</p>

          <p>The use of genetic genealogy, once a hobby for ancestry enthusiasts, has become a revolutionary tool for law enforcement in cracking cold cases. The technique involves using DNA from a crime scene to build a family tree through public genealogy databases, leading investigators to suspects like the Golden State Killer. This method, pioneered by researchers like Barbara Rae-Venter, provides crucial investigative leads that traditional detective work can then confirm. While it has raised privacy concerns, the practice has proven highly effective in identifying and capturing previously elusive serial criminals.</p>

Health policy experts, like Robin Rudowitz of KFF, raise significant questions about the viability of this idea. They point to numerous barriers, including the fact that most non-disabled Medicaid recipients are already working, often in low-wage jobs. Furthermore, there are mismatches in location, skills, and the physically demanding nature of farm work that make a simple replacement unlikely.</p>
