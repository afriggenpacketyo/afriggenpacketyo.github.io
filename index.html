          <p>Actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner, widely known for his role as Theo Huxtable on "The Cosby Show," has died at the age of 54. Officials in Costa Rica confirmed his death was due to an accidental drowning after he was reportedly caught in a strong current while swimming. Warner had a prolific career, starring in numerous television shows and earning a Grammy Award for his musical work. Friends and colleagues remembered him as a humble and kind individual who was conscious of his cultural impact and legacy.</p>

          <p>For homeowners seeking to borrow $20,000, home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) and home equity loans present viable options with interest rates currently lower than personal loans or credit cards. As of July 2025, the average rates for both products are nearly identical, resulting in very similar monthly payments over common repayment periods. However, the article notes that HELOC rates are variable and subject to change with market conditions, while home equity loan rates are fixed. This distinction is a critical factor for borrowers to consider when choosing how to leverage their home's equity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Director of National Intelligence has announced the release of 230,000 previously sealed FBI files concerning the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The documents detail the FBI's investigation, potential leads, and information regarding killer James Earl Ray. In response, Dr. King's family issued a statement urging the public to view the files within the historical context of the FBI's COINTELPRO campaign, which aimed to discredit the civil rights leader. The family condemned any potential misuse of the documents to undermine their father's legacy and the movement he led.</p>

          <p>The German government has allowed two envoys from Afghanistan's Taliban regime to enter the country, a first since the group seized power in 2021. The envoys will provide consular support, such as issuing passports, to facilitate the deportation of Afghan migrants with failed asylum claims or criminal records. German officials emphasized that this measure does not constitute formal diplomatic recognition of the Taliban government. The move has drawn criticism from the United Nations, which cited ongoing human rights violations in Afghanistan and advised against such returns.</p>

Making an informed decision is crucial, as early withdrawal penalties can apply if funds are needed before the CD matures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has announced that there will not be a vote on a resolution concerning the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein before Congress's upcoming recess. Johnson stated that the administration needs space to conduct its own process and that congressional action is not yet necessary. The decision comes after the Justice Department formally requested a judge to unseal grand jury transcripts related to the case. This move delays a separate bipartisan effort to force a vote compelling the immediate release of the documents.</p>

          <p>The Republican National Committee (RNC) concluded the first half of 2025 with a substantial financial advantage, holding $80.7 million in cash compared to the Democratic National Committee's (DNC) $15.2 million. This $65.6 million gap is significantly wider than at the same point before the 2018 midterms. The RNC's fundraising success is closely tied to its collaboration with President Trump's team. Meanwhile, the DNC is working to recover from its 2024 election losses and build momentum for the upcoming midterm and presidential elections.</p>

          <p>President Trump's trade war and the uncertainty surrounding tariffs are having a significant negative impact on smaller and secondary U.S. ports from California to the Gulf Coast. Shippers are rerouting cargo to larger ports like Los Angeles to get goods in before tariff deadlines, causing a drop in container volumes at ports such as Oakland, Jacksonville, and New Orleans. This shift is threatening local economies and jobs that depend on port activity. The article highlights how the recalibration of supply chains is creating economic pain for these smaller but vital trade hubs.</p>

          <p>For Americans struggling with high levels of unsecured debt, a debt management program can be an effective solution, but enrollment is not automatic. This article outlines three primary requirements that credit counseling agencies typically look for in potential candidates. These include having a steady and sufficient income to make consistent payments, possessing a manageable amount of unsecured debt within the program's limits, and demonstrating a willingness to commit to the program's rules, such as closing credit accounts. These criteria ensure that the program is a suitable and effective option for the individual's financial situation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A massive recall has been issued for approximately 5 million above-ground pools following the drowning deaths of nine young children. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission found that compression straps on the exterior of the pools, sold by major retailers since 2002, can act as footholds, allowing toddlers to climb in. The deaths occurred even when ladders were removed, giving parents a false sense of security. The recall affects pools 48 inches or taller from manufacturers Bestway, Intex, and Polygroup, who are offering a repair kit to consumers.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has overturned the conviction of Pedro Hernandez for the 1979 murder of six-year-old Etan Patz, one of New York City's most infamous missing child cases. The court ruled that Hernandez, who confessed to the crime after a lengthy interrogation, must receive a new trial or be released. The decision hinges on the finding that the trial judge gave the jury improper instructions regarding the voluntariness of Hernandez's confession, a violation of established federal law. The Manhattan District Attorney's office is currently reviewing the decision.</p>

The author details a series of actions, including lawsuits against major news outlets, the defunding of public broadcasting, and the appointment of a loyalist to head the FCC. The article suggests these moves go beyond rhetoric to actively demean, demonize, and economically weaken independent reporting. It raises concerns about the timidity of corporate media leaders in response and the potential long-term damage to the Fourth Estate.</p>

He also recommends maintaining eye contact with the animal, as they prefer to ambush from behind. As a final resort, he suggests pushing firmly on the shark's sensitive nose to drive it away, rather than punching it.</p>
