          <p>Vice President JD Vance accused California Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass of fostering violent immigration protests while touring federal facilities in Los Angeles. Vance claimed their sanctuary city policies emboldened rioters and endangered law enforcement, which Newsom's spokesperson refuted as false. Vance also mistakenly referred to Senator Alex Padilla as "Jose Padilla," prompting criticism from Padilla's office and Newsom, who suggested the error was intentional, referencing a convicted al-Qaeda operative with the same name. Vance defended the administration's immigration policies amid ongoing tensions between federal and local authorities regarding enforcement tactics. Optimism surrounding a resolution between local and federal officials is low.</p>

Cutting power to Fordow is another possible tactic to disable centrifuges. The Israeli Prime Minister alluded to having undisclosed strategies to address the threat posed by the Iranian nuclear program; the possibility of unilateral action indicates the tensions in the region remain high.

          <p>The United States' failure to reach a tariff agreement with Japan and threats of new duties on imports may embolden China in trade negotiations. China was heavily impacted by US President Donald Trump's increased duties on imports, but negotiations led to a temporary pause. Analysts suggest that the US's difficulty in securing trade deals indicates desperation, potentially giving Chinese negotiators more leverage. Chen Zhiwu, a professor at the University of Hong Kong, believes the threats and lack of a US-Japan deal signal weakness, encouraging China to take a firmer stance.</p>

          <p>As summer approaches, the appropriateness of wearing shorts in the office remains a contentious issue. Many companies are moving away from formal dress codes, encouraging employees to dress comfortably and professionally. However, stylists generally agree that shorts are often too casual for client-facing roles and advise monitoring colleagues' attire to gauge appropriateness. While some companies embrace shorts, others maintain that beachwear is unacceptable, highlighting the ongoing negotiation between comfort and professionalism in the workplace.</p>

          <p>Diplomatic efforts are underway to de-escalate the Israel-Iran conflict within a two-week window set by President Trump. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with European foreign ministers in Geneva, with the U.S. offering a proposal allowing Iran a civilian nuclear program if it ceases uranium enrichment. The Supreme Leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei, remains the ultimate decision-maker, and it is unclear if the ongoing Israeli airstrikes will push him toward a diplomatic resolution. The US is ready for direct negotiations with Iranian counterparts.</p>

Yusuf's abrupt departure and quick return to Reform highlight questions about his management approach and its impact on those around him.</p>

          <p>A review of Rithy Panh's "Meeting with Pol Pot" describes it as a tense historical drama about a trio of Western journalists invited to witness the Khmer Rouge's proclaimed utopia. The film depicts the journalists' growing horror as they uncover the regime's cruelty and violence. The movie stars Irène Jacob as a French reporter modeled after Elizabeth Becker, whose book inspired the screenplay. The review emphasizes the film's potent reminder of journalism's value and inherent dangers when confronting facades, as well as Panh's soulful sensibility regarding the mass tragedy.</p>
