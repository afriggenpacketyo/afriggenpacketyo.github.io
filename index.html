          <p>During a meeting at the White House, former President Donald Trump told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that a ceasefire is not a necessary precondition for a peace deal with Russia. Trump emphasized that the U.S. would help guarantee Ukraine's security but stated that European nations would be the "first line of defence." The discussion, which included several European leaders, highlighted differing views, with France and Germany insisting a ceasefire was essential for credible negotiations to begin.</p>

          <p>After a two-week standoff, Texas House Democrats have returned to Austin, restoring the quorum needed for the legislature to conduct business. The lawmakers had left the state to block a Republican-led effort to redraw congressional maps in a way that could add five GOP seats in the 2026 midterms. Democrats stated they are returning to build a legal case against the proposed maps, which they argue are discriminatory, as the redistricting bill now moves to a House committee.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has pledged to issue an executive order to eliminate mail-in voting and voting machines, citing baseless claims of massive fraud. However, the U.S. Constitution grants states the authority to determine the "time, place and manner" of elections, with Congress having the power to alter federal election rules, not the president. Legal experts and court rulings on his previous election-related orders affirm that the president has virtually no direct power to implement such sweeping changes to how elections are conducted.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin fell to below $115,000 after hitting a new record high last week, triggering a broader cryptocurrency market downturn. The sell-off was fueled by macroeconomic concerns following higher-than-expected inflation data and comments from the Treasury Secretary about the nation's strategic Bitcoin reserve. The price drop led to over $500 million in forced liquidations of long positions as traders took profits, impacting other major cryptocurrencies like Ether as well. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jasveen Sangha, dubbed the "Ketamine Queen," has agreed to plead guilty to federal charges for supplying the drugs that led to the death of actor Matthew Perry. Perry died from the acute effects of ketamine in October 2023, and Sangha was one of five individuals charged in connection with providing him the substance. According to the Justice Department, her Los Angeles home was a "drug-selling emporium," and she now faces a maximum sentence of 60 years in prison.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds US Wage Growth Has Not Kept Pace with Inflation Over Past Four Years</h2>

          <p>A new analysis from Bankrate indicates that the average American's wages have lagged behind inflation by 1.2 percentage points over the last four years, eroding purchasing power for many households. The study found that some professions have been hit harder than others, with educators experiencing the largest gap between pay growth and the cost of living. In contrast, workers in sectors that saw high demand post-pandemic, such as leisure, hospitality, and healthcare, have seen wage increases that outpaced inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Conservative network Newsmax will pay $67 million to settle a defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems over the broadcast of false claims about the 2020 presidential election. The settlement was reached after a judge ruled that Newsmax had defamed Dominion, leaving a jury to decide only on malice and damages. This follows a similar, larger settlement between Fox News and Dominion, highlighting the significant financial consequences for media outlets that promoted baseless election fraud conspiracy theories.</p>

The report also clarifies that both the U.S. and Europe have provided a mixture of grants and loans, contrary to some political claims.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has stated his belief that the artificial intelligence market is currently in an investment bubble, comparing the overexcitement among investors to the dot-com boom of the late 1990s. While affirming that AI is a profoundly important technological shift, he warned that the current level of speculative investment is unsustainable. His comments add to a growing chorus of experts cautioning that the rapid surge in AI-related spending and valuations may not be grounded in solid fundamentals. (not investment advice)</p>
