            <p>An article in The Guardian discusses the challenges of fostering viewpoint diversity in universities, particularly in light of Donald Trump's political interventions. Trump's administration has demanded that Harvard and other elite colleges reorganize their governance and hire faculty to ensure viewpoint diversity, a move the author argues is a form of political bullying. The author contends that Trump's demands contradict his insistence on merit-based hiring and raise questions about how to achieve genuine intellectual balance without resorting to ideological litmus tests. The piece suggests that the solutions often threaten to make the problem worse, potentially subverting scholarly objectivity. Optimism score: 40</p>
