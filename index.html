          <h2>Arkansas Officials Urge Trump to Reconsider Disaster Relief Denial</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders and the state's GOP congressional delegation are appealing to President Trump to reconsider the denial of federal disaster relief following severe storms in March. The request was initially denied by FEMA, prompting the officials to emphasize the catastrophic damage and the need for federal assistance for rebuilding efforts. This pushback comes amidst similar denials in other states, marking the first instance of Republicans publicly challenging FEMA's decision under the Trump administration. Trump has previously criticized FEMA and suggested states manage disaster relief independently.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has initiated a review of state investments and business dealings with El Salvador, potentially leading to a boycott due to El Salvador's cooperation with the Trump administration in the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a suspected MS-13 gang member. Pritzker argues the deportation defies court orders and due process, prompting him to assess the state's financial ties to El Salvador.

          <p>A proposed bill in California, AB 942, is generating controversy as it aims to significantly reduce energy credits for homeowners with rooftop solar panels, especially those installed before April 2023. Assemblymember Lisa Calderon, formerly of Southern California Edison, argues the bill promotes equity by reducing costs for non-solar customers. Opponents, including environmental groups and solar industry advocates, claim it breaks the state's 20-year incentive promise and benefits utilities at the expense of renewable energy adoption, while electrical worker unions support the bill to alleviate costs for non-solar ratepayers.</p>
