          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr., 82, has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to the bone, his office announced. The diagnosis followed reports of urinary symptoms, leading to the discovery of a nodule on his prostate. While the cancer is stage 4 and considered aggressive, it appears to be hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management, according to the statement from Mr. Biden’s office. Mr. Biden and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians, and supportive statements have been issued by political figures, including former President Trump and former Vice President Harris.</p>

          <p>An agreement has been reached to end New Jersey's first statewide transit strike in over 40 years, just three days after it began, according to NJ Transit and a union spokesman. The terms of the deal with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen were not immediately available, but members will return to work on Monday, though trains will not run until Tuesday morning to allow for equipment inspection. The engineers had been seeking a new contract for over five years, demanding pay parity with counterparts at other New York City railroads, and the strike had caused significant commuter disruption and economic damage to the New York area.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler won the US PGA Championship by six strokes, overcoming a shaky start to dominate the back nine. Despite opening the door for Jon Rahm early on, Scheffler posted birdies on the 10th, 14th, and 15th holes to regain control. Rahm's struggles on the 'Green Mile' finale, including a double-bogey on the 17th, crushed his hopes of a major triumph. Bryson DeChambeau, Davis Riley, and Harris English finished in a share of second place, while Rory McIlroy ended in a tie for 47th.</p>

          <p>Nicusor Dan, the liberal and pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, has won Romania's presidential election, defeating hard-right nationalist George Simion after a tense runoff. The election was viewed as a geopolitical choice between East and West, with Dan campaigning on fighting corruption and supporting Ukraine, while Simion attacked the EU and called for cutting aid to Kyiv. A large voter turnout, including significant participation from the diaspora, played a key role in Dan's victory. The election was held months after the previous election was canceled due to allegations of Russian interference.</p>

          <p>Five years after a devastating fire, Paris's Notre Dame Cathedral has reopened its doors to the public, thanks to the meticulous work of hundreds of craftspeople. Known as compagnons, these artisans have revived medieval skills to restore the cathedral's stained-glass windows, stone walls, and organ. Restorers like Olivia Salaun, Philomene Thivet Mazzantti, and Diana Castillo have played key roles in bringing the cathedral's masterpieces back to life. The project has also sparked a "Notre Dame effect," drawing young people to traditional crafts and trades.</p>

          <p>Israel has announced it will allow a "basic amount of food" into Gaza to prevent a hunger crisis after blockading the territory for 10 weeks, following increasing pressure from aid agencies and international bodies. This decision comes amid a renewed military offensive against Hamas, named Operation Gideon's Chariot, with strikes on various sites, including a hospital in northern Gaza. Negotiators from Israel and Hamas are still trying to reach a ceasefire agreement in Qatar, but a senior Hamas source says no progress has been made due to Israeli intransigence.</p>

          <p>Federal and local agencies are investigating a crash involving a Mexican tall ship, the Cuauhtémoc, and the Brooklyn Bridge, which resulted in two deaths and multiple injuries. The ship, carrying 277 people, reportedly lost power and drifted backward, colliding with the bridge and snapping its masts. Senator Schumer is questioning whether cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) played a role in the incident, citing a lack of a tugboat and a vacant commandant post in the Coast Guard.</p>

Boeing was accused of misleading the FAA about aspects of the Max before the agency certified the plane for flight, and the Justice Department said it had agreed to consider any written submissions by the family members through May 22.</p>
