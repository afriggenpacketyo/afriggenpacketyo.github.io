        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Goldman Sachs forecasts a significant increase in inflation and a heightened risk of recession in the next year due to President Trump's new tariffs.  The bank projects a 3.5% inflation rate in 2025 and only 1% annualized economic growth, leading to a 35% chance of recession.  This analysis exhibits a slightly negative bias, focusing on the potential economic downsides of the tariffs and potentially downplaying any potential benefits.</p>
