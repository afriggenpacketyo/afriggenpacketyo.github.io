          <p>U.S. consumer confidence fell in September, dropping to its lowest level since April and missing economists' expectations. The Conference Board's report indicated increased pessimism about current business conditions and job availability, with the "present situation" index hitting a one-year low. This decline comes as Wall Street and federal agencies, including the Federal Reserve, prepare for a potential data blackout caused by the looming government shutdown. The uncertainty impacts economic forecasting and monetary policy decisions, as officials weigh further interest rate moves amid a weakening labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israel's Ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, condemned a walkout by some delegates ahead of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address as a "staged" act by hostile missions. He asserted that those who cannot listen to Israel's leader have no place in the hall, while noting most delegations remained. Danon also criticized the UN for scheduling key Middle East talks during the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashanah, which prevented Israeli representation. He dismissed recent recognitions of Palestinian statehood by several Western nations as "empty declarations" driven by domestic political interests.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has given Hamas a three to four-day deadline to accept a comprehensive peace plan aimed at ending the war in Gaza. The proposal, developed with Israel, reportedly includes a ceasefire, the release of all hostages, and the disarmament of Hamas, but has received mixed reactions. While many international leaders have praised the effort, some of Israel's far-right cabinet members have denounced it, and Prime Minister Netanyahu has publicly rejected the creation of a Palestinian state. The international community is now awaiting Hamas's response as Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey facilitate discussions.</p>

The storm is currently moving away from the Bahamas and the southeastern U.S. coastline, with forecasts predicting it will approach Bermuda by late Wednesday. The National Hurricane Center has issued a hurricane watch for Bermuda and warns that swells from Imelda are causing life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the U.S. East Coast.

          <p>Federal prosecutors have recommended a prison sentence of at least 11 years for Sean 'Diddy' Combs, who was convicted in July on two counts of transporting individuals for prostitution. In a sentencing memo, prosecutors argued that despite his acquittal on more severe charges, his "decades of unchecked violence" and the physical abuse inflicted upon victims like Cassie Ventura warrant a significant sentence. The recommendation starkly contrasts with the defense's request for time served. Victim impact statements, including one from Ventura, urged the judge to deliver a sentence that reflects the extensive harm Combs has caused.</p>

The letter states that federal workers are willing to forgo their paychecks to protect critical public services from damaging cuts and what they term unconstitutional executive overreach. This move is seen as a significant act of solidarity, offering Democrats a powerful opportunity to champion economic justice and the preservation of government programs.

The program aims to present China as open to early-career professionals, but policy analysts suggest that Beijing needs to provide greater transparency and stricter oversight to address the public's unease.

          <p>Coffee prices in the U.S. have surged nearly 21% over the past year, reaching a record high of $8.87 per pound for ground roast coffee. This price spike is attributed to a combination of factors, including adverse weather in key growing regions like Brazil and significant U.S. tariffs on coffee-producing nations. Family-owned chains like Gregory's Coffee are grappling with these increased costs, which affect not only the beans but also related supplies like bags. While some retailers have absorbed the costs so far, many, including major brands, are indicating that price increases for consumers are imminent.</p>

          <p>While the Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates again in October, experts suggest the impact on mortgage rates may be less significant than borrowers hope. Markets have likely already priced in the anticipated quarter-point reduction, meaning mortgage rates may not see a substantial drop following the official announcement. Mortgage rates are more directly influenced by Treasury yields, which can fluctuate based on broader economic data like inflation reports released before the Fed's meeting. Homeowners with high-interest loans from recent years are still encouraged to explore refinancing options as rates remain at three-year lows. (not investment advice)</p>

After initially resisting, Dodik has now capitulated, paving the way for an early presidential election in November.

Sanford, who was killed by police, is suspected of ramming his truck into the church before opening fire, killing at least four people and burning the building down.

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has accused Democrats of causing the government shutdown standoff by insisting on policy demands unrelated to the immediate need for a funding bill. He argued that their insistence on extending Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits in a short-term continuing resolution has "painted them into a corner." Johnson stated that a debate on ACA reforms could happen later but should not hold up government funding. In response, Democratic leaders maintain they will not support a partisan bill that fails to include what they consider essential healthcare protections for the American people.</p>

          <p>In an unusual instance of cooperation, the U.S. is deporting approximately 120 Iranian nationals who were detained for illegally entering the country, according to Iranian officials. The first flight was scheduled to depart Monday night, with up to 400 individuals potentially being returned as part of a broader agreement. Most of the deportees had crossed into the U.S. from Mexico. While the Trump administration has not formally acknowledged a specific deal, the move aligns with its crackdown on illegal immigration. This action marks a departure from previous U.S. policy, which has often been sympathetic to Iranians seeking asylum.</p>

          <p>U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer cautioned that Britain is at a "fork in the road" and must choose between renewal and decline, in a keynote speech at the Labour Party's annual conference. Facing falling poll numbers and the rise of the right-wing Reform UK party, Starmer called for unity around a vision of a country that is proud of its values rather than one that succumbs to the politics of grievance. He acknowledged that the path to renewal would be difficult and require uncomfortable decisions, hinting at potential tax hikes to address a significant fiscal deficit amid challenging economic conditions.</p>

The ICO's investigation, which began in March, provisionally found that the company was not complying with UK data protection laws. Imgur's decision to exit the UK market is a commercial one, but the ICO stated that it does not absolve the company of responsibility for any prior infringements.</p>

The report from Pregnancy Justice found that the vast majority of these cases involved allegations of child abuse or neglect, often linked to substance use, and disproportionately targeted low-income women in southern states. By applying laws meant for children to fetuses, these prosecutions are seen as advancing the legal concept of "fetal personhood." In 16 of the documented cases, the charges included homicide.</p>
