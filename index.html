          <p>A 41-year-old employee at a Tallahassee Chuck E. Cheese was arrested while in his full mouse costume for allegedly stealing and using a customer's debit card. The victim conducted her own investigation, obtaining security footage that identified the suspect, and then worked with police to set up his arrest at the restaurant. Police officers escorted the man, still in costume, out of the establishment in handcuffs. The suspect, who denied the allegations, was found with the stolen card in his pocket and faces multiple felony charges.</p>

The couple, who married in June, have been celebrating their nuptials in Europe, accompanied by numerous high-profile guests. Sánchez has been noted for her fashion choices, including the more conservative Dolce & Gabbana wedding dress she wore, which she said was inspired by a Sophia Loren film. The couple's relationship became public in 2019, and they were engaged in May 2023.</p>

          <p>The Federal Communications Commission has approved the $8.4 billion merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media, a decision that has sparked significant controversy. Critics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, have suggested the approval was linked to Paramount's $16 million settlement of a lawsuit filed by Donald Trump and other concessions. Skydance has committed to eliminating diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and appointing an ombudsman to review bias complaints at CBS News. The FCC's sole Democratic commissioner dissented, arguing the deal erodes press freedom by imposing unprecedented controls over newsroom decisions.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has asserted that major technology companies like Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft are 'underspending' on artificial intelligence, despite projections of a combined $320 billion investment in 2025. He argues that the race for AI dominance is a 'winner-take-all' situation, and increased spending is necessary to secure a market-leading position. Citing Alphabet's strong quarterly earnings and increased capital expenditures as justification, Cramer believes these investments are crucial for developing the most accurate and profitable AI systems, which could lead to a near-monopoly for the ultimate winner.

          <p>The new Marvel film 'The Fantastic Four: First Steps' features a mid-credits scene that formally introduces the iconic villain Doctor Doom into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In the scene, a cloaked figure with a distinctive mask appears before Reed Richards and Sue Storm's son, Franklin. This sets the stage for the upcoming crossover film 'Avengers: Doomsday,' where Robert Downey Jr. is slated to portray the character. The film is set in an alternate universe, Earth-828, suggesting the Fantastic Four's eventual arrival in the main MCU timeline may be driven by this new threat.</p>

          <p>President Trump has withdrawn the formal nomination of his former lawyer, Alina Habba, to be the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, a move that legally allows her to serve in the position in an acting capacity.

Attorney General Pam Bondi criticized the judges' move as 'rogue.' By pulling the Senate nomination, the administration sidesteps a legal provision that would have blocked Habba from continuing in an acting role.</p>

The effort aims to revive diplomatic channels after U.S.-Iran talks stalled following military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.

Grand jury testimony, a key part of the files, is legally protected by secrecy rules and can only be unsealed by a judge under exceptional circumstances, a high bar to clear. Furthermore, releasing raw investigative evidence outside of a criminal proceeding is highly unusual for the FBI, due to privacy concerns and the protection of ongoing investigations.

          <p>McDonald's is set to test a new lineup of 10 beverages in 500 U.S. restaurants, inspired by its recently closed CosMc's drink-focused chain. The move aims to attract younger customers, particularly Gen Z, who show a strong preference for flavorful and unique cold drinks. The new offerings, which include items like a Creamy Vanilla Cold Brew and a Popping Tropic Refresher, will be branded with the CosMc's name. This strategy allows McDonald's to integrate the experimental beverage concepts into its existing stores rather than operating separate locations, capitalizing on a growing market for specialty drinks.</p>

          <p>An old photograph showing a teenage Ivanka Trump sitting on her father Donald Trump's lap has been confirmed as authentic. The image, which resurfaced on social media in mid-July 2025 amid controversy over the Jeffrey Epstein case, was not digitally manipulated or generated by AI. According to Getty Images, the photo was taken in 1996 at the Mar-a-Lago estate during a concert. The image's circulation has been fueled by critics who share it alongside other photos of the pair from various stages of her life to suggest a pattern of unsettling behavior.</p>

          <p>An Ontario judge has acquitted five former members of Canada's world junior hockey team of sexually assaulting a woman in a hotel room in 2018. In her ruling, the judge stated that she did not find the complainant's testimony to be 'credible or reliable,' and therefore the prosecution could not prove its case. The players had been accused of assaulting the woman after a Hockey Canada gala. The case, which centered on the issue of consent, has drawn significant public attention in Canada and raised questions about the culture within the sport.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have successfully manufactured the world's largest barium gallium selenide (BGSe) crystal, a critical component for developing ultra-high-power laser weapons. This synthetic crystal, measuring 60 millimeters in diameter, can efficiently convert laser beams to frequencies that travel long distances through the atmosphere. More importantly, it can withstand immense power levels, potentially solving the long-standing problem of laser components damaging themselves during operation. This breakthrough could enable the development of ground-based lasers powerful enough to disable satellites in orbit, marking a significant advance in directed-energy weapon technology.</p>

          <p>The Federal Communications Commission has officially approved Skydance Media's $8 billion takeover of Paramount Global, clearing the final regulatory obstacle for the deal. The approval followed a period of intense political scrutiny, notably after Paramount settled a lawsuit with President Trump for $16 million over a '60 Minutes' interview. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr praised Skydance's commitments, which include canceling all DEI initiatives and installing a news ombudsman to address bias. The decision has drawn criticism, with the lone Democratic commissioner dissenting, citing concerns over press freedom and potential political influence on the merger's approval.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has issued an order that, for now, maintains the ability of individual voters and groups to file lawsuits under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. The action came in a case from North Dakota, where tribes challenged a redistricting plan for diluting Native American voting strength. The Court blocked a lower appellate court ruling that had uniquely argued individuals do not have a private right to sue under the act. This temporary victory for voting rights advocates may be short-lived, as the justices are set to rehear a separate, similar case from Louisiana next term.</p>

          <p>Jeremy Corbyn, the former leader of the UK's Labour Party, has announced the launch of a new political party alongside fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana. The yet-unnamed party aims to 'take on the rich and powerful' and provide an alternative to what they describe as Labour's 'control freaks' and the 'dangerously divisive' politics of Reform UK. Corbyn stated the new venture will be community-led and grassroots-focused, differentiating it from the centralized structure of Labour. The move could potentially split the left-wing vote and pose a challenge to the Labour Party in future elections.</p>
