          <p>American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) reported disappointing quarterly earnings, leading to a lowered financial outlook due to a $75 million write-down in spring and summer merchandise. CEO Jay Schottenstein acknowledged the challenging quarter and outlined actions to improve performance, though the company withdrew its full-year guidance amid macroeconomic uncertainties. The results reflect slow sales, heavy discounting, and a volatile economic environment. AEO expects second-quarter revenue to decline by 5%, with comparable sales down 3% and gross margin also decreasing year-over-year, as the company aims to recover in time for the back-to-school season (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Gap Inc. shares experienced a significant drop after the company warned that new tariffs could cost between $100 million and $150 million annually if they remain in effect. The company reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings and revenue but highlighted the potential impact of 30% duties on imports from China and a 10% levy on imports from most other countries. While Gap is working to mitigate these costs by diversifying its supply chain, the tariff situation introduces uncertainty into the company's turnaround efforts. Despite the tariff concerns, Gap's CEO, Richard Dickson, remains optimistic about the company's ability to navigate the challenges (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>California is bracing for a potential record-breaking year of valley fever cases, driven by prolonged, drier summers, with reported cases already exceeding previous years. Valley fever, a lung infection caused by inhaling fungal spores in dry soil, is becoming more prevalent due to climate change extending high-risk exposure periods. Public health officials advise residents, hikers, and tourists to take precautions, such as staying on well-maintained trails, wearing N95 masks in dusty conditions, and avoiding activities that stir up dust. Early diagnosis is crucial, as symptoms often mimic other respiratory illnesses, and treatment typically involves antifungal medications.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily reinstated tariffs imposed by former President Trump, halting a lower court's decision that had blocked them. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit granted the Trump administration's request for a stay, pending a review of the trade court's decision. The trade court had previously ruled that Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose tariffs was an overreach of presidential authority. The Justice Department argued that without the stay, national security and economic interests would be irreparably harmed, leading the appeals court to temporarily reinstate the tariffs while the legal battle continues. The legal challenges question the extent of presidential power in trade matters. </p>
