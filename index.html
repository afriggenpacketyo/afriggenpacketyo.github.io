          <p>The UK's Ministry of Defence has stated it will not provide compensation to thousands of Afghans whose personal information was leaked in a February 2022 data breach. Despite a lawsuit from a firm representing over 1,000 clients, the MoD is defending its position, citing an internal review that found it "highly unlikely" individuals would be targeted by the Taliban based solely on the leak. This decision has caused significant distress, as many affected families remaining in Afghanistan now fear for their safety and are forced to maintain low profiles to avoid potential retribution.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's successful Democratic primary campaign for New York City mayor is being viewed as a pivotal moment for Muslim and South Asian American political representation. His platform, which focuses on affordability and Palestinian rights, has resonated with a diverse coalition of voters, including many outside his own community. Despite facing Islamophobic attacks, Mamdani's rise signifies a shift in American politics, challenging long-held assumptions about who can lead a major city. His grassroots campaign, supported by groups like DRUM Beats, has energized working-class immigrant communities who see his potential victory as a sign of hope and progress.</p>

          <h2>US Safety Board Calls Media Speculation on Air India Crash 'Premature'</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has cautioned against speculative media reports regarding the cause of the fatal Air India Boeing Dreamliner crash that killed 270 people. Following a preliminary report from India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) that mentioned a pilot's query about the engine fuel cutoff switches, some reports suggested intentional pilot action. The NTSB emphasized that complex investigations take time and that drawing early conclusions is inappropriate. Indian authorities and pilot federations have also condemned the reporting as irresponsible and have taken legal action against some media outlets.</p>

          <p>A fireworks display at the Rheinkirmes fair in Düsseldorf, Germany, was cut short after multiple rockets misfired, injuring 19 people, four of them seriously. Eyewitnesses reported that some fireworks exploded unusually low or flew sideways into the crowd and the nearby Rhine River, with at least one child among the injured. In other German news, the Red Cross has warned that the population lacks sufficient training for major emergencies. Additionally, controversy has arisen over the recent deportation of 81 men to Afghanistan, with reports questioning whether all of them were dangerous criminals as claimed by the government.</p>

The event would be held at London Stadium, which previously hosted the championships in 2017.

          <p>The United States has enacted the GENIUS Act, a new law creating a regulatory framework for stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to the US dollar. The legislation is seen as a major victory for the crypto industry, aiming to legitimize the use of these digital assets for payments and increase their adoption by consumers and businesses. While supporters believe this will bolster the dollar's global status and expand financial access, critics have raised concerns about the law's potential for money laundering and the lack of protections against foreign issuance.

          <h2>Chinese Study Suggests Chemotherapy Can Accelerate Cancer Metastasis</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 00:00:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by Chinese researchers has found that chemotherapy, while effective at treating primary tumors, may inadvertently awaken dormant cancer cells and speed up their spread to other organs. The findings, focused on breast cancer, help explain why some patients experience metastasis in areas like the lungs even after successful initial treatment. The research team also identified that using specific drugs alongside chemotherapy could inhibit this process in mice. A clinical trial based on these findings is now underway with breast cancer patients to explore potential new treatment strategies.</p>

          <p>A Brazilian court has imposed strict restrictions on former president Jair Bolsonaro, ordering him to wear an electronic ankle tag and adhere to a nighttime curfew. The measures were enacted over fears he might flee the country while on trial for allegedly plotting a coup to overturn the 2023 election results. The judge also banned Bolsonaro from social media and from communicating with his son and foreign diplomats. This development occurs amid rising tensions with the U.S., where President Trump has condemned the trial as a "witch hunt" and threatened tariffs on Brazilian goods.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has filed a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal and its owner, Rupert Murdoch, over an article detailing a sexually suggestive letter he allegedly sent to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003. The lawsuit targets the newspaper, its parent companies, and the reporters involved, with Trump vehemently denying he wrote the letter. In response, the Journal's publisher expressed full confidence in its reporting and vowed to vigorously defend against the suit. The legal action comes as the Trump administration faces pressure to be more transparent about the Epstein case.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has announced the elimination of its Office of Research and Development (ORD), the agency's primary scientific research arm. The move is expected to impact hundreds of scientists and researchers and will result in a claimed savings of $748.8 million. This decision is part of a broader reduction in force that has seen the EPA's total staff shrink by about 22% since January 2025. Critics, including a former EPA official, argue that dismantling the respected research office is dangerous and will leave the public more vulnerable to pollution and environmental health risks.</p>

          <p>Beijing's top disciplinary commission is using a failed tourism project in Guilin as a prime example of wasteful grass-roots government mismanagement. The "Yaohan Longevity City" project, initially a key local initiative, was left largely abandoned after the capital chain broke and local officials made a series of poor decisions. The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection condemned the project as a "severe waste of resources" and a case of local leaders pursuing projects disconnected from reality. The primary backer of the project has since been expelled from the Communist Party for misappropriating funds.</p>

          <p>Scientists at the People's Liberation Army Engineering University have proposed a new electromagnetic railgun design that could nearly double the force of the current naval version. The innovative "X-railgun" involves cross-stacking two railguns into a single weapon system. This approach aims to overcome the power limitations of the existing technology, which struggles with firing heavier projectiles needed for significant military applications. According to the project team, the new design could allow for shells up to 30kg to be fired at Mach 7, representing a major advancement in China's electromagnetic weapon capabilities.</p>

          <p>According to the Environment Agency, serious water pollution incidents caused by water companies in England surged by 60% in 2024, reaching the highest number on record. There were 75 incidents classified as causing serious or persistent harm, up from 47 the previous year, with Thames Water being the worst offender. A cross-party parliamentary committee labeled the situation a "national disgrace" and criticized regulators for being "missing in action." The data highlights systemic failures and underinvestment in infrastructure, prompting calls for significant regulatory reform and holding companies accountable for their environmental obligations.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that a strong majority of Americans, approximately two-thirds, favor the United States returning to the moon and eventually sending astronauts to Mars. Support is particularly high among younger Americans who did not witness the original moon landing. The 1969 Apollo 11 mission is still widely viewed as a worthwhile achievement that contributes to national pride. Furthermore, the public generally believes that the space program provides technological benefits for everyone, indicating broad and cross-partisan backing for continued investment in space exploration and scientific discovery.</p>
