          <p>Consumer goods giant Nestlé has announced plans to cut 16,000 jobs over the next two years as part of a strategic overhaul led by its new CEO. The move, which includes 12,000 white-collar positions, is designed to improve operational efficiency and accelerate a cost-savings program to 3 billion Swiss francs. The announcement comes amid a turbulent year of leadership changes and economic pressures but was met with a positive market response, as the company's stock jumped nearly 9% following the news.</p>

          <p>Two Federal Reserve Governors, Stephen Miran and Christopher Waller, have publicly presented conflicting opinions on the central bank's next move regarding interest rates. Miran is advocating for a more aggressive half-percentage-point cut to address a weakening labor market, while Waller supports a more cautious quarter-point reduction. Their differing views highlight the Fed's ongoing challenge of balancing concerns about slowing employment against persistent inflationary pressures, a task made more difficult by a government shutdown delaying key economic data.

          <p>Former ambassador Richard Grenell praised President Donald Trump’s foreign policy, describing it as being filled with “common sense” and a willingness to confront issues directly. Grenell criticized the previous administration for avoiding dialogue with leaders like Vladimir Putin, contrasting it with Trump's approach of active engagement and adjusting policy as needed. He highlighted Trump's planned discussions with both the Russian and Ukrainian presidents as evidence of his proactive strategy to solve global problems and strengthen America's position.</p>

          <p>The head of MI5, Sir Ken McCallum, stated that Chinese state operatives pose a daily national security threat to the UK and voiced his frustration over the recent collapse of a high-profile espionage prosecution. The case, involving a former parliamentary researcher accused of spying for China, was dropped after the Crown Prosecution Service determined the evidence did not sufficiently prove China was a threat. This has sparked a political firestorm, with accusations that the government undermined the case to avoid damaging economic relations with Beijing.</p>

          <p>The long-simmering conflict between the Armenian government and the influential Apostolic Church has intensified following the recent arrests of two archbishops. The clergy members face serious charges, including making calls to seize power, which the Church has condemned as part of a “systematic anti-church campaign.” This rift has been growing since Armenia's defeat in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, with the Church increasingly positioning itself as a key opposition force ahead of the 2026 parliamentary elections.</p>

This policy is part of a broader 10-year plan aimed at reducing traffic congestion, curbing air pollution, and encouraging residents to use public transportation, walk, or cycle. While the specific surcharge has yet to be determined, the council has stated the additional cost will remain “negligible” relative to the vehicle's purchase price.</p>

For decades, such detection was considered unfeasible due to the immense challenge of “background clutter,” where radar signals reflecting off the Earth’s surface create noise that masks an aircraft's faint signature. This technological breakthrough suggests a significant potential shift in military surveillance and stealth capabilities, allowing for consistent tracking regardless of weather or time of day.</p>

His survival was contingent on making significant concessions to the opposition Socialist Party, including a promise to freeze a contentious pension reform. While this provides temporary breathing room to pass the 2026 budget, it also highlights the profound political instability and diminished authority of President Emmanuel Macron's administration.</p>
