          <p>Bumble shares surged after the dating app company announced it will lay off 30% of its workforce, which equates to approximately 240 roles, as part of a strategic restructuring. The layoffs are expected to incur charges of $13 million to $18 million during the third and fourth quarters of the year, but the company anticipates annual cost savings of $40 million. Bumble plans to reinvest these savings into product and technology development to strengthen its core business and position itself for future growth. Shares of the dating app company have struggled since going public in 2021, with its market value declining significantly. The company hopes that the restructuring will help to revive growth and improve its financial performance. The optimism score for the dating app company's future after the restructuring is cautiously optimistic.</p>

          <p>Marcus Monzo has been found guilty of murdering 14-year-old Daniel Anjorin with a samurai sword in Hainault, as well as three counts of attempted murder, wounding with intent, and possession of an offensive weapon. The attacks, which took place over 20 minutes, also targeted a pedestrian, two police officers, and a couple in their home. Monzo claimed to have no memory of the events, attributing his actions to a cannabis-induced psychosis, but the prosecution argued that self-induced intoxication was not a valid defense for murder. The judge stated that Monzo would face a life term when he returns to court for sentencing on Friday. The community mourns the tragic loss of a young life and expresses gratitude to the emergency services who risked their own safety during the incident.</p>

AeroVironment also reported record fiscal year revenue of $820.6 million, reflecting a 14% increase over the previous year, alongside net income of $16.66 million for the fourth quarter.

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. will meet with Iran next week, amidst a tenuous ceasefire between Israel and Iran. Speaking at a news conference during the NATO summit in The Hague, Netherlands, Trump stated that a formal agreement with Iran may not be necessary, citing the destruction of their nuclear sites. He emphasized that the U.S. is primarily concerned with preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The announcement follows meetings with world leaders and cautious optimism regarding the ceasefire brokered by the Trump administration, which ended a 12-day conflict that resulted in casualties in both Israel and Iran.</p>

          <p>Tesla's new car sales in Europe have experienced a fifth consecutive month of decline in May, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA), as customers increasingly opt for cheaper Chinese electric vehicles. Tesla's car sales in the European Union, Britain, and the European Free Trade Association fell by 27.9% year-on-year, totaling 13,863 units. The company's European market share also decreased from 1.8% to 1.2% during the same period. The article suggests that the decline may be partly attributed to reputational damage linked to CEO Elon Musk's rhetoric and political activities, although this is not the primary reason for the company's losses in Europe.</p>

These sites, such as the Moses Macedonia African Cemetery in Bethesda, Maryland, and the Evergreen Cemetery in St. Petersburg, Florida, face challenges ranging from encroaching construction to lack of oversight. Activists are working to document the existence of these cemeteries, protest development, and conduct genealogical research to protect the remains of enslaved people and their descendants. While a federal law exists to protect Black cemeteries, it has not yet been funded by Congress, highlighting the need for continued advocacy and community-based preservation efforts.</p>

          <p>The Wallis Annenberg Wildlife Crossing, designed to provide safe passage for wildlife over the 101 Freeway in Agoura Hills, is entering its second and final phase. This phase involves installing connectors to facilitate wildlife movement between the Santa Susana and Santa Monica Mountains. The work is complex, requiring the burying of overhead wires, moving water lines, stabilizing an underground creek, and constructing a tunnel over Agoura Road, all while preserving a grove of native oak trees. Partial closures of Agoura Road are expected to begin in early August and last for several months, with the project's completion anticipated by the end of 2026. This is a large scale effort to reconnect wildlife habitats that have been fragmented by human infrastructure.</p>

Starmer insists the Labour party is united on the need to reform the welfare system, arguing that the current system is failing those who need help finding work or protection.

Trump also characterized it as a major win for Europe and Western civilization, highlighting the importance of collective defense efforts among NATO allies.

          <p>President Trump is disputing an early Pentagon report suggesting that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities only set back Tehran's program by months, claiming "total obliteration." During the NATO summit in the Netherlands, Trump insisted that the strikes had effectively eliminated Iran's nuclear capabilities, setting the program back "basically decades." He dismissed initial intelligence assessments as inconclusive, asserting that additional intelligence and eyewitness accounts confirm the destruction of the sites. Trump stated that he is not interested in restarting negotiations with Iran and believes the conflict is over.

          <p>Sales of new single-family homes in the U.S. experienced a significant drop in May, declining 13.7% compared to April, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The sales total was also 6.3% lower than May of the previous year, falling below both the six-month and one-year averages. This decline in sales has resulted in a notable increase in supply, reaching a 9.8-month supply at the current sales rate, the highest level in three years. Economists attribute the slowdown to stubbornly high mortgage rates, which have impacted affordability and buyer activity. The increase in supply reflects the challenges faced by the housing market in the current economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The "Russian House" in Berlin, a cultural center run by a sanctioned Russian federal agency, is under scrutiny for allegedly spreading propaganda for Putin's Russia. Despite the agency being on the EU sanctions list since 2022, the German federal government is required to pay â‚¬70,000 in property taxes for the building due to a long-standing agreement between Germany and Russia. Critics argue that the center has strayed from its original purpose of promoting mutual cultural exchange. While some call for its closure, the German government hesitates due to concerns about Russia closing the Goethe Institute in Moscow, but the future of the building remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>FedEx reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue, revealing that it has achieved its $4 billion cost-cutting goal and plans to reduce costs by another $1 billion in the upcoming fiscal year. The company's U.S. daily package volume increased by 6% year-over-year, with U.S. ground home delivery volume up 10%. Despite the positive results, FedEx stock declined in after-hours trading due to current-quarter profit guidance that was slightly below Wall Street expectations. The company's long-term cost-cutting initiative, known as the DRIVE program, is aimed at improving profitability and efficiency. The quarterly results come shortly after the death of FedEx founder and executive chairman, Fred Smith.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has declined to place Los Angeles' homelessness programs into receivership, despite finding that the city failed to adhere to the terms of a settlement agreement. The judge cited that receivership is a last resort and that less intrusive remedies should be exhausted first. He did, however, find that the city breached the agreement by failing to provide a plan for creating new homeless beds and by missing quarterly housing targets. The judge ordered the selection of a third-party monitor to review the city's data and signaled that he would likely order the city to pay legal fees for the plaintiffs.
