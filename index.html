          <p>The Cambridge Dictionary has incorporated over 6,000 new words this year, reflecting the dynamic influence of internet culture and modern work trends on the English language. Among these additions are viral slang terms like "Skibidi," a versatile gibberish phrase, and "tradwife," referring to a married mother embracing traditional roles while active on social media. Other notable inclusions are "delulu," a play on "delusional," and "mouse jiggler," a device used to simulate activity during remote work. The dictionary also added "broligarchy," a term combining "bro" and "oligarchy" to describe powerful tech leaders. This significant expansion underscores the dictionary's effort to capture contemporary linguistic shifts that are expected to have lasting relevance in common usage.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to host Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and key European leaders at the White House today for critical talks aimed at securing a lasting peace agreement in the ongoing war with Russia. This meeting follows Trump's recent summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which, while not achieving an immediate ceasefire, reportedly led to discussions on broader peace terms. Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized that both Ukraine and Russia would need to make concessions, with agenda items including security guarantees for Ukraine, territorial questions, and post-war reconstruction. The Trump administration is pushing for a swift resolution to the conflict, even as Russian forces continue drone and missile attacks across Ukraine, including a recent deadly strike in Kharkiv.</p>

          <p>Peter Navarro, a trade advisor to U.S. President Donald Trump, has publicly criticized India for its continued purchases of Russian crude oil, labeling them "opportunistic." Navarro argued that India's actions undermine international efforts to economically isolate Russia, effectively serving as a conduit for Russian oil exports and providing Moscow with necessary funds. These comments come amidst reports of canceled trade negotiations between the U.S. and India, and the Trump administration's plan to impose additional tariffs on Indian imports. India maintains its purchases are a necessity for energy security, citing diversions of traditional supplies from Europe. (not investment advice)</p>

This devastating attack was part of a widespread wave of Russian missile and drone launches across multiple Ukrainian regions overnight. President Zelenskyy condemned the strike as a deliberate act of pressure aimed at humiliating diplomatic efforts, underscoring the relentless violence that persists despite ongoing international peace negotiations.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. Attorney General William Barr is slated to face closed-door questioning from Congress regarding his personal investigation into the death of Jeffrey Epstein in federal custody. Barr had publicly asserted that his review of surveillance footage confirmed Epstein's suicide and that no one entered his cell block. However, a recent CBS News analysis of the publicly released video revealed inconsistencies, particularly questioning whether the footage conclusively proves no one accessed the area. Lawmakers on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform will probe Barr on these discrepancies, the missing minute of video, and the overall thoroughness of the Justice Department's inquiry, as renewed public and governmental scrutiny surrounds Epstein's controversial death.</p>

Spain has significantly increased its troop deployment to 1,900, and 27,000 residents have been evacuated from their homes. Major fires persist in northwest and west Spain, burning vast hectares and creating "unbreathable" air quality in affected regions like Castile and León. The severity of these widespread fires, also impacting Greece, France, and Turkey, is exacerbated by intense heatwave conditions, which meteorologists increasingly link to human-induced climate change.</p>

          <p>The Premier League season has commenced, revealing new tactical approaches and team dynamics. Liverpool, under Arne Slot, displayed strong attacking play but appeared vulnerable to counter-attacks, conceding two fast-break goals in their first game, matching their total from the entire previous season. This vulnerability is linked to sloppy midfield passing and committing too many players forward. Meanwhile, Manchester City has found solutions to compensate for Rodri's absence, demonstrating strong expected goal differences. Arsenal, under Mikel Arteta, is experimenting with a more direct, counter-attacking style, which proved ineffective in their opening match but holds potential for future success if execution improves.</p>

This trend is driven by a general stagnation in the labor market, marked by low rates of hiring, quitting, and layoffs, and reflects widespread economic and global uncertainties. While prolonged tenure in a role isn't inherently detrimental, consultants warn that "job hugging" can lead to missed opportunities for higher wage growth and skill development, potentially impacting long-term career marketability.

These works delve into deeply philosophical questions, societal assumptions, and personal shame, challenging the inadequacy of binary categories in defining identity.

          <p>Google and Kairos Power have announced a partnership to deploy an advanced nuclear plant, Kairos' Hermes 2 reactor, connected to the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) electric grid by 2030. This initiative marks the first U.S. utility power purchase agreement with an advanced reactor, with TVA committing to buy up to 50 megawatts of power. The collaboration aims to accelerate the deployment of advanced nuclear technology by ensuring that consumers are not burdened with the initial construction costs, with Google and Kairos bearing the financial risk. The plant, which will power Google's data centers, is intended to establish a standardized, cost-efficient reactor design, potentially ushering in a new era of carbon-free nuclear energy construction in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Air Canada has initiated widespread flight cancellations and a gradual suspension of operations in anticipation of a potential strike by its flight attendants, a move expected to impact hundreds of thousands of travelers. The airline reported an unusual surge in "unplanned crew book-offs," leading to immediate cancellations and a projected complete grounding by early Saturday morning. This pre-emptive action aims to facilitate a more orderly restart of services, though the airline estimates a full recovery could take up to a week. The union, representing approximately 10,000 flight attendants, issued a 72-hour strike notice after contract negotiations stalled, primarily over what they term "poverty wages" and unpaid labor.</p>

          <p>Tesla has announced that its Model Y L, a new six-seat version of its popular Model Y featuring a longer wheelbase, is "coming soon" to the Chinese market. This strategic product refresh comes as Tesla navigates intensifying competition within China's electric vehicle sector, including the recent launch of Xiaomi's YU7. The announcement follows a reported 8.4% decline in Tesla's July sales of China-made EVs, underscoring the pressures of an ongoing price war that has impacted automakers, suppliers, and dealerships. In addition to the Model Y L, a longer-range, rear-wheel drive Model 3 is also anticipated for the Chinese market, as indicated by recent regulatory filings.</p>

          <p>U.S. and Chinese negotiators face a formidable task in securing a comprehensive trade deal, even with a tariff truce now extended to November 10 and the prospect of a summit between Presidents Trump and Xi. This article emphasizes that Beijing has adopted a more assertive negotiating posture, having learned from previous agreements that disproportionately benefited Washington. China has also strategically diversified its export markets and developed a "toolbox" of retaliatory measures, including restricting critical mineral exports, which it is prepared to leverage. Achieving a balanced agreement will necessitate substantial concessions from Washington, making the current diplomatic efforts particularly challenging for U.S. negotiators.

          <p>This article provides a detailed explanation of the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, which categorizes hurricanes based on their sustained wind speeds and estimates potential damage. The scale ranges from Category 1 to Category 5, with storms of Category 3 or higher deemed "major hurricanes" due to their potential for significant loss of life and property damage. The Atlantic hurricane season, running from June to November, is predicted to be "above average" for 2024. Notable examples of storms at each category, like Hurricane Andrew (Category 5) and Hurricane Katrina (Category 3 at landfall), illustrate the varying impacts, while discussions about a potential Category 6 highlight concerns over increasingly extreme storms linked to climate change.</p>

          <p>Yieldstreet, a platform that promised retail investors access to exclusive alternative assets, has resulted in massive losses for many customers on its real estate investments, undermining its "invest like the 1%" marketing. Dozens of investor letters reviewed by this article reveal over $78 million in defaults across 30 real estate projects, with some declared total losses, wiping out substantial individual savings. While the company attributes these struggles to rising interest rates and market conditions, customers and critics allege misleading disclosures and poor underwriting practices. Despite regulatory fines and recent leadership changes, the platform continues to operate, raising concerns that its business model, which charges annual management fees, disproportionately impacts investors seeking financial independence.

          <p>Indian markets surged following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's announcement of significant tax cuts, including a streamlined two-rate Goods and Services Tax (GST) structure, designed to invigorate the domestic economy. These reforms, unveiled in his Independence Day speech, aim to simplify tax compliance, reduce rates, and modernize the GST framework to attract investment and stimulate consumption. This strategic economic boost is particularly timely as India confronts additional U.S. tariffs imposed by the Trump administration over its ongoing purchases of Russian crude oil. Analysts suggest these robust domestic measures could largely counterbalance the adverse effects of the U.S. tariffs, thereby supporting India's predominantly consumption-driven economic growth.

          <p>Hurricane Erin, which re-intensified to a powerful Category 4 storm, caused widespread power outages across Puerto Rico as its outer bands delivered heavy rains and tropical-storm-force winds. Initially, over 147,000 utility customers were without electricity, though the majority of service was restored by Monday morning, primarily in the Caguas, Mayagüez, and San Juan regions. The storm led to flight cancellations across the Caribbean, but ports in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands have since reopened. Erin is projected to remain a major hurricane, generating life-threatening surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast, with North Carolina's Outer Banks already preparing for potential impacts. Scientists increasingly link the rapid intensification of such hurricanes to human-induced climate change.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price recently experienced a dip to $115,000 after achieving a new all-time high of $124,496, as intensified macroeconomic concerns sparked over $500 million in forced selling of long positions across the broader crypto market. This pullback, which also impacted Ether after it neared its own record, followed higher-than-expected July wholesale inflation data, raising doubts about a Federal Reserve rate cut in September. Further contributing to investor sentiment, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent clarified that President Trump's strategic bitcoin reserve would be confined to assets forfeited to the federal government. Despite these pressures, many market observers view the current dip as a healthy and strategic cooldown, largely supported by robust institutional inflows into crypto ETFs.

          <p>This article outlines the distinct objectives of the U.S., Ukraine, Europe, and Russia ahead of the crucial White House talks on the Ukraine war. President Trump seeks "any deal" to fulfill a campaign promise, potentially pressuring Ukraine to concede territory like Crimea and forgo NATO membership, despite his envoy promising security guarantees. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy aims to avoid territorial concessions without robust security guarantees, concerned about ongoing Russian attacks and the shift from ceasefire to a full peace deal. European leaders prioritize a clear U.S. commitment to Ukraine's security and fear border redrawing by force. Russia, absent from the talks, likely seeks full control of Donbas and a ratified commitment against Ukraine's NATO entry.</p>
