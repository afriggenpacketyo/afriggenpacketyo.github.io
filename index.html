          <p>Worldcoin, co-founded by Sam Altman, has officially launched its eye-scanning ID project in the United States, opening six retail locations where individuals can have their irises scanned in exchange for cryptocurrency. The project aims to create a global identity verification system using iris scans and blockchain technology to combat fraud and bots. Worldcoin has partnered with Visa to introduce the "World Visa card" for iris-scanned users and is piloting age verification tools with Tinder in Japan. The project stores some personal data for fraud prevention purposes, but investors claim the data is decentralized and cannot be reverse-engineered.</p>

          <p>During a NewsNation town hall event, President Donald Trump claimed that he had not made any mistakes during his first 100 days in office, prompting laughter from the audience. This assertion came despite a historically unpopular start to his term, marked by economic contraction and criticism from allies. Trump maintained that the U.S. is in a transition period and promised "tremendous economic victories" in the coming year, while acknowledging that such progress takes time.</p>

          <p>European auto manufacturers are experiencing a sharp drop in first-quarter profits, leading many to suspend or reduce their full-year financial forecasts due to uncertainties surrounding U.S. President Donald Trump's trade tariffs. Stellantis, Mercedes, and Volvo Cars have all cited tariff-related volatility as a primary factor impacting their financial outlooks. While Trump has taken steps to ease car tariffs, analysts warn that the ever-changing trade policies will likely hinder long-term corporate investment decisions. Despite the challenges, Volkswagen has maintained its financial guidance but expects performance to be at the lower end of its annual forecasts.</p>

          <p>Tyrique George, a teenager, has broken into Chelsea's £1 billion squad without being loaned out, a rare feat given the club's extensive talent pool. Despite internal doubts about his chances, George impressed Chelsea's head coach Enzo Maresca during pre-season, securing his place in the first team. His rapid progress has significantly increased his estimated transfer value, reflecting his potential. George's success is attributed to a combination of his talent, dedicated personal coaching, and exposure to playing against older, more experienced players.</p>

The letters reflect a concern that the war's continuation does not contribute to its declared goals and endangers the lives of the hostages.

          <p>Scientists from the University of Glasgow have confirmed the continued rise of mosquitoes in Scotland, with more than 20 different species now identified, including some as far north as Shetland. This discovery is attributed to a successful citizen science project where the public reported sightings and photos of biting insects. Researchers found that mosquitoes were more prevalent than previously known, often mistaken for midges or clegs. The project also uses traps that lure insects with carbon dioxide, mimicking human breath, to monitor mosquito populations.</p>

          <p>The United States military, while possessing advanced equipment, lacks the necessary personnel and materiel to sustain a major war, according to Mackenzie Eaglen and Brady Africk. The armed forces are equipped for short, high-intensity conflicts but not for longer, more violent wars. Ukraine's fight against Russia and U.S. operations against the Houthis in Yemen highlight the demands of modern warfare. The authors argue that the U.S. has traded a larger, more durable military force for one that is high-tech but brittle, prioritizing expensive weapons over sufficient firepower.</p>

The central bank cited "trade and other policies" leading to a slowdown in overseas economies and a decline in domestic corporate profits.
