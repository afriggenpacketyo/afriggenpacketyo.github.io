          <p>The U.S. Senate has advanced a massive Republican-led spending and tax bill, a key legislative priority for President Trump's second term. The bill's centerpiece is making the 2017 tax cuts permanent, while also increasing funds for border security and defense, offset by cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs. The Senate version differs from the House-passed bill on key issues like Medicaid restrictions and the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, reflecting ongoing negotiations to secure final passage.

          <p>The UK government has announced a new strategy to tackle obesity by partnering with supermarkets and food manufacturers to make healthy options more appealing to consumers.

This approach is part of a wider 10-year plan for the NHS and aims to improve public health by making healthier eating more accessible and affordable.</p>

These questions explore whether partners feel they are on the same team during conflicts, can be their authentic selves, maintain genuine curiosity about each other, and consistently take accountability for their mistakes. According to the article, answering "no" to these questions can be a strong indicator of underlying unhappiness, even if it hasn't been consciously acknowledged by the individuals involved.</p>
