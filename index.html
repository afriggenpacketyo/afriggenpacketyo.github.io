          <p>As artificial intelligence rapidly advances, Hong Kong firms are being encouraged to proactively address AI security risks, particularly concerning personal data privacy. International declarations, such as the Bletchley Declaration and UN resolutions, emphasize the need for safe, secure, and trustworthy AI systems. China's Global AI Governance Initiative promotes a people-centered approach to AI development, highlighting the importance of balancing innovation with security. Organizations developing or using AI systems must prioritize data protection measures to mitigate risks like excessive data collection and unauthorized use.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A leaked memo indicates that Angela Rayner's department urged Chancellor Rachel Reeves to consider tax increases prior to the Spring Statement. The memo proposed various measures to raise ¬£3-4 billion annually, including increasing corporation tax on banks, extending the freeze on the 45% tax rate threshold, and reinstating the lifetime pensions allowance. While Reeves did not implement these suggestions, the memo highlights ongoing debates within the Labour party regarding tax and spending decisions, particularly in light of welfare cuts and defense spending increases. The discussion underscores internal tensions regarding fiscal policy and alternative funding strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thames Water has suspended its 'retention scheme' intended to award substantial bonuses to senior executives linked to securing a ¬£3 billion rescue loan. The decision follows criticism from Downing Street, which deemed rewarding executives for mismanagement as unacceptable. The company will await guidance from the regulator Ofwat to ensure its approach aligns with turnaround objectives and public expectations. This action comes amid heavy scrutiny of Thames Water's performance, marked by sewage discharges, leaks, and financial instability, as the government remains prepared to place the company under special administration. Regardless of the company's future, water supplies and waste services will continue uninterrupted.</p>

          <p>Pope Leo XIV, the first pope from the US, faces potential conflict with Maga Catholics due to his progressive stances. Some Maga figures view him as anti-Trump and aligned with Marxist ideologies. However, the new pope's selection signals a potential challenge to Trumpian nationalism within the Church. Drawing parallels with Leo XIII, the new pope aims to address issues like inequality, climate change, and migration, which are in direct contrast to the Maga worldview.</p>

          <p>The Tokyo metropolitan government will waive basic water utility charges for households for four months this summer in an effort to encourage residents to use air conditioning and stay cool amid increasingly extreme heat. The supplementary budget bill includes funds to cover the costs for about 8.2 million households. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike emphasized the need to protect residents' lives and daily living as real wages decline and predictions indicate an extremely hot summer. This measure aims to alleviate financial burden and promote public health during the summer months.</p>

          <p>Leanne Lucas, a survivor of the Southport stabbings, is advocating for the use of blunt-tipped kitchen knives to reduce the risk of serious injuries, stating she 'can't unsee' kitchen knife risks since the incident. She launched the 'Let's Be Blunt' campaign to promote a cultural shift towards safer alternatives in kitchens. Lucas's call for safer knives follows her personal experience of hyper-vigilance around knives after the attack that killed three children and injured several others. Knife crime is a complex societal issue, and design can make simple steps to dramatically improve safety.</p>

          <p>Japan's agriculture minister, Taku Eto, resigned after facing criticism for stating he had never bought rice, his nation's staple grain, because supporters gifted it to him. The comment drew attention to the government's inability to resolve the rice shortage, which has increased prices. Urban voters have chafed at the soaring prices and shortages, which at times have forced rationing by supermarkets. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba appointed Shinjiro Koizumi as the new agriculture minister.</p>

          <p>Scientists are warning that a 1,000-foot-tall 'mega tsunami' could potentially devastate parts of America's West Coast, Alaska, and Hawaii if a strong earthquake occurs along the Cascadia subduction zone. A recent study estimates a 15 percent chance of a magnitude 8.0 earthquake hitting the region within the next 50 years. Such an event could sink coastal land by as much as 6.5 feet and result in waves reaching extreme heights, leaving little time for adaptation or mitigation. The most severe effects are predicted for southern Washington, northern Oregon, and northern California.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has stated that the United States' export controls on artificial intelligence chips to China were 'a failure' as companies were turning to locally-developed cutting-edge technology. He said that companies would use the 'second best' option if they couldn't get chips from the American AI leader. The American action has also pushed China to aggressively invest and develop a supply chain that is not dependent on foreign manufacturers. Huang added that Nvidia's share of China's AI chip market had plummeted to 50 percent from nearly 95 percent at the beginning of former president Joe Biden's administration.</p>
