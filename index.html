          <p>A record high of 70 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children arrived in the care of Kent County Council in a single day, according to a recent report. This surge follows a period of lower arrival numbers in early 2025, which the council attributed to adverse weather and more accurate age assessments. Despite the earlier dip, officials warn that if the current high rate of arrivals continues, it could lead to an overall increase for the year, placing significant strain on local services. The development comes as organizations in France also report seeing more lone children from different nationalities attempting the crossing.</p>

          <h2>Newly Discovered Wooden Tools in China Point to an Ancient 'Wood Age'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 06:30:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study published in the journal Science reveals that wooden tools were widely used in southwest China 300,000 years ago, providing the first major evidence of an East Asian 'Wood Age.' Dozens of well-preserved wooden artifacts were unearthed at the Gantangqing site in Yunnan province, a location already recognized as a top archaeological discovery in China. This find is considered world-class because wood decomposes easily, leaving very few artifacts from the Paleolithic era. The discovery fills a significant gap in the archaeological record and reshapes understanding of early human technological development in the region.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, faced a massive overnight attack involving a record 550 drones and 11 missiles, causing at least 23 injuries and widespread damage to infrastructure and buildings. The assault occurred shortly after a phone call where Russian President Putin reportedly showed no interest in a truce proposed by U.S. President Trump. President Zelensky condemned the attack as cynical, highlighting Russia's lack of intent to end the war. He called on international allies to increase pressure on Moscow and impose greater sanctions in response to the escalating aggression.</p>

          <p>Experts from the UK Meteor Network suggest that pieces of a small meteor, which lit up the UK sky, have likely landed on or near Ben Nevis, Britain's highest mountain. The meteor, originating from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, was observed descending to about 12 miles above the ground, with residents reporting a bright glow and a loud bang. While finding the fragments in the vast, mountainous terrain will be difficult, the network has asked hillwalkers to be on the lookout for the space rocks, which could provide valuable scientific insights.</p>

          <p>A 68-year-old British woman and a 67-year-old New Zealander were killed by a charging elephant during a guided walking safari in Zambia's South Luangwa National Park. The female elephant, which was with its calf, trampled the two tourists to death despite attempts by tour guides to deter it by firing shots. Zambian authorities have previously warned tourists to exercise extreme caution, as female elephants are highly protective of their young. This tragic incident follows other fatal attacks on tourists in the southern African country over the past year.</p>

The goal is to create a community memorial with the salvaged chimneys, a logistically and financially challenging task that honors the memories of the homes and residents affected by the devastating fire and preserves the "patina of the fire" itself.</p>

          <p>India's securities regulator, SEBI, has temporarily banned U.S. trading firm Jane Street from its markets and frozen over $566 million in alleged illegal gains. The regulator accused the quantitative trading firm of a manipulative strategy involving large, coordinated trades in stocks and options to artificially influence India's benchmark Nifty 50 index for its own profit. SEBI stated the "intensity and sheer scale" of the trades lacked plausible economic rationale and that the firm's disregard for a prior warning showed it was not a "good faith actor."

          <p>This article explores the accessibility and inclusivity of clubbing through the experience of Felize, a 20-year-old wheelchair user who frequents Berlin's famous techno club, Berghain. While many clubs promote themselves as "safe spaces," Felize's story reveals both progress and persistent challenges, from physical barriers like stairs to social ones where people treat her and her wheelchair as an obstacle. She finds Berghain surprisingly accessible but advocates for greater empathy and visibility for people with disabilities in nightlife, wanting to be seen as just another person who loves to dance.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced it is consulting with other Palestinian groups before formally responding to the latest U.S.-backed proposal for a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza. The proposed 60-day truce would involve a staggered release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and an increase in humanitarian aid. A key sticking point remains Hamas's demand for a guarantee of a permanent end to the war. Meanwhile, Israel continues military operations and Prime Minister Netanyahu has reiterated his commitment to freeing all hostages and destroying Hamas's capabilities.</p>

          <p>A Missouri judge has once again blocked many of the state's abortion restrictions, including a near-total ban, by issuing a preliminary injunction. The judge ruled the laws likely violate a state constitutional right to abortion that was approved by voters in a ballot measure last year. This decision allows Planned Parenthood to resume procedural abortions in the state, though the state's Attorney General has vowed to appeal the ruling. The order marks the latest development in the protracted legal and political battle over abortion access in Missouri.</p>

          <p>Joey "Jaws" Chestnut, the dominant champion of competitive eating, is returning to the Nathan’s Fourth of July hot dog eating contest after a one-year ban. His exclusion in 2024 was due to a controversial deal to promote a rival brand of plant-based hot dogs, which created a conflict with the event's sponsor. The 16-time winner's return to the iconic Coney Island event is highly anticipated by fans and organizers, who see him as a larger-than-life figure central to the tradition and a symbol of the growing spectacle of the sport.</p>

          <p>Harvard economics professor Kenneth Rogoff states that the U.S. dollar is off to its weakest start to a year in half a century, a trend accelerated by President Trump's trade policies. The dollar has fallen significantly against other world currencies, making imports and foreign travel more expensive for Americans. Rogoff attributes the decline to a combination of factors, including trade wars, threats of taxes on foreign investment, and concerns over the rising U.S. budget deficit, which all make holding dollars less attractive to global investors.
