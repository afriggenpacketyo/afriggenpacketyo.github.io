          <p>Actresses Dakota and Elle Fanning reflect on their successful careers after starting as child stars, attributing their stability to a strong family bond and mutual support. In a recent interview, they emphasized a complete lack of professional competition, explaining that they view each other's successes as shared family achievements. The sisters noted that their desire to protect one another and carve out individual paths when younger has evolved into a deeply collaborative and supportive adult relationship, helping them navigate the pressures of Hollywood. This dynamic has allowed them to defy the common narrative of troubled young actors.</p>

Wright was one of the few who responded, leading to a decades-long bond built on mutual healing and understanding.

          <h2>Oregon Officials Condemn Trump's Directive to Deploy Federal Troops to Portland</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 10:54:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oregon Governor Tina Kotek and other Portland leaders have publicly pushed back against President Trump's order to send federal troops to the city, calling the move unwanted and unnecessary. In an open letter, officials argued that local law enforcement efforts have already led to a decrease in violent crime and that federal intervention would be counterproductive to the city's recovery. They drew parallels to the 2020 deployment of federal agents, which they claim inflamed tensions and harmed the community, urging the administration to cease its disparagement of Portland.</p>

          <p>The German government is planning to engage in direct talks with the Taliban in Afghanistan to establish a formal process for deporting Afghan criminals and individuals deemed security threats. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt stated that ministry officials are scheduled to travel to Kabul in October to negotiate the repatriations, which would utilize commercial flights. This policy shift marks a significant development, as Germany currently has no formal diplomatic ties with the ruling Taliban regime and has previously relied on intermediaries for such actions. The move is part of a broader push to more consistently enforce deportation orders for non-citizens convicted of crimes.</p>

Signs of additional weakness could strengthen the case for multiple rate cuts, while evidence of resilience might make the central bank more hesitant to ease its monetary policy further.

These expressions can set unrealistic expectations, de-prioritize your requests, and reduce your authority in a conversation.

          <p>The master of ceremonies hired to entertain the crowd at the Ryder Cup has resigned and apologized after she was recorded leading a profane chant against European golfer Rory McIlroy. Comedian Heather McMahan was attempting to build atmosphere on the first tee when she encouraged the chant, which contributed to what McIlroy later described as a "very, very challenging" and toxic environment. The incident led to increased security around McIlroy's group, and several spectators were evicted for personal abuse during the day's play.</p>

          <p>California is set for a special election in November on Proposition 50, a measure that would redraw the state's congressional maps mid-decade. The Democratic-led initiative is a direct response to Republican gerrymandering in states like Texas and aims to create up to five new Democratic-leaning districts. The proposal has ignited a fierce political battle, as it could unseat long-term Republican representatives like Doug LaMalfa and significantly impact the balance of power in the U.S. House of Representatives. Both parties are now mobilizing for a high-stakes campaign over the state's political future.</p>

          <p>With a government funding deadline looming, congressional Democrats are preparing for a potential shutdown, refusing to support any spending bill that does not reverse Republican-led cuts to healthcare programs. The Democratic ultimatum demands the restoration of funding for Medicaid and an extension of subsidies for Affordable Care Act (ACA) plans. This strategy frames the standoff as a fight over healthcare, an issue they believe provides them with significant political leverage. The move signals a refusal to concede to the Republican agenda, setting the stage for a high-stakes confrontation.</p>

          <p>China's new Type 076 amphibious assault ship, the Sichuan, is reportedly preparing to begin its first sea trials. Recent social media images show that covers have been removed from the vessel's advanced electromagnetic catapult system, fueling speculation that it is nearly ready for deployment. This ship is considered a significant asset for the PLA Navy's unmanned operations, as its launch system is designed for drones, leading many to describe it as the world's first dedicated drone carrier.

          <p>Music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs is scheduled to be sentenced next week after being convicted on two counts of transportation for engagement in prostitution. While he was acquitted of more serious charges, including sex-trafficking and racketeering, he still faces up to 20 years in prison. The charges stemmed from incidents where Combs arranged and paid for sex workers to travel for encounters with his girlfriends, which he would observe. Prosecutors are recommending a sentence of at least four to five years, while his defense team is arguing for a much shorter term.</p>
