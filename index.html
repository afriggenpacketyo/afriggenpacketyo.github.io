          <p>The Association of Volleyball Professionals (AVP) hosted a league event inside the Intuit Dome, the home of the NBA's Clippers, by trucking in 300 tons of sand. This move aimed to elevate the sport's professional image and attract a new, more diverse audience by creating a unique indoor spectacle. Players noted the different conditions, such as the lack of wind, which led to a faster, more power-focused game with tighter rallies. The event is seen as a potential blueprint for growing the sport beyond its traditional beach settings and reaching more fans who might not typically attend outdoor matches.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A proposal by a German education minister to consider a quota for students with immigrant backgrounds in schools has ignited a national debate. Proponents, like the German Teachers' Association, acknowledge the challenges of teaching in classes with many non-German speakers but question the feasibility of quotas, suggesting targeted funding is better. Critics, including school principals and student bodies, argue that such a policy would be discriminatory, stigmatizing, and counterproductive to social cohesion. The discussion highlights broader issues within Germany's education system, which has shown declining performance in international studies for all students.</p>

          <p>More than 24 hours after a major Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid on Glass House Farms in Camarillo, California, families are desperately searching for the nearly 200 arrested migrant workers and several protesters. Relatives and community organizations report that they have received no information on the whereabouts of the detained individuals, including a university professor who was arrested while demonstrating. Consulates for Mexico and Guatemala have been inundated with calls from concerned family members seeking information. The lack of communication from federal agencies has led to accusations of due process violations and created a climate of fear.</p>

According to the Department of Homeland Security, the individual was not being pursued by law enforcement at the time of the fall.

Although the lineup, led by a Shohei Ohtani home run, battled back to score seven runs against ace Logan Webb, they ultimately fell short.

          <p>This opinion article by Raja Shehadeh contends that Israel's proposed plan to move Palestinians into a secured camp in Rafah amounts to a concentration camp and a crime against humanity. The author argues that the international legal system has repeatedly failed to protect Palestinians, dating back to the 1948 Nakba, and that powerful nations' interests have prevented enforcement of international law. Despite this, the author finds hope in Palestinian resilience and "sumoud" (steadfastness), asserting that this spirit will endure. The piece concludes that when the war ends, it will be shared humanity, not legal institutions, that ultimately holds Israel and its allies accountable.</p>

A map provided by Israel reportedly showed a much larger "buffer zone" than previously discussed, which Hamas officials viewed as a bad-faith maneuver.

This trend is marked by deepening ties between tech firms and the US defense sector, potentially creating a class of "tech hawks" with a more interventionist foreign policy stance.

          <p>A preliminary report into the Air India Flight 171 crash that killed 260 people has revealed a baffling detail from the cockpit voice recorder. Seconds after takeoff, both of the Boeing 787's fuel-control switches were moved to the "cut-off" position, starving the engines of fuel. The recording captures one pilot asking the other why he cut the fuel, with the other denying he did so. Investigators are trying to determine if this was an intentional act or an unprecedented accident, as the switches are designed with safety locks to prevent such an occurrence. This finding deepens the mystery of the crash, which occurred just 40 seconds after the plane became airborne.</p>

          <p>Federal immigration authorities have confirmed the arrest of about 200 people suspected of being in the U.S. illegally during raids on two cannabis farm sites in Southern California. The operation, involving ICE and CBP, was conducted using criminal search warrants related to the harboring and employment of undocumented immigrants. The raids led to a tense standoff at one farm, where protesters clashed with agents, resulting in multiple injuries and four arrests for assault or resisting officers. A farm worker was also critically injured after a fall. The events have heightened fear in immigrant communities and prompted a federal judge to temporarily halt certain raid tactics.</p>

          <p>Chinese power bank manufacturers are facing intense scrutiny following several incidents where defective units caught fire on commercial flights. In response, China's Civil Aviation Administration (CAAC) issued an emergency ban, prohibiting passengers from carrying power banks that do not have the mandatory "3C" safety certification mark. This rule has caused confusion and led to large numbers of power banks being abandoned at airports. The ban follows earlier regulations that already prohibited the charging of these devices during flights. The State Administration for Market Regulation is now conducting a comprehensive review of power bank products, expected to conclude soon.</p>

          <p>Health officials in Coconino County, Arizona, have confirmed that a local resident has died from pneumonic plague, a rare but serious bacterial infection. This marks the first recorded death from this form of the plague in the county since 2007. While plague is treatable with modern antibiotics, the pneumonic form, which infects the lungs, is the most deadly and the most easily spread between people. The bacteria is naturally present in rodent populations, such as prairie dogs, and can be transmitted to humans through infected flea bites or by handling infected animals. Officials did not release further details about the victim.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the global market for weight-loss drugs like Ozempic is projected to reach $150 billion, Chinese pharmaceutical firms are poised to enter the competition with at least 60 similar drugs currently under trial. The patent for semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, is set to expire in China in 2026, much earlier than in other markets. This will likely open the door for many Chinese companies to launch cheaper, generic versions of the drug, significantly increasing affordability and access for patients. The development reflects a major push by China's domestic drug industry to capture a share of this lucrative market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 39-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder and arson after allegedly setting a San Joaquin County probation officer on fire. The incident occurred when the suspect entered the adult probation office with a gas can and a lighter, prompting a security alert. When officers confronted the man in a nearby parking lot, a struggle ensued during which the suspect ignited the fuel, causing significant burns to one officer's arms. The officer's injuries are not believed to be life-threatening. The suspect, who was on supervision for a prior firearm felony, was also injured and taken into custody after the flames were extinguished.</p>

The terminal operator, International Transportation Service, will add 19 acres of new land and extend the quay to accommodate larger container ships, aiming to boost cargo capacity by 50%. Officials acknowledged the current challenging trade environment but expressed confidence in the long-term need for enhanced infrastructure, citing lessons learned from persevering through the pandemic.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As part of a broader Trump administration initiative to reduce the federal workforce, the U.S. State Department has laid off more than 1,000 employees. The involuntary cuts included 1,107 civil service and 246 foreign service staff members, following over 1,500 voluntary departures earlier in the year. Critics, including Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, argue that these indiscriminate cuts undermine national security. The layoffs have reportedly impacted key areas, such as the bureau responsible for refugee resettlement. The move is part of a campaign promise to cut government spending and follows a Supreme Court decision allowing the plan to proceed.</p>
