          <p>New Jersey Representative LaMonica McIver has been charged by the DOJ with assaulting law enforcement officers outside an ICE detention facility. Acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba stated that McIver assaulted, impeded, and interfered with law enforcement during a protest on May 9. McIver claims the charges are politically motivated and mischaracterize her actions. Top House Democrats have defended McIver, vowing to respond vigorously to what they see as an abuse of power, while charges against Newark's Mayor Baraka were dropped.</p>

          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, saw its shares jump as much as 14% in its Hong Kong trading debut. The IPO raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion), reportedly making it the largest global listing in 2025. CATL plans to use 90% of the funds to build a factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive clients. Despite facing scrutiny from the U.S. and EU due to trade tensions and alleged military links, CATL's net profit increased by 15% year over year, though annual revenue dropped slightly due to intense competition in China.</p>

The NTSB is working with Mexican counterparts to inspect the engine, interview crew members, and recover data recorders, with a preliminary report expected within 30 days.

          <p>China experienced a net capital inflow of US$17.3 billion into its bond and equities markets in April, despite the ongoing trade war initiated by former U.S. President Donald Trump. This contrasts with market concerns over rising Treasury yields and Moody's downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating. Analysts suggest this reflects a shift away from U.S. dollar assets, driven by China's economic recovery and a weaker U.S. dollar. Bank of America analysts noted that the U.S. downgrade and bond yield increases signal a favorable environment for emerging markets like China.</p>

          <p>Ruth López, a leading human rights activist in El Salvador, has been arrested on charges of embezzlement of state funds, which her organization Cristosal denies, claiming the charges are politically motivated. López, known for criticizing President Nayib Bukele and documenting human rights abuses, was arrested amid a growing crackdown on dissent in the country. Cristosal denounced her arrest as "short-term enforced disappearance" and international human rights organizations have condemned the arrest, expressing concern over the increasingly pervasive environment of fear in El Salvador.</p>

          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson faces challenges in passing President Trump's tax and budget bill due to deep divisions among House Republicans. Conservatives are pushing for more spending cuts, while moderates oppose Medicaid reductions. The bill also faces opposition from Republicans in high-tax states over state and local tax deductions, as well as disagreements over clean energy tax credits. With a narrow majority, Johnson can only afford to lose a few Republican votes, making it difficult to pass the bill by the Memorial Day deadline.</p>

          <p>A new EU deal reminds us of the UK's uneasy relationship with its neighbors, existing both as members and non-members of the European Union. The government calls it a "reset," but this resetting is likely permanent, with the current trajectory leaning toward a closer relationship. However, some Brexiteers find parts thin and oversold, seeing it as a breach of a crucial principle: accepting "dynamic alignment" in some areas. This trade-off involves making trade easier at the expense of handing over some power.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to accept a free luxury Boeing 747-8 from Qatar to serve as Air Force One has raised ethical and financial questions. Despite a $3.9 billion contract with Boeing for new Air Force One jets, delays prompted Trump to seek a quicker solution. The proposed gift from Qatar, facilitated by Trump's Middle East envoy, Steven Witkoff, has drawn criticism for potentially currying favor with the administration. The plan involves refitting the plane for presidential use, but significant costs and practical challenges remain, raising doubts about its feasibility and purpose.</p>
