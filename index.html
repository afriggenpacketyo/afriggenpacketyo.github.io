        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Manchester City defender Nedum Onuoha praised the new Champions League format, highlighting the increased number of good games and significant moments, noting that teams only played each other once in the league stage, altering the energy and stakes. Journalist Nicky Bandini pointed out that the format benefited PSG, allowing them to progress and develop throughout the season, which they might not have been able to do under the old system. Onuoha added that PSG's journey shows that finding form at the right time is crucial, as they were outside the top 24 until their penultimate game and successfully navigated the play-off stage. The new format emphasizes the importance of timing and allows for more entertaining journeys for teams, as seen with PSG's unexpected path to victory.</p>

          <p>Dallas Wings player DiJonai Carrington expressed her frustration on social media after referees called security on her during a heated argument in a game against the Chicago Sky. Carrington suggested the summoning of security was a "microaggression," while former Wings player Cheryl Swoopes criticized the referee's actions, stating that if the referee felt scared, they should not be allowed to officiate again. Carrington was previously involved in controversy when she poked Caitlin Clark in the eye during a game last season and later appeared to make light of the incident. Carrington has also expressed political views, including wearing a shirt with an anti-Trump message and calling for WNBA players to take action in response to President Trump's policies. </p>

          <p>A Singapore-based quantum researcher, Alexander Miller, has warned that Chinaâ€™s quantum satellite, Micius, could be hacked due to tiny delays between its onboard lasers. These delays could be exploited by eavesdroppers in an attack, potentially compromising the security of quantum key distribution (QKD). While QKD is theoretically unhackable, realistic devices can be vulnerable to side-channel attacks that rely on flaws in experimental implementation. Miller's analysis of communication data between a ground station and Micius revealed time delays, suggesting the distribution of quantum keys from the satellite was insecure.</p>

          <p>A confidential report by the United Nations nuclear watchdog reveals that Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, prompting calls for Tehran to cooperate with the agency's probe. As of May 17, Iran possessed 900.8 pounds of uranium enriched up to 60%, a significant increase since February. The IAEA has expressed serious concern, noting that Iran is the only non-nuclear-weapon state producing such material. The report also estimates Iran's overall stockpile of enriched uranium at 20,387.4 pounds, raising international concerns about potential proliferation implications.</p>

Defence Secretary John Healey emphasized that the war in Ukraine highlighted the need for a strong industrial base to support the military, strengthening the UK's security and economy.

          <p>UFC Hall of Famer B.J. Penn was arrested for the third time in six days in Hawaii, related to his claims that his family has been replaced with imposters. This arrest stemmed from Penn failing to appear in court, violating his bail agreement, following previous arrests for abuse of a family member. Penn's mother, Lorraine Shin, has filed a restraining order against him, alleging psychological abuse and accusing him of believing she is an imposter. Shin suspects Penn suffers from Capgras syndrome, a delusional disorder, and Penn has made multiple social media posts alleging his family has been murdered and replaced.</p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton has criticized the introduction of a new rule clamping down on front wing flexibility at the Spanish Grand Prix, calling it a "waste of money." The FIA imposed a stiffer load test on front wings to limit aerodynamic exploitation, but Hamilton stated the change had no impact and everyone had to spend more money to make new wings. He said the change was barely noticeable and the money could have been donated to charity instead. The FIA delayed the rule's implementation expecting teams to introduce new front wings anyway as part of development programs.</p>
