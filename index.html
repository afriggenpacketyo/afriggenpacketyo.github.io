        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republican Senator Ron Johnson has strongly criticized President Trump's proposed spending bill, labeling it as "immoral" and "grotesque" due to its potential to significantly increase the national debt. Johnson expressed his unwillingness to support the bill without substantial revisions, citing concerns about the burden it would place on future generations. He suggested splitting the bill into separate parts, although Trump insists on passing his agenda as a single package. Johnson's opposition, along with other fiscal conservatives, could jeopardize the bill's passage in the Senate, where Republicans hold a narrow majority. Optimism surrounding this bill is relatively low as fiscal conservatives have concerns.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has released an estimate stating that President Trump's tariffs are projected to negatively impact the U.S. economy by shrinking GDP growth by 0.06% annually, while also increasing inflation by an average of 0.4 percentage points in 2025 and 2026. However, the CBO also projects that tariff revenues would reduce the federal deficit by $2.8 trillion over the next decade. The analysis accounts for retaliatory tariffs from other countries and incorporates the uncertainty stemming from recent tariff changes; ultimately, the CBO letter responds to a request for information from Senate Democrats.

          <p>The Trump administration is intensifying its efforts to address antisemitism at Columbia University by notifying the institution's accrediting body that the university is failing to meet accreditation standards. This action follows the cancellation of $400 million in federal grants due to Columbia's alleged failure to protect Jewish students from antisemitic harassment. Columbia has taken steps to overhaul its policies regarding protests, safety, and security, including adopting a new campus-wide definition of antisemitism. The Education Department is now scrutinizing Columbia's compliance with accreditation standards, including federal civil rights laws, and the university recently cut around 180 staff positions in response to the revoked grants.</p>

          <p>Unexploded bombs from past conflicts continue to pose a global threat, as evidenced by the recent evacuation in Cologne, Germany, to defuse three World War II-era bombs. This issue is prevalent in many countries, including France, Belgium, Poland, and Ukraine, where unexploded ordnance from various wars endangers lives and hinders development. In Ukraine, a quarter of the country is contaminated with mines and other explosive devices, leading to civilian casualties and agricultural disruption. The disposal of these explosives is costly and complex, requiring advanced technology and posing significant risks.</p>

          <p>Following an hour-long conversation with Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin indicated that Russia "will have to respond" to Ukraine's recent drone attacks on Russian airfields. Trump, who claimed he could end the Ukraine war quickly, did not discourage retaliation, and Putin offered to participate in U.S. talks with Iran regarding its nuclear program. Putin ruled out a comprehensive ceasefire, while Zelenskyy dismissed Moscow's peace proposals as an "ultimatum," though progress was signaled on issues like prisoner exchanges and the return of abducted children. The conversation between Trump and Putin highlights the ongoing tensions and complexities in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.</p>

Authorities said Park and Bartkus shared extremist beliefs, motivated by a pro-mortalism, anti-natalism, and anti-pro-life ideology. Park also allegedly possessed recipes to create a bomb similar to the one used in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.</p>
