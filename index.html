            <p>A coalition of small U.S. businesses has filed a lawsuit against President Trump, contesting the legality of his recently imposed tariffs on foreign imports. The lawsuit argues that Trump is overstepping his authority by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to justify the tariffs, claiming that trade deficits do not constitute a national emergency. The businesses, which span various sectors, argue that these tariffs, dubbed 'Liberation Day tariffs,' are devastating their operations and violating the principle of taxation with representation. The Liberty Justice Center is representing the businesses in this legal challenge. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in a Washington, D.C., courtroom in a landmark antitrust trial where the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is challenging Meta's ownership of Instagram and WhatsApp. The FTC alleges that Meta's acquisitions of these platforms stifle competition and give it excessive control over the social media market. Zuckerberg defended the acquisitions, arguing that Instagram and WhatsApp have thrived under Meta's ownership. The FTC seeks to force Meta to divest Instagram and WhatsApp and to require prior notice for future mergers and acquisitions. The trial is expected to last several weeks.</p>

The Trump administration's demands were part of a review of nearly $9 billion in federal funding for the school, putting this funding at risk.

            <p>President Trump is considering a temporary pause on auto tariffs to allow car manufacturers time to adjust their supply chains and relocate production to the United States. Automakers have expressed concerns about the complexity of their supply chains, which are tightly interwoven with other nations, making it difficult to manufacture vehicles entirely within the U.S. Experts predict that the 25% tariffs on foreign-made cars could significantly increase car prices, potentially by thousands of dollars. Trump has previously reversed course on tariffs, leading to market volatility and raising concerns about a potential recession. (not investment advice)</p>
