          <p>Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist, led the New York City Democratic primary, potentially becoming the city's first Muslim mayor. Former Governor Andrew Cuomo conceded after Mamdani secured 43.5% of the vote with 90% counted. New York City utilizes a ranked-choice voting system, meaning the Board of Elections will tally second-choice candidates, likely benefiting Mamdani due to his cross-endorsement with Brad Lander. Given the city's Democratic lean, the primary winner is likely to win the mayoral election in November, marking a significant shift in the city's political landscape.</p>

          <p>The New York City mayoral primary is being closely watched nationally as a battle between the Democratic Party's left-wing and moderate factions. Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, is challenging former Governor Andrew Cuomo, viewed as the establishment candidate. Mamdani's platform focuses on affordability, including free public buses and universal childcare, but critics question the feasibility of his ambitious promises. With ranked-choice voting in place, the outcome remains uncertain, but the race highlights the ongoing internal struggle within the Democratic Party to define its future direction.</p>

          <p>Edward Coristine, a 19-year-old with the nickname "Big Balls," has resigned from his post at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), following Elon Musk's departure. Coristine, a software developer, gained attention for his irreverent nickname and his work investigating wasteful spending in the federal government. He claimed to have found a multitude of outgoing payments from the Treasury Department lacking details about their recipients or purpose, describing the system as lacking accountability. DOGE has reportedly achieved roughly $180 billion in savings through various cost-cutting measures since its inception.</p>

The arrest follows other recent incidents of individuals posing as law enforcement officers in California and comes amid concerns about ICE raids involving agents without clear identification.

          <p>An initial classified assessment indicates that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities have set back Tehran's nuclear program by months, not obliterated it as President Trump claimed. The Defense Intelligence Agency assessment found that entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities were sealed off, but the underground infrastructure remains largely intact. Some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was reportedly moved before the strikes, and the White House has disputed the assessment. A classified briefing for Congress was cancelled, but lawmakers are scheduled to be briefed later in the week.</p>

          <p>The UK's Climate Change Committee reports that more people are buying electric cars and installing heat pumps, but further increases are needed to meet net-zero targets. The government needs to ensure households benefit from cleaner technologies through lower bills, and the committee argues that achieving net zero by 2050 is achievable and could bring long-term economic benefits. While electric car sales are rising, heat pump sales remain below target, and electricity costs need to be addressed to make these technologies more affordable. The committee suggests removing charges from electricity bills to support renewable energy projects.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iran, the FBI is refocusing on counter-terrorism efforts and immigration officials have arrested 11 Iranian citizens in the U.S., some with alleged ties to Iran's military and paramilitary groups. While there is no specific threat, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security have briefed state leaders and law enforcement agencies about the heightened threat environment. The arrests were part of President Trump's efforts to deport immigrants in the U.S. illegally, and some FBI personnel have been reassigned from immigration enforcement to counter-terrorism roles. Since the U.S. involvement in Iran, police patrols have been increased at sensitive sites nationwide.</p>

The assessment, by the U.S. Central Command and the Defense Intelligence Agency, concluded that the strikes did not completely destroy Iran's nuclear program but likely set it back by a few months. Witkoff also assured that the ceasefire between Israel and Iran is holding and said it’s “not even conceivable” that Iran could resume its nuclear enrichment program within a matter of months.</p>

          <p>Chinese astronomers have used the slowing spin of dying stars to understand how stars are born, finding that stars born today spin much faster than those formed billions of years ago. Using data from Europe's Gaia space telescope, researchers studied thousands of stars and found that newly formed stars spin up to 10 times faster than older ones. The extra spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to form, providing evidence that the galaxy's star-forming clouds have grown more turbulent over time.</p>

          <p>UK newspapers report on the UK purchasing new fighter jets capable of carrying nuclear bombs, a move described as the biggest expansion of the deterrent since the Cold War. Headlines also focus on President Trump's use of profanity during peacemaking efforts in the Israel-Iran conflict. Other stories include England's cricket victory over India, Sir Keir Starmer's stance on welfare bill, and the unveiling of the UK's National Security Strategy, which prepares for potential wartime threats. The Daily Mail also features details about Jeff Bezos' wedding, while the Sun investigates illegal migrant food delivery riders.</p>

          <p>President Trump reacted furiously after an Israel-Iran ceasefire he brokered was violated, using profanity and criticizing both sides. A Pentagon report indicated that U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities were not as successful as Trump claimed, setting back the program by months rather than obliterating it. ICE is arresting an increasing number of immigrants without criminal records, and a Department of Justice leader reportedly suggested defying courts over deportations. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended holding interest rates after renewed attacks from Trump.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, but voiced frustration with both countries for violating the agreement shortly after it was announced. He accused Israel of launching a major bombing campaign after the deal was made and said both countries didn't know what they were doing. Following a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, bombardments appeared to cease. The conflict between Israel and Iran has resulted in at least 1,000 deaths, and drones have hit bases in Iraq housing U.S. troops.</p>

The Clouatres filed a motion to reopen the case, and the agency posted on social media about Paola Clouatre's case, writing that when Clouatre "was apprehended by @CBP and ordered removed by a judge in 2018, she chose to defy the order and stay in the U.S. 7 years later, she had another bad idea and applied for a Green Card. @ICEgov took her into custody at our New Orleans office. @DHSgov has a long memory and no tolerance for defiance when it comes to making America safe again."</p>
