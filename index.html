          <p>A devastating house fire in Brent, north-west London, resulted in the deaths of a 43-year-old woman and three children aged 15, 8, and 4. Emergency services responded to the blaze in Tillett Close, Stonebridge, where they discovered the victims. A 41-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in custody, while two other women were taken to hospital. The London Fire Brigade extinguished the fire, which involved two terraced houses, and police and fire services are investigating the cause of the blaze, with neighbors expressing their shock and grief over the 'extremely tragic incident'.</p>

          <p>Applications from American citizens seeking British citizenship or indefinite residency in the UK have reached a record high, with over 6,000 applications in the year leading up to March. The surge in applications, particularly at the start of 2025, coincides with Donald Trump's second presidency and a perceived polarized political climate in the US. While some immigration lawyers cite political conditions as a factor, the majority of settlement applications are from individuals eligible through spousal or family links. The UK government is considering provisions to expedite qualification based on contributions, while also introducing stricter language requirements.</p>

          <p>Security researchers have uncovered over 19 billion leaked passwords from hundreds of breaches between April 2024 and April 2025, with a staggering 94% being reused or predictable. The most common passwords, such as '123456' and 'password', remain prevalent despite years of warnings. Experts emphasize the importance of using password managers to generate complex passwords and enabling two-factor authentication to protect online accounts. Additionally, users are advised to keep software updated, avoid downloading from untrusted sources, and consider personal data removal services to minimize the risk of credential stuffing and account compromise.</p>

          <p>The United States is developing next-generation fighter jets and unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs), also known as 'loyal wingmen,' to potentially offset China's numerical advantage in fleet size. General David Allvin, chief of staff of the US Air Force, highlighted the cost-effectiveness and lethality of the collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) program. The UCAVs, developed by General Atomics and Anduril, are undergoing ground testing for propulsion, avionics, and autonomy integration, with flight testing expected later in the year. These drones are intended to augment crewed fighter aircraft in air-to-air missions and strike missions.</p>

          <p>A major power outage affected southeastern France, causing disruptions to traffic and briefly halting events at the Cannes Film Festival. Approximately 160,000 households in the Alpes-Maritimes department lost electricity after a high-voltage line failure. The outage occurred shortly after a fire at an electrical substation near Cannes had already weakened the grid. While the Palais des Festivals switched to an independent power supply, screenings at the Cineum were temporarily suspended.

          <p>President Donald Trump delivered the commencement address to the U.S. Military Academy graduates at West Point, amid his administration's rollback of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs.

Critics, including former West Point teachers, argue that these programs do not undermine the academy's values. Two protests were planned during the ceremony to voice opposition to these policies.

          <p>Whitehall insiders are preparing for a difficult spending review as the UK government aims to set budgets through 2029, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves seeking to balance spending priorities. While overall government spending is increasing due to tax rises, significant cash injections for health and defense are creating a squeeze on day-to-day spending in other departments. The Treasury is expected to be tight on daily expenses but more generous with capital spending, leading to potential cuts in public services like policing and education. Tensions are rising over council budgets, affordable housing, and plans to improve police performance.</p>

          <p>President Trump addressed the 2025 graduating class at West Point, marking his first military commencement address of his second term. This address occurred amid a backdrop of controversy, as West Point complies with the Trump administration's executive order banning diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. The U.S. military academy disbanded a dozen cadet clubs formed around race and gender, and faculty members have resigned in protest. The president's address follows Vice President Vance's speech at the U.S. Naval Academy, emphasizing a shift in foreign policy against open-ended conflicts.</p>

          <p>A Republican tax bill threatens to derail the U.S. clean energy boom by terminating key tax credits for renewable energy projects. The bill would eliminate investment and electricity production credits for clean energy facilities, potentially causing a significant decline in clean energy deployment. The legislation also restricts tax credits for projects sourcing materials from foreign entities, primarily targeting China. Industry leaders warn of job losses and increased electricity costs, while analysts anticipate a substantial slowdown in clean energy additions to the grid if the bill becomes law.</p>

          <p>Republicans in the House rushed President Donald Trump's 'big, beautiful bill' through the chamber, facing criticism for procedural missteps similar to those they had previously accused Democrats of committing. The 1,100-page bill was approved on a party-line vote with limited time for review. Critics, including some Republicans, raised concerns about the speed and lack of transparency in the process. Despite these concerns, the GOP succeeded in pressuring members to vote quickly, aiming for Trump to sign the bill into law by July 4.</p>

          <p>Violent crime rates in the US are experiencing a significant decline, returning to pre-pandemic levels after a spike in 2020. The FBI's 2023 crime report indicates a nearly 12% decrease in murders year over year, with further declines in 2024 and early 2025. Cities like Baltimore, once synonymous with violent crime, have seen homicides fall to decade lows. Factors contributing to this decline include the easing of pandemic-related stressors and government initiatives aimed at reducing community violence. Despite these positive trends, public perception often lags behind reality, with many Americans still believing that crime is on the rise.</p>

By focusing on Devon, a working-class outsider, the series dissects the bought intimacies of the wealthy. While the series is entertaining, its strength lies in its exploration of power dynamics and the complexities of female relationships within the upper class.</p>
