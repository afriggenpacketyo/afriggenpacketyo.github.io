          <h2>Poll Indicates American Disapproval of Trump's Tariff Policies</h2>

          <p>A recent poll reveals that 59% of Americans disapprove of President Trump's decision to increase tariffs on imported goods, reflecting growing concerns about the economic impact of the ongoing trade war with China. Despite Trump's assurances of being "nice," China has criticized the U.S. for coercion and threats, while stocks experienced volatility amidst fears of Trump potentially firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Although the president stated he would not fire Powell, the uncertainty surrounding trade policies and leadership at the Federal Reserve continues to weigh on market sentiment.

          <p>Artificial intelligence is enabling scammers to create convincing fake profiles and apply for remote jobs, leading to potential security breaches and financial losses for companies. Scammers use AI to generate fake resumes, professional headshots, and LinkedIn profiles, and can even use deepfake technology during interviews. Experts estimate that one in four job applicants could be fake by 2028, prompting companies to implement more rigorous screening processes, including in-person interviews, to combat this growing threat. The Justice Department has uncovered networks using these tactics to funnel money to North Korea's military programs.</p>

          <p>The Jones Road Wildfire in Ocean County, New Jersey, has burned through 12,500 acres and is approximately 40% contained, prompting evacuations and a state of emergency. While some 5,000 residents have been allowed to return home, the fire destroyed a business and threatened numerous structures, with no injuries reported. Fire officials expect the acreage to increase as they work towards full containment, potentially making it the largest wildfire in New Jersey in 20 years.</p>

          <p>Google is requiring some remote employees to return to the office three days a week or risk losing their jobs, citing the importance of in-person collaboration. This change affects employees previously approved for remote work and comes as Google aims to cut costs and invest in artificial intelligence. Some remote staffers were offered voluntary buyouts as an alternative to returning to the office, reflecting a broader trend of companies tightening remote work restrictions.</p>

          <h2>Tesla Stock Rises Despite Weak Earnings</h2>

          <p>Tesla shares experienced a surge despite reporting weak first-quarter earnings, driven by CEO Elon Musk's suggestion that he will spend more time at the company and optimism regarding potential tariff reductions. The stock's initial jump followed President Trump's signals that duties on China will not be as high as 145% and his commitment to not fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The electric vehicle maker reported a 20% year-over-year drop in automotive revenue and a 71% decline in net income. (not investment advice)</p>
