        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An op-ed argues the U.S. is critically vulnerable due to China's dominance over the rare earth metals market, which are essential for defense and technology sectors. Despite years of warnings, the U.S. has failed to build a secure, independent supply chain, leaving it exposed to China's ability to weaponize this dependence through export controls. A recent six-month reprieve on export licenses is seen as a temporary "stress test" rather than a solution, demanding a long-term, unified national strategy to build domestic capacity and strengthen alliances. The article stresses that without urgent, coherent action, the U.S. risks falling further behind in this crucial geopolitical power struggle.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is taking steps to dismantle federal energy efficiency regulations, including the popular Energy Star program, which helps consumers identify energy-saving appliances. The move has drawn criticism from consumer groups and some manufacturers who argue it could lead to higher utility bills and remove a trusted tool for comparison shopping. Proponents of the deregulation claim it will lower appliance costs and increase personal choice, while opponents warn of a "buyer beware" market and the loss of billions in collective energy savings. The future of these programs may hinge on legal challenges, as federal law contains provisions against rolling back established standards.</p>

          <p>The recently designated SÃ¡ttÃ­tla Highlands national monument in Northern California, a sacred site for the Pit River Tribe, faces an uncertain future following threats from the Trump administration to rescind its protections. The area, vital for its ecological and cultural significance, was protected by President Biden to prevent industrial development and preserve its natural state. While legal experts question a president's authority to abolish monuments, the administration's stance has created a new battle for the tribe and environmental groups. The situation highlights the clash between conservation efforts, Indigenous rights, and a pro-energy political agenda.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly called for a ceasefire agreement in Gaza to secure the return of hostages, amid an ongoing 20-month conflict. His call comes as the Israeli military issued new mass evacuation orders for several neighborhoods in northern Gaza due to escalating attacks. Despite recent talks and a potential visit by Prime Minister Netanyahu to Washington, a deal remains stalled over the fundamental disagreement on whether a ceasefire would lead to a permanent end to the war. The article also notes Trump's criticism of the corruption trial against Netanyahu, which he claims interferes with negotiations.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have released an updated version of President Trump's major legislative package, which aims to make his 2017 tax cuts permanent while also addressing spending on border security, defense, and energy. The bill includes controversial provisions such as new restrictions on Medicaid and food stamps, an increased cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, and a $5 trillion raise to the debt ceiling. As the legislation moves through the Senate via the reconciliation process, GOP leaders are navigating internal party dynamics and the constraints of Senate rules to secure its passage before a July 4th target.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly criticized and threatened a primary challenge against Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina for opposing his signature tax and spending bill. Tillis, along with Senator Rand Paul, voted against advancing the legislation, citing concerns over proposed Medicaid cuts that he argued would harm his state's hospitals and rural communities. In response, Trump accused Tillis of grandstanding and announced he would meet with potential challengers for his 2026 re-election bid. The incident highlights the internal divisions within the GOP and the president's willingness to enforce party loyalty.</p>

          <p>A new biography examines the life and influence of William F. Buckley Jr., the founder of National Review and host of "Firing Line," who is credited with catalyzing the modern conservative movement in America. The article details how Buckley's intellectual and cultural politics elevated figures like Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan, reshaping the Republican Party. It explores the line from Buckley's foundational work to the rise of President Donald Trump, suggesting that Trump's anti-elite populism has roots in the critique of liberalism that Buckley championed decades ago. The analysis portrays Buckley's legacy as complex, blending civility with a movement that ultimately led to today's political landscape.</p>

          <p>The UK government has significantly altered its welfare reform bill after facing a substantial rebellion from over 120 of its own Labour backbench MPs. Health Secretary Wes Streeting acknowledged that the initial plans, which included cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (PIP), were mishandled and that the government has now shifted its approach. Key concessions include limiting PIP cuts to new claimants and allowing the health-related component of Universal Credit to rise with inflation for existing recipients. Rebel MPs have indicated they are now likely to support the bill, averting a major defeat for the prime minister but raising questions about his leadership.</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Identify Waiting Too Long to Save as the Top Retirement Planning Mistake</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to financial experts, the most significant mistake Americans make when planning for retirement is simply waiting too long to begin saving. Procrastination during one's 20s and 30s, often with the intention of starting after earning more or paying off debt, results in the loss of decades of potential compound interest growth. Another critical error is focusing solely on a total savings number rather than creating a reliable income strategy for retirement. Experts advise starting immediately, even with small amounts, to build the habit and take advantage of employer matches and the power of long-term investing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Postal Service is alerting Americans to a "brushing" scam where they receive unsolicited packages containing low-value items they didn't order. This scheme is used by third-party sellers to post fake "verified" reviews to boost their product ratings, but it's also a major red flag that the recipient's personal information, including their name and address, has been compromised. Officials warn that this data could be used for broader identity theft or credit fraud. Consumers who receive such packages are advised to report the incident, monitor their financial accounts, and update their passwords.</p>

Khosrowshahi also addressed the future of the company, including the expansion of robotaxi services, which he believes can grow alongside human driving for the next decade. The CEO, an immigrant from Iran, also spoke on the importance of the U.S. remaining a welcoming country for those seeking to build a life.</p>

This growing depth of talent is attributed to factors like Andy Murray's inspiring success, improved training facilities, and players developing through the U.S. college system.

He emphasized that while capabilities at sites like Fordo and Natanz were importantly set back, the knowledge and industrial capacity remain, making a diplomatic solution essential. Grossi expressed concern over a new Iranian law that could suspend cooperation with inspectors and the uncertainty surrounding the location of nearly 900 pounds of highly enriched uranium.

The plan, part of a broader 10-year NHS strategy, aims to tackle rising obesity rates, which cost the health service Â£11 billion annually.

          <p>Thousands of Chinese immigrants in Taiwan face a looming deadline to provide proof that they have canceled their household registration in mainland China, or risk losing their Taiwanese residency and facing potential deportation. The policy, part of a broader set of national security measures by President Lai Ching-te's administration, has caused distress and uncertainty for many who have lived in Taiwan for decades. While the government cites national security and risk management, critics argue the implementation is rushed, unfair, and stigmatizes a community caught in cross-strait tensions.

          <p>A psychologist who studies couples suggests that answering "no" to four specific questions may indicate underlying unhappiness in a relationship, even if it's not consciously recognized. These questions probe whether partners feel they are on the same team during conflicts, can be their authentic selves, are genuinely curious about each other's inner worlds, and take accountability for their mistakes. According to research, negative answers in these areas can point to a lack of emotional intimacy, trust, and teamwork. The article advises that if these core components are missing, it may be time for couples to reflect on their connection.</p>

The text on the shirt described the soldiers' adversaries as "warring Indians" and "Mexican revolutionaries," language that many have condemned as anti-Indigenous and a harmful framing of American history. The incident has sparked a discussion on social media about the complex legacy of the Buffalo Soldiers, who fought against Indigenous peoples during the US's westward expansion.

          <p>An in-depth article explores the concept of "sludge," the intentional administrative friction that companies and institutions create to impede customers, such as endless phone trees, dropped calls, and confusing procedures. This weaponized inefficiency is often a deliberate strategy to save money by making it too difficult for consumers to get refunds, appeal claims, or cancel services, leading to a state of weary resignation. Experts explain that this system prioritizes short-term metrics over long-term loyalty, with agents trained to follow policies that discourage helping people.
