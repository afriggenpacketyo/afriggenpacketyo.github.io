          <p>A bipartisan group of U.S. House members introduced legislation to strengthen border security by identifying and tracking potential terrorists from Syria before they reach the U.S. The bill mandates that the Department of Homeland Security evaluate threats originating from Syria, focusing on individuals with ties to terrorist organizations. This initiative comes after recent regime changes in Syria raised concerns about the country's evolving political landscape and the presence of terrorist groups.</p>
