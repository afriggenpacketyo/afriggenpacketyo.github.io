          <p>The Texas Senate has passed a new congressional map designed to increase the number of Republican-leaning districts by five, a move backed by former President Trump to bolster the GOP's standing before the 2026 midterms. The approval came after a contentious period where Texas Democrats fled the state to break quorum and stall the vote, generating national attention. Despite Democratic accusations that the map is racially discriminatory and illegal, the measure now heads to Governor Greg Abbott's desk for his signature. This action has prompted a counter-redistricting effort in California, setting up a larger political battle over congressional power.</p>

          <p>The Texas legislature has given its final approval to a redrawn congressional map that heavily favors the Republican party, potentially adding up to five GOP seats in the U.S. House. The bill, which now awaits Governor Greg Abbott's expected signature, was passed despite a two-week walkout by state Democrats who fled to deny a quorum. Democrats have condemned the map, alleging it violates the Voting Rights Act by diluting the influence of minority voters, and have vowed to challenge it in court. The move is part of a broader, unusual mid-decade redistricting push ahead of the upcoming midterm elections.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant political battle over congressional power is unfolding between Texas and California, the nation's two most populous states. Texas Republicans initiated an unusual mid-decade redistricting effort to create five new GOP-leaning congressional seats, aiming to secure their party's advantage in the U.S. House. In direct response, California Democrats have advanced their own plan to redraw state maps to add five Democratic-leaning seats, effectively neutralizing the Texas maneuver. This escalating political arms race over gerrymandering could influence the balance of power in Washington D.C. and potentially spread to other states ahead of the next national elections.</p>

Despite her $1.3 billion net worth, Guo advocates for a relentless work ethic, suggesting that new founders may need to work 90-hour weeks to succeed. She dismisses the idea that long hours preclude work-life balance, arguing that time often wasted on social media could be used more productively. Her perspective reflects a Silicon Valley ethos of constant work, contrasting with other entrepreneurs who argue such a culture is outdated and detrimental to talent retention.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese defense researchers have developed a new data link system designed for large-scale hypersonic combat, which could significantly outperform current NATO communication technologies. The system boasts a time synchronization accuracy within five nanoseconds, a critical capability when coordinating weapons traveling at speeds exceeding Mach 5. This technological leap enables real-time, secure communication between various military assets, including hypersonic platforms, command centers, and naval fleets.

          <p>The parole hearings for Erik and Lyle Menendez, who were denied release, highlighted several key aspects of their case three decades after they murdered their parents. More than a dozen family members testified in support of their freedom, reflecting growing sympathy fueled by recent Netflix series and documentaries. The brothers' legal team is also pursuing a new trial based on recently discovered evidence supporting their claims of long-term sexual abuse by their father. However, the new Los Angeles County District Attorney, Nathan Hochman, strongly opposes their release, arguing they have not taken full responsibility for their crimes.</p>

In her first interviews since her release, she stated she would be meeting with members of Donald Trump's administration, who she says are advocates for free speech.

          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has resumed its eruption on Hawaii's Big Island, marking its 31st eruptive event since December. The eruption began with lava fountains shooting up to 100 feet into the air within its summit crater, a spectacle contained safely within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists explain that magma building up in a lower chamber forces its way to the surface, creating periodic fountain episodes. While the activity poses no threat to homes, it has drawn increased tourism to the park, with visitors eager to witness the powerful display of nature.</p>

          <h2>Malaysia to Ban Unprocessed Rare Earth Exports to Boost Domestic Industry</h2>

          <p>Malaysia has announced it will ban the export of unprocessed rare earth minerals to encourage investment in its domestic downstream processing industries. The move is intended to ensure that the value from these critical materials, which are essential for many electronic products, remains within the country. This policy signals Malaysia's intent to leverage its existing processing capabilities to become a key player in the global supply chain, particularly as countries like the United States seek to diversify their sources away from China. Foreign investment will be welcomed for projects that involve local processing, job creation, and technology transfer.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong has become the primary venue for initial public offerings by mainland Chinese companies, overtaking the United States in both the number of listings and capital raised this year. So far in 2025, 46 Chinese firms have raised $16.5 billion in Hong Kong, compared to just 16 listings raising $740.9 million in the US. This shift is attributed to the strong performance of new shares in Hong Kong and the geopolitical tensions between China and the US, which create regulatory uncertainty and delisting risks for Chinese stocks in American markets.

          <p>Eileen Gu, the American-born Chinese skier and two-time Olympic gold medalist, has sustained an injury while training at a ski field in New Zealand. The 21-year-old athlete was flown to Christchurch for medical imaging following what she described on social media as a "very terrible man-made accident." Gu, who recently returned from a shoulder injury, suggested she was interrupted while preparing for a run, a dangerous situation for a professional athlete. She has asked fans not to record or photograph her during training to allow for full concentration. The extent of her injury has not yet been confirmed.</p>

          <p>A former Fresno County Superior Court judge, Adolfo Corona, has been federally indicted on charges of sexually assaulting two court employees and attempting to obstruct the investigation. The indictment alleges that Corona assaulted one employee in a stairwell in March 2024 and another in his chambers in December 2023. Prosecutors claim he lied to the FBI and tried to persuade a motorcycle dealership employee to falsify records to create an alibi for one of the incidents. If convicted on the new federal charges, the 66-year-old retired judge could face up to 80 years in prison.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that air pollution from all stages of oil and gas operations in the U.S. causes an estimated 91,000 premature deaths annually, with Black, Latino, Indigenous, and Asian Americans bearing the greatest health burden. The research is the first to quantify the nationwide health impacts, including preterm births and childhood asthma, from exploration to consumption. California, particularly Los Angeles County, ranks among the most affected areas. The findings attribute these racial disparities to historical zoning practices like redlining, which concentrated minority communities near industrial pollution sources and high-traffic areas, creating a legacy of environmental injustice.</p>

          <p>At least five people, including a child, were killed after a tour bus carrying 51 people crashed in upstate New York on its way back from a trip to Niagra Falls on Friday.\n\nThe passengers were initially trapped in the wreckage, according to law enforcement, and then admitted to hospitals in the region where more than 40 of them were evaluated or treated with injuries ranging from head trauma to broken arms and legs.\n\nThe bus, which had 52 passengers onboard, including the driver, was traveling eastbound when it apparently lost control on Interstate 90 near the Pembroke exit, roughly 25 miles (40km) east of Buffalo. It went into the median and then ended up in a ditch on the right side of the road, New York state trooper James O’Callaghan said.\n\nO’Callaghan told reporters at the scene that “the bus did roll” and most people had not been wearing seat belts. People inside were ejected as the windows shattered. “There were multiple ejections,” he said. “There were multiple people trapped and there’s multiple fatalities, and this includes children as well.”\n\nThe driver survived. “The driver is alive and well,” O’Callaghan said. “We’re working with him. We believe we have a good idea of what happened, why the bus lost control.”\n\nHe did not provide further details.\n\nPhotos from witnesses showed the bus tipped on its side near the road, with emergency crews and medical helicopters rushing victims to hospitals.\n\n“There was glass all over the road and people’s stuff all over the road,” Powell Stephens of Medina told the Buffalo News after passing the scene. “Windows were all shattered.”\n\nThe tour bus was heading back to New York City from the famous falls on the US-Canada border, when it crashed between Buffalo and Rochester.\n\nO’Callaghan said the tourists were chiefly of Indian, Chinese and Filipino origin, and officials were trying to get interpreters to the scene.\n\nThe interstate highway was blocked, and O’Callaghan said there were multiple entrapments and people were being taken to local hospitals.\n\nThe Mercy Flight medical transport service said its three helicopters, and three more from other services transported people from the crash site.\n\nAt a news conference at Erie county medical center later in the day, Dr Samuel Cloud, the facility’s chief medical officer, said the crash was “probably the most trauma patients from one incident in my career here in Buffalo”. Two people who needed surgery at the center were expected to recover, said Dr Jeffrey Brewer, chief of surgery.\n\nThe New York State Thruway Authority announced that a significant section of the highway was shut down in both directions. Officials urged drivers to avoid the area.\n\nKathy Hochul, the New York governor, wrote on X that she had been updated on “the tragic tour bus accident” – and that her office was coordinating with law enforcement and local agencies.</p>
