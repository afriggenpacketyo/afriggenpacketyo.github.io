          <p>Iran and the United States convened in Muscat, Oman, for a fourth round of negotiations regarding Iran's nuclear program, aiming to bridge differences and potentially revive a deal that would limit Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for the easing of U.S. sanctions. According to an Iranian spokesman, the talks were described as "difficult but useful" in finding ways to address disagreements, with Omani mediators set to coordinate future discussions. The negotiations occur as President Trump prepares to travel to the Middle East, with threats of military action against Iran if diplomacy fails, while Iran insists its peaceful nuclear activities are non-negotiable. This New York Times article provides a comprehensive overview of the stakes, sticking points, and potential outcomes of these critical talks.</p>

          <p>Due to radar outages and air traffic controller shortages, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy plans to reduce flights at Newark Liberty International Airport for the coming weeks. The FAA will implement a ground stop of about 45 minutes for Newark flights.

          <p>Fueled by the driest start to spring in nearly 70 years, wildfires have broken out across Scotland, Wales, and England, prompting warnings of a potential drought this summer. A large forest fire near Fauldhouse, Scotland, required the deployment of around 50 firefighters and a helicopter. The Met Office reports that April received only 56 percent of its average rainfall, while March saw just 43 percent. The European Unionâ€™s Copernicus climate service has upgraded Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to drought warning status.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, has returned to Massachusetts after being detained by ICE for six weeks; a federal judge ordered her release. Ozturk was taken into custody by plainclothes ICE officers in Somerville, Massachusetts, allegedly due to an op-ed she co-authored criticizing Israel's war with Hamas. Supporters, including Senator Ed Markey and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, celebrated her release, emphasizing the importance of due process and free speech. Ozturk's lawyers argued that her First Amendment rights were violated, and the judge found no evidence to justify her detainment besides the op-ed.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that the 10% baseline tariff rate on imports is expected to remain in place for the foreseeable future, aligning with President Trump's recent statements. Lutnick dismissed concerns that consumers would bear the burden of these tariffs, asserting that businesses and foreign countries would absorb the costs. However, data suggests that businesses are attempting to pass costs on to consumers, and consumer confidence has declined since the tariff announcement. Lutnick stated that domestically produced products would not be subject to tariffs, compelling foreign competitors to compete more effectively.</p>

          <p>After a four-day clash, India and Pakistan have seemingly pulled back from the brink, but the underlying tensions and new military technologies suggest that future conflicts are likely. The recent conflict involved a dizzying aerial escalation, with airstrikes, antiaircraft volleys, and weaponized drones used en masse for the first time. Political realities in both countries, marked by entrenched religious nationalism, remain unchanged, creating a powerful push toward further confrontation. International diplomacy, particularly from the United States and Saudi Arabia, played a crucial role in de-escalation.</p>

          <p>A group of Quakers are marching over 300 miles from New York City to Washington D.C. to protest the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. The march is rooted in a long history of Quaker activism, promoting justice and peace. The protestors aim to show solidarity with migrants and other targeted groups, delivering a copy of the Flushing Remonstrance, a 17th-century document advocating for religious freedom. They view the administration's actions as a violation of constitutional law and a disregard for pluralism and human dignity.</p>

          <p>With employee confidence low and economic uncertainty high, Alison Green, the writer behind Ask a Manager, offers advice for navigating a tough job market. She notes that people are worried about job security, potential layoffs, and whether they can find new employment if needed. Green suggests that individuals in federal government or nonprofit roles should assess their job security and consider safer alternatives, while those who have been in their jobs for a long time should prepare for a changed hiring process. For those stuck in bad job situations, Green acknowledges that there may not be easy solutions.</p>

The new rules, set to be implemented this year, will require care firms to prioritize hiring British nationals or extending visas for existing overseas workers.

The government plans to unveil changes to visa and recruitment laws on Monday in a bid to cut net migration, and says measures will cut up to 50,000 lower-skilled and care workers coming to the UK over the next year.</p>

          <p>Argentine boxer Fernando Martinez retained the WBA super flyweight belt in a 12-round fight against Japanese former champion Kazuto Ioka.

The fight was initially scheduled for December 31 but was postponed due to Martinez catching the flu.</p>

          <p>This article discusses President Trump's selective use of the term "freedom of choice," promoting it in the economic sphere while restricting it in the political sphere. Trump promotes expanded consumer options, but his administration limits choices in areas like education, expression, and voting. The author argues that this reveals a new form of authoritarianism that prioritizes consumer choice over other forms of freedom. This strategy has been taken up by other right leaning governments around the world.</p>

          <p>This New York Times guest essay discusses the decline of Elon Musk's influence following the end of his partnership with President Trump. Musk's reputation has suffered due to controversial actions and criticisms of the administration, damaging his companies' stock prices and investor confidence. Despite securing lucrative federal contracts, Musk's lack of political experience and disregard for Washington's norms led to his downfall. The essay argues that there is no room in the American system for an unelected co-president.</p>

          <p>The United States is scaling back its efforts to promote democracy abroad under President Trump, dismantling the Agency for Global Media, restructuring the State Department, and cutting funding to USAID. Experts worry that these actions will create a vacuum for promoting freedom and representative government.
