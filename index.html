          <p>Justin Welby, former Archbishop of Canterbury, publicly forgave serial abuser John Smyth, despite a report criticizing Welby's inaction.  While stating his forgiveness is irrelevant to victims' healing, this statement caused significant backlash from survivors who feel unheard and betrayed by the Church's continued failures.  The interview reveals a potential bias towards prioritizing institutional image over immediate victim needs, minimizing the impact of his failures.</p>
