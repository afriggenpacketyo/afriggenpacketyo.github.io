        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FDA is set to phase out petroleum-based synthetic dyes from food products by the end of next year, responding to growing concerns about their impact on children's health. Commissioner Marty Makary cited studies linking these dyes to conditions like ADHD, obesity, and cancer, advocating for natural alternatives like watermelon or beet juice. The FDA will also revoke authorization for certain synthetic colorings and expedite the approval of natural color additives, signaling a significant shift in food safety regulations. This decision impacts major food companies and aims to reduce children's exposure to potentially harmful chemicals. Optimism score reflects the positive impact on public health.

          <h2>More Americans Consider Bankruptcy Amid Economic Pressures</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 16:18:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The number of Americans considering bankruptcy is surging to its highest level since just before the pandemic, signaling potential economic challenges. Heavy consumer debts, years of inflation, and higher interest rates are squeezing household budgets. Experts warn that the Trump administration's economic policies, including tariffs, are likely to fuel inflation and dampen economic growth. While bankruptcy can provide relief, experts recommend seeking protection sooner rather than later to shield assets from creditors.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's spokesperson stated that he does not believe transgender women are women, following a UK Supreme Court ruling defining women by biological sex. This marks a shift from Starmer's previous stance. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch accused the government of U-turning in response to the judgement. While Starmer affirmed that trans women should be treated with dignity and respect, the ruling and subsequent statements have sparked debate and concern among LGBT advocates.</p>
