          <p>Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, facing International Criminal Court charges for crimes against humanity, remains popular as the Philippines holds midterm elections. His arrest and extradition have sharply divided the nation, with some polls showing majority support for the investigation, while many supporters view him as a victim of political persecution by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Duterte's camp has used his case in The Hague as a campaign tool, rallying supporters with the slogan "BRING HIM HOME." Meanwhile, Duterte's daughter, Sara Duterte, has seen her approval rating rise, potentially positioning her for a future presidential run.</p>

          <p>Britain is increasing its military spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, aiming to stimulate domestic job creation and local prosperity, with Barrow-in-Furness serving as a potential model. The town will receive £200 million in government funding to rejuvenate its economy, with BAE Systems, a major employer in Barrow, expanding its operations. The initiative aims to address infrastructure problems, attract workers, and improve health and education outcomes. This strategy could be replicated across Britain, directing military spending towards poorer regions and generating positive effects on local communities, with the key being to attract new businesses and opportunities.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport experienced its third system outage in less than two weeks, causing significant delays and cancellations. The latest incident involved a momentary failure of a backup air traffic control system, leading to a 45-minute ground stop. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced plans to reduce flights temporarily and build a direct line from Newark to the Philly TRACON to address the ongoing issues. Passengers expressed frustration, with many experiencing multiple delays and overnight stays.

          <p>Immigration into the UK has been a significant demographic change in the 21st century, marked by a consistent trend of more people migrating to the UK than emigrating over the past 30 years. Net migration began to climb in 1994, particularly during Labour's time in office in the early 2000s. Despite Conservative promises to reduce net migration to the levels of the 1990s, numbers remained historically high. Brexit, intended to grant greater control over immigration, has not resulted in a decrease, with net migration reaching 906,000 in the year to June 2023, though recent data suggests a potential fall in 2024.</p>

          <p>A measure in President Trump's reconciliation bill aimed at restricting federal payments to abortion providers may face opposition from moderate House Republicans. The provision, intended to redirect funds from "big abortion" to federally qualified health centers, has raised concerns about how these groups are defined. Moderate Republicans argue that the Hyde Amendment already prevents federal funding for abortion services, and that a new fight on abortion could be divisive. With a narrow majority in the House, Republican leaders face the challenge of passing the bill without significant dissent.</p>

However, it also poses challenges, as it could triple electricity demand and exacerbate climate change, given India's reliance on coal for power generation. Despite these concerns, the priority for many Indians is immediate relief from the heat, leading to increased AC purchases and energy consumption.</p>

          <p>Fresh & Ready Foods, based in Los Angeles, voluntarily recalled several premade food items after federal regulators found a strain of listeria on its equipment linked to an outbreak first identified last year. The recall includes sandwiches and protein snacks sold in California, Nevada, Arizona, and Washington. The company took this action as a precautionary measure after the FDA confirmed the listeria strain matched the one causing illnesses in the 2024 outbreak. The company has advised consumers to discard any recalled products and is offering refunds.</p>
