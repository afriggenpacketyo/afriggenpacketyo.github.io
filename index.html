          <p>President Trump stated that any protesters attending the upcoming military parade in Washington, D.C., celebrating the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary, would be met with "very heavy force," reiterating the threat multiple times. This statement comes despite security officials tracking approximately nine protests planned for the event, which coincides with Trump's 79th birthday. Trump characterized the protesters as people who "hate our country." It is anticipated that the number of protesters will be smaller than the number of attendees at the parade. Optimism surrounding the event is somewhat tempered by the potential for conflict.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem requested Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to authorize military forces deployed to Los Angeles protests to arrest civilians, which would exceed the authorities invoked by President Trump. Noem's letter, revealed by the San Francisco Chronicle, asked for troops to detain or arrest lawbreakers under Title 18. Legal experts noted that defense personnel are generally prohibited from direct law enforcement activities, unless explicitly authorized by Congress, and Hegseth reportedly took no action on Noem's request, with the Marines' commandant reiterating that the Marines sent to LA "don't have arrest authority."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has asked a federal judge to quickly block President Trump's deployment of National Guard members and Marines to Los Angeles, arguing that the deployments are unlawful and stoking more fear and civil unrest. State Attorney General Rob Bonta asserted that the deployments pose "imminent harm to State Sovereignty" and escalate tensions, rather than quelling civil unrest. Newsom characterized Trump's actions as tyrannical, while Trump defended his decision by claiming Los Angeles would be "burning" without federal intervention. The lawsuit argues that the recent unrest is not comparable to past events like the 1992 riots.</p>

Text messages revealed Nutley initiated the relationship, sending nude photos and engaging in multiple sexual encounters with the student, even threatening suicide and paying him to remain silent when he tried to end the relationship. Prosecutors likened Nutley to "most pedophiles" who prey on vulnerable individuals, while her attorney described her as a "broken woman" suffering from mental illness and past sexual abuse.</p>

          <p>David Huerta, president of SEIU California and SEIU-USWW, was arrested while protesting an immigration raid in Los Angeles and later released on bond. Huerta was charged with conspiracy to impede an officer, a felony that carries a potential prison sentence. The arrest has drawn criticism from union leaders and Democratic representatives, who argue it was an attempt to intimidate protesters. Huerta, a longtime advocate for workers and immigrants, remains focused on those detained in the raids. The incident occurred amid heightened tensions in LA, where the Trump administration has deployed National Guard troops and Marines in response to protests.</p>

The study, which analyzed 117 long-term studies, recommends moderate screen time, particularly for educational purposes, and encourages children to engage in social activities and physical activity to develop resilience and emotional skills.
