          <h2>The Science Behind Why Cities Experience Higher Temperatures During Heatwaves</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 21:23:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Urban areas often experience significantly higher temperatures than surrounding rural landscapes, a phenomenon known as the "urban heat island effect." This effect is caused by dark surfaces like roads and buildings that absorb and retain the sun's heat, which is then slowly released, particularly at night. The lack of vegetation and water sources in cities, which provide natural cooling in the countryside, exacerbates the issue. As climate change makes heatwaves more frequent and intense, densely populated urban centers are becoming increasingly vulnerable to extreme heat and its associated health risks.</p>

          <p>The lavish wedding of billionaire Jeff Bezos and Lauren SÃ¡nchez in Venice has sparked significant controversy and protests from local residents. Hundreds of demonstrators marched through the city, arguing that the extravagant event highlights the exploitation of Venice while its citizens struggle with overtourism, high living costs, and environmental threats. Activists carried banners with slogans like "Kisses Yes, Bezos No," framing the wedding as an affront to the city's fragile state. Despite a donation from Bezos to local environmental groups, many protesters dismissed it as a public relations move that fails to address the systemic issues facing Venice.</p>

          <p>A new pilot program in Kent, UK, is teaching primary school children as young as five about sun safety to help prevent future cases of skin cancer. The initiative, led by the Melanoma Fund, educates students on reading UV indexes and applying sunscreen, with plans for a nationwide rollout by 2026. Experts emphasize that sunburn during childhood significantly increases the risk of melanoma, the most serious skin cancer, later in life. With melanoma diagnoses projected to rise, the program aims to instill lifelong habits and empower the next generation to protect their skin.</p>

The march was a celebration of human rights and solidarity, with Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, declaring it a peaceful show of defiance against a "hateful power."

          <p>In the aftermath of its 12-day war with Israel, Iran's regime is deepening its crackdown on its own citizens with a wave of speedy executions and arrests. This week, three men were executed on espionage charges, which human rights activists claim were based on unfair trials. The government has also arrested over 700 people accused of ties to Israel and is implementing new surveillance measures to monitor citizens' online activities. Many Iranians and activists fear this phase of heightened repression is the regime's way of reasserting control and taking revenge on the populace after suffering significant military and infrastructure losses.</p>

          <p>The UK's recent ban on disposable vapes, intended to curb youth addiction and environmental waste, is facing challenges as young people continue to access nicotine products. The article highlights the story of a mother who, in a desperate attempt to manage her teenagers' addiction, now buys them lower-nicotine vapes herself. Health experts and Trading Standards officials express concern that the ban may be ineffective, as some legal rechargeable vapes are still being marketed to children.

He cited the Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which has achieved results comparable to top U.S. competitors like OpenAI but with far less computing power.

The lawsuit stems from statements Trump made in 2024, where he allegedly falsely claimed the men had killed someone and pled guilty. The judge ruled that Pennsylvania's Anti-SLAPP law, which Trump's legal team cited to protect against lawsuits targeting free speech, does not apply in federal court. This decision allows the case, brought by the men wrongfully convicted in the 1989 Central Park jogger case, to move forward.</p>

          <h2>UK Labour Leader Keir Starmer Calls Fixing 'Broken' Welfare System a 'Moral Imperative'</h2>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has declared that reforming the nation's "broken" benefits system is a "moral imperative," following a backbench revolt that forced his government to U-turn on planned welfare cuts. Speaking at a conference, Starmer assured that the safety net for vulnerable people would remain but stated benefits should not become a "snare" for those who can work. The government conceded on its plan to tighten criteria for Personal Independence Payment (Pip) for existing claimants after facing significant opposition from within the Labour party. Rebel MPs are still pushing for further changes ahead of a key vote.</p>

          <h2>Supreme Court's Recent Term Delivers Consistent Victories for Conservative States and Executive Power</h2>

          <p>The latest Supreme Court term concluded with a series of significant, though not blockbuster, victories for conservative states and President Trump's assertions of executive power. In its final days, the court's 6-3 conservative majority bolstered states' authority on issues like transgender medical care and abortion clinic funding, while also reining in the power of lower court judges to issue nationwide injunctions against federal policies. This pattern reflects a states-rights brand of conservatism and a judiciary increasingly willing to defer to the executive branch. The term solidifies the court's rightward shift and its profound impact on the nation's legal and political landscape.</p>
