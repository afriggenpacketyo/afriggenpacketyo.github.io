          <p>Gold prices have surged to a new record of over $4,000 an ounce, marking its biggest rally since the 1970s, as investors seek safe-haven assets amidst global economic and political instability. Factors contributing to this rally include the ongoing US government shutdown, delays in economic data release, and a weakening US dollar. Analysts note that while gold is a hedge against uncertainty, its value could fall if the shutdown ends quickly or if interest rates rise due to resurgent inflation. This article highlights the metal's role as a protective investment during turbulent times. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is facing unprecedented political pressure, including two no-confidence votes within three months, from both far-right and left-wing factions in the European Parliament. Critics accuse her of a lack of transparency, failed migration and climate policies, and a centralized leadership style. While her ousting is unlikely, the situation highlights the increasing fragmentation and fragile trust within the parliament's political center. This article suggests von der Leyen's delicate balancing act will continue amid ongoing challenges.</p>

          <p>US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are joining indirect peace talks in Egypt between Israeli and Hamas negotiators, as discussions remain tough and without tangible results after a second day. Disagreements persist over Israeli withdrawal maps from Gaza and Hamas's demand for guarantees that fighting will not resume post-deal. The negotiations focus on a permanent ceasefire, hostage-for-prisoner exchange, Israeli withdrawal, humanitarian aid, and post-war governance. This article underscores the critical efforts to end the conflict, with calls for adherence to a peace plan.</p>

          <p>The ongoing government shutdown is causing widespread flight delays and cancellations across the US due to air traffic controller staffing shortages, with some facilities operating at significantly reduced capacity. Controllers, deemed essential workers, are working without pay, leading to increased sick calls and financial stress. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy acknowledged the issue, noting that safety remains the priority, even if it means slowing down air traffic. This article details how the shutdown is impacting crucial infrastructure and its personnel.</p>
