          <p>Rescue operations are ongoing in Central Texas following catastrophic flash floods that caused the Guadalupe River to surge to historic levels. The death toll has climbed to at least 109, with over 100 people still reported missing, primarily in the hard-hit Kerr County. A federal disaster has been declared, enabling FEMA to assist local and state teams in the search and recovery efforts. The tragedy was particularly severe at Camp Mystic, a girls' summer camp, where dozens of campers and staff lost their lives.</p>

          <p>Camp Mystic, a girls' Christian summer camp in Texas Hill Country, has confirmed that at least 27 of its campers and counselors died in the recent devastating flash floods. As of Tuesday, search and rescue teams were still looking for five missing campers and one counselor from the camp. The camp's owner, Dick Eastland, also reportedly died while trying to save children. The article names several of the young victims, sharing tributes from their grieving families and highlighting the profound sense of loss within the community.</p>

          <h2>Officials Face Scrutiny Over Warning Systems Following Deadly Texas Floods</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 17:17:55 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the wake of the deadly Texas floods, officials are facing intense questioning regarding the adequacy and timing of public warnings. Despite the National Weather Service issuing a "life-threatening" alert, some local authorities claimed they were not aware of the severity until hours later. The article highlights the lack of a siren-based warning system in Kerr County, a decision previously made due to cost, and the ongoing debate over whether staffing shortages at the National Weather Service impacted forecasting. Officials have largely deferred questions, stating their current priority is the recovery effort.</p>

The plot is described as impatient but entertaining, filled with quirky side characters and a villainous Lex Luthor played by Nicholas Hoult.

          <p>Canadian authorities have charged four men, including two active members of the Canadian Armed Forces, over an alleged plot to form an "anti-government militia." The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) stated the group intended to "forcibly take possession of land" in the Québec City area. The suspects allegedly conducted military-style training and stockpiled explosive devices, dozens of firearms, and thousands of ammunition rounds. The arrests highlight ongoing concerns about extremism within the Canadian military, which has pledged to take the allegations very seriously.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecasts that the annual cost of the state pension's 'triple lock' policy will be three times higher than originally estimated, reaching £15.5 billion by 2030. The triple lock guarantees that the state pension increases annually by the highest of inflation, wage growth, or 2.5%. The OBR report notes that this policy, combined with an aging population, is placing the UK's public finances in a vulnerable and unsustainable position over the long term. The government has stated its commitment to the policy for now. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 15:50:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article analyzes the political implications of the recent Senate bill cutting means-tested programs like Medicaid and food stamps. It explores the long-standing progressive argument that universal social programs, like Social Security, are more politically durable than those targeted at low-income individuals. The author argues this view is complicated, noting that means-tested benefits have actually grown substantially over recent decades while some universal programs have faced cuts. The piece concludes that while universal programs have substantive policy advantages, establishing them is politically difficult due to fiscal constraints and American aversion to tax increases.</p>

According to the complaint, Orso collapsed on a curb just ten minutes after his release from the Murrieta jail and was not discovered for approximately 40 minutes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumers and restaurants in the U.S. are facing record-high beef prices, which reached $5.98 per pound in May. The primary cause is a classic supply and demand issue: the number of beef cattle is at its lowest level since the 1960s, while consumer demand remains robust. This herd shrinkage has been driven largely by years of drought conditions across major cattle-producing regions, which reduced feedstock and forced ranchers to sell off cows. Experts predict that prices will likely continue to rise and remain elevated for the next several years as the industry slowly rebuilds its herds.</p>

          <p>A review of the new "Superman" movie praises director James Gunn's decision to place the hero in a world already populated with other super-powered individuals. This approach, starring David Corenswet as a more sincere and regular-guy Superman, avoids a tired origin story and instead defines the character's uniqueness through his interactions with peers. The film is described as bright, whimsical, and consciously sincere, a departure from the grittier superhero films of recent years. The review highlights the movie's success in exploring a society's struggle to accept genuine, unambiguous goodness.</p>
