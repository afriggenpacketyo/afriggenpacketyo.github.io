          <h2>UK Retail Sales Rise in June Driven by Warm Weather</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 02:46:54 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail sales volumes in the United Kingdom saw a 0.9% increase in June, a rebound attributed to favorable weather conditions. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the warm weather encouraged consumer spending, particularly on fuel and at supermarkets. Supermarkets noted higher sales of beverages as people enjoyed the sunshine, and increased travel boosted fuel purchases. The ONS also revised its previous estimates, indicating that the decline in sales during May was more significant than initially reported, providing additional context for June's recovery.</p>

          <p>Volkswagen has significantly reduced its full-year profit forecast after reporting a 29% drop in second-quarter operating profit, falling to 3.83 billion euros. The German automaker attributes the downturn to the disruptive impact of U.S. import tariffs, robust competition, and higher sales of lower-margin electric models. Consequently, VW has lowered its expected operating return on sales for 2025 and anticipates full-year sales to be flat compared to the previous year. Despite these challenges, the company highlighted a 62% increase in orders for all-electric vehicles during the first half of 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>India Faces Intensifying Pressure to Finalize Trade Agreement with U.S. Ahead of Deadline</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 02:29:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pressure is mounting on India to conclude a trade deal with the United States before an August 1 deadline, after which certain tariffs are set to increase. The urgency has been heightened by a recent U.S.-Japan trade agreement that addressed similar issues, such as market access for American agricultural products, a sensitive topic for India. Analysts suggest that the U.S. is also motivated to finalize a deal, viewing India as a strategic partner and a potential manufacturing alternative to China. India's position within the BRICS bloc and its strategy of multi-alignment through other trade negotiations provide it with additional leverage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has struck down California's law requiring background checks for all ammunition purchases, ruling it an unconstitutional violation of the Second Amendment. In a 2-1 decision, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found the state failed to prove the law aligns with the nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation. Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the ruling as a "slap in the face" to gun violence prevention efforts, while the state's attorney general is considering legal options. Proponents of the law, including the California Rifle & Pistol Association, hailed the decision as a victory against government overreach.</p>

          <p>Resident doctors in England have commenced a five-day strike as part of an ongoing pay dispute with the government, marking the 12th walkout on the issue. Health Secretary Wes Streeting has pledged to minimize disruption, with NHS England instructing hospitals to cancel non-urgent treatments only in exceptional circumstances. This approach differs from previous strikes, where the focus was primarily on maintaining emergency care. The British Medical Association (BMA) warned that this strategy risks overstretching staff and reiterated that restoring pay, which they claim has fallen by a fifth since 2008 in real terms, is the key to resolving the dispute.</p>

He asserted that the FA's position is that the current application of VAR is in a "good place."

          <p>Ranchers in southern Mexico are struggling to combat an outbreak of the New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite infecting cattle and other animals. The rapid spread in the state of Chiapas has led the United States to bar Mexican cattle imports over fears of the parasite moving north. Veterinarians and ranchers report a surge in cases and soaring prices for treatment medication, forcing some to use ineffective home remedies. While a U.S.-supported plant to produce sterile flies for eradication is under construction, it will not be operational until next year, leaving local communities to face the costly problem largely on their own.</p>

Economists suggest a potential trade-off could see the U.S. reduce metal tariffs in exchange for the U.K. dropping the tech tax.

The Welsh government intends for the scheme to be cost-neutral, de-medicalizing the process and reducing administrative burdens on doctors and pharmacies.

          <p>An official investigation has been launched in China following the deaths of six university students in an industrial accident at a copper-molybdenum mine in Inner Mongolia. The engineering students were on a field trip when a grating panel reportedly gave way, causing them to fall into a slurry-filled flotation tank. The incident has sparked public and state media calls for stricter safety protocols and a thorough inquiry to determine the cause and prevent future tragedies. The government of the Inner Mongolia autonomous region has assembled an investigation team that has already begun its work at the accident site.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has approved the $8 billion merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media, clearing a major regulatory hurdle for the deal. The approval transfers broadcast licenses for 28 CBS television stations to the new entity, owned by Skydance's David Ellison. The decision came shortly after Paramount settled a lawsuit with President Donald Trump and days after CBS canceled "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," sparking criticism from Democrats about the timing and potential political influence. Skydance has pledged to install an ombudsman to ensure unbiased journalism and to end certain diversity and inclusion initiatives. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against New York City, challenging its sanctuary city laws that limit cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration agents. The lawsuit argues that these policies obstruct the enforcement of federal immigration law and endanger public safety by preventing the transfer of non-citizen criminals to federal custody. The legal action follows recent criticism from Homeland Security officials after an off-duty Border Patrol officer was shot by an undocumented immigrant. City officials defended the policies as essential for ensuring all residents, regardless of status, feel safe reporting crimes, but will review the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell had a public disagreement over the costs of a major renovation project at the Fed's headquarters. During a joint tour of the construction site, Trump claimed the cost had risen to $3.1 billion, a figure Powell disputed, stating it included a separate building completed years ago. The president has previously criticized the project's ballooning budget, suggesting it could be grounds for firing Powell. While Trump stated he does not think firing Powell is necessary, he reiterated his desire for lower interest rates to spur the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

This puts pressure on Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government, which has maintained that recognition should be timed for maximum impact. Conservative members of the committee dissented, echoing the government's position that recognition should be part of a broader two-state solution, not a unilateral step.</p>

Video on social media showed a home being swept away by the rushing, muddy water, which coursed through creeks and over roads. The area is particularly vulnerable to flooding due to burn scars from past wildfires that have stripped the surrounding hillsides of vegetation. This is the second major flood to hit the community this summer, with a previous event earlier in the month resulting in at least three fatalities.

          <p>A research team from China's Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics has become the first to directly observe and measure quantum friction between two solid surfaces. Using folded graphene, the scientists discovered that friction did not always increase with thickness; in some cases, thicker folds exhibited less resistance. This counterintuitive effect was traced to how bending the material altered electron movement, restricting the conversion of motion into heat. The breakthrough provides the first experimental evidence of this phenomenon and could pave the way for developing ultra-efficient, low-wear nanoscale machines and devices.</p>
