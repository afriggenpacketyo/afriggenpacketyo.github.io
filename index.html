          <p>Recent high-level trade and technology negotiations between the United States and China, hosted in Madrid, have intensified concerns within Europe about its diminishing global influence. While Spanish officials welcomed the diplomatic event, analysts worry that the continent is becoming a "playground" for superpowers rather than a key player. This sentiment follows a period where European leaders feel their strategic interests have been overlooked by both Washington and Beijing, highlighting anxieties over the EU's geopolitical standing.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has labeled comments by tech billionaire Elon Musk as "abhorrent" following his address to a protest rally. Musk criticized "uncontrolled migration" and stated that violence would come to people unless they fight back, also calling for a new parliamentary vote in Britain. Government officials, including a Downing Street spokesperson, denounced the language as dangerous and inflammatory, while some politicians have called for a review of government contracts with Musk's companies.</p>

          <p>German authorities have carried out a series of raids across three states targeting a group of suspected right-wing extremists believed to be in possession of illegal weapons. The operation saw police search thirteen homes belonging to suspects aged between 32 and 57. This action is part of a broader crackdown on far-right radicalism in Germany, following several major raids in recent months, including one last week against a group allegedly plotting to establish a neo-Nazi state. The country is also facing economic pressures, with a new study indicating millions are struggling with rising living costs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK state pension is expected to rise by 4.7% next April, in line with the latest average earnings growth data, as part of the government's "triple lock" commitment. This increase would add over £500 annually to the new state pension, bringing it closer to the frozen personal tax allowance threshold. Experts and pensioners express concern that this will result in more retirees being subject to income tax, effectively clawing back some of the gains from the pension increase.

          <h2>Online Harassment of TV Weather Forecasters Linked to Climate Change Misinformation</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>TV meteorologists are facing a surge in online harassment and threats, often fueled by the politicization of climate change science and widespread misinformation. One forecaster, Chris Gloninger, left his job after receiving a death threat for incorporating climate change context into his weather reports. Experts trace the issue to historical denial campaigns by fossil fuel companies and the modern spread of conspiracies on social media. They suggest that education, empathy, and building trust are key to combating this trend, which targets some of the most visible communicators of climate science.</p>

          <p>The White House is in damage-control mode following a major immigration raid at a Hyundai-LG battery plant in Georgia that led to the arrest of 475 workers. The action has angered South Korea and raised concerns about its impact on foreign investment in the U.S. In response, President Trump stated that skilled foreign workers are welcome to train the domestic workforce, emphasizing he does not want to disincentivize investment. Washington has also reportedly agreed to establish a new "visa working group" with Seoul to address concerns over worker permits.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has initiated a $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, alleging a "decades-long pattern of intentional and malicious defamation."

          <p>A UN Human Rights Council commission report has concluded that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, a charge Israel vehemently denies and dismisses as biased. The report's findings, which cite actions like targeting civilians and blocking aid, are contributing to growing international condemnation of Israel's military conduct, even among its traditional allies. This development comes as several Western nations are poised to recognize Palestinian statehood, further isolating Israel's position and deepening international divisions over the long-standing conflict.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, the political discourse has devolved into finger-pointing, with President Trump asserting the problem of extremism lies with "the left." This article critiques the tendency to assign collective blame for the actions of a deranged individual, drawing parallels to past instances where political figures were wrongly blamed for acts of violence. The author argues that such partisan reactions are counterproductive and that blaming entire ideologies for an insane act is itself a form of extremism.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for accelerated efforts to build a unified national market, identifying it as crucial for China to gain a competitive advantage internationally and achieve its development goals. In an article for the Communist Party's journal Qiushi, Xi outlined key tasks, with a primary focus on curbing excessive and destructive price competition among domestic firms. The directive suggests a push for companies to compete on product quality rather than engaging in price wars, aiming to phase out obsolete industrial capacity.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to a "framework" deal concerning the U.S. operations of TikTok, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The announcement, made during trade talks in Madrid, suggests a path toward American ownership of the popular social media app, which faces a potential ban over national security concerns. The commercial terms have reportedly been settled, with President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping expected to finalize the agreement on Friday, though details about control over TikTok's powerful algorithm remain unclear.</p>

          <p>A five-day experiment where teenagers in Bradford removed all technology from their bedrooms revealed several positive outcomes, including improved sleep and more family interaction. Participants, who typically spent hours on phones and gaming consoles in their rooms, reported feeling better rested and more engaged in other activities like baking and reading. While the teens still used their devices in common areas, the project highlighted the benefits of setting physical boundaries with technology, leading some to adopt new habits like keeping phones out of their bedrooms at night.</p>

The writer identifies excessive executive power, gerrymandering, and political violence as key threats, suggesting that a Democratic victory in the midterm elections is necessary for Congress to act as a check on the presidency. The author contends that Democrats must focus on kitchen-table economic issues to win, as the negative financial impacts of Trump's policies become more apparent to voters.</p>

          <p>The names of many of China's ballistic missiles, such as the "Dongfeng" (East Wind) series, were inspired by the words of Mao Zedong. The name "Dongfeng" originates from a 1957 speech in which Mao declared, "Either the east wind prevails over the west wind, or the west wind prevails over the east wind," symbolizing the ideological struggle between communism and capitalism. According to state media, this reflects a tradition of drawing upon historical and political rhetoric to name key military hardware within the People's Republic of China.</p>

          <p>While the Los Angeles Dodgers plan to use Shohei Ohtani primarily as a starting pitcher in the upcoming playoffs, the team's leadership has not ruled out deploying him from the bullpen in certain high-leverage situations. President of baseball operations Andrew Friedman acknowledged that unforeseen circumstances in October could warrant such a move, similar to how other starters have been used in the past. However, using Ohtani as a reliever presents logistical challenges and is complicated by MLB's two-way player rules, which would cause the Dodgers to lose his designated hitter spot.</p>
