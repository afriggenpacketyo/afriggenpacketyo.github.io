          <p>Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer Ron Chernow's latest book delves into the life of Samuel Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, exploring the roots of his sardonic humor in his anxious pursuit of wealth and early struggles. The article highlights Twain's enduring relevance through his critiques of politics and society, and his groundbreaking anti-slavery novel "Huckleberry Finn." Chernow posits that Twain, despite his complexities, remains a vital presence in American culture, whose "water-like" writing continues to resonate widely.</p>

          <h2>Ken Burns Criticizes Proposed Cuts to Public Broadcasting Funding</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-06 10:14:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Filmmaker Ken Burns has strongly criticized the proposed elimination of federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), which supports PBS and NPR. He argues that such cuts are "shortsighted" and misguided, particularly because public media serves vital roles in rural areas, providing essential programming, education, and emergency information. Burns, whose own documentaries rely on PBS's long-term commitment, emphasizes that public broadcasting embodies American institutions that represent citizens "from the bottom up," likening it to the Declaration of Independence applied to communications.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European Union leaders face a critical deadline to secure a trade deal with the US, aiming to avert President Trump's threatened 50% tariffs on EU imports. The negotiations, focused on 15-18 agreements, have caused global economic uncertainty and a significant dollar decline. While Germany advocates for a swift deal to prevent a full-scale trade war, France prefers holding out for a more balanced agreement. Industries across Europe are bracing for increased export costs, as a comprehensive trade deal now seems unattainable, with a bare-bones framework agreement being the most likely outcome.</p>

          <p>This article details the notoriously difficult production of Steven Spielberg's 1975 blockbuster "Jaws" on Martha's Vineyard, marked by an uncooperative mechanical shark and a tripled shooting schedule. Despite initial doubts from actor Richard Dreyfuss, who initially resisted the role, Spielberg's ingenuity transformed setbacks into opportunities. The film, adapted from Peter Benchley's novel, became the first summer blockbuster and significantly influenced Hollywood. It remains a cultural touchstone, forever linking its stars and audiences to the primal fear of the ocean.</p>

          <p>The Statue of Liberty, initially conceived as a tribute to the end of slavery, evolved into a symbol of immigration largely due to Emma Lazarus's poem "The New Colossus." Its proximity to Ellis Island further solidified its association with welcoming immigrants. While early 20th-century laws, like the 1924 Johnson-Reed Act, restricted immigration, the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, championed by John F. Kennedy, dismantled ethnic quotas, fundamentally reshaping American demographics.

          <p>Russia has officially recognized the Taliban as Afghanistan's legitimate government, a move welcomed by the Taliban as a "brave decision" and the start of a new phase of positive relations. This makes Russia the first country to grant such recognition since the Taliban's return to power in 2021, despite their severe interpretation of Sharia law and restrictions on women's rights. Analysts suggest Russia's motivation includes significant economic interests, aiming to establish Afghanistan as a trade hub, and to assume a leading role among autocratic states, potentially pressuring Western nations to follow suit.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Finance has announced restrictions blocking EU companies without operations in China from government medical device contracts exceeding 45 million yuan, effective immediately. This tit-for-tat measure follows Beijing's repeated, unsuccessful attempts to resolve trade differences through consultation. The Ministry of Commerce stated this was a "last resort" reciprocal countermeasure.

Only five GOP members voted against it, fewer than any budget in Trump's first term, showcasing the immense political pressure within the party. This article highlights the "cultish devotion" to Trump or fear of his "wrath" among Republicans, demonstrating the high cost of crossing the former president.</p>
