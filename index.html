        <h2>House GOP Passes Bill to Avoid Government Shutdown</h2>
        <div class="timestamp">2025-03-11 17:52:54 EDT</div>

      <div class="flip-card-back">
        <p>The House of Representatives passed a bill to temporarily fund the government, preventing a shutdown.  The bill's passage was driven by a combination of White House pressure on conservative Republicans and the desire to give President Trump flexibility to implement his agenda through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).  The bill's fate in the Senate is uncertain, requiring bipartisan support to overcome a filibuster.</p>

        <h2>House Passes Spending Bill to Prevent Government Shutdown</h2>
        <div class="timestamp">2025-03-11 17:52:44 EDT</div>
      </div>
      <div class="flip-card-back">
        <p>The House narrowly passed a bill to fund the government until September 30, 2025.  This represents a significant win for House Speaker Mike Johnson, who previously relied on Democratic votes to avoid shutdowns. The bill now moves to the Senate, where it needs 60 votes to pass.</p>

        <h2>Education Department to Lay Off Significant Portion of Staff</h2>
        <div class="timestamp">2025-03-11 17:52:17 EDT</div>

      <div class="flip-card-back">
        <p>The Trump administration plans to lay off approximately half of the Education Department's staff.  This drastic measure could significantly weaken the department's ability to manage federal student loans, track student achievement, and enforce civil rights laws in schools. The move aligns with President Trump's previously stated desire to dismantle the department.</p>

      <div class="flip-card-back">
        <p>Following US-Ukraine talks in Jeddah, the US will communicate to Russia that reciprocal action is key to achieving peace.  This shifts pressure onto Russia, particularly after recent tensions between President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. While the US and Ukraine aren't fully aligned on the path forward, the resumption of US intelligence sharing and aid suggests a potential reset in the situation.</p>

        <p>The Philadelphia Eagles will visit the White House to celebrate their Super Bowl win, reversing the situation from 2018 when several players declined an invitation due to disagreements with then-President Trump over anthem protests.
