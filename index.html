          <h2>US Next-Generation Fighter Jet Engine Development Faces Two-Year Delay</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Development of the engine system for the F-47, the U.S. Air Force's sixth-generation fighter jet, is now expected to be delayed by approximately two years. Citing 2026 budget documents, reports indicate the completion date has shifted from late 2027 to early 2030. An Air Force spokesperson attributed the revised schedule to significant supply chain challenges affecting the Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion program. This setback impacts the broader Next Generation Air Dominance initiative, which aims to secure future air superiority.</p>

          <p>CBS has announced that "The Late Show" will conclude its run in May 2026, a decision that has sparked political controversy. The announcement came shortly after host Stephen Colbert criticized parent company Paramount for a $16 million settlement with Donald Trump. While CBS stated the cancellation was a financial decision, prominent Democratic figures have raised concerns about potential political motives, questioning if Colbert's outspoken criticism of Trump and Paramount influenced the network's move. Colbert confirmed the entire franchise is ending, not just his role as host.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 39-year-old Canadian man, Shaheer Cassim, has been charged with hijacking and terrorism after seizing control of a Cessna 172. He allegedly threatened a flight instructor and flew the plane to Vancouver, prompting NORAD to scramble F-15 fighter jets. The RCMP stated the suspect acted with an ideological motive to disrupt airspace, linked to social media posts about climate change and religious proclamations. The incident caused a temporary shutdown at Vancouver International Airport but ended safely with no injuries reported.</p>

          <p>The UK's Met Office has issued an amber warning for thunderstorms across southeast and eastern England, cautioning against torrential rain and potential flash flooding. Forecasters predict that some areas could receive over a month's worth of rainfall in just a few hours, leading to significant disruption. The heavy downpours, combined with frequent lightning and large hail, pose a risk to transport and infrastructure. This extreme weather event is occurring after a period of drought, where baked-dry soils are less able to absorb sudden, intense rainfall.</p>

          <p>An NHS doctor and her husband have each been sentenced to 10 months in jail for stealing and selling hospital-grade personal protective equipment (PPE) on eBay. Dr. Attiya Sheikh and her husband Omer Sheikh made nearly £8,000 by selling stolen gloves and masks during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The scheme was uncovered when an NHS supplier noticed its products on the auction site, leading to an investigation and a search of the couple's home. A counter-fraud official described the crime as particularly immoral, exploiting public fear and equipment shortages.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of preliminary rates indicates that premiums for health insurance plans on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces are set to increase by an average of 15% next year. This record-setting pace is partly attributed to the expiration of enhanced federal subsidies that were put in place in 2021. The KFF analysis suggests that the lapsing subsidies contribute about 4 percentage points to the hike, with the rest driven by rising medical service costs. This change could make coverage more expensive for millions and potentially lead to more people becoming uninsured. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As part of its 18th sanctions package against Russia, the European Union has agreed to lower the price cap on Russian crude oil. The G7/EU price cap mechanism, established after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, is designed to limit Moscow's war-funding revenues while keeping its oil on the global market. While the exact new level was not officially announced, officials indicated it would be set just above $47 per barrel at current prices, down from the original $60.

Recent data showing a rise in the Consumer Price Index to 2.7% in June has complicated the case for immediate easing. Fed officials appear reluctant to lower rates until they have a clearer picture of inflation trends, especially with potential price impacts from new tariffs. While investors still anticipate a rate cut later this year, the central bank's focus remains on stabilizing inflation rather than lowering government borrowing costs. (not investment advice)</p>

The bill asserts that any such documents signed by a device would have no legal force or effect.

          <p>The British government plans to introduce legislation that will grant 16 and 17-year-olds the right to vote in all U.K. elections. The move would add approximately 1.5 million young people to the electorate, representing the most significant expansion of the franchise since 1969. This change presents a new challenge for political parties, who will need to engage this demographic, which increasingly consumes news through social media platforms like TikTok. While the Labour Party is expected to benefit, the right-wing Reform UK party also has a strong social media presence that could appeal to these new voters.</p>

          <p>With an August 1 deadline approaching, the European Union is simultaneously negotiating with the U.S. and preparing countermeasures in case President Trump imposes a threatened 30% tariff. The White House has stated it will not postpone the deadline, increasing pressure on the EU to reach an agreement. The EU's strategy involves good-faith negotiations, preparing retaliatory tariffs, coordinating with other affected nations, and strengthening its own economic competitiveness. As part of a potential deal, the EU is reportedly considering offering a reduction in its 10% tariff on U.S. cars if Washington lowers its own auto tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>HMP Pentonville in London has been put into special measures after an inspection revealed "shocking failures," including the illegal detention of inmates past their release dates. A report from the chief inspector of prisons found that staff had failed to calculate sentences accurately, resulting in 130 inmates being held too long over a six-month period. The prison was also described as being infested with cockroaches and mice, with most prisoners locked in overcrowded cells for over 22 hours a day. The Justice Secretary has 28 days to respond with an action plan to address the "frightening conditions."</p>

          <p>Former UK Defence Secretary Sir Grant Shapps has defended the government's decision to use a super-injunction to hide a major data breach that exposed the details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had worked with Britain. The 2022 breach, which also included data on over 100 British officials, was kept secret due to fears that those exposed would be targeted and killed by the Taliban. Shapps argued the secrecy was justified to save lives, though he was surprised the injunction lasted so long. The breach forced the government to covertly create a new resettlement scheme for those affected, costing an estimated £850 million.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the deaths of 27 children and staff at a Texas summer camp, experts are urging parents to ask camps specific questions about safety protocols for extreme weather. With federal oversight of camps being minimal and state regulations varying widely, parents should inquire about plans for heat, floods, and wildfires. Key questions include how camps manage heat exposure with shade and hydration, whether they are located in floodplains, and what their specific emergency action and communication plans are. Experts stress that generic assurances are not enough and that detailed procedures should be in place.</p>

While supporters of the cut cited ideological bias and misuse of taxpayer dollars, executives at public media outlets warn the move will be devastating. Small stations, particularly those serving rural and tribal communities that rely heavily on federal aid, may be forced to go off the air.</p>
