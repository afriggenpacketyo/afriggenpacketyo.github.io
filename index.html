        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming Supreme Court term is set to tackle several contentious issues, though outcomes in some areas appear predictable. Key cases involve the legality of President Trump's tariffs, the future of the Voting Rights Act's protections against racial gerrymandering, and campaign finance regulations. The conservative-majority court is also expected to rule on state laws concerning transgender athletes and bans on conversion therapy, likely favoring conservative positions. While the tariffs case presents some uncertainty, observers anticipate significant shifts in election law and LGBTQ rights, continuing the court's rightward trend.</p>

The program, designed to attract foreign talent for specialized jobs, has been a cornerstone for many immigrant entrepreneurs who have founded major companies. While some of these leaders, like Musk and Nadella, have voiced support for reforms to the system, they also emphasize its critical role in maintaining U.S. competitiveness and innovation by bringing essential talent into the country.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has announced it will begin a phased restart of manufacturing operations at its UK plants after a cyberattack forced a complete shutdown on September 1. The halt in production at its Solihull, Wolverhampton, and Halewood facilities has placed immense financial strain on the company and its extensive supply chain, which employs around 100,000 people. While the resumption of work is welcome news for suppliers, many of whom faced bankruptcy, they caution that a full return to capacity will take weeks and that government financial assistance, including £1.5bn in loan guarantees, remains crucial for their survival.</p>

          <p>A tragic cable car accident at a forest monastery in Sri Lanka has claimed the life of an eighth Buddhist monk, who succumbed to his injuries in the hospital. The incident occurred when a makeshift cabin carrying 13 monks plunged down a mountainside after its cable reportedly snapped. Seven monks, including three foreign nationals from Romania, Russia, and India, were killed instantly in the crash. The monks were traveling to meditation units within the Na Uyana monastery, and investigations are underway to determine the exact cause of the catastrophic failure.</p>

          <p>Emma Walmsley, the chief executive of pharmaceutical giant GSK, has announced she will step down on December 31 after more than eight years leading the company. Walmsley, the first woman to head a major drugmaker, will be succeeded by current Chief Commercial Officer Luke Miels. During her tenure, she oversaw significant strategic moves, including the successful spinoff of the consumer healthcare division, Haleon.

          <p>Federal and local authorities are investigating the motive behind a violent attack at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, where a gunman killed at least four people and injured eight others. The suspect, identified as 40-year-old veteran Thomas Jacob Sanford, drove his truck into the church, opened fire on the congregation, and set the building on fire before being killed in a shootout with police. The FBI is leading the investigation, treating it as an "act of targeted violence," and exploring potential connections to recent threats or the death of church president Russell M. Nelson the previous day.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's health department, led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is launching a new safety review of mifepristone, the drug used in most U.S. abortions. The review is based on a non-peer-reviewed study from a conservative think tank that has been widely criticized by medical experts for flawed methodology. This action is seen as the administration's latest effort to curtail abortion access, following other measures that have restricted funding for providers. Critics argue the move relies on "junk science" to appease anti-abortion activists and threatens access to a medication that has been proven safe and effective for over 25 years.</p>

          <p>White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller has reportedly been a central figure in directing U.S. military strikes against boats in international waters suspected of carrying drugs from Venezuela. According to sources, Miller, in his capacity as homeland security adviser, has wielded significant influence over the operations, sometimes superseding other top officials. The legal justification for these strikes, which have involved using Hellfire missiles, is based on the Trump administration's designation of the Tren de Aragua cartel as a foreign terrorist organization linked to the Venezuelan government, an argument that has been challenged in federal court.</p>

          <p>This article argues that American politics has entered a dangerous "illiberalism doom loop," where both Republicans and Democrats increasingly deploy tactics they once condemned in their opponents. It notes that after years of decrying "cancel culture," the Trump administration is now using state power to pressure universities, media, and political adversaries. This tit-for-tat cycle erodes foundational democratic norms like free speech and the rule of law. The author warns that this behavior, rooted in grievance politics, creates a self-perpetuating cycle where each side feels justified in using more extreme measures, pushing the country towards a postliberal future.</p>

          <p>A growing number of users are reporting experiences where they feel an AI chatbot, like ChatGPT, has become sentient, but experts urge skepticism. Most AI researchers believe current large language models are not conscious; instead, they are sophisticated mimics trained on vast amounts of text, including science fiction, which leads them to convincingly play the role of a sentient being. An update in April allowing ChatGPT to remember past chats likely contributes to the illusion of a persistent identity. While the possibility of a non-human-like AI consciousness isn't entirely dismissed, users are advised to stay grounded and not take dramatic actions based on these interactions.</p>

          <p>For the millions who experience Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) or milder "winter blues," experts suggest that starting bright light therapy in the fall can be an effective preventative measure. Using a 10,000-lux light box for about 30 minutes each morning helps reset the body's internal clock, which can be disrupted by diminishing daylight. Research has shown that light therapy can be as effective as antidepressant medication for seasonal depression and can improve symptoms within a week. Making this a consistent part of a morning routine can provide an enduring positive effect throughout the darker fall and winter months.</p>

          <h2>Malnutrition-Related Form of Diabetes Officially Named 'Type 5'</h2>

          <p>An international team of researchers is formally recognizing a distinct form of diabetes, linked to malnutrition, as "Type 5 diabetes." First observed in Jamaica in the 1950s, this type affects young, thin individuals who produce some insulin but not enough, and it doesn't fit the profiles of Type 1 or Type 2. The condition, which could affect up to 25 million people, has often been misdiagnosed as Type 1, leading to potentially lethal treatments with excessive insulin. By giving it a formal name, advocates hope to galvanize research and develop safer, more effective treatment protocols.</p>

          <p>This story recounts how a sixth-grade teacher's simple hug had a profound and lasting impact on a student named Tanya Eby. Feeling abandoned after her friends ostracized her, her brother was sent to live with her dad, and her stepdad left, Tanya broke down in class. Her teacher, Mrs. Welch, listened to her story and offered a comforting hug. That single moment of empathy made Tanya feel seen and centered, helping her believe she would be okay. Now a college writing teacher herself, Tanya reflects on how that small act of kindness shaped her own empathy for students.</p>

          <p>A surprising trend has emerged where jumping spiders, affectionately nicknamed "spoods," are becoming popular pets, particularly among women who were formerly arachnophobic. Thanks to viral social media videos showcasing their seemingly cute antics, breeders are seeing a massive surge in demand for these tiny, intelligent arachnids. Owners are drawn to their distinct personalities and the relative ease of their care. Experts note that jumping spiders are surprisingly complex, with excellent eyesight and the ability to plan, making them more engaging than one might expect from an insect-sized pet.</p>

          <p>Israeli soldiers surviving catastrophic injuries from the war in Gaza are benefiting from significant medical advances, including drones that deliver whole blood directly to the battlefield. Surgeons have also developed new protocols, such as performing immediate, comprehensive surgery on multiple severe injuries rather than staging them, which has been crucial in saving limbs. One civilian surgeon's innovative techniques have saved the limbs of 35 soldiers and have been shared with doctors at the Mayo Clinic in the U.S. These developments highlight how the crucible of war is accelerating medical innovation, though the soldiers carry profound physical and psychological scars.</p>
