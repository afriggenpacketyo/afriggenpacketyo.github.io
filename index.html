        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Norwich City dismissed head coach Johannes Hoff Thorup following a series of defeats, appointing former Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere as his replacement for the remaining two games of the season. Sporting director Ben Knapper cited disappointing results as the reason for the change, despite having a long-term focus initially. Wilshere, previously a first-team coach, will be assisted by Tony Roberts and Nick Stanley. Norwich, despite scoring many goals, have struggled defensively this season, which ultimately contributed to the decision to sack Thorup.</p>

          <p>Florida's public university system has entered into agreements with ICE, granting campus police immigration enforcement powers. This collaboration allows them to question, arrest, and prepare charges for suspected immigration violations, effectively acting as "force multipliers" for ICE. This move contrasts with elite universities in the Northeast that have resisted such cooperation, and it has sparked protests and concerns about academic freedom and the targeting of international students, especially those involved in pro-Palestinian protests. The agreements are unprecedented and raise questions about the future of immigration enforcement on college campuses.</p>

However, the Policing Minister argues this would hinder monitoring of serious antisemitism and racist incidents. NCHIs are alleged acts perceived to be motivated by hostility or prejudice, but do not constitute a criminal offense.</p>

This move comes amid rising domestic calls for more affordable imported rice due to supply shortages and surging prices.

          <p>Since President Trump announced sweeping tariffs, various economic indicators suggest growing anxiety. Consumer confidence has plummeted, and there's panic-buying of products likely to see price hikes. Manufacturing is slowing, contradicting Trump's goal of reviving American manufacturing. While it's too early to predict a recession, the tariffs are already shifting economic activity, impacting consumer spending and business confidence. The data indicates that Trump's policies are having the opposite of their intended effect.</p>

          <p>President Trump's administration is experiencing increased infighting and backstabbing among its members, fueled by controversies related to trade, national security, and personal loyalty. Tensions are evident within the Pentagon, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth facing criticism. The interpersonal drama reflects Trump's management style and could lead to further turmoil as he pursues significant policy changes. The lack of a consistent ideology and the inexperience of many officials contribute to the internal strife.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is considering expanding tariff-free imports of U.S.-grown rice as part of negotiations over higher levies imposed by Washington. A proposal involves increasing the amount imported from the United States to around 410,000 tons from the current 350,000. This move aims to secure exemption from U.S. tariffs and address domestic calls for more affordable imported rice. The decision balances trade negotiations with the need to protect the domestic rice industry.</p>

          <p>A decline in air travel to the U.S., potentially linked to President Trump's tariffs and other policies, is impacting Walt Disney's theme park business. International guests account for a significant portion of Disney's park attendance, and recent data shows a decrease in foreign arrivals. This slowdown, combined with increased competition from Universal's new theme park, could lead to reduced spending and attendance at Disney's parks.
