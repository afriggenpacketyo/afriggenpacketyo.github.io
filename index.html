          <p>According to a Kremlin statement, President Vladimir Putin will not attend the peace talks with Ukraine in Turkey; instead, a hard-line aide will lead the Russian delegation. President Trump also indicated he would not attend, sending Secretary of State Marco Rubio in his place. Zelensky expressed his readiness for negotiations but emphasized the need for Western pressure on Russia to halt the conflict. The stakes remain high for both sides in the ongoing war, with Russia claiming battlefield victories despite significant troop losses and equipment depletion, while Ukraine seeks security guarantees from the United States.</p>

          <p>While some Afrikaners are taking up President Trump's offer to resettle in the US due to concerns about crime and land policies, many others are choosing to stay in South Africa and contribute to the country's future. The US offer came after claims of a 'genocide' against white Afrikaners, a claim widely discredited, even though farm attacks do occur in a country with a high murder rate affecting all citizens. Some who are leaving cite land invasions and a lack of government support, while those staying express pride in their Afrikaner origins and a commitment to building a better future for all South Africans. The US embassy clarified that applicants need to be of South African nationality, Afrikaner or from a racial minority, and able to cite an incident of past persecution or fear of persecution in the future.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole after serving over three decades for the 1989 killings of their parents.

Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman opposed the resentencing, while relatives of the Menendez brothers expressed joy and hope for their release.

          <p>Sixty-five survivors of Hamas captivity are appealing to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Donald Trump, and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff to prioritize the release of remaining hostages, even if it requires halting military operations. Following Edan Alexanderâ€™s release, the former hostages urged leaders to seize the opportunity and pursue a comprehensive deal. Keith Siegel, among the signatories, has previously credited Trump for securing his release and is now advocating for the freedom of all captives in Gaza. Trump has been working on deals in the Middle East, but their connection to the remaining hostages is unclear.</p>

          <p>Overdose deaths in the United States experienced a significant drop last year, marking the most substantial progress in over a decade, yet this positive trend coincides with proposed funding cuts to crucial federal health programs. Data from the CDC reveals a nearly 27% decrease in drug fatalities nationwide, with declines observed across major drug categories and in most states. While experts attribute this progress to factors such as changes in the illicit drug supply and increased access to treatment, concerns linger about the sustainability of these gains in light of potential budget reductions affecting addiction-related initiatives.</p>

This move counters the trend of voters supporting abortion rights in state ballot measures since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, setting the stage for a contentious political battle.</p>

          <p>In Westlake, Los Angeles, two individuals were discovered deceased inside a tent at a homeless encampment, occurring months after a fatal fire at the same location. The Los Angeles Police Department responded to the scene, and the L.A. County medical examiner's office is working to determine the cause of death, with police not investigating the deaths as homicides. This incident underscores the ongoing challenges and dangers faced by individuals experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles, where drug overdoses and encampment fires contribute to a high mortality rate.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced plans to weaken limits on certain "forever chemicals" in drinking water, reversing standards finalized last year, while maintaining limits on PFOA and PFOS. The EPA will scrap limits on three types of PFAS, including GenX substances, and a limit on a mixture of several PFAS types. The agency will also give utilities two extra years, until 2031, to comply with standards for PFOA and PFOS. This decision has drawn criticism from health advocates who argue it undermines efforts to protect Americans from harmful chemicals.</p>

Trump urged al-Sharaa to join the Abraham Accords and normalize ties with Israel, while also addressing terrorism and chemical weapons concerns.

          <p>State Farm customers in California are set to pay more for homeowners insurance after the state approved a 17% premium increase, following a judge's ruling that the company faced "extraordinary financial distress" due to recent wildfires. The decision grants State Farm a $400 million cash infusion from its parent company, though it is lower than the initially proposed 21.8% increase. The increases will take effect on June 1, pending another hearing, with the company agreeing to refrain from implementing new non-renewal programs through the end of 2025.</p>
