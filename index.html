          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland to negotiate a framework trade agreement. The meeting aims to prevent a proposed 30% U.S. tariff on EU imports, which is set to take effect on August 1st. There is cautious optimism for a deal, with sources suggesting a potential compromise involving a 15% baseline tariff, similar to a recent U.S.-Japan agreement. The outcome of these talks is critical for the massive transatlantic trade relationship, which represents nearly a third of global trade. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pemiscot Memorial, a vital hospital in Missouri's poorest county, is on the brink of closure due to financial instability, a situation potentially worsened by a new bill championed by Donald Trump. The legislation mandates significant cuts to Medicaid, a primary revenue source for the hospital, by introducing work requirements and capping provider taxes. This poses a severe threat to healthcare access in a region where the hospital is the only nearby emergency facility for many residents. Despite local support for Trump and the Republican lawmakers who passed the bill, hospital leaders and community members fear the cuts will devastate the local healthcare system and economy.</p>

          <p>WWE icon Hulk Hogan passed away at age 71, reportedly from cardiac arrest, following a long history of significant health problems. In recent years, Hogan disclosed that he had undergone 25 surgeries, including ten on his back, as well as multiple joint replacements, attributing these issues to the physical toll of his 40-year wrestling career. Despite his health battles, which included admitted steroid use in the 1990s and a recent major neck surgery, Hogan expressed no regrets about his career. Medical experts note that the physical strain and lifestyle associated with his era of professional wrestling often led to premature health complications.</p>

          <p>A new study from Keck Medicine of USC reveals a significant increase in serious liver disease among Americans who drink heavily, even though overall alcohol consumption patterns have not changed. The research found that the proportion of heavy drinkers with advanced liver scarring, or fibrosis, has more than doubled over the last two decades. This trend is particularly pronounced in women, older individuals, and those with metabolic conditions like obesity and diabetes. Researchers suggest the changing health profile of the American drinker is a key factor and warn that liver disease is often silent, with many people unaware of their condition until it is dangerously advanced.</p>

          <p>Following the death of actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner, a columnist reflects on the profound impact his character, Theo Huxtable from "The Cosby Show," had on Black America. Alongside other influential TV characters, Theo provided a positive and relatable representation of Black youth, challenging stereotypes and offering a vision of a supportive, successful Black family that was rare on television at the time. The article argues that Warner carried a significant cultural burden with grace, helping to redefine Blackness in the public eye simply by portraying a normal young man navigating life's challenges. The community's gratitude is rooted in recognition of his contribution to a more positive and humane narrative.</p>

However, she warns that these rights are now under threat from an administration that has scapegoated disabled people, cut accessibility guidelines, and reduced Medicaid funding.

          <p>Despite the Trump administration's rhetoric of deporting the "worst of the worst," an analysis of ICE data reveals a different reality in the Los Angeles area. In June, seven out of ten immigrants arrested had no criminal convictions, a sharp increase from previous months. This shift coincides with an aggressive new mandate to increase daily arrests, leading to the detention of individuals like garment workers and tamale vendors. Critics and researchers argue the administration is focusing on a minority of violent offenders in its messaging to justify broader enforcement actions that are sweeping up non-criminal members of the community, causing public support for the policies to decline.</p>

          <p>Humanitarian expert Alex de Waal argues that Israel's establishment of "secure distribution sites" for food in Gaza is a deceptive measure that serves as an alibi for the ongoing mass starvation of Palestinians. He contends that the amount of aid provided is less than half of what is needed and the distribution method, which requires people to risk their lives in military zones, favors the strong over the most vulnerable. The aid lacks essential therapeutic foods for malnourished children and ignores the severe lack of clean water and cooking fuel. De Waal concludes that these food points are not a genuine humanitarian effort but a tool to degrade and humiliate Palestinians while avoiding international condemnation.</p>

          <p>A 25-year-old Cuban asylum seeker, identified as Jenny, was abruptly detained by ICE agents in an El Paso courthouse corridor moments after a judge scheduled her next hearing for 2026. This incident is part of a wider, aggressive tactic under the Trump administration where migrants attending their required court dates are being arrested, often to be placed in fast-tracked deportation proceedings. Advocacy groups report that ICE is targeting not only recent arrivals but also individuals with ongoing cases and clear pathways to legal status. These courthouse arrests are creating a climate of fear, potentially discouraging immigrants from appearing in court and thus jeopardizing their cases.</p>

Meanwhile, first-time and middle-income buyers are largely priced out by the combination of high prices and elevated mortgage rates.

Tensions are heightened by Turkey's potential military support for Damascus, as Ankara views the SDF as a threat and desires their disarmament.

While the government is accelerating efforts to get aid onto planes, some critics, including MP Sarah Champion, describe airdrops as largely symbolic and inefficient, calling instead for Israel to open all land borders to prevent a man-made famine.

Thailand's military significantly outnumbers Cambodia's in both personnel and advanced weaponry, boasting a modern air force with Swedish Gripen and U.S. F-16 jets, which Cambodia lacks. While Thailand benefits from decades of U.S. support and a robust domestic arms industry, Cambodia relies heavily on Chinese and Russian equipment and has deepening defense links with Beijing. Despite Thailand's military superiority, analysts note that the difficult border terrain may favor Cambodian forces, potentially leading Thailand to rely on its superior air power.</p>

          <p>The anticipated recovery in the luxury goods market is facing several key challenges, despite some better-than-feared results from industry leader LVMH. A sharp decline in the Japanese yen has weakened a previously booming tourist market, while the looming threat of U.S. tariffs is forcing many European brands to consider price increases. Furthermore, sales performance is diverging significantly by product category, with high-end jewelry and leather goods showing resilience for some brands like Hermes, while others struggle. A slight uptick in U.S. sales has provided a glimmer of hope, though it is unclear if this is sustainable or driven by pre-tariff purchasing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As U.S. President Donald Trump arrives in Scotland for a visit to his golf resorts, he is being met with organized resistance and local discontent. Activists in Aberdeenshire, still angered by the environmental impact of his Menie resort, are planning protests, while residents near his Turnberry course face road diversions and a heavy police presence. Many locals and activists express frustration that UK and Scottish leaders are meeting with Trump, arguing it does not represent public sentiment. Protestors are connecting his visit to broader transnational struggles against fascism, signaling a shift from previous demonstrations that were more locally focused.</p>

          <p>China's recent announcement to expand duty-free access for nearly all products from 53 African nations is strengthening its position as a preferred partner on the continent. This move contrasts sharply with recent U.S. policies, which include threats of foreign aid cuts, new visa restrictions, and impending tariffs on imports from several African countries. Observers note that these differing approaches are causing African nations to increasingly see Beijing as a more reliable and beneficial partner. Washington's long-held belief that its humanitarian aid would secure goodwill is being challenged as its trade and diplomatic policies create friction and push African countries closer to China.</p>

          <h2>Taiwan Holds Unprecedented Recall Election Targeting China-Friendly Lawmakers</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Taiwanese voters participated in a large-scale recall election on Saturday, targeting 24 lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The vote was driven by public anger over the KMT-led legislative bloc's actions, which include blocking key defense budgets and passing controversial reforms seen as favoring Beijing. The recall effort, if successful, could reshape the power balance in the legislature, where the ruling Democratic Progressive Party currently lacks a majority. The KMT has condemned the recalls as political retaliation, while the elections have intensified tensions between those who favor Taiwanese sovereignty and those who advocate for closer ties with China.</p>

          <h2>Investigation Reveals Parkinson's and RLS Drugs Can Cause Extreme Compulsive Behaviors</h2>

          <p>A BBC investigation has uncovered numerous cases where patients prescribed dopamine agonists, such as Ropinirole for Parkinson's disease, developed extreme compulsive behaviors, including hypersexuality and gambling addictions. One family was torn apart after a father began secretly recording his wife and obsessively using porn sites, which his family attributes to his medication. The article reveals that while drug manufacturers were aware of links to such behaviors decades ago, current warnings on patient leaflets remain vague. Critics are calling for stronger, clearer warnings as doctors are reportedly still not adequately informing patients of these devastating potential side effects.</p>

          <p>A labor dispute involving private waste-management company Republic Services has left trash overflowing in cities across the United States this summer. The strike, which began in the Boston area on July 1st and spread to other states, involves thousands of Teamsters union members who say they are underpaid and receive poor benefits. While some local disputes have been resolved, many workers remain on strike, leading to foul odors, pest concerns, and public frustration. Affected municipalities are suing the company for breach of contract and are being forced to find alternative, costly solutions to manage the accumulating waste.</p>

          <p>Officials have confirmed that an explosion that killed three Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies at a training facility was caused by the detonation of a grenade they had recovered a day earlier. The deputies from the Arson Explosives Detail had believed the device was inert. In a concerning development, a second grenade recovered from the same Santa Monica location is now missing, though authorities are confident it was brought to the training facility. The ATF is leading a search for the missing explosive, and the Sheriff's Department has revised its policies, marking the department's largest loss of life since 1857.</p>
