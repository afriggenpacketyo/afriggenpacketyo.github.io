          <p>Oasis initiated their highly anticipated reunion tour in Cardiff, delivering a powerful performance that largely won over critics and fans after a 16-year absence. The band played a setlist of their classic 1990s hits, with Liam Gallagher’s vocals noted as being particularly strong and rejuvenated. While the infamous brotherly feud was still palpable through their lack of on-stage interaction, the emotional weight of their music and a brief hug at the end resonated with the 70,000-strong audience. The reviewer praised the show as the band's best since 1995, highlighting the enduring relevance of their anthems.</p>

          <p>At the Chester Zoo in the U.K., a same-sex pair of male Humboldt penguins named Scampi and Flounder are successfully raising a chick. Zookeepers strategically placed an egg from another penguin couple into their care to improve the chick's chances of survival, part of a highly successful breeding season for the zoo. This heartwarming event highlights a natural behavior in penguins while also contributing to vital conservation efforts for the Humboldt species, which is listed as vulnerable to extinction. The zoo is now home to 63 penguins, bolstering the genetically healthy population in European conservation programs.</p>

          <p>Hamas has formally delivered what it termed a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-backed proposal for a ceasefire and hostage release in Gaza, signaling a readiness to enter negotiations. However, a senior Palestinian official familiar with the discussions clarified that the group is seeking several key amendments to the framework. These demands include a U.S. guarantee that hostilities will not resume if talks for a permanent end to the war fail. As diplomatic efforts continue, the Israeli military has maintained its operations across Gaza, with the territory's health ministry reporting 138 Palestinian fatalities in a 24-hour period.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protestors gathered in downtown Los Angeles on the Fourth of July to rally against recent large-scale immigration raids and a new federal spending bill that increases funding for such enforcement. Demonstrators marched from City Hall to the federal building, expressing fear and anger over the Trump administration's aggressive immigration crackdown, which has created a climate of fear in the community. Local officials, including Mayor Karen Bass and Assemblymember Isaac Bryan, condemned the raids and the bill, highlighting the tension between state and federal authorities over immigration policy.

          <p>Germany began its Women's Euro 2025 campaign with a 2-0 victory over Poland, but the win was overshadowed by a significant injury to captain Giulia Gwinn. The Bayern Munich fullback was forced to leave the field in tears during the first half after a knee injury, raising serious concerns given her history of two prior ACL tears. Goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller secured the three points for the eight-time champions, who otherwise appeared wasteful in front of goal.

          <p>Recent diplomatic events highlight India's growing position as a potential counterbalance to China's leadership within Global South-focused organizations like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and Brics. A recent meeting of SCO defense ministers failed to produce a joint statement due to a lack of consensus on language regarding terrorism, reportedly due to Indian objections. This incident underscores the procedural power India wields, as both the SCO and Brics require consensus for decision-making.

The group had sought a temporary injunction to block the government's proscription order, which will criminalize membership or support for the group with penalties of up to 14 years in prison. The government moved to ban the group following activism that caused millions in damages, including to aircraft at an RAF base. Palestine Action's legal team argued the ban was an "authoritarian abuse" of power against a civil disobedience group.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has issued a temporary stay, pausing the Trump administration's attempt to deport eight migrants to South Sudan, a country with which they have no ties. The men, who were convicted of violent crimes in the U.S., were being held at a military facility in Djibouti after their initial removal flight was blocked by a lower court. The new ruling provides a brief window for their lawyers to argue that sending them to South Sudan, where they could face harm or torture, is unconstitutional.

          <p>The comprehensive tax and spending package signed into law by President Trump enacts significant policy changes, including making most of the 2017 tax cuts permanent. The 887-page bill also introduces new restrictions and work requirements for Medicaid and the SNAP food assistance program, which the CBO estimates will cause millions to lose coverage. Furthermore, it allocates billions in new funding for border security and immigration enforcement, increases the SALT deduction cap temporarily, and terminates many green energy incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act. The legislation is projected to add over $3 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Clarifies New Bill Does Not Eliminate Taxes on Social Security Benefits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 16:35:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to some claims, the newly passed "big, beautiful bill" does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits, according to policy experts. Instead, the legislation introduces a new temporary tax deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors aged 65 and older with incomes below a certain threshold, which can be applied to all income, not just Social Security. This distinction is important, as the underlying taxation rules for Social Security benefits remain unchanged. The relief will not benefit many low-income seniors who already have no federal tax liability, while potentially providing the most significant advantage to higher-income beneficiaries.

          <p>The technology IPO market is showing signs of life after a prolonged downturn, with crypto company Circle's stock surging over 500% since its June debut. This success, along with the strong performance of AI firm CoreWeave, has provided much-needed returns for venture capital firms that have faced a liquidity drought since early 2022. While the market is not fully recovered, with many large private companies still on the sidelines, the increase in public offerings has sparked cautious optimism among investors. The industry hopes this momentum signals a sustained trend, ending the "zombie company" risk for many startups. (not investment advice)</p>

The report states that Russian forces are deploying substances like the WWI-era poison gas chloropicrin and riot control agents against Ukrainian soldiers in trenches. This forces them into the open where they are then targeted by conventional fire. The findings have prompted calls from Dutch officials for increased sanctions against Moscow and underscore the brutal nature of the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>A wildfire in California's Los Padres National Forest, dubbed the Madre Fire, has rapidly grown to over 70,800 acres, making it the largest blaze in the state so far this year. The fire, which is currently 10% contained, has prompted evacuation orders and warnings in parts of San Luis Obispo and Kern counties. With the holiday weekend approaching, officials have warned of the potential dangers posed by the fire's exponential growth, which has been fueled by weather, terrain, and fuel conditions.

          <p>During a speech in Iowa, President Trump used the term "shylocks" to refer to some lenders, a word that is widely recognized as an antisemitic slur. The term originates from a Jewish character in Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice" and evokes harmful stereotypes about Jewish people and greed. When questioned by reporters, the president claimed he was unaware of the term's antisemitic connotations, stating he understood it to simply mean a moneylender charging high rates. The Anti-Defamation League and other critics condemned the remark as irresponsible and dangerous, calling it a blatant example of antisemitism.</p>

When armed police later attempted to arrest him in the car park, he and his brother, Muhammad Amaad, allegedly resisted violently, resulting in injuries to the officers, including a broken nose for one. The defendants deny the charges, claiming they acted in self-defense, but the prosecution asserts their use of force was unlawful and excessive.</p>

          <p>The new federal budget package signed by President Trump includes a provision creating a new tax deduction for tipped workers, a policy he has promoted as "no tax on tips." The legislation allows employees who earn tips, such as restaurant servers and bartenders, to deduct a portion of their income from their federal taxes, though they will still owe state, local, and payroll taxes. Critics note that the tax break is temporary, expiring in 2028, and may not benefit the lowest-wage workers who often have no federal tax liability to begin with. The bill sets income caps for eligibility and limits the total deduction amount. (not investment advice)</p>
