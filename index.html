          <p>A limited number of National Guard members deployed in Washington D.C. have been authorized to carry service weapons, marking an escalation in President Trump's law enforcement efforts in the capital. This directive from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reverses previous guidance, with nearly 2,000 troops currently stationed to combat what the President calls an "epidemic of crime." However, local data indicates a decline in violent crime over the past 18 months, leading city officials to deem the initiative unnecessary. The armed guardsmen are operating under established Rules for the Use of Force, allowing force only as a last resort against imminent threats, primarily focused on protecting landmarks and crowd control.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mississippi has declared a public health emergency after its infant mortality rate surged to 9.7 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2024, nearly double the national average, with over 3,500 infant deaths since 2014. The crisis is exacerbated by stark racial disparities, as Black infants are twice as likely to die, and is linked to factors like congenital malformations and premature birth. State officials plan to expand prenatal services and strengthen community health programs, but federal funding cuts to vital maternal and infant health initiatives, like PRAMS, complicate efforts. Medicaid expansion, which Mississippi has not adopted, has shown significant improvements in infant health in other states.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer offers his "Monday playbook" following a significant stock market rally, which he attributes to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's signals of impending interest rate cuts at Jackson Hole.

          <p>France has formally summoned U.S. Ambassador Charles Kushner following his letter to President Emmanuel Macron, which alleged insufficient French action against rising antisemitism, deeming the claims "unacceptable." The French foreign ministry cited the 1961 Vienna Convention, emphasizing the obligation not to interfere in internal state affairs, and stated that the allegations undermine the transatlantic partnership. France acknowledges a regrettable increase in antisemitic acts since October 7, 2023, and asserts its full mobilization against such incidents. This diplomatic disagreement adds to existing strains between the two nations, which have also seen tensions over trade tariffs and the future of U.N. peacekeepers in Lebanon.</p>

          <p>Chinese property developer Evergrande has been delisted from the Hong Kong stock market after a spectacular collapse under massive debts, marking a grim milestone for the once-$50bn firm. The delisting, described as inevitable, highlights its central role in China's ongoing property crisis, which has significantly dragged on the world's second-largest economy. Founder Hui Ka Yan's fortune plummeted, and he faces fines for overstating revenue. The crisis has led to widespread layoffs, reduced consumer spending, and falling housing prices, impacting household savings.

While the Biden administration repealed some Trump-era restrictions, the underlying law remains. Trump's policies, which designated some cartels as terrorist organizations, create a complex situation where victims fear being accused of "material support" if coerced by gangs. This leads many to live in hiding, fearing deportation while awaiting lengthy asylum processes.</p>

          <p>Lourdes, France, stands as a renowned site of profound mystery and documented medical miracles, with the Catholic Church officially recognizing over 70 unexplained cures in 163 years. Millions of pilgrims visit annually, inspired by countless stories of miraculous recoveries. The Lourdes Office of Medical Observations, under Dr. Alessandro de Franciscis, conducts exhaustive, decade-long investigations into thousands of reported claims. Their stringent criteria require a severe disease, a sudden, complete, and lasting cure, and crucially, no possible medical explanation. Medical experts, including Dr. Esther Sternberg, have attested to the credibility of these conclusions, underscoring the rigorous scrutiny applied to these extraordinary events.</p>

          <p>Newly surfaced evidence concerning the 9/11 attacks, specifically a 1999 video of Saudi national Omar al-Bayoumi filming the U.S. Capitol and an airplane descent equation, was reportedly not shared with FBI field agents or top intelligence officials for years. Bayoumi, identified as a suspected Saudi intelligence operative with links to two hijackers, filmed potential targets within 90 days of al Qaeda's planning for the attacks. Retired FBI and CIA personnel, who were unaware of this crucial information, express significant concern, suggesting it could have altered the investigation's trajectory and challenged the 9/11 Commission's conclusions. This discovery highlights critical failures in intelligence dissemination.</p>

          <p>A human case of the flesh-eating screwworm parasite has been confirmed in Maryland, originating from an individual who traveled from Guatemala, marking the first new confirmed case in the U.S. this year. This parasitic fly, which consumes the living flesh of warm-blooded animals and is fatal if untreated, is part of an escalating outbreak moving northward from Central America. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has faced criticism for its slow response but now plans to construct a sterile fly facility in Texas, aiming to combat the pest using a method that successfully eradicated screwworm from the U.S. in the 1960s. This development could significantly impact the already strained beef and cattle futures market.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has accused President Trump of "manufacturing a crisis" to justify deploying federalized National Guard troops to Chicago, overriding local leadership. This proposed intervention, following similar deployments in Washington D.C. and Los Angeles, faces strong opposition from Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who condemn it as an "abuse of power" and a "flagrant violation of our constitution." Trump asserts that Chicago residents are "screaming for us to come" to address crime, despite local data indicating significant reductions. Critics view this as a politically motivated maneuver targeting predominantly Democratic-run cities.</p>

          <p>Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse has been removed from his position as Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) director, a decision that followed a DIA assessment which contradicted President Trump's public statements on the effectiveness of U.S. strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities. The DIA's findings indicated the strikes set back Iran's program by only months, not the "decades" Trump claimed, and also revealed some enriched uranium had been relocated prior to the attacks. While intelligence committee leaders were informed without specific reasons, Pentagon officials stated such leaders serve "at the pleasure of President Trump." This ousting, coupled with other recent military removals, raises significant concerns about the politicization of intelligence within the administration.</p>

          <p>A homeowner received a warning from their HOA for charging a Tesla in their driveway, with the prohibition stemming not from the electric vehicle itself, but from the perceived "ugly" appearance of the charging cord. The HOA's letter cited "Electrical chords running along the ground for Electrical Vehicle charging are not permitted," referencing NEC 625. However, numerous online commenters and an expert in renewable energy contended that this interpretation was a misapplication of the National Electrical Code and not a safety issue. The incident underscores frequent homeowner frustrations with HOAs that prioritize aesthetic control and micromanagement over practical considerations, often exceeding their regulatory authority.</p>

          <p>A devastating, fiery multi-vehicle crash on Interstate 15 in Temecula on Saturday night resulted in four fatalities after a BMW M4, reportedly driven recklessly, crossed the concrete median into southbound lanes. The BMW collided with a Nissan Sentra, instantly igniting. Three passengers in the BMW—a 23-year-old woman, a 14-year-old boy, and a 15-year-old girl—were killed, while the 25-year-old BMW driver sustained major injuries but survived. The 35-year-old driver of the Sentra also tragically died en route to the hospital. Authorities are investigating the collision, with charges pending against the BMW driver, though alcohol has been ruled out as a contributing factor.</p>

While expressing cautious optimism for a trade deal later this autumn, Da Wei's broader commentary highlights significant underlying flaws in the U.S. approach. His expertise lies in China-U.S. relations and U.S. security and foreign policy, providing a nuanced perspective on China's expanding role on the global stage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Seattle Mariners slugger Cal Raleigh made history by hitting his 48th and 49th home runs against the Athletics, setting a new single-season record for catchers, surpassing Salvador Perez's 2021 total. Raleigh's achievement also marked his ninth multi-home run game of the season, breaking Mickey Mantle's record for switch-hitters. The 28-year-old, a first-time All-Star and Home Run Derby winner, has launched 40 homers while catching this year, placing him among elite Hall of Fame catchers who achieved similar power numbers. This remarkable season positions Raleigh to potentially become the first American League catcher to lead the major leagues outright in home runs.</p>
