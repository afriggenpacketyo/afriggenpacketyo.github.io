            <p>The U.S. Embassy in the Bahamas has issued a warning to women renting jet skis in Nassau, citing multiple reports of rape and sexual assault by jet ski operators. These attacks have occurred on isolated islands near New Providence, with victims being picked up from popular beaches. Since August of last year, several Americans have also been hospitalized due to jet ski accidents, leading the embassy to prohibit U.S. government employees from renting jet skis in the area. The State Department has issued a Level 2 Travel Advisory for the Bahamas due to security risks.</p>

While a Harry Potter-themed area is unlikely due to existing contracts with Warner Bros., the park expects 8.5 million visitors annually and will require significant transport infrastructure upgrades.</p>

            <p>China's consumer prices fell by 0.1% year-on-year in March, signaling increasing deflationary pressures as trade tensions with the U.S. escalate. Producer prices also saw a larger-than-expected decline of 2.5% year-on-year, marking the 29th consecutive month of deflation. This data comes as President Trump increased tariffs on Chinese imports to 125%, prompting China to retaliate with tariffs on U.S. goods.

            <p>A group of UK MPs is advocating for a levy on streaming services' subscription revenues to support British TV production. The Culture, Media and Sport Committee suggests that streaming companies contribute 5% of their UK revenue to a cultural fund for dramas of specific interest to British audiences. The committee emphasizes the importance of supporting independent British producers and safeguarding distinctly British content amid the rise of streaming platforms. Netflix argues that such levies could diminish competitiveness and increase costs for audiences.</p>

            <p>Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, argues that Trump's tariffs are a symptom, not the cause, of deeper global economic issues. He identifies five converging crises: monetary and economic breakdown, domestic political unraveling, geopolitical realignment, climate instability, and technological disruption. Dalio suggests that policymakers should study historical debt-default cycles and the stagflation of the 1970s to understand the current situation. He believes the world is witnessing the slow-motion collapse of the global system. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Los Angeles County public health officials have lifted ocean water advisories for Malibu and Santa Monica beaches affected by the Palisades fire in January. Water testing showed no dangerous levels of chemicals related to wildfires. However, beachgoers are cautioned to avoid fire-related debris in the ocean and on the sand. High tides can carry debris into the water, posing a hazard.</p>

            <p>A Delaware judge has ruled that Newsmax broadcast false and defamatory claims about Dominion Voting Systems' role in the 2020 election. The judge found that Newsmax aired inaccurate information that would likely cause viewers to think negatively about Dominion. This ruling follows a similar defamation lawsuit against Fox News, which resulted in a settlement. Newsmax maintains it covered the issue fairly and will defend itself vigorously at trial.</p>

            <p>President Trump's trade war is increasingly focused on China, with a 125% tariff imposed on Chinese goods while pausing higher tariffs on other nations. This move aims to reshape global trade and challenge China's dominance. The decision follows China's retaliation with an 84% levy on US goods. The future depends on whether China is willing to negotiate and make significant concessions, but the US commitment to free trade remains uncertain.</p>
