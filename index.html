          <p>Japan has relinquished its position as the world's leading creditor for the first time in 34 years, now surpassed by Germany, according to the Finance Ministry. While Japan's net external assets reached a record high, gross external assets totaled 533.05 trillion yen, falling short of Germany's 569.65 trillion yen. The yen's depreciation increased the value of Japan's foreign-currency assets, while Germany benefited from a significant current account surplus. Japan's net external credit increased for the seventh consecutive year, driven by direct investment in the United States by domestic financial institutions and trading houses.

          <p>President Trump announced a delay in implementing a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union, pushing the start date from June 1 to July 9 to allow time for negotiations.

Trump had previously threatened the tariffs, citing difficulties in trade negotiations with the EU, which caused stock market instability. Von der Leyen affirmed the EU's readiness for swift and decisive talks, acknowledging the importance of the EU-U.S. trade relationship.</p>

Resident doctors are balloting on whether to strike, despite being offered a 5.4% average pay rise this year, which is more than other doctors, nurses, and teachers. The union is urging members to vote for industrial action, arguing the pay rise is insufficient to compensate for below-inflation pay awards since 2008.

          <p>The government is shifting apprenticeship funding in England to prioritize training opportunities for individuals under 21, pulling funding from postgraduate apprenticeships. Controversial plans will restrict funding for level 7 apprenticeships, equivalent to a master's degree, to those under 21, potentially impacting advanced NHS training. The government aims to create 120,000 more training opportunities for young adults by increasing a charge paid by employers recruiting from outside the UK.

          <p>Physicists are studying the acoustics of rocket launches to address noise concerns as spaceflight frequency increases. With SpaceX launching Falcon 9 rockets frequently, the noise, including sonic booms, is impacting communities, and researchers aim to understand what levels are acceptable. The scientists are also investigating the triple sonic boom generated by Falcon 9 boosters returning to Earth and are preparing to measure noise from SpaceX's larger Starship rocket. The goal is to gather data that could help lessen disruptions before rocket noise becomes a pervasive issue.</p>

          <p>President Trump criticized Vladimir Putin as "absolutely crazy" amid Russia's largest drone attack on Ukraine since the war began. The escalation thwarts hopes for a peace agreement, as Putin appears determined to capture more Ukrainian territory and inflict more damage. Trump also expressed frustration with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and warned Putin that conquering all of Ukraine would lead to Russia's downfall. The Russian government downplayed Trump's remarks, while some European leaders expressed hope that his anger might translate into action, with Germany noting some partners had already dropped restrictions on military aid to Ukraine.</p>
