          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and activist, arrived in New Jersey after a federal judge ordered his release from ICE detention in Louisiana, where he had been held for over 100 days. Khalil's arrest sparked protests and discussions about free speech, as the Trump administration sought his deportation for his role in campus protests against Israel. Upon arrival, Khalil accused the Trump administration of dehumanizing immigrants and suppressing pro-Palestine voices, while Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez condemned his detainment as a violation of his First Amendment rights. The judge ruled that Khalil was neither a threat nor a flight risk, but left open the possibility of deportation proceedings based on issues with his green card application. The optimism score reflects the positive outcome of his release while acknowledging the ongoing legal challenges he faces.</p>

Cunningham stated that the referees' lack of protection for Clark has been a recurring issue since she entered the league, highlighting controversial incidents where Clark was roughed up without fouls being called. She has gained popularity for taking matters into her own hands to protect Clark, earning the nickname "the enforcer" for the Fever. The article also mentions former NBA player Joakim Noah's suggestion that the Fever acquire a player to protect Clark, emphasizing the need for enforcement on the court.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities in Fordo, Natanz, and Esfahan, stating that all planes are safely outside Iranian airspace after a successful attack. This action marks a direct armed conflict between the U.S. and Iran, escalating the involvement in Israel's efforts to cripple Tehran's nuclear program and potentially topple its regime. The strikes follow Iran's pledge to retaliate if the U.S. joined the Israeli assault, which began with airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites and military targets on June 13. The article highlights the significance of the Fordo facility, which is believed to be key to Iran's nuclear program and heavily fortified, requiring specialized "bunker-buster" bombs for potential destruction.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from making drastic cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation, preventing policy changes that could have stripped universities of tens of millions of dollars. Judge Indira Talwani ruled that the NSF's change to cap indirect costs at 15% was arbitrary and unlawful, which the University of California estimated would cost it nearly $100 million annually. The cuts would have impacted expenses such as building maintenance and computer systems, threatening critical research in fields like artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. The ruling aligns with similar blocks against funding caps placed on grants by the Energy Department and the National Institutes of Health.</p>

This action places the United States in direct armed conflict with Iran, marking a significant escalation in its involvement with Israel's efforts to cripple Tehran's nuclear program.

The State Department has also placed Israel under a Level 4 travel advisory, urging Americans not to travel there due to armed conflict, terrorism, and civil unrest. In the meantime, Americans in Israel have organized evacuations via other means, including charter flights and land routes through Jordan, as tensions with Iran have intensified and missile strikes have resulted in casualties, including lightly wounded U.S. citizens.</p>

          <p>President Trump contradicted his director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, regarding Iran's nuclear program, stating that she was "wrong" in her assessment that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon. This disagreement arose as the White House claimed Iran had everything it needed to build a nuclear weapon within weeks, while Gabbard testified in March that the U.S. intelligence community believed Iran had not authorized a nuclear weapons program. The president's dismissal of his intelligence community's assessment occurred as he considered joining Israel in strikes on Iran, later announcing that the U.S. had launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities.

          <p>The article discusses the potential use of the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) and the B-2 Spirit bomber in strikes against Iran, particularly targeting the Fordo nuclear facility. Fordo is a key uranium enrichment site located 300 feet beneath a mountain, protected by air defenses, and believed by experts to be central to Iran's nuclear program. The MOP is designed to attack deeply-buried facilities, and the B-2 Spirit is the only aircraft equipped to carry and deploy it due to its weight and stealth capabilities. The article highlights that while Israel has been conducting strikes against Iran, complete destruction of Iran's nuclear capabilities may require U.S. assistance.</p>

          <p>The article highlights the Fordo nuclear facility in Iran as a significant concern for international experts, noting its deep underground location and suspected role in clandestine efforts towards nuclear weapons capability. Despite Iran's denial of any intention to build nuclear weapons, Israel claims to have intelligence indicating a secret Iranian program focused on developing such weapons. Fordo's fortified location and structure make it a challenging target, potentially requiring the U.S.-produced GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator to destroy it. The IAEA's declaration of Iran's non-compliance with monitoring efforts and the discovery of uranium particles enriched to almost 84% purity at Fordo have heightened concerns about the facility's purpose.</p>

Reed noted that Trump's dismissal of Gabbard's testimony, where she stated that the intelligence community assessed Iran was not building a nuclear weapon, coincided with Trump's contemplation of an attack against Iran. He argued that Trump needed to conclude that Iran had the capacity and intent to develop a nuclear weapon quickly to justify such an attack.

His visit occurred amidst clashes between protesters and law enforcement over ICE raids and deportations, a key part of President Trump's agenda. Vance's visit also followed a federal appeals court ruling allowing Trump to keep the National Guard in Los Angeles to quell protests against his deportation plans. Earlier, Vance attacked the protests and advocated for the passage of a megabill to further secure the border, while Democrats have spoken out against the administration's immigration practices.</p>

The law requires schools to post a 16 x 20-inch poster or framed copy of a specific English version of the commandments, despite variations in translations and interpretations. Supporters argue the Ten Commandments are foundational to the U.S. judicial and educational systems, while opponents, including some faith leaders, argue it infringes on religious freedom.

          <p>The article provides a behind-the-scenes look at the challenges faced by receptionists at a GP practice during the 8 AM rush for same-day appointments, highlighting the increasing demand and patient frustrations. Receptionists at Tudor House Medical Practice in Nottingham describe the manic scene when phone lines open, with patients sometimes expressing frustration and even verbal abuse when they can't secure an appointment. The practice has implemented upgrades like a call-back option to improve the process, and the government has pledged additional funding to general practices to address the issue. The surgery now utilizes an expanded team of health professionals to complement the work of family doctors, aiming to give doctors more time to focus on complex cases.</p>

          <p>The pop-punk band South Arcade discusses the inspiration behind their breakout hit, Supermodels, and their connection to the growing Y2K core movement, which reflects an interest in the culture of the late 90s and early 2000s. The band members, born at the start of the millennium, draw inspiration from older siblings and friends who introduced them to Y2K-era music and culture. South Arcade gained traction through TikTok, where the Y2K hashtag has been used in millions of posts, and they have found success in capturing a nostalgic feeling in their music. The band emphasizes the appeal of Y2K culture as a form of escapism, where bedrooms were personalized with posters and collectibles, offering a contrast to the minimalism of modern phone-centric culture.</p>

          <p>The article explores the whereabouts of the giant Michael Jackson statues that appeared around the world in 1995 to promote his album HIStory, detailing the creation and varied fates of these fiberglass monoliths. Originally, ten statues were made, and while some may have been destroyed, others have remained on display in unexpected locations, such as a McDonald's in the Netherlands and a nightclub in Austria. The statue at the McDonald's was removed in 2019 following the Leaving Neverland documentary, while the one in Austria is now for sale after the club closed, and one is located in a Swiss fairground. The statues serve as a reminder of Jackson's global impact and the enduring fascination with his legacy.</p>

          <p>The article examines the trend of social media advice on lowering cortisol levels, a stress hormone, and explores why quick fixes often fail to address the underlying causes of stress. Experts warn that simplistic solutions like cortisol cocktails and supplements may not be effective and can prevent individuals from seeking proper medical treatment for serious health problems. Instead, they emphasize the importance of identifying and addressing the root causes of stress, such as relationship issues, financial worries, or family problems, and recommend techniques like mindfulness, exercise, and therapy. The article also highlights the potential dangers of high cortisol levels and the need to consult a medical professional for sudden body changes.</p>

          <p>Former Texas Representative Blake Farenthold, who left Congress amid sexual harassment allegations, has died at the age of 63 due to health reasons. Farenthold was elected in 2010, defeating long-serving Democratic Rep.

He denied the allegations but apologized for an unprofessional office atmosphere, and after leaving office, he started his own radio show, which he continued until his death.

The balloon tour company, Sobrevoar ServiÃ§os TurÃ­sticos, has suspended its activities indefinitely and stated that it complied with all regulations and had no prior history of accidents. The victims included couples, a mother and daughter, an ophthalmologist, and a figure skater.</p>

Under the plans, new recruits would receive the bonus after completing training and serving for two years, and former armed services personnel would be offered a Â£20,000 payment if they return to serve two additional years. The proposed scheme would be limited to 3,000 personnel, with its Â£60m cost covered by the main defence budget.</p>
