          <p>The prospect of a renewed trade war between the United States and China is casting a shadow over the significant rally seen in Chinese stocks this year. Following President Trump's announcement of a "massive" tariff increase and new export controls on critical software, Chinese stocks listed in the US experienced their largest drop since April. This escalation, a response to Beijing's own curbs on rare earth exports, has injected significant uncertainty into global markets. While some analysts believe the impact on Chinese equities might be limited, the immediate reaction suggests investor sentiment is fragile after a period of strong growth for companies like Alibaba and Tencent.

          <p>Pakistan has sealed its major border crossings at Torkham and Chaman with Afghanistan following intense overnight military clashes between the two nations. Both sides report inflicting heavy casualties, with Pakistani media claiming the capture of numerous Afghan border posts and the Taliban government in Kabul asserting it killed dozens of Pakistani soldiers. The conflict erupted after Afghan forces fired on Pakistani posts, which they claimed was retaliation for earlier Pakistani airstrikes inside Afghanistan. These strikes were a response to attacks by the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a group Islamabad accuses the Afghan Taliban of sheltering, escalating regional tensions significantly.</p>

          <p>China is embarking on what it calls a "project of the century" with the construction of a 1,980km railway connecting its Xinjiang and Tibet autonomous regions. The project is notable for the immense engineering challenges it presents, as the line will traverse treacherous terrain including mountain ranges and permafrost zones at an average altitude of over 4,500 meters. The financial investment required is equally massive, with analysts estimating the total cost could reach 400 billion yuan (US$56.2 billion), making it one of the most expensive rail projects in the country's history. A state-owned company has been established to build and operate this strategically significant infrastructure link.</p>

          <p>Ian Watkins, the former lead singer of the band Lostprophets, has died at the age of 48 after being attacked in HMP Wakefield, where he was serving a 29-year sentence for numerous child sex offenses. West Yorkshire Police have arrested two men on suspicion of murder following the incident. Watkins was jailed in 2013 for crimes described by the sentencing judge as plumbing "new depths of depravity," including the attempted sexual assault of a baby. His death occurs shortly after a report highlighted a marked increase in violence at the prison, particularly noting the vulnerability of older inmates convicted of sexual offenses.</p>

The protests, initially led by youth over power and water shortages, have escalated into broader demands for political change, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries. This event marks another chapter in the nation's long history of political instability, with Rajoelina himself first coming to power after a 2009 military-backed uprising.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has proposed doubling its tariffs to 50% on steel imports that exceed a newly reduced quota, a move aimed at tackling global overproduction and protecting the struggling European steel industry. This decision mirrors a similar tariff hike by the US, leading to speculation that the EU is employing a protectionist strategy to pressure the Trump administration into offering concessions on its own duties for European steel. While China has criticized the move, European industry groups have welcomed it as a "lifeline" compliant with WTO rules. The policy could, however, negatively impact major steel exporters to the EU, such as the United Kingdom and India. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to a Financial Times report citing U.S. and Ukrainian officials, the United States has been providing intelligence to help Ukraine conduct long-range drone strikes against critical Russian energy infrastructure. This collaborative effort is aimed at weakening Russia's economy and pressuring President Vladimir Putin toward negotiations. The U.S. intelligence allegedly aids in planning mission routes, timing, and altitudes to help Ukrainian drones bypass Russian air defenses. While the White House has not commented, this report suggests a deep level of U.S. involvement in the strategic planning of attacks far beyond the immediate front lines of the conflict.</p>

          <p>The European Union is gradually implementing its new digital border management tool, the Entry/Exit System (EES), which will replace manual passport stamping for non-EU citizens entering the 29-country Schengen Area. The system requires travelers to register biometric data, including fingerprints and a facial photo, upon their first entry, with the registration remaining valid for three years. While intended to enhance security and streamline travel in the long run, there are concerns about potential delays and queues during the initial rollout phase. The system is being introduced progressively at various border points, including airports and channel crossings, with a full implementation expected by April 2026.</p>

This represents a strategic shift from the party's previous pledge to hold an independence referendum within five years.

The policy aligns with existing provisions for Christian and Jewish holidays, where individuals can take unpaid leave for religious observance.

Their research, published in the journal Cell, reveals that this process of somatic embryogenesis can be initiated by manipulating two specific genetic switches. This ability was previously thought to be exclusive to fertilized eggs, but the study demonstrates how differentiated plant cells can be reprogrammed to form an embryo. This fundamental biological discovery could have significant implications for agriculture and plant science, offering new ways to propagate and engineer plants from non-reproductive cells.</p>

          <p>Former England midfielder Fran Kirby has opened up about her journey back to professional football after being diagnosed with pericarditis, an inflammation of the sac around the heart, in 2019. The condition, which caused extreme chest pain and fatigue, led to a 10-month sideline and made her contemplate retirement. However, she made a full recovery, going on to win numerous trophies with Chelsea and a European Championship with the Lionesses before retiring from international play. Kirby now emphasizes the importance of listening to her body and resting properly, sharing her story to raise awareness and reflect on her renewed appreciation for her health and career.</p>

          <h2>China Defends Rare Earth Export Controls Amid Escalating Tariff Battle with the U.S.</h2>

          <p>China has defended its new export controls on rare earth materials and technologies as a "legitimate" measure to safeguard national and global stability, pushing back against U.S. accusations of economic coercion. The move prompted a swift U.S. response, with President Trump announcing 100% retaliatory tariffs on Chinese imports and new restrictions on critical software. This sharp escalation in the trade war has caused global stock markets to plunge and casts doubt on a potential upcoming meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Beijing argues its control list is smaller than that of the U.S. and that the impact on supply chains will be limited. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the career of English striker Harry Kane, questioning whether his consistent, record-breaking achievements for both club and country are fully appreciated. As the all-time leading goalscorer for England and Tottenham Hotspur, Kane has maintained remarkable form since his move to Bayern Munich, recently becoming the fastest player to score 100 goals for a single club in Europe's top leagues. Despite his prolific numbers and all-around skill, some critics point to a lack of major team trophies or downplay his international record. However, pundits and former players argue that his humility and understated profile may cause his status as a true global superstar to be undervalued.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of thousands gathered in Tel Aviv for a rally marked by anticipation and cautious celebration ahead of the expected release of Israeli hostages by Hamas. U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff addressed the crowd, crediting Donald Trump's involvement for making the ceasefire and hostage return deal possible, a sentiment echoed by many attendees who chanted their thanks to the former U.S. president. The event highlighted a mix of relief and lingering anger, as some participants also expressed frustration with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's handling of the crisis.

          <p>Kenya has converted US$5 billion in loans from China, originally taken to finance its Standard Gauge Railway, from U.S. dollars to Chinese yuan. The move is expected to provide significant debt relief, cutting the country's annual debt-servicing costs by an estimated US$215 million. This financial restructuring, which is anticipated to halve the loan's interest rate, may set a precedent for other debt-distressed African nations that owe substantial amounts to China. Analysts suggest that such currency swaps could also serve to strengthen economic and political ties between these countries and Beijing, potentially shifting financial reliance away from traditional Western creditors and currencies.</p>

          <p>Following new revelations suggesting Prince Andrew maintained contact with Jeffrey Epstein longer than he claimed, this article analyzes the potential actions King Charles can take to mitigate the damage to the monarchy. While Prince Andrew has already been stripped of his HRH title and military patronages, further sanctions are complex. Removing his Duke of York title would require an act of Parliament, and evicting him from his Royal Lodge residence is difficult due to his long-term lease. The Royal Family has opted for more subtle measures, such as excluding him from public events and funding, but appears limited in its ability to fully sever ties or prevent ongoing reputational harm.</p>

          <p>King Miller, a walk-on redshirt freshman running back, delivered a breakout performance to lead the USC Trojans to a decisive 31-13 victory over No. 15 Michigan. Stepping up after USC's top two running backs left the game with injuries, Miller rushed for 148 yards and a touchdown, including two long runs that broke the game open in the second half. His unexpected contribution powered a dominant USC ground game and secured a crucial win for coach Lincoln Riley against a ranked opponent. The victory, built on physical play at the line of scrimmage, repositions USC's season and potentially opens a path toward College Football Playoff consideration.</p>
