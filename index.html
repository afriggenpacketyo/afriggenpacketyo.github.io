          <p>Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg admire Iain M. Banks' Culture series, which presents a post-scarcity socialist society valuing empathy and cooperation, in stark contrast to Silicon Valley's ethos. The Culture series critiques hierarchical structures and economic inequality, portraying capitalist tech billionaires as villains who exploit and torture others for profit. Banks's Culture prioritizes collective well-being over individual wealth, delegating governance to AI to allow citizens to pursue leisure and personal growth, an antithesis to the demanding work culture in Silicon Valley. The article suggests that the tech moguls may be drawn to the technological spectacle of the Culture, missing the underlying message about the importance of socialism and anarchy.</p>

Even with the temporary tariff reduction, the U.S. trade-weighted tariff rate on Chinese goods remains significantly higher than before the second Trump administration.

          <p>Much of southern Kentucky is at high risk of a significant tornado outbreak, following recent storms that killed several people in Kentucky, Missouri, and Virginia. The U.S. has seen over 850 tornadoes this year, significantly above the usual average. Negotiations between Israel and Hamas have reached an impasse, with Israel facing pressure from the UK, France, and Canada to end the war. In other news, President Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to negotiate a ceasefire in the war in Ukraine, though no immediate ceasefire was agreed upon. </p>

          <p>The UK and the European Union have agreed on a major new deal covering trade, defence, fishing, and energy, but several key issues remain unresolved. Questions persist regarding the financial contribution from the UK, the number of people who will benefit from the youth visa scheme, and when British travellers can use e-gates. Additionally, the deal lacks concrete commitments to ease touring for British bands in Europe and secure mutual recognition of UK qualifications in the EU. Negotiations are ongoing to address these outstanding issues. </p>

          <p>Lucy Connolly, the wife of a Conservative councillor, has lost her appeal against a 31-month jail sentence for inciting racial hatred after posting an online rant against migrants on X. The tweet, which called for "mass deportation now" and urged followers to "set fire" to hotels housing asylum seekers, was viewed 310,000 times. Judges at the Court of Appeal ruled that the original sentence was not manifestly excessive. Connolly's husband lost his seat in this year's local elections, and he expressed heartbreak over the court's decision. </p>

The judge described Ebid as ruthlessly exploiting desperate individuals for profit, noting the horrifying treatment of migrants and the considerable risk of loss of life.

          <p>Scientists have discovered a fossil of a three-eyed predator named Mosura fentoni in Canada's Burgess Shale, dating back over 500 million years. This species, a member of the extinct radiodonts, was about the size of an index finger and possessed spiny jointed claws and a circular mouth lined with teeth. Researchers said Mosura was "unlike any living animal", featuring a unique abdomen-like body region with multiple segments. The discovery provides insights into the early evolution of arthropods. </p>

Eukaryotes, cells or organisms characterized by a membrane-bound nucleus, are the foundation of complex, multicellular life.

This has led to a shift in attitudes, with ranchers becoming more tolerant of jaguars and actively participating in their conservation. The program has expanded the protected area for jaguars and their prey, offering hope for the reestablishment of jaguars in the U.S. </p>
