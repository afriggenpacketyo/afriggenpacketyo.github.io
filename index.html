          <p>A nationwide manhunt is underway in the UK for Ethiopian national Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, an asylum seeker mistakenly released from prison. Kebatu was jailed last month for 12 months for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl in Epping. Justice Secretary David Lammy is reportedly furious over the error, as Kebatu was meant to be transferred to an immigration detention center after serving his time, not freed. The incident highlights significant failures in the prison and immigration systems.</p>

          <p>Dahbia Benkired, a 27-year-old Algerian immigrant, has been handed a rare whole-life sentence in France for the sexual assault and murder of 12-year-old Lola Daviet in October 2022. The court ruled she must serve at least 30 years, marking the first time a woman has received this harshest possible penalty in France. The case, which saw Lola's body found in a plastic storage box, sparked national shock and was seized upon by right-wing politicians due to the perpetrator's immigration status. Benkired, found to have psychopathic traits but sane, expressed remorse in court.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James pleaded not guilty to federal bank fraud charges in Norfolk, Virginia, facing accusations of misrepresenting her intent to use a purchased home to secure a lower mortgage interest rate. James, a vocal critic of former President Trump, decried the charges as politically motivated and a "weaponization of the justice system" for revenge. Her legal team plans to seek dismissal, arguing vindictive prosecution and an invalid appointment of the interim U.S. Attorney. The trial is scheduled for January 26, 2026, with pre-trial hearings set for December.</p>

          <p>Several U.S. states, including Texas, California, Missouri, North Carolina, and Utah, are undertaking mid-decade redistricting efforts that could significantly impact the 2026 midterm elections. Initiated by President Trump's call for more Republican seats, these moves aim to redraw House maps to favor one party, with Democrats in California countering GOP efforts. Challenges to the new maps, including lawsuits alleging racial bias and gerrymandering, are ongoing. This unusual mid-census redistricting push reflects both parties' attempts to gain or maintain congressional majorities in a volatile political environment.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have unveiled a sensational NBA gambling scandal, charging multiple figures with high-tech cheating in underground poker games backed by New York Mafia families and exchanging insider information for illegal sports bets. Allegations include rigged shuffling machines, card-reading glasses, X-ray technology, and poker chip trays used to defraud players. Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups and retired NBA player Damon Jones are accused of participating in these games, with Jones also implicated in providing non-public injury information about players like LeBron James. The widespread allegations reveal a deep network of corruption affecting professional sports.</p>

          <h2>Fact Check: Comparing European Sexual Assault Statistics is Misleading Due to Varying Definitions and Reporting Practices</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A viral chart claiming the UK is the "sexual assault capital of Europe" is misleading, despite using accurate numbers from sources like the UNODC, due to significant differences in legal definitions and reporting practices across countries. Criminologists emphasize that cross-country comparisons of police-reported crime statistics are problematic, as countries vary in how they define and count sexual offenses. Victim surveys are recommended as a more reliable measure of prevalence. Claims linking immigration to increased sexual violence are also debunked, as there is no evidence to support such assertions. The article underscores the complexity of crime data and the dangers of misinterpretation.</p>

          <p>Alaska Airlines has resumed flights after a nationwide ground stop caused by a significant IT outage, though disruptions are expected to continue into Friday.

While operations have been restored, the airline advises passengers to check their flight status due to anticipated further disruptions as aircraft and crews are repositioned. The incident highlights the vulnerability of modern aviation to technology failures and the cascading impact on travel plans.</p>

          <p>Sheffield Wednesday, a Championship football club, has entered administration, resulting in an automatic 12-point deduction and placing them at the bottom of the league. This move effectively ends the unpopular reign of owner Dejphon Chansiri, with administrators now seeking new ownership amidst active discussions with interested investors. Fan groups are also exploring a supporter-led takeover proposal. While financially challenging, the administration is seen as a "bittersweet day" by fans and players, offering hope for a fresh start and a unified club, despite the immediate uphill battle to avoid relegation.</p>

          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has condemned the Trump administration's military strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats in international waters, calling them illegal and ineffective in curbing drug trafficking. Petro asserts that some killed in the strikes were innocent civilians and that the U.S. provides no prior warning or information about the operations. While President Trump blames Petro for increased cocaine production in Colombia, Petro advocates for collaborative efforts and dialogue, warning that unilateral U.S. actions could escalate violence and inspire insurgency. He emphasized targeting cartel leaders rather than "workers" and expressed readiness to fill funding gaps if U.S. aid is halted.</p>

          <p>A new study by the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC) alleges that Russian-linked mercenaries in Mali, including those from the Wagner Group and its successor Africa Corps, have systematically exploited military equipment intended for the Malian army. This includes armored vehicles, machine guns, and drones, potentially violating the UN Arms Trade Treaty (ATT). The report accuses Mali's military leadership of knowingly allowing this appropriation, raising concerns about human rights violations and regional destabilization.

          <p>Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei faces a critical political reckoning in upcoming midterm elections, with his party, La Libertad Avanza, needing a stronger congressional presence to pass legislation. Milei's approval ratings have plummeted to historic lows amidst a deepening currency crisis, corruption scandals, and severe austerity measures, including 50,000 public sector job cuts. Despite a controversial $20 billion U.S. bailout and efforts to curb triple-digit inflation, public anger is palpable. The elections are a crucial test of his mandate, though he retains strong support among younger voters.</p>

          <p>San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie successfully persuaded President Trump to call off a planned immigration enforcement "surge" in the city, earning an unusual compliment from the president. Trump credited Lurie's "very nicely" presented case and endorsements from tech leaders like Marc Benioff and Jensen Huang. Lurie, a political outsider, has focused on urban revitalization and public safety, arguing San Francisco's comeback is real and crime is down. While the president's reversal was unexpected, uncertainties remain about the scope of the halt and potential federal actions in other Bay Area cities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Guillermo del Toro, in an introduction to a new edition of Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein*, delves into the novel's profound spiritual and existential themes, describing horror as a refuge for spirituality. He explains how Shelley, writing at a young age, poured her contradictions into the monster's tale, exploring abandonment and the consequences of Victor Frankenstein's arrogant creation. Del Toro views *Frankenstein* as a parable about the absence of paradise and the loneliness of existence, resonating deeply with his own films, *Pinocchio* and *Frankenstein*, which explore father-son relationships and the lineage of pain. The article highlights the enduring power and relevance of this literary masterpiece.</p>
