          <h2>China's Exports Surge Despite U.S. Tariffs, Driven by Southeast Asia</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced an unexpected surge in April, growing by 8.1% year-on-year, despite the imposition of tariffs by the United States. This growth was largely fueled by a significant increase in shipments to Southeast Asian countries, which offset a sharp decline in exports to the U.S. The article highlights that while exports to the U.S. fell by over 21%, shipments to ASEAN countries jumped by 20.8%. Experts suggest that transshipment through third countries and pre-tariff contracts may have contributed to the surge, but anticipate a gradual weakening in trade data in the coming months.</p>

Tokyo insists on the full elimination of reciprocal tariffs, including a 25% levy on cars and a 25% duty on steel and aluminum, as a condition for reaching an agreement with Washington. The Japanese government plans to hold further talks with the U.S. to pursue its demands, despite the recent U.S.-Britain trade agreement.</p>

          <p>Country music legend Randy Travis, who suffered a stroke in 2013 that left him with aphasia, has made a remarkable comeback with the help of artificial intelligence. Travis collaborated with AI and musician James DuprÃ© to release two new songs, "Where That Came From" and "Horses in Heaven," and has been touring since last spring. His wife, Mary Travis, explained that the AI process involved using raw vocals from 45 of Randy's songs and a vocal line from DuprÃ© to create new music, emphasizing the creativity and effort involved.</p>

          <p>Nvidia intends to release a modified version of its H20 chip for the Chinese market in July, aiming to circumvent U.S. export controls. The downgraded H20 chip will have significantly reduced memory capacity to meet the new technical thresholds set by U.S. officials. This move demonstrates Nvidia's effort to maintain its presence in China, a crucial market, despite increasing restrictions on semiconductor technology exports. The article notes that downstream customers may be able to modify the module configuration to adjust the chip's performance.</p>

          <p>Shares of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), China's largest contract chip maker, experienced a nearly 7% drop after its first-quarter earnings fell short of estimates. While the company reported a 28% year-on-year revenue increase to $2.24 billion and a 162% surge in profit to $188 million, these figures missed analysts' expectations. The article attributes the earnings miss to "production fluctuations" that led to falling average selling prices, a trend expected to continue into the second quarter. Despite the earnings miss, SMIC's wafer shipments increased by 15% from the previous quarter, and capacity utilization reached 89.6%.</p>

A senior executive at a major European private bank noted an unprecedented sell-off from wealthy clients and institutions, potentially signaling a long-term shift.

          <p>Despite tariffs imposed on imported aluminum by the U.S. government, the domestic aluminum sector has not seen a revival due to high energy costs. The article explains that while tariffs have reshaped global trade flows and increased costs for American consumers, they have not achieved the goal of boosting U.S. aluminum production. Rising electricity prices in the U.S., relative to global competitors, are leading to smelter closures instead of restarts. The lack of access to competitively priced, long-term power contracts remains a primary barrier for U.S. aluminum producers.</p>

          <p>President Vladimir Putin presided over a Victory Day parade in Moscow, commemorating the Soviet triumph over Nazi Germany, while attempts to end the war in Ukraine falter. The article highlights that the parade, attended by leaders from China, Brazil, and other countries, aims to showcase Russia's past glories and justify its actions in Ukraine. In the days leading up to Victory Day, Ukraine has increased its attacks on Moscow, raising concerns about potential targeting of the parade.

          <p>The European wind industry is reassessing its approach to the U.S. market due to policy uncertainty and skepticism from the Trump administration regarding offshore wind power. The article highlights the pause in construction of the Empire Wind project off Long Island, causing concern among European companies. While the U.S. market faces challenges, industry executives are relying on Europe to compensate for the pullback. Vestas and Orsted reported positive financial results, but the decision by Orsted to halt a large wind facility in Britain underscores the difficulties in the renewable energy sector.</p>

The article highlights the contrast between the rapid processing of Afrikaner cases and the long waits faced by other refugees. The administration plans to welcome the Afrikaners at Washington Dulles International Airport. This move follows an executive order signed by Trump in February, offering resettlement to Afrikaners and cutting U.S. financial assistance to South Africa.

The 10% tariff imposed on U.K. imports remains in place, but under the plan, the first 100,000 vehicles imported into the U.S. by British automakers each year are subject to that 10% rate, and additional vehicles will face 25% rates, according to the White House.

The upcoming U.S.-China talks this weekend could potentially lead to a partial rollback of U.S. duties, although a full reversal is unlikely.</p>

The grand jury's determination stems from indictments against four officers and the police chief for mishandling or removing evidence. An audit revealed that nearly 40% of evidence bags and a third of firearms were undocumented, with missing items including drugs, firearms, and cash.
