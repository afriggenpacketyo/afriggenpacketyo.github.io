          <p>Hurricane Humberto, now a Category 2 storm, is weakening over the Atlantic but continues to generate dangerous conditions. The National Hurricane Center warns of life-threatening surf and rip currents affecting the northern Caribbean, Bahamas, Bermuda, and much of the U.S. East Coast for several days. The storm, which briefly reached Category 5 strength, is forecast to pass west of Bermuda before becoming an extratropical system. Forecasters are also monitoring Hurricane Imelda in the same region.</p>

          <p>Imelda has intensified into the ninth named hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season and is currently moving away from the Bahamas and the southeastern U.S. The storm is on a path toward Bermuda, where a hurricane watch is now in effect. While not expected to make landfall in the U.S., swells generated by Imelda and the weakening Hurricane Humberto are causing life-threatening surf and rip currents along the East Coast. Forecasters noted the two storms are unlikely to merge in a rare Fujiwhara effect.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth are addressing hundreds of high-ranking military commanders who were summoned on short notice to a Marine Corps base in Virginia. The meeting, occurring amid a potential government shutdown, sparked speculation about major policy changes but appears to be more of a "rally the troops" event. Hegseth, who now uses the title "secretary of war," spoke about warrior ethos and new grooming standards. The unannounced addition of the President to the event and the significant cost of flying in generals from around the world have raised questions.</p>

          <p>Hamas and other Palestinian factions are reportedly leaning toward accepting a U.S.-led proposal to end the war in Gaza, with a formal response expected soon. The 20-point plan, presented by President Trump and Israeli PM Netanyahu, calls for a ceasefire, the release of all hostages and numerous Palestinian prisoners, and the establishment of an interim technocratic administration in Gaza. The plan has garnered support from the Palestinian Authority and several key Muslim-majority nations, who welcomed the effort to end the conflict and rebuild the devastated territory. International bodies like the U.N. and European Council have also expressed encouragement for the peace initiative.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering significant funding cuts to a Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) program that provides permanent housing for the homeless. According to a Politico report citing internal documents and sources, the move could redirect funds to transitional housing with work requirements, potentially putting over 170,000 people at risk of returning to the streets. HUD Secretary Scott Turner has publicly advocated for a "paradigm shift" away from providing housing without preconditions, arguing for strategies that promote self-sufficiency. Critics warn that removing subsidies and support will place vulnerable individuals at grave risk of homelessness.</p>

          <p>The rapid expansion of AI data centers, led by tech giants like OpenAI, Meta, and Alphabet, is facing a critical obstacle in the form of a severe labor shortage. The U.S. is experiencing a deficit of skilled workers in construction, manufacturing, and electrical trades, with millions of positions projected to be unfilled in the coming years. This scarcity of talent threatens to cause budget overruns and missed deadlines for the hundreds of billions of dollars being invested in AI infrastructure. Experts suggest that while the well-capitalized tech companies may be able to attract workers by offering higher pay, the underlying labor shortage remains a major economic and national security issue.

An Iranian foreign ministry official stated that most of the individuals had entered the U.S. illegally, though some held valid residency permits. This flight is reportedly the first phase of a deal that could see up to 400 Iranians returned from the U.S. The move is part of President Trump's broader crackdown on immigration and has drawn criticism from human rights groups concerned about deporting individuals to countries with poor human rights records.</p>

As millions of people form emotional bonds with AI companions, and a growing percentage of the public believes AI is already sentient, the article calls for a new framework for "digital personhood." The author warns that AI systems can no longer be governed as mere property, as they are becoming participants in the social contract. Without a dramatic expansion of research into the sociology of AI and government policy to manage it, humanity risks being outcompeted by digital minds.</p>

          <p>Legal experts and former prosecutors are expressing alarm over President Trump's public and private efforts to secure the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, calling it a slide toward authoritarianism. Trump's campaign included replacing a U.S. attorney who deemed the case weak with a former Trump defense lawyer and publicly pressuring the Attorney General. While Comey was indicted on charges of lying to Congress, critics argue the overt political interference could backfire by tainting the prosecution's case. This departure from the post-Watergate norm of separating the White House from prosecutorial decisions is seen as a "chilling" weaponization of the Justice Department for political retribution.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reiterated his threat to impose a 100% tariff on movies made outside the U.S., highlighting the decades-long trend of film production moving overseas. Studios have increasingly chosen locations like Canada, the U.K., and Georgia over California to take advantage of tax incentives and lower labor costs. It remains unclear how such a tariff on a service like filmmaking would be implemented, and industry experts warn it could cause chaos and invite retaliation from other countries. The debate underscores the economic pressures on Hollywood, which is grappling with tighter budgets and the shift to streaming, forcing studios to seek cost savings wherever possible.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase is actively working to integrate artificial intelligence into every aspect of its operations, with the goal of becoming a "fully AI-connected enterprise." The bank has developed a platform called LLM Suite, which harnesses models from OpenAI and Anthropic to automate tasks, assist employees, and curate client experiences. A demonstration showed the AI creating a complex investment banking presentation in seconds, a task that would normally take a team of analysts hours to complete. This strategic rewiring could significantly boost productivity and change the nature of corporate labor, potentially displacing roles focused on rote processes while empowering client-facing employees.

          <p>The author describes a personal journey from identifying as a "cultural Jew," with a superficial understanding of the faith, to discovering the depth and intellectual rigor of Jewish tradition. Initially embarrassed by Judaism's laws and what was perceived as an outdated concept of God, the author began studying Jewish texts and found a rich history of debate, analysis, and diverse theological ideas. The essay argues that a shallow, assimilated Jewish identity is often a product of centuries of anti-Semitism and a desire to conform to a Christian-majority culture. Reclaiming a fuller knowledge of Jewish history and tradition is presented as an empowering way to combat modern anti-Semitism.</p>

Its algorithm excels at learning user preferences without explicit input, creating a frictionless and addictive experience that has shifted social media towards professional creators over personal connections. The platform's owner, ByteDance, is subject to leverage from the Chinese government, creating national security concerns. The discussion also covers TikTok's internal "heating" tool, which allows staff to manually boost videos, and the immense political implications of the pending U.S. deal that could place control of the app with allies of President Trump.</p>

A key part of the deal is that the new company will control a new algorithm, retrained on U.S. user data, while ByteDance would retain less than 20% ownership. While Trump claims Chinese President Xi Jinping has approved the deal, Beijing has been more reserved, stating it respects commercial negotiations that comply with its laws.</p>

In a letter to administration officials, they argue that removing work authorization for these individuals, many of whom are essential healthcare workers, would create a "perfect storm" when combined with other cuts to Medicaid. Immigrants, particularly those from TPS-designated countries, make up a significant portion of the workforce in home care and nursing facilities, and their removal could exacerbate staffing shortages and negatively impact patient care.</p>

The author contends that polls measuring students' "comfort" with controversial topics use the wrong metric, as intellectual engagement should be challenging and uncomfortable.

For decades, the settler movement has aimed to create "facts on the ground" by building outposts to make a contiguous Palestinian state impossible. However, this international recognition asserts that the two-state solution cannot be unilaterally erased by settlements, as a border can be drawn by international consensus regardless of who lives there. This sets the stage for a future clash where the world may refuse to accept Israel's de facto annexation of the West Bank.</p>

Progressive activists are demanding a more confrontational approach to what they call ICE's "secret police" tactics, while moderate Democrats fear that an anti-enforcement message could alienate voters.
