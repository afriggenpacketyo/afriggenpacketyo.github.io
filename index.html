          <p>Starbucks is partnering with NomadGo to introduce an AI-powered inventory system, aiming to improve supply chain efficiency and reduce costs. This move, combined with a reduction in production days, is part of a broader turnaround strategy focused on technological improvements. The article also touches on market trends, noting a positive court ruling for Apple and Alphabet, and expresses caution ahead of Salesforce's earnings report due to concerns about how agentic AI might affect its "seat model" business structure.

          <p>President Trump has indicated his administration is considering the deployment of National Guard troops to New Orleans, noting that Louisiana's Republican governor, Jeff Landry, would welcome the federal assistance. This contrasts with the opposition from Democratic governors in other cities like Chicago, which Trump also mentioned as potential deployment sites. The president's remarks on using military for domestic law enforcement come as his administration faces legal challenges over a similar deployment in Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>During a press conference for victims of Jeffrey Epstein, survivor Chauntae Davies stated that Epstein frequently bragged about his powerful connections, with his friendship with Donald Trump being his "biggest brag." Davies recalled that Epstein kept a framed photo of himself with Trump on his desk and often spoke of their close relationship. Her testimony was part of a broader call from survivors for the release of all documents related to Epstein, aimed at exposing the network that enabled his abuse.</p>

          <p>Golfer Rory McIlroy has advised his European Ryder Cup teammates to follow the example of tennis star Novak Djokovic in managing hostile American crowds at the upcoming event in New York. McIlroy noted Djokovic's ability to channel negative energy from pro-American audiences, a skill the tennis player discussed with the team before their victory in Rome. McIlroy believes that controlling their own reactions and not playing into the crowd's hostility will be key for the European team's success at Bethpage.</p>

          <p>On his first official engagement of the autumn, King Charles visited the new Midland Metropolitan University Hospital in Birmingham and shared a lighthearted moment with an 85-year-old patient. When the patient mentioned she was "wearing out," the King joked that he is also discovering that "bits don't work so well when you get past 70." The visit had been previously postponed due to the King's cancer treatment, and he assured another patient that he was feeling "not too bad."</p>

          <p>Despite CEO Tim Cook's efforts to mitigate the impact of U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, some analysts predict Apple will raise prices on its upcoming iPhone 17 models. The company has managed to absorb most tariff costs so far by shifting its supply chain and securing exemptions, but it still incurred significant expenses. With the cost of smartphone components rising globally, a price increase could be attributed to market factors rather than directly to tariffs, potentially by altering storage configurations on new models.</p>

          <p>The number of federal student loan borrowers using forbearance to pause their payments surged from 2.9 million in 2024 to 10.3 million in the third quarter of 2025. This dramatic increase is largely attributed to the fallout from the repeal of the Biden-era SAVE repayment plan, as millions enrolled in that plan were automatically placed in forbearance. Experts note that this indicates widespread financial struggle among borrowers, as interest continues to accrue during the pause, potentially worsening their long-term debt situation.

          <p>A comprehensive analysis of two decades of satellite data shows that fresh water is disappearing at an alarming rate, with vast "mega-drying" regions expanding across the globe. Researchers attribute the desiccation to rising temperatures and the chronic overpumping of groundwater aquifers for agriculture and cities. The study found that nearly three-fourths of humanity lives in countries that are losing water, and this depletion now contributes more to sea-level rise than the melting of mountain glaciers or polar ice sheets.</p>
