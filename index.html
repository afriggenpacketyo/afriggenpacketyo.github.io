          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a nearly 61% year-over-year increase in its second-quarter net profit, significantly surpassing market expectations. This record-breaking performance is largely attributed to the sustained high demand for advanced artificial intelligence chips from major clients like Nvidia and Apple. Advanced chips, those 7-nanometer or smaller, constituted 74% of the company's total wafer revenue for the quarter. Despite the strong results, the company acknowledges potential risks from U.S. trade policies, including threatened tariffs on Taiwanese goods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's top anti-graft body, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), is launching a targeted crackdown on corruption within the nation's science and technology sectors. The initiative aims to eliminate fraud related to research project funding, management, and evaluation processes to foster a better environment for innovation. The CCDI plans to utilize advanced technologies like big data and artificial intelligence to detect and expose complex corruption schemes. This move is intended to ensure that scientific development aligns with national goals and to plug systemic loopholes in governance.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, is facing legal challenges in Memphis over permits for its supercomputer facility. The NAACP and environmental organizations have appealed a decision allowing the company to operate natural gas-burning turbines, which they argue were improperly categorized and violate the Clean Air Act. Residents have complained for months about emissions and odors, citing disproportionate health impacts on nearby majority-Black communities. In response, xAI has dismissed the appeal as baseless and politically motivated, asserting its compliance with all relevant laws.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has taken disciplinary action against several of its own Members of Parliament, removing the party whip from four and stripping three others of their trade envoy roles. This move follows their rebellion against the government's position on a welfare bill, marking a significant effort by the leadership to enforce party loyalty. The decision has been met with a mixed reaction within the party, with some supporting the need for authority while others have labeled it as "petty" and "vindictive." The leadership insists the action targets repeated organization against the government, not isolated acts of dissent.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is currently engaged in a lengthy session to debate and amend a Trump administration request to rescind $9 billion in previously approved spending. The proposed cuts primarily target foreign aid programs managed by USAID and funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports NPR and PBS. The package has faced resistance within the Republican party, with some senators expressing concern over the impact on programs like AIDS prevention and public broadcasting in rural areas. Because the Senate is amending the bill, it must be sent back to the House for another vote before a fast-approaching deadline. (not investment advice)</p>

This downturn comes as the country faces a 25% "reciprocal tariff" from the U.S. and a lack of progress in trade negotiations.

          <h2>ICE Deportation Data Reveals Few Deportees Were Convicted of Homicide</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) data reveals that despite the administration's focus on deporting the "worst of the worst," very few of those removed had violent crime convictions. Of the roughly 100,000 people deported in the first half of the year, only 0.58% had been convicted of homicide, while offenses like sexual assault and kidnapping each accounted for less than 2% of cases. The data, obtained by CBS News, shows that a majority of infractions were for traffic or immigration-related offenses. This contradicts the public messaging that has emphasized the removal of dangerous criminals.</p>

          <p>During Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's visit to China, both nations have focused on securing a series of trade and investment agreements, deliberately setting aside major political disputes. The new deals are expected to widen market access for Australian agricultural products and coal, and involve cooperation on financial digitalization. Notably, there has been no public discussion of the contentious issue surrounding the Darwin Port, which Australia wants to reclaim from a Chinese company on security grounds. This pragmatic approach is seen as an effort by Beijing to find common ground and stabilize relations.</p>

          <p>Financial analysts are warning of significant market instability if President Trump were to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. A research note from Wolfe Research predicts such a move would likely trigger a major equity selloff and a spike in long-term bond yields, creating a "mess" for the economy. The legality of the president firing a Fed chair for cause is also a major point of contention, with experts believing the issue would ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court. The speculation follows reports that the president was considering the move, though he later publicly stated it was "highly unlikely." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tensions have reportedly emerged within the Trump administration regarding the leadership and direction of the Justice Department's antitrust division. Sources indicate that Gail Slater, who heads the division, has faced criticism from some administration officials and business leaders over her handling of major merger investigations, including those involving Capital One and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. While Slater has strong support from some, others have questioned whether her priorities align with the president's agenda.

          <p>A tsunami advisory for southern Alaska has been canceled after a powerful 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast. The quake, which occurred about 50 miles south of Sand Point, initially triggered a more severe tsunami warning, prompting some coastal communities to evacuate to higher ground. The warning was later downgraded to an advisory and then lifted entirely as authorities determined there was no threat of large, widespread waves. The earthquake was felt across the Alaska Peninsula, a region located along the seismically active Pacific "Ring of Fire."</p>

For residents in Inner Mongolia, this has meant years of worsening symptoms, from sneezing to bronchial asthma.

The lawsuit, filed on behalf of twelve plaintiffs, argues that this practice violates due process rights and turns courthouses into a "trap" for immigrants seeking legal protection. The groups claim this policy discourages people from complying with their legal obligations and weaponizes a supposedly neutral forum, inflicting irreparable harm on families and undermining the justice system.</p>

This strategy offers a renewable alternative to the gas-fired plants often used for data centers and creates a sustainable use for EV batteries that are no longer suitable for cars but still retain significant capacity.
