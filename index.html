        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York appellate court has thrown out the approximately $527 million financial penalty against former President Trump in his civil fraud case, deeming the fine "excessive" and a violation of the Eighth Amendment. While the massive disgorgement was vacated, the court upheld other sanctions, including a three-year ban on Trump serving as an officer or director of any New York corporation. New York Attorney General Letitia James has announced her office will appeal the decision to the state's highest court, emphasizing that the ruling still affirmed that Trump had violated the law.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has indicated it will investigate Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook following a criminal referral from Bill Pulte, a Trump administration housing official. The referral alleges potential mortgage fraud, claiming Cook listed two different properties as her primary residence simultaneously. In a letter to Fed Chair Jerome Powell, a DOJ attorney urged him to fire Cook, although Powell lacks that authority. Cook has denied the allegations, stating she is gathering information to respond to legitimate questions and has no intention of being bullied into resigning. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Erik Menendez, convicted alongside his brother Lyle for the 1989 murders of their parents, is appearing before a California parole board for the first time after nearly 30 years in prison. His eligibility comes after a judge reduced his life-without-parole sentence under a youth offender law, as he was under 26 at the time of the crime. The brothers have long maintained they acted in self-defense against years of abuse, a claim prosecutors contest. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office strongly opposes their release, arguing they have not accepted full responsibility for the murders.</p>

          <p>Comedian Marc Maron is arguing that the current state of comedy, heavily influenced by what he calls the "Rogansphere," has become a driving force for far-right politics. In his new special and recent interviews, Maron contends that "anti-woke" comedians have normalized fascism by platforming extremists and dumbed down the craft of comedy with hackneyed, punching-down humor. He specifically criticizes podcasters like Joe Rogan and Theo Von for shifting cultural norms toward something dangerous. Maron's outspoken crusade suggests that this brand of comedy is not just failing artistically but is actively contributing to a decline in democratic ideas.</p>

          <p>Lucy Connolly, a 42-year-old woman sentenced to 31 months in prison for a racially charged social media post, has been released. Her post, which called for mass deportations and setting fire to hotels housing asylum seekers, followed the fatal stabbing of three girls in Southport in July 2024. Her release has reignited a debate on free speech and sentencing proportionality in the UK.

          <p>According to House Oversight Chair James Comer, former White House spokesman Ian Sams only met in person with then-President Joe Biden twice during his tenure. Sams, who served from May 2022 to August 2024, was a prominent defender of Biden's mental acuity, particularly against criticisms in Special Counsel Robert Hur's report. Comer stated that Sams' limited direct interaction raises serious questions about who was providing him with information and directing the White House's messaging strategy. The revelation is part of a broader Republican-led investigation into whether Biden's inner circle worked to conceal signs of his cognitive decline.</p>

Storm surge warnings remain in effect for parts of North Carolina, where evacuation orders were issued for vulnerable areas like Hatteras and Ocracoke islands.

Federal officials objected to content that discusses transgender and gender queer identities, deeming it outside the grant's scope. California officials refused to alter the materials, arguing they are medically accurate, were previously approved by the same federal agency, and are required under state law, setting up another legal conflict between the state and the administration.</p>

Meanwhile, Zelensky insists any meeting must follow an agreement on security guarantees with Kyiv's allies, which would exclude Russia.

Experts state that barrier islands like the Outer Banks are inherently dynamic and ill-suited for permanent development, with some areas losing up to 15 feet of beachfront annually.

          <p>The Pentagon is actively recruiting its civilian employees for a "volunteer force" to support the Trump administration's mass deportation efforts. An internal email and job posting ask staff to sign up for deployments of up to 180 days to assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) operations. Volunteer duties may include data entry, logistics, and operational planning at facilities along the southern border and throughout the U.S. interior. This initiative is part of a broader administration effort to expand immigration enforcement personnel and infrastructure across the country, which also includes hiring more ICE agents.</p>

          <p>A revisionist narrative suggesting that COVID-19 lockdowns and restrictions were known to be ineffective and harmful from the start is gaining mainstream traction. This article critiques this view, arguing that it misrepresents the pre-pandemic scientific consensus and misinterprets data from places like Sweden. While acknowledging that some measures, like prolonged school closures, were policy failures, the article contends that the revisionist focus on elite groupthink ignores the genuine public fear that drove many decisions. The author warns that this overcorrection could undermine public health and leave the U.S. dangerously unprepared for the next, potentially deadlier, pandemic.</p>

          <p>The performance group Lucha VaVoom de La Liz is bidding farewell to its longtime home, the Mayan theater in downtown Los Angeles, which is permanently closing after 35 years. The troupe, known for its unique blend of Mexican lucha libre wrestling and burlesque, will hold its final show, titled "The Good, the Bad and the Fabulous," at the historic venue. The Mayan's president cited an "unrelenting barrage of adversity" over the past five years as the reason for the closure. While the performers and fans express sadness over leaving the venue, Lucha VaVoom plans to continue its shows at a new location.</p>

          <p>With certificate of deposit (CD) rates remaining elevated, savers can still secure attractive returns on their cash reserves without market risk. A $25,000 deposit could yield varied returns depending on the term length; for example, a 1-year CD at 4.30% would earn approximately $1,075, while a 5-year CD at 4.20% could generate around $5,250. While shorter terms offer more liquidity, longer terms provide higher overall earnings and protection against potential future rate drops. This makes CDs a compelling option for predictable, guaranteed growth on funds that are not needed immediately. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. rose by 2% in July, defying expectations of a decline and reaching a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.01 million units. This uptick is attributed to a temporary dip in mortgage rates during May and June when these sales contracts were likely signed. Housing inventory increased by 15.7% from the previous year, reaching its highest level since May 2020, which is helping to ease pressure on prices. The median home price saw a minimal 0.2% annual increase, suggesting the market may be approaching an inflection point toward greater affordability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new photo essay examines the complex emotional landscape of "empty nesters," parents whose children have grown up and moved out. The project documents various households in Los Angeles County, revealing that the experience is far from uniform and often involves a mix of grief, relief, and reinvention. For some, the departure brings a profound sense of loss, while for others it marks a period of rediscovered autonomy and a chance to redefine their identities and relationships. The essay also highlights the modern fluidity of the empty nest, with many adult children returning home, creating a state of perpetual flux for their parents.</p>

Prosecutors described how he exploited his position of power, using tactics like late-night massages to commit the assaults.

However, significant hurdles remain, including a lack of infrastructure and funding, with Africa still producing only 0.1% of the world's vaccines.

          <p>This article explores five key teachings from the Baha'i faith that can be applied to achieve greater happiness, regardless of one's religious beliefs. These lessons include having faith in the future, viewing suffering as a catalyst for growth, seeking deeper spiritual happiness over fleeting pleasures, and understanding that one's own happiness is tied to making others happy. The author notes that these principles, which emphasize service and virtue, align with findings from social science on well-being. The Baha'i faith, which originated in 19th-century Persia, offers a tested framework for living a positive and meaningful life despite worldly troubles.</p>

          <p>A recent fundraiser for anti-factory farming charities, amplified by podcaster Dwarkesh Patel, has raised over $2 million and highlighted the concept of "moral offsetting." The idea, promoted by the organization FarmKind, suggests that individuals who feel guilty about eating meat but are unwilling to go vegan can offset the harm by donating to effective animal advocacy groups. This approach frames donations as a pragmatic way to reduce animal suffering, similar to how carbon offsets work for environmental impact. While it provides a tangible way for people to contribute, critics worry it could absolve consumers of personal responsibility for their dietary choices.</p>
