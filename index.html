        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Metropolitan Police chief has voiced his concerns regarding a planned protest in London supporting Palestine Action, especially after activists from the group broke into RAF Brize Norton and vandalized military planes. Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley emphasized the importance of the right to protest but deemed actions supporting Palestine Action as beyond legitimate protest. While the Met cannot legally prevent the protest until the group is officially proscribed, they plan to impose conditions to prevent disruption and will address any law breaches robustly. The controversy highlights the ongoing tensions and debates surrounding protests related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the government's response to activism. The police are preparing to manage the demonstration while balancing the rights of protesters and the need to maintain public order, as various groups support the action. The situation has raised concerns about extremism and the limits of permissible protest, as well as the potential impact on British democracy. The commissioner has stated that the police will release conditions for the protest after they have been confirmed. The article underscores the complexities of policing political activism and the challenges of balancing freedom of expression with public safety. The events highlight the delicate balance between upholding democratic rights and addressing concerns about extremism. The situation has raised concerns about extremism and the limits of permissible protest, as well as the potential impact on British democracy. The Met said it would release conditions for the protest "once they have been confirmed".</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called on China to leverage its relationship with Iran to prevent the closure of the Strait of Hormuz, a critical global oil trade route. Rubio emphasized China's heavy reliance on the strait for its oil imports, noting that closing it would be "economic suicide" for Iran, disrupting its oil exports to China. The article underscores the potential for significant global economic consequences should Iran attempt to block the waterway. While some analysts believe the U.S. Navy would swiftly counter any such attempt, others caution against underestimating the risk of prolonged disruption. The U.S. retains options to address the situation, but the move would likely trigger a massive escalation and broader international response.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, Washington is bracing for a response from Tehran, which has downplayed the impact of the attacks but affirmed its nuclear knowledge. The U.S. military asserts that the strikes caused "extremely severe damage and destruction" to the targeted sites. The Israeli official dismissed that idea, alluding to direct talks with Moscow over the Iranian program. While the United States and Israel believe that Saturday’s strikes were a strategic victory, some concern remains that Iran may have removed critical equipment and materiel from its site in Fordow. Experts suggest potential Iranian responses could include disruptions to shipping lanes or intensified harassment of merchant vessels, drawing parallels to past conflicts.</p>

Israel has affirmed its coordination with the U.S. in planning the strikes, while Iranian officials have confirmed the attacks but downplayed the extent of the damage. The operation, named Operation Midnight Hammer, involved 125 U.S. military aircraft, including B-2 stealth bombers, and utilized precision-guided weapons, including Massive Ordnance Penetrators. Iran launched a fresh barrage of missiles which hit parts of Tel Aviv and Haifa. The deputy political director of Iran's state broadcaster, Hassan Abedini, said Iran had evacuated these three nuclear sites a "while ago".</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, global reactions have been mixed, with some countries calling for diplomacy and others condemning the military action. Israeli leaders lauded the strikes, while Iranian officials vowed retaliation. The U.N. chief expressed alarm, urging de-escalation and a diplomatic solution. Iran's allies, including Hamas and the Houthis, condemned the "American aggression," vowing to join in retaliation. Saudi Arabia expressed "deep concern," calling for de-escalation, while Lebanon's leader emphasized the need to avoid regional spillover. Several European countries urged caution and affirmed support for Israel. Left-wing Latin American governments expressed fierce opposition, while Argentina's president praised the attacks.</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz has been labeled the "red-hot favorite" for Wimbledon after winning the Queen's Club title, marking his second time claiming the crown and extending his winning streak to 18 matches. Despite arriving in London with "no expectations," Alcaraz's performance has sent a strong message to his rivals. Former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash noted that Alcaraz is the player to beat, citing his excellent form. Winning Queen's is considered a good omen for Alcaraz, as he went on to triumph at Wimbledon in 2023 after winning the Queen's title.</p>

          <p>Following US strikes on its nuclear sites, Iran has stated that the US "must receive a response". The conflict has put renewed focus on security in the Strait of Hormuz, with Iran reportedly considering blocking it after the US strikes on its nuclear sites. Around 20 million barrels of crude, condensate and fuels are estimated to flow via the waterway daily. But experts say Iran is unlikely to move ahead with closing it, and exporters have other options to fall back on if it does.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, the Pentagon briefing emphasized the military operation but lacked details about future actions. The U.S. wants this attack to have been a "one-and-done," with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stating the mission was to defend Israel and deter Iran's nuclear ambitions. While President Trump spoke of Iran's nuclear sites being "obliterated," Gen. Dan Caine revised that downwards when he spoke of "extremely severe damage". The US defence secretary said Washington was in touch with Tehran privately and publicly, giving it every opportunity to come to the table, every opportunity for peace.</p>

          <p>JD Vance has said the US is “not at war” with Iran – but is with its nuclear weapons program, holding out a position that the White House hopes to maintain over the coming days as the Iranian regime considers a retributive response to Saturday’s US strike on three of its nuclear installations. Vance declined to confirm with absolute certainty that Iran’s nuclear sites were completely destroyed, a position that Donald Trump set out in a Saturday night address when the president stated that the targeted Iranian facilities had been “completely and totally obliterated” in the US strikes. Vance instead said that he believes the US has “substantially delayed” Iran’s ability to develop a nuclear weapon. In a statement to Bloomberg, Darya Dolzikova, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, said there were slim prospects that the US entering the war would convince Iran to increase International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) cooperation.</p>

Rubio urged Iran to pursue diplomacy, adding that the U.S. has no current plans for further attacks on Iran unless "they mess around." He also warned Iran that closing the Strait of Hormuz would be a "suicidal" move for the regime. Rubio said closing the strait would affect the U.S., but it would have "a lot more impact on the rest of the world," particularly on China.</p>
