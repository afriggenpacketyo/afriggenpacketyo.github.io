          <p>President Trump's executive order shifting disaster response responsibility to states is met with skepticism from emergency management experts.  While states already handle initial disaster response, they heavily rely on federal resources and funding from FEMA.  The potential withdrawal of these resources could severely hamper state capabilities and leave them unprepared for increasingly intense disasters.</p>
