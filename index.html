          <p>SpaceX successfully launched its colossal Super Heavy-Starship rocket on its tenth test flight, achieving significant milestones after several prior catastrophic failures. The 40-story-tall rocket's Super Heavy booster performed as planned, propelling the Starship upper stage before executing a controlled splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico. The Starship upper stage, designed for deep-space missions, reached engine cutoff and deployed satellite simulators, heading for a splashdown in the Indian Ocean. This critical test flight is paramount for SpaceX's goals of launching Starlink satellites, eventually sending settlers to Mars, and fulfilling NASA's reliance on a modified Starship for a crewed lunar landing as early as 2027. The successful flight helps address growing concerns about the program's timeline and reliability.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel announced its decision to revert to its beloved original "Uncle Hershel" logo, following significant public backlash against a recent modern redesign. The controversy stemmed from the company's efforts to update its aesthetic, which included a simplified text-only logo that many customers felt abandoned the brand's traditional country charm and identity. Former President Donald Trump publicly weighed in, urging the company to listen to customer response, which he called "the ultimate Poll." The company's statement thanked guests for their heartfelt voices, reaffirming its commitment to its core values of "delicious food, warm welcomes, and the kind of country hospitality that feels like family." This reversal underscores the powerful influence of consumer sentiment on corporate branding.</p>

          <p>A New York judge rejected former Governor Andrew Cuomo's attempt to continue a taxpayer-funded legal battle against Brittany Commisso, an ex-aide who accused him of sexual assault. The judge explicitly stated that Cuomo was using the civil litigation and discovery devices primarily to "resurrect his public image," rather than pursuing a legitimate legal argument. This ruling comes after the state agreed to pay $450,000 to settle Commisso's lawsuit, which stemmed from an investigation that found Cuomo sexually harassed at least 11 women, leading to his resignation. Cuomo, now an independent candidate for New York City mayor, maintains his innocence and seeks the release of text messages he claims would discredit the allegations.</p>

          <p>Australian authorities are conducting an extensive manhunt for Dezi Freeman, 56, who is suspected of shooting and killing two police officers and injuring a third in the rural town of Porepunkah. The incident occurred when ten officers arrived at a property to execute a warrant for alleged sexual offenses. Police have deployed a helicopter and armored vehicles, advising residents to stay indoors as Freeman, reportedly skilled in bushcraft, remains at large in a dense bush area. The injured officer is recovering after surgery, and authorities have confirmed that Freeman's family is safe, contrary to earlier reports of a hostage situation. The search continues across a wide area.</p>

The term "haboob" derives from an Arabic word meaning "wind" or "blow," common in hot, dry regions. Though visually striking, these storms are typically brief, lasting 10 to 30 minutes. However, they pose significant dangers by severely reducing visibility, leading to dozens of traffic fatalities annually in the U.S., underscoring the critical need for public awareness and caution.</p>

          <p>India's substantial $434 billion merchandise export engine faces significant headwinds as President Donald Trump's 50% tariffs on Indian goods take effect, primarily in response to India's substantial Russian energy imports. Analysts from Capital Economics and Goldman Sachs warn that these steep levies risk severely diminishing India's attractiveness as an emerging manufacturing hub and could reduce its GDP growth by up to 0.6 percentage points. Key sectors like engineering goods, gems and jewelry, textiles, and electronics, which have high exposure to the U.S. market, are expected to be significantly impacted. Experts note that while India is highly dependent on the U.S. as its largest export partner, the U.S. has greater flexibility to diversify its import sources, potentially eroding India's long-term export competitiveness.

In response, Modi's government is also pushing for significant tax reforms, including a simplified two-tier Goods and Services Tax system, in addition to an earlier $12 billion income tax giveaway.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer expressed strong skepticism that President Trump's recently announced tariffs on furniture imports will successfully revive domestic manufacturing in the U.S., despite the administration's stated intentions. Cramer argues that many of these industries are largely "a thing of the past," attributing this to years of favoring cheaper import supply chains and the subsequent departure or retirement of a skilled American workforce. He suggested that increased tariffs would more likely result in higher product prices for consumers rather than a significant resurgence of local production. Cramer pointed out that while some companies like Ethan Allen, which manufactures 75% of its products domestically, might see a temporary advantage, the long-term impact on the industry as a whole is questionable, especially considering the lack of national security relevance compared to goods like semiconductors.

Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport reported damage and disruptions due to the extreme weather. Meteorologists explain that haboobs are generated by strong thunderstorm downdrafts that stir up loose dust.

This action is widely viewed as an escalation of Trump's months-long pressure campaign aimed at influencing the historically independent Fed to lower interest rates. If successful, Cook's removal would create an opening for Trump to appoint a new governor, potentially securing a majority on the Federal Open Market Committee and granting him dangerous leverage over U.S. monetary policy.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national who was wrongly deported to El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison, have filed an emergency motion to reopen his immigration case to seek asylum in the United States. Abrego Garcia, rearrested in Maryland after a temporary release, is currently held in a Virginia detention center, where a federal block prevents his immediate deportation. His legal team argues that his prior deportation and subsequent return to the U.S. now qualify him for asylum, citing fears of persecution and torture if he were to be sent to Uganda or returned to El Salvador. They also advocate for Costa Rica, which has offered him refugee status, as his designated country of removal, while criticizing government officials for his "unilateral" re-arrest and alleged coercive tactics during plea negotiations.</p>

          <p>Isaiah Hodgson, a 29-year-old U.S. Border Patrol agent, was found dead in a Riverside County home while facing multiple charges for drunkenly attacking Long Beach police last month. Authorities reported no evidence of foul play in his death, the cause of which remains unreported. Hodgson had been charged with three counts of resisting arrest, one count of battery causing injury to a police officer, and several misdemeanor weapons offenses, stemming from an incident where he was off-duty, intoxicated, and armed. Notably, he had also played a visible role in the Trump administration’s intensive immigration enforcement efforts and was involved in the controversial detention of a U.S. citizen.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NAACP, joined by the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, has filed a lawsuit against Texas, alleging that the state's newly redrawn congressional maps constitute racial gerrymandering and unlawfully diminish the political power of Black voters. The suit targets Governor Greg Abbott and Secretary of State Jane Nelson, seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent the implementation of these maps. It argues that the redistricting violates both the U.S. Constitution and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act by improperly reducing the ability of voters of color to elect their preferred candidates. This legal challenge arises as Texas Republicans, a minority in both legislative chambers, passed the maps with the aim of increasing their congressional representation by five seats, sparking broader national debates on redistricting and voting rights.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Decades of dedicated conservation efforts in China's Shennongjia mountains have led to a remarkable recovery for the endangered golden snub-nosed monkey population. Once severely threatened by hunting and extensive logging, their numbers have dramatically increased from below 500 to over 1,600, with hopes of reaching 2,000 within a decade. Professor Yang Jingyuan, who has devoted his entire career to understanding and protecting this unique species, now observes their complex social structures and unique behaviors. The conservation success is largely attributed to the implementation of logging bans, the successful integration of former farmers into forest protection roles, and a painstaking year-long process to habituate a specific monkey group to human researchers. The national park's expanded tree cover and strictly enforced protection zones are crucial for ensuring the species' long-term survival.</p>

This showcase, however, is set against a backdrop of ongoing internal scrutiny, as evidenced by the recent removal of former navy chief of staff Li Hanjun from the national legislature on suspicion of "serious violations of discipline and law," a euphemism for corruption. While some observers question whether the extensive anti-corruption campaign could impede the PLA's war readiness, others interpret it as a firm demonstration of Beijing's resolve to forge a formidable and disciplined military. The parade is anticipated to unveil both new advanced weaponry and a new generation of military commanders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's extensive gutting of USAID has resulted in a chaotic "fire sale" of humanitarian aid assets, including essential items like mosquito nets, water towers, and medical equipment, originally purchased for over 5,000 now-canceled foreign-aid projects. Millions of dollars worth of U.S. government property are being auctioned off at significant losses or simply abandoned due to a lack of clear guidance. While some NGOs have managed to redistribute items to local partners, many projects remain half-finished, and vital supplies, such as mpox vaccines, have expired or been deliberately incinerated. This unprecedented and disorganized shutdown risks reversing years of humanitarian progress, with a recent study projecting over 14 million additional deaths by 2030, raising profound concerns about national security and the responsible use of taxpayer funds.</p>
