          <p>Iowa state Representative J.D. Scholten has announced his candidacy to challenge Republican Senator Joni Ernst in 2026, spurred by her controversial remarks regarding potential Medicaid cuts. Ernst responded to constituents' concerns about Republican Medicaid cuts by sarcastically stating, "Well, we're all going to die." Scholten, who previously ran for Congress, aims to make the race a referendum on President Donald Trump's trade policies, particularly concerning Iowa soybean farmers affected by the trade war with China. Democrats have not won a Senate race in Iowa since 2008, making this a challenging but significant campaign. The focus will be on healthcare and trade policy as key issues in the election. </p>

          <p>A private survey indicates that China's manufacturing activity contracted in May at its fastest rate since September 2022, driven by a sharp decline in new export orders due to U.S. tariffs. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 48.3, signaling contraction for the first time since last year. The decline in foreign demand accelerated, with new export orders reaching their lowest level since July 2023, and the job market remained grim.

          <p>A former Taiwanese defense official, Andrew Yang Nien-dzu, has warned that the risk of a military accident across the Taiwan Strait is increasing due to heightened pressure from Beijing and a lack of direct communication channels. Yang cited increasing “grey zone operations” by Beijing, including more frequent activities by its coastguard forces near Taiwan. He also expressed concern about the lack of official communication between Beijing and Taipei since 2016, when exchanges were suspended after the previous Taiwanese leader refused to accept the one-China principle. The former minister's comments highlight the growing tensions and potential for miscalculation in the region.</p>

          <p>A recent court ruling against Donald Trump's global trade tariffs has sparked criticism of his emphasis on loyalty over competence. Trump responded by attacking the Federalist Society, suggesting they gave him bad advice on judicial nominations. This reaction underscores Trump's tendency to view any opposition as a personal attack. The incident highlights concerns that Trump prioritizes servile loyalty above all else, even within the judicial system. (not investment advice)</p>
