          <p>Uber plans to integrate helicopter services into its app through a partnership with Joby Aviation, aiming to allow passengers to book flights in major cities. This move follows Joby's acquisition of Blade Air Mobility, a helicopter and seaplane flight provider. The integration will enable users to book helicopter rides directly through the Uber app, though details on pricing and specific locations are yet to be released. Uber and Joby have been collaborating since 2019, when Joby acquired Uber's Elevate division, focused on electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles, showcasing Uber's continued expansion into aerial ride-sharing services. This is a novel and exciting development for the company. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The producer price index (PPI) surprisingly decreased by 0.1% in August, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, offering potential support for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut. The drop in wholesale prices, which measures input costs for goods and services, contrasts with expectations of a 0.3% rise. The core PPI, excluding volatile food and energy prices, also fell by 0.1%, leading to gains in stock market futures and slightly negative Treasury yields. This data release precedes the Federal Open Market Committee's decision on interest rates, with markets pricing in a high probability of a rate cut. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Oracle's stock experienced a significant surge, climbing 40% after the company reported strong cloud demand numbers, positioning it for its best day since 1992. The company's remaining performance obligations reached $455 billion, marking a substantial increase of 359% year-over-year. This surge is attributed to Oracle's gains from the artificial intelligence boom, driven by its cloud infrastructure business and access to Nvidia's GPUs. Oracle is now approaching a $1 trillion market capitalization, with analysts expressing shock and awe at the company's performance and potential. The company is now a key AI enabler.

          <p>Gregory Bovino, a U.S. Border Patrol official who led immigration enforcement raids in California, has been deployed to Chicago amidst the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration. Federal officials plan to initiate a surge of arrests in the Chicago area, targeting immigrants suspected of being in the U.S. illegally. Bovino previously oversaw Operation At Large in California, where Border Patrol agents arrested unauthorized immigrants far from the border. His deployment to Chicago signals an increased role for Customs and Border Protection in interior immigration enforcement, despite criticism from Illinois Governor JB Pritzker. This new development is occurring amidst ongoing changes in immigration enforcement policies.</p>

President Trump and Republican candidate Michael Whatley are blaming the killing on the Cooper's, the former Democratic Governor, soft-on-crime policies. They highlight the suspect's criminal record and previous release following a robbery sentence. Cooper's campaign defends his record, accusing Whatley of misrepresenting his stance on law enforcement funding.

          <p>The Senate Banking Committee has advanced the nomination of Stephen Miran, a White House economic advisor, to become a Federal Reserve governor. The vote occurred along party lines, amidst ongoing debate about interest rate cuts and Trump's criticism of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. Miran's nomination follows the resignation of Adriana Kugler, and he would serve until the end of Kugler's term if confirmed. Democrats have raised concerns about Miran's continued role at the Council of Economic Advisors should he be appointed to the Fed. This is a development in the ongoing debate about the Federal Reserve. (not investment advice)</p>

While consolidating into a lower interest rate can be beneficial, experts advise carefully considering fees, closing costs, and the potential loss of loan benefits.

          <p>President Trump had dinner at a seafood restaurant in Washington, D.C., promoting his efforts to crack down on crime in the nation's capital. He was greeted by cheers and boos, as well as protesters opposing U.S. policy in support of Israel. Trump claimed that Washington is now a safe zone due to his administration's actions, despite ongoing street protests and concerns about increased military and police presence. The president was accompanied by several high-ranking officials, and the dinner excursion was notable as he rarely dines away from the White House. The event is causing mixed reactions. </p>

          <p>Oracle's stock surged despite missing Q1 top and bottom lines, driven by a significant increase in remaining performance obligations (RPO). The company's cloud revenue climbed 27%, and CEO Safra Catz highlighted the backlog, which gives the company room to raise its cloud targets. Chairman Larry Ellison pointed to a sharp jump in multi-cloud database revenue and previewed an Oracle AI Database service. Investors are weighing near-term results against the company's loaded contract pipeline, positioning cloud and AI as near-term growth drivers. This is an interesting trend for the company.

          <p>Google Cloud's chief, Thomas Kurian, outlined how the tech giant is monetizing its artificial intelligence services, already generating billions in revenue. Google Cloud's customer demand backlog is growing faster than its revenue, with over 50% expected to convert to revenue in the next two years. Kurian detailed monetization methods, including consumption-based pricing for AI infrastructure, subscriptions for cloud services, and upselling to higher-priced tiers. Google Cloud is also capturing new customers more quickly, with nearly two-thirds already using its AI tools. These are some of the ways Google is making money off of AI. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The new season of *The Summer I Turned Pretty* centers on seemingly small dilemmas that hold great significance for its young characters. The series, adapted from Jenny Han's novels, finds profundity in the unremarkable lives of American kids, treating their crossroads with care and nuance. The show avoids contemporary political references, allowing the focus to remain on the nuances of growing up and the exploration of teenage emotions. This approach acknowledges the complexities of young lives and resonates with both teen and adult audiences, who can appreciate the series' reverence for the experience of simply being young.

          <p>NATO allies held consultations on the incursion by Russian drones into Polish airspace, invoking Article 4 of the NATO treaty. The incident occurred amid a widespread Russian attack in western Ukraine, prompting Poland to scramble its own and NATO air defenses. Article 4 allows allies to put urgent matters on the agenda of the North Atlantic Council, but it does not automatically lead to action under Article 5, the collective security guarantee. This marks the first time Poland engaged assets in its airspace since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The event is causing worry for the nations. </p>
