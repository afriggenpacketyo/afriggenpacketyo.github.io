          <p>Three far-right extremists, Brogan Stewart, Christopher Ringrose, and Marco Pitzettu, have been convicted of terrorism offenses after planning attacks on targets, including a mosque. The trio, part of an online group that "idolized the Nazi regime," amassed hundreds of weapons. Stewart had detailed plans to torture a Muslim leader, using an "information extraction kit." The three extremists are scheduled to be sentenced on July 17, and their conviction underscores the ongoing threat posed by far-right extremism and the efforts of counter-terrorism police to disrupt their activities.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is rebranding its streaming platform Max as HBO Max again, reversing a decision made just two years prior. The company aims to refocus on quality programming and storytelling, leveraging the HBO brand to drive growth. CEO David Zaslav emphasized that the streaming service has significantly improved its profitability and subscriber base. This CNBC article notes the move comes as WBD seeks to compete with streaming giants like Netflix by emphasizing distinct and high-quality content rather than a broad range of offerings. WBD aims to have over 150 million users by the end of 2026.</p>

          <p>Researchers are exploring the extraction of valuable metals, including rare earths, from wastewater sources like the Berkeley Pit in Butte, Montana, to boost U.S. production for electric cars, medical technology, and national defense. The Berkeley Pit contains 50 billion gallons of acidic, toxic water from mining operations, which Montana Resources uses to extract copper through cementation. This New York Times article highlights how advancements in extraction technologies are making it economically feasible and cleaner to mine wastewater for metals like neodymium and praseodymium, essential for magnets in electric vehicles and defense applications. The project awaits a Department of Defense grant to build a concentrator for full-scale rare earth production, aiming to reduce U.S. reliance on China for these critical minerals.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have moved forward with President Trump's tax bill, which includes trillions of dollars in tax breaks, despite ongoing disagreements over the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. The House Ways and Means Committee passed its portion of the legislation, but the SALT cap remains a point of contention. The current proposal would raise the SALT cap to $30,000 for those with a modified adjusted gross income of $400,000 or less, but some lawmakers are pushing for a higher limit. The full House vote is expected soon, but significant changes are anticipated in the Senate.</p>

As of last September, there were 8,030 family offices globally managing $3.1 trillion in assets, and this number is expected to increase significantly by 2030. This CNBC article highlights that the talent crunch is due to a combination of a lack of qualified candidates and the high selectivity of family offices, which prioritize trust above all else.

          <p>A new report indicates that the gap between what Americans earn and what they need to afford a basic standard of living is widening, with the bottom 60% of U.S. households unable to achieve a "minimal quality of life." The analysis considers costs beyond basic necessities, including technology, education, and healthcare. The report finds that low-income households, earning an average of $38,000 per year in 2023, would need $67,000 to afford the items tracked by the index. This CBS News article emphasizes that traditional economic indicators do not reflect the lived reality of many Americans, as the cost of basic economic security has doubled since 2001, while median earnings for the bottom 60% have fallen.</p>

          <p>China and the United States have agreed to a temporary truce in their trade war, but their rivalry continues as both countries actively court emerging markets. As President Trump traveled to the Middle East, China signed trade and investment deals with Brazil during President Lula da Silva's state visit to Beijing. The People’s Bank of China renewed a bilateral currency swap agreement with Brazil, expected to boost local currency use and support financial stability.

          <p>Israel tried to kill Muhammad Sinwar, a key Hamas leader in Gaza, which would deprive the group of another top commander. The assassination attempt is a major tactical success for Israel but its long-term significance is unclear, as Hamas has survived for decades despite Israel’s systematic assassination of its leaders. The death would also be unlikely to change Israeli battlefield calculations, as Israel’s aims extend far beyond killing specific commanders, as it seeks “total victory” over Hamas. The war’s trajectory is as dependent on Israel as it is on Hamas, and the insistence of the Israeli government to continue the war is the actual problem.</p>
