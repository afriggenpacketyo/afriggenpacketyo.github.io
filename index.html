        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lord Robert Winston, a celebrated IVF pioneer and Labour peer, has resigned from the British Medical Association in protest of upcoming strikes by resident doctors. He argues that the planned five-day walkout over pay ignores the vulnerability of patients and damages public trust in the medical profession. The BMA contends the strike is necessary as the government has refused to negotiate on pay, which they claim is 20% lower in real terms than in 2008. Lord Winston's departure highlights the deep divisions within the medical community regarding industrial action amidst the NHS's ongoing struggles with wait times.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is escalating its trade dispute with Canada by imposing a 35% tariff on all Canadian imports, set to begin on August 1. In a public letter, President Trump cited Canada's retaliatory tariffs and its alleged failure to curb the flow of fentanyl as justification for the new duties. The letter warns that the tariff rate could increase if Canada continues to retaliate, adding another layer of tension to the ongoing trade negotiations between the two nations. This move is part of a broader strategy that includes threats of 15-20% blanket tariffs on other major trading partners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Research from Princeton University reveals a 170% increase in threats and harassment against local school officials across the United States since the COVID-19 pandemic. The study indicates that initial conflicts over pandemic-related measures like mask mandates have evolved into intense disputes over cultural issues, including LGBTQ+ policies and diversity initiatives. Officials from across the political spectrum report being targeted, often fueled by misinformation on social media. This hostile environment is causing significant distress and raising concerns that it could deter individuals from seeking public service on school boards.</p>

          <p>In a significant environmental effort, China has destroyed approximately 300 dams and closed numerous hydropower stations along the Red River, a key tributary of the upper Yangtze. This action aims to restore natural water flows and save critical habitats for rare and endemic fish species. For decades, the dense network of dams has fragmented the river, blocking fish migration routes and drastically reducing suitable spawning grounds. The project is seen by ecologists as a crucial step to revive the last refuge for these unique species in the region.</p>

The public spending watchdog cited delays, personnel shortages, and infrastructure gaps as major problems, calling the £11 billion spent so far a "disappointing return" on investment. While the F-35 is technologically superior, its full mission capable rate is only about a third of the Ministry of Defence's target.

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has once again blocked President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of some U.S. residents. The judge approved a class-action lawsuit filed by the ACLU, temporarily halting the order from taking effect while the legal challenge proceeds. This decision follows a recent Supreme Court ruling that limited the use of universal injunctions but still allows them through specific legal avenues like class-action suits. The lawsuit argues that the president's order is unconstitutional, violating the 14th Amendment's guarantee of citizenship to all persons born in the United States.</p>

          <p>Kenneth Bianchi, one of the two convicted 'Hillside Strangler' serial killers, has been denied parole after 46 years in prison. The California Board of Parole Hearings made the decision after hearing opposition from prosecutors and testimony from victims' families. Bianchi, along with his cousin Angelo Buono Jr., terrorized Los Angeles in the 1970s, murdering at least 12 women. Now 74, Bianchi will not be eligible for another parole hearing for ten years, ensuring he remains incarcerated for the foreseeable future for his role in the infamous crime spree.</p>

          <p>The war in Gaza rages on with no ceasefire agreement in sight, even after meetings between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Trump. In a recent tragic incident, an Israeli strike killed 15 people, mostly women and children, as they waited outside a health clinic in central Gaza. The U.S.-based charity Project HOPE, which runs the clinic, condemned the attack as a blatant violation of international humanitarian law. The Israeli military stated the strike targeted a terrorist participant from the October 7th attack and is investigating the harm caused to civilians.</p>

Curators described the find as incredibly rare, likening the odds to hitting a hole-in-one from the moon. The fossil is believed to be a vertebra from a plant-eating dinosaur that lived approximately 67.5 million years ago and is now on display at the museum.</p>

The meeting's agenda was not disclosed, but it occurs as Nvidia grapples with U.S. export controls on its advanced AI chips, particularly to China. The Trump administration's restrictions have effectively cut off Nvidia's sales to the lucrative Chinese market, which Huang has noted could cost the company billions in planned orders. President Trump praised Nvidia's stock performance in a social media post prior to the meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's threat of a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports is stretching the limits of his emergency economic powers, which are already facing a court challenge. The tariff was announced in a letter that cited political motivations, including the prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. To justify the levy, Trump is using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), but the letter also incorrectly claims the U.S. has a trade deficit with Brazil, when it actually has a surplus. Critics argue this move is an abuse of power and further erodes the administration's credibility on its aggressive trade agenda. (not investment advice)</p>

In his new book, he argues that eight specific words—people, better, democracy, new, time, strong, change, and together—resonate most effectively with voters. He describes these words as "emotional shortcuts" that work across different cultures and political ideologies. The analysis suggests that while not a guarantee of success, these words serve as powerful building blocks for creating memorable and persuasive campaign messaging.</p>

          <p>Irvine Welsh, the author of the cult novel "Trainspotting," has shared a critical perspective on modern technology, arguing that AI and social media are making society less intelligent. He expresses concern that we are becoming "dumbed down machines" as we increasingly rely on technology to think for us, leading to a potential "post-culture" society. Welsh, who is publishing a sequel to his famous novel, believes the internet has become a controlling force rather than an enabling one. He contrasts this with the 1990s, an era he feels younger generations are nostalgic for because people "had lives then."</p>
