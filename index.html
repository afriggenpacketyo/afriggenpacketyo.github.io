          <p>North Korea plans to send thousands of military construction workers and deminers to the Kursk region of Russia, according to a top Russian official, signaling increased cooperation between the two nations. This move follows previous reports of North Korea supplying combat troops and weapons to support Russia's war in Ukraine. Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu stated that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un agreed to send 1,000 sappers for mine clearance and 5,000 military construction workers for infrastructure restoration. South Korea, the U.S., and Japan have expressed concerns over the deepening ties, fearing that Russia may provide advanced technologies to North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. The U.S. State Department said that Pyongyang was now relying on Russia to provide it with desperately needed funds in exchange for labor and soldiers for hire schemes, while Japan's Prime Minister Ishiba expressed deep concern, saying advancing cooperation between Russia and North Korea threatens to jeopardize global security.</p>

The London Gatwick-bound Boeing 787 Dreamliner, carrying 242 people, crashed into a populated area just 40 seconds after takeoff. Investigators are analyzing the wreckage, cockpit voice recorder, and flight data recorder to understand what went wrong in the moments leading up to the crash. Possible causes being explored include engine failure, fuel contamination, improperly extended flaps, or maintenance errors.

          <p>Since the beginning of Donald Trump's second term, ICE operations in Southern California have become more aggressive, causing fear within the undocumented community. Raids have been conducted in various cities, targeting immigrants seeking work and those with irregular status. The article recounts an incident at a Home Depot parking lot where ICE agents, along with local law enforcement, detained approximately 25 people. While deportations haven't been massive, the anti-immigrant policies have reduced the flow of people migrating to the U.S., as potential migrants no longer view the U.S. as a viable destination.</p>

The judge has cautioned both legal teams against violating the court's sealing order by discussing the trial with the media. The jury has been shown videos and text messages related to the case, including interactions between Diddy and Cassie Ventura, as the trial progresses towards its expected conclusion by July 4.</p>
