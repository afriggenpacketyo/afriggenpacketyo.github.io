          <p>California State Senator Sabrina Cervantes was cited on suspicion of driving under the influence after a car collision near the state Capitol. Cervantes vehemently denies the allegations, stating that hospital lab results will prove she had no alcohol in her system. She claims she was 'falsely accused' and 'accosted' by police officers while being treated for minor injuries at the hospital. The Sacramento County District Attorney's Office is awaiting toxicology results before making a decision on filing charges in this 'deeply distressing' incident.</p>

          <p>Representative Gerald E. Connolly of Virginia, a nine-term congressman, died at his home in Fairfax County, Va., at the age of 75 after battling esophageal cancer. Connolly was known for his vigorous defense of government workers and his opposition to efforts to weaken civil service job protections, particularly during President Trump's first term. He also led efforts to block the Trump White House from adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census, viewing it as a politically motivated attempt to intimidate immigrants. Connolly was a key figure in Virginia's shift from a reliably red state to one that leans blue in federal elections.</p>

          <p>Deborah Rutter, the former Kennedy Center president, is disputing criticisms made by President Trump and current president Richard Grenell regarding her tenure. Trump claimed the previous leadership spent millions of dollars without improving the center, while Grenell alleged finding $26 million in 'phantom revenue' and plans to refer the matter to the U.S. attorney's office. Rutter stated that these allegations are false and disregard the transparently audited financial reports. She also noted that limited federal funding has led to a backlog of maintenance, a common issue for federal buildings in Washington, D.C.</p>

The test will allow for earlier diagnoses and treatment interventions, potentially benefiting millions of Americans living with Alzheimer's.

          <p>President Trump accused South Africa of seizing land from white farmers without compensation, a claim President Cyril Ramaphosa disputed. The article highlights the hypocrisy of Trump's stance, as his administration used eminent domain to seize land from landowners in Texas to build the U.S.-Mexico border wall. One such landowner, Richard Drawe, reluctantly allowed the government to build on his land after years of family ownership, receiving compensation but feeling his idyllic life had been disrupted by 'that damn wall.' The article underscores Trump's history of using government-sanctioned land grabs, both as a developer and as president.</p>

The change is planned for the autumn Budget, with details of the new approach to be set out 'early.'

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled $33 million in FEMA grants intended for earthquake retrofits in California, which has sparked concern from Sen. Adam Schiff, who urged the decision to be reconsidered. The funds were to be used to strengthen vulnerable apartment buildings, known as soft-story apartments, which are prone to collapse during earthquakes. FEMA stated that the program was wasteful and politically motivated, while Schiff argued that eliminating this funding would endanger those who can least afford it. The cancellation affects numerous projects across California, including those in San Bernardino County, Rancho Palos Verdes, and Orange County.</p>

          <p>President Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill,' intended to fund his second-term agenda, faces a hurdle due to the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction. Republicans are divided, with some from high-tax districts advocating for an increase in the SALT cap, while fiscal conservatives view it as subsidizing blue states. Trump himself has shifted his stance, now supporting the elimination of the cap he previously championed. This division is causing infighting, with some GOP House members vowing to vote against the bill without a SALT cap increase, and fiscal hardliners pushing back against any deal that raises the cap.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has ruled that the Trump administration violated an order barring officials from deporting people to countries not their own without giving them a chance to object. The ruling came after lawyers said eight migrants were deported after being told they were being sent to South Sudan. Homeland Security officials disclosed that the eight immigrants had been deported on a flight to a third country, but refused to say where the men were going. The judge said the government had given the deported men little more than 24 hours notice that they were being removed from the United States.</p>

          <p>President Trump's Justice Department, led by Ed Martin, plans to target perceived enemies, even without sufficient evidence for prosecution, raising concerns about the weaponization of the department. Martin intends to expose and discredit those he believes to be guilty, regardless of whether they committed prosecutable crimes. This approach deviates from the traditional prosecutorial standard of charging crimes, not people, and violates ethical guidelines. Critics view this as a dangerous blurring of personal score-settling and government power, with the potential for abuse and intimidation.</p>
