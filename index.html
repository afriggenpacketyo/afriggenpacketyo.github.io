          <h2>Jewish Community Leaders Express Concern Over Zohran Mamdani's Potential NYC Mayoral Victory</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jewish leaders in New York City are expressing significant concern over Zohran Mamdani's Democratic mayoral nomination, warning of a potential "mass exodus" of Jewish residents if he wins the election. Their apprehension stems from his positions on Israel, including his refusal to condemn certain protest language and his sponsorship of a bill they argue targets Jewish organizations connected to Israel. Amid rising antisemitism in the city, these leaders fear his election could exacerbate the situation, viewing him as an existential threat to the community's future in New York.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has disclosed that thousands of Afghans were secretly relocated to the United Kingdom under a special scheme created after a Ministry of Defence official inadvertently leaked their personal data. The breach, which occurred in 2022, compromised the details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had applied for UK resettlement, putting them at risk from the Taliban. The existence of the leak and the subsequent £400 million relocation program were concealed from the public by a super-injunction, which has now been lifted by a High Court judge.</p>

          <p>Leicester City has appointed Marti Cifuentes as its new manager on a three-year contract, following the club's recent relegation from the Premier League. The 43-year-old Spaniard, formerly the head coach of Queens Park Rangers, is tasked with leading the Foxes back to the top flight, a feat they achieved in 2024 under previous manager Enzo Maresca. Cifuentes is the sixth permanent manager for the club in just over two years, and his appointment is seen as a move towards a more modern, progressive style of football.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the U.S. has reached a trade deal with Indonesia, just a week after threatening the country with a 32% tariff on its exports. While the president provided few specifics in his social media post, he described it as a "great deal, for everybody," achieved through direct negotiations with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick later suggested that the agreement involves Indonesia dropping its tariffs on U.S. goods, following a pattern similar to a recent, vaguely detailed deal announced with Vietnam.</p>

Economists suggest that the full inflationary effects of the Trump administration's tariffs have not yet been realized, anticipating that dwindling pre-tariff stockpiles will lead businesses to pass more costs on to consumers in the latter half of the year.

          <p>Jeff Bezos has named Tom Taylor, a former veteran Amazon executive who previously led the Alexa division, as the new president and CEO of the Bezos Earth Fund. Taylor will oversee the $10 billion fund, which Bezos established in 2020 to combat climate change and protect biodiversity by issuing grants to scientists and organizations. The fund, which has so far distributed $2.3 billion, aims to disburse its entire capital by 2030, and Taylor's appointment brings experienced corporate leadership to the major philanthropic effort.</p>

          <p>This week is pivotal for the cryptocurrency industry in Washington, as the House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on two key pieces of legislation aimed at creating a regulatory framework for digital assets. The GENIUS Act, a stablecoin bill that has already passed the Senate, could become the first standalone crypto law. A more comprehensive market structure bill, the CLARITY Act, also has bipartisan support in the House but faces a more uncertain path in the Senate amid concerns over potential conflicts of interest.

          <p>The White House has stated that President Trump was "merely asking a question" and "not encouraging further killing" when he asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky about the country's capacity to strike Moscow. The clarification came after reports that Trump had privately encouraged an escalation of attacks on Russia. This occurred as the president announced a new weapons package for Ukraine and threatened Russia with 100% secondary tariffs if a ceasefire is not reached in 50 days, signaling a complex and increasingly frustrated U.S. stance on the ongoing war.</p>

After his administration announced it found no evidence for popular conspiracy theories surrounding Epstein, many of Trump's own supporters and allied media figures have refused to drop the issue, shouting "cover-up." The author argues that this defiance from his base is significant, as it marks a rare instance where Trump's attempts to control the narrative have failed within his own coalition, creating a schadenfreude-filled spectacle for his opponents.</p>

While President Trump aims to close the agency, a complete shutdown would require congressional approval, which is unlikely, leaving the administration to pursue its goal by dramatically shrinking the department's size and scope.</p>
