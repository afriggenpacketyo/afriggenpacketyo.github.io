          <p>Energy Secretary Ed Miliband is considering implementing regional energy pricing in the UK, potentially leading to lower bills in areas generating more power. The proposed "zonal pricing" aims to improve grid efficiency and encourage investment, but concerns exist about potential bill increases for southern English households. Some energy companies support the idea, while others worry about scaring off investment and raising bills. Miliband emphasizes that no decision has been made and that any changes must result in lower bills across the country.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's approach to science is facing criticism, with concerns raised about political interference and the promotion of scientifically dubious claims. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, has been accused of distorting health information and promoting debunked theories. The administration's focus on specific research areas, such as autism and transgender health, is raising concerns about biased studies designed to support political goals. Scientists worry about the politicization of research and the erosion of scientific integrity.</p>
