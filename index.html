        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Metropolitan Police has announced it will no longer investigate non-crime hate incidents, aiming to redirect officer focus to criminal matters. This policy change follows the controversial arrest of "Father Ted" creator Graham Linehan, whose case related to social media posts has now been dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service. The move is intended to provide clearer direction for officers and prevent them from policing "toxic culture war debates," according to a Met spokesperson. Non-crime hate incidents are acts perceived as motivated by prejudice but do not meet the criminal threshold.</p>

          <p>An Amazon Web Services (AWS) outage on Monday caused significant disruptions for numerous major websites and online services globally, including Disney+, Reddit, and several banking apps. The issue originated from DNS problems within its main US-East-1 region in Virginia, affecting over 70 of its own services. While AWS reported that the primary issue was mitigated within hours, some users continued to experience problems. The event highlights the internet's heavy reliance on a few major cloud providers, as millions of companies depend on AWS for essential cloud computing infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Millions of people participated in the "No Kings" demonstrations across the United States to protest the Trump administration, with the events remaining remarkably peaceful despite some Republican leaders predicting violence. The marches, organized by a coalition of liberal groups, were characterized by a mix of serious political messaging and irreverent humor, featuring a wide array of creative signs and costumes. The article suggests that this broad, diverse coalition is unified by a shared opposition to the administration's policies. The peaceful nature of the protests defied expectations of conflict and resulted in very few arrests.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to fast-track the delivery of nuclear-powered submarines to Australia as part of the AUKUS security pact, aimed at countering China's influence in the Indo-Pacific. President Trump confirmed the accelerated timeline during a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, stating the process is moving "very, very quickly." The agreement involves the sale of up to five Virginia-class submarines. Despite expediting the deal, Trump also expressed confidence in his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping, suggesting the trilateral agreement might not ultimately be necessary to deter China.</p>

          <p>An art exhibition in Los Angeles is displaying decommissioned Confederate statues, including a melted-down monument of General Robert E. Lee from Charlottesville, as a way to re-contextualize their controversial history. The "Monuments" show at the Museum of Contemporary Art places these figures, who fought to preserve slavery, alongside contemporary art to challenge the "Lost Cause" ideology. Curators and activists involved argue that the exhibit confronts the narrative of white supremacy that these statues represent. The initiative comes as President Trump has ordered the reinstallation of similar monuments, highlighting the ongoing national debate over American history.</p>

          <p>The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), the agency responsible for safeguarding the U.S. nuclear stockpile, will furlough approximately 1,400 employees as the government shutdown continues. This marks the first time the agency has had to furlough workers since its establishment in 2000, leaving fewer than 400 staff members on duty. While officials assert that the nuclear stockpile will remain secure, the furloughs are expected to hamper efforts to modernize older weapons. The shutdown stems from a legislative impasse between Republicans and Democrats over federal funding and healthcare provisions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the significant financial repercussions of dropping out of a debt settlement program before its completion. Quitting early means unsettled debts remain fully owed, with interest and fees continuing to accrue, potentially leaving the individual in a worse position than before. Any money deposited into a settlement account may be reduced by fees, and the credit score damage incurred during the process will not be offset by the benefit of becoming debt-free. Furthermore, any debts that were successfully settled could still have tax implications, as forgiven amounts are often considered taxable income by the IRS. (not investment advice)</p>

The central question is whether this prohibition is consistent with the Second Amendment, especially following the court's 2022 Bruen decision that expanded gun rights.

The author suggests that voters, particularly Democrats, may forgive her behavior because they value her reputation as a "fighter" who holds corporate power to account.

          <p>Japan's health ministry has approved the over-the-counter sale of an emergency contraceptive pill, Norlevo, for the first time, a major step for reproductive health access in the country. The "morning-after" pill will be available without a doctor's prescription, though it will be classified as a "medicine requiring guidance," meaning it must be taken in the presence of a pharmacist. This move brings Japan in line with over 90 other countries where such medication is already accessible without a prescription. Campaigners have long argued that the previous requirement was a barrier for many women, including victims of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>The recent Amazon Web Services (AWS) outage highlights its critical role as the backbone for about a third of the internet. AWS provides cloud computing services like storage, databases, and server capacity, allowing millions of companies to operate without maintaining their own expensive infrastructure. Monday's disruption was caused by a Domain Name System (DNS) error, a common issue where the system that translates website names into IP addresses fails, effectively losing the "map" to the internet's destinations. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with the global economy's heavy reliance on a few dominant cloud service providers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article critiques the political discourse surrounding crime in Chicago, arguing that both Democratic defenses and Republican attacks oversimplify a complex and persistent tragedy. It highlights the murder of 24-year-old police officer Aréanah Preston as a symbol of the city's failure to protect its residents, particularly in Black and Latino communities. While homicide numbers have fallen from a recent peak, Chicago's murder rate remains significantly higher than that of New York or Los Angeles. The author points to decades of disinvestment, an ineffective police department, and a political leadership that has tolerated disorder as root causes of the ongoing violence.</p>

Senior U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to help ensure the agreement does not collapse. The clashes began after an attack killed two Israeli soldiers, which prompted Israel to launch retaliatory airstrikes in Gaza that killed 45 people, according to local health officials. Despite the flare-up, both Israel and Hamas recommitted to the peace process, which includes a hostage release and increased humanitarian aid to Gaza.</p>

          <p>An executive coach and human behavior professor outlines five practical strategies for effectively working with a controlling manager while conserving one's own energy. The advice includes submitting rough drafts to invite early input, reinforcing the boss's authority with deferential language, and oversharing information to satisfy their need for oversight. Other techniques involve preemptively asking for feedback to get ahead of criticism and directly asking for positive reinforcement to balance the focus on adjustments. These methods aim to manage the dynamic by catering to the boss's psychological needs, thereby creating a less frustrating work environment for the employee.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Electric vehicles generally depreciate more quickly than their internal combustion engine counterparts, losing about 13% more value over a five-year period, according to tracking firm iSeeCars. This rapid loss in value is attributed to several factors, including historically generous government and manufacturer incentives that lower the benchmark for used car prices. The fast pace of technological advancement, particularly in battery range, also makes older models less desirable. As more affordable, mainstream EVs enter the market, this trend could change, but for now, the higher depreciation remains a consideration for value-oriented buyers. (not investment advice)</p>

The primary obstacle is the "means test," which compares an individual's income to their state's median income; those earning below the median generally qualify automatically. Higher earners may still qualify if, after deducting allowed expenses, they have little to no disposable income left to repay creditors. Other disqualifying factors include a recent bankruptcy filing, failure to complete required credit counseling, or signs of fraud, such as hiding assets or making large luxury purchases just before filing.
