          <p>Former President Trump has publicly praised Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan following a meeting, a significant reversal from his call for Tan's immediate resignation just days prior. The initial demand was prompted by concerns from Senator Tom Cotton regarding Tan's alleged ties to China. Following the meeting, which included cabinet members, Trump described Tan's career as an "amazing story" and indicated they would collaborate on future suggestions, causing Intel's stock to rise. This shift in tone highlights the administration's active and often unpredictable involvement in the semiconductor industry amid U.S.-China tech competition.</p>

          <p>In The Hundred cricket tournament, 22-year-old fast bowler Sonny Baker delivered an outstanding performance to help Manchester Originals secure a 10-run win against London Spirit. Baker's initial spell was exceptionally economical, restricting Spirit's chase and earning praise from his captain, Phil Salt, who compared him to England legend James Anderson. Despite a strong innings of 71 from London's David Warner, Baker's crucial wicket of Ashton Turner and overall figures of 2-22 were decisive. Baker was named player of the match for his impressive pace and skill.</p>

          <p>Top Democrats, including Hillary Clinton and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, received significant criticism on social media for their reactions to former President Trump's plan to federalize the Washington, D.C. police force. Clinton called Trump's justification "unhinged," and both she and Jeffries cited statistics indicating that violent crime in D.C. is at a 30-year low. Conservatives and White House officials pushed back, arguing that crime is out of control and sharing headlines of recent violent incidents to counter the Democrats' claims. The debate highlights the deep political divide over the perception of public safety in the nation's capital.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has announced he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, stating an intention to "try to get some of that territory back for Ukraine." He characterized the summit as a preliminary "feel-out meeting" to push Putin to end the war, suggesting he would know quickly if a deal is possible. Trump mentioned he would update European allies and speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky before finalizing any agreement. This unilateral approach has raised concerns among European leaders and in Kyiv, who insist that any peace deal must involve Ukraine directly.</p>

          <p>An 11-year-old girl sustained non-fatal injuries after being attacked by a mountain lion near her home in Malibu. The incident occurred while she was doing chores near a chicken coop, where the animal bit her arm, leg, and back. The girl's mother and sibling intervened, and the sound of a stun gun scared the lion away, which then briefly chased them. California Department of Fish and Wildlife officers later located and fatally shot the young male mountain lion on the property. This marks the 27th documented mountain lion attack on a human in the state since 1986.</p>

Critics, primarily Democrats, warn that dismantling the department would disrupt essential services like federal student loans and grants for low-income and special education students, which would require an act of Congress to fully achieve.</p>

The piece suggests the move is a pretext to use state power against political opponents, drawing parallels to his actions during the 2020 protests and citing praise from right-wing activists who admire authoritarian leaders.

          <p>AOL is officially shutting down its iconic dial-up internet service in the U.S. and Canada, effective September 30. The service, known for its distinctive connection sound, was a gateway to the internet for millions in the 1990s but has long been superseded by broadband. At its peak, AOL had over 30 million subscribers, but today, fewer than 300,000 Americans report using a dial-up connection. The decision marks the end of an era for a brand that once dominated the early consumer internet landscape.</p>

          <p>Shares of lithium mining companies, including U.S.-based Albemarle, experienced a significant surge on Monday. The rally was triggered by news that Chinese battery giant CATL has temporarily suspended production at its Yichun mine due to an expired permit. This mine accounts for approximately 4% of the projected global lithium supply for 2025. Investors anticipate that the production halt will tighten an already constrained market and drive up lithium prices, benefiting other producers. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Caltech suggests that the next major earthquake on California's San Andreas fault may not resemble past events like the 1906 or 1857 quakes. By studying a recent, unexpectedly long rupture on a similar fault in Myanmar, researchers concluded that seismic events do not repeat in identical ways. The findings imply that a future "Big One" could rupture a much longer section of the fault than previously thought, potentially exceeding magnitude 8, or manifest as a series of smaller but still powerful quakes. This highlights the complexity and inherent randomness of earthquake behavior, making precise prediction impossible.</p>

The company projects a significantly wider operating loss compared to the previous year.

          <p>Cannabis-related stocks, including Canopy Growth and Tilray Brands, rallied significantly after former President Trump announced he is considering reclassifying marijuana to a less dangerous drug category. Such a move, likely from Schedule I to Schedule III under federal law, would ease tax burdens and encourage institutional investment in the industry. Trump stated a decision would be made in the coming weeks. While the final authority rests with the Attorney General, the president's public consideration of the issue has created strong optimism and a surge in trading for the sector.

          <p>Nvidia and AMD have agreed to a deal with the U.S. government to share 15% of their revenue from certain chip sales to China in exchange for export licenses. This unusual arrangement, brokered by the Trump administration, allows the companies to sell their H20 and MI308 chips, respectively, to the lucrative Chinese market after they were previously restricted. Analysts view the move as a transactional approach to trade policy, setting a strange precedent but ultimately being a net positive for the companies, as 85% of revenue is better than zero. The deal underscores the strategic importance of semiconductors in U.S.-China geopolitical competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explains the legal basis for former President Trump's move to place the Washington, D.C. police under federal control. Trump invoked Section 740 of the D.C. Home Rule Act of 1973, a provision that allows the president to assume command of the city's police force for up to 30 days during "special conditions of an emergency nature." While the Home Rule Act grants D.C. an elected mayor and council, Congress retains oversight, and the president has this specific emergency power. The move has been condemned by D.C. officials and Democrats as an assault on local governance, while Republicans have praised it as a necessary step to combat crime.</p>

The author contends that the court's 2019 decision in Rucho v. Common Cause, which deemed partisan gerrymandering a "nonjusticiable" issue for federal courts, opened the door for states to manipulate districts without legal consequence. While Trump is pushing Texas to redraw its maps for partisan gain, the article asserts this is only possible because the Supreme Court abdicated its role in protecting voting rights from such manipulation.

The piece points to the rapid development of substitute materials, such as sodium-ion batteries that don't use lithium or cobalt, and efficiency gains that reduce the amount of silver needed in solar panels.
