          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal made landfall early Sunday near Litchfield Beach, South Carolina, with sustained winds of 50 mph. The storm, which had briefly intensified to 60 mph winds before reaching the coast, is now weakening as it moves inland. Tropical storm warnings remain in effect for parts of the North and South Carolina coastline, with officials anticipating 2 to 4 inches of rain and localized flash flooding. The storm is expected to dissipate by Monday, but will continue to bring scattered showers and gusty winds to the region throughout the day.</p>

          <p>A building in a Herriman, Utah, strip mall exploded late Saturday after a vehicle crashed into the structure, triggering a major fire. The powerful blast sent the building's roof into the air and was captured in dramatic video footage. Several people were reportedly injured in the incident, which also prompted temporary evacuations in a one-mile radius due to concerns over a gas leak. The evacuation order was lifted in the early morning hours after the situation was brought under control by fire and police departments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK education secretary stated that the government's recent U-turn on a major package of welfare reforms has made future spending decisions more difficult. The reversal, prompted by a rebellion from Labour MPs, means that a projected £5 billion in annual savings will be delayed or lost, increasing pressure on the chancellor. The minister did not commit to scrapping the two-child benefit cap, a related policy, noting that while the government is exploring all options to reduce child poverty, the climbdown on the broader reforms limits its financial flexibility.

          <p>Two months after being ousted from Germany's ruling coalition, the Green Party is struggling to redefine its role and strategy as an opposition force. Party leadership is grappling with how to reconnect with voters, particularly after public backlash against policies like the controversial heating law. The party faces challenges, including a lack of personnel in eastern Germany and the perception that it is an out-of-touch party of prohibitions. Leaders are now attempting to pivot towards a more grassroots approach, aiming to better address the everyday concerns of citizens while still championing their core issue of climate protection.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of researchers in China has developed a novel data sorting system that is significantly faster and more energy-efficient than existing methods. The new approach utilizes memristors, which are electronic components that combine memory and resistor functions, to overcome the "Von Neumann bottleneck" that limits data transfer speeds in traditional computing architectures. By enabling "sort-in-memory" operations, the hardware prototype demonstrated major performance improvements in tasks like route finding and AI-driven neural network inference. This innovation could address critical performance bottlenecks in fields ranging from artificial intelligence to scientific computing.</p>

          <p>The US-citizen husband of a Canadian woman, who has lived in the U.S. since she was a child, reports feeling "blindsided" after his wife was detained by immigration agents during her permanent residency interview. The family, who supported Donald Trump's tough stance on immigration, did not believe the policies would affect them, as the woman has no criminal record and has been raising three US-born children. Despite her husband's vote, the 45-year-old woman, Cynthia Olivera, is now in a detention facility awaiting deportation to Canada based on a decades-old order. The case highlights the broad application of the administration's immigration crackdown beyond its stated focus on violent criminals.</p>

The shoplifter admitted to the offense but was dealt with through a "community resolution," which involved paying for the stolen goods and being banned from the store, but resulted in no criminal conviction. The shopkeeper, Andrew Board, argues this approach fails to deter future crime and reflects a broader national issue where a majority of reported shoplifting offenses go unpunished.

          <p>After a trial that detailed a complex plot of lust and greed, a Los Angeles jury found Monica Sementilli guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy in the 2017 killing of her husband, celebrity hairdresser Fabio Sementilli. Prosecutors successfully argued she conspired with her lover, Robert Baker, to stage the murder as a robbery to collect on a life insurance policy. Key evidence included her suspicious activity on the day of the murder and testimony from Baker's accomplice. Sementilli has been sentenced to life in prison without parole, bringing a conclusion to a case that has taken nearly eight years to resolve.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods in central Texas have resulted in at least 50 deaths, with rescue crews continuing to search for 27 girls missing from a riverside summer camp. The Guadalupe River rose a catastrophic 26 feet in just 45 minutes early Friday, overwhelming Camp Mystic and surrounding communities. The disaster has prompted questions about the adequacy of warnings and the impact of federal budget cuts on the National Weather Service's forecasting ability. The event also highlights the increasing frequency of extreme rainfall events, which scientists link to the warming atmosphere caused by the climate crisis.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have found that genetic factors play a significant role in shaping "brain criticality," the crucial balance between neural excitation and inhibition that is linked to the brain's information processing capabilities. The study, published in the *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, established a direct link between an individual's genetic makeup, their brain's criticality state, and their cognitive functions. By identifying brain criticality as a heritable biological phenotype, these findings open new avenues for understanding brain function and the genetic underpinnings of various neurological and psychiatric disorders.</p>

          <p>Chilean tennis player Nicolas Jarry, who is set to face Britain's Cameron Norrie at Wimbledon, has opened up about his "year of battles" with a debilitating health condition. Just over a year ago, Jarry was diagnosed with vestibular neuritis, an inner-ear nerve inflammation causing severe vertigo and balance issues, which derailed his career when he was ranked in the world's top 20. His emotional run to the fourth round at Wimbledon is a significant achievement after a period of physical and psychological struggle. The tournament holds special meaning for Jarry, as his grandfather also reached the same stage in 1974.</p>

          <p>In a stunning turn, a Colorado judge dismissed the original murder charges against Barry Morphew just days before his trial for the 2020 disappearance of his wife, Suzanne. The dismissal came after the judge sanctioned prosecutors for repeatedly failing to turn over potentially exculpatory evidence, including barring most of their key expert witnesses. The case had been built on circumstantial evidence, including a "chipmunk alibi," a tranquilizer gun theory, and data from Morphew's truck. The defense also highlighted DNA from an unknown male linked to other sexual assaults found in Suzanne's car, which complicated the prosecution's narrative.</p>

          <p>Barry Morphew has been arrested for a second time and indicted on first-degree murder charges in the death of his wife, Suzanne, following the discovery of her remains in 2023. The new indictment reveals shocking details, including the presence of a potent animal tranquilizer in her bone marrow, a substance only Morphew had access to in the area. Forensic analysis also suggests her body was moved at least twice after her death, having decomposed in a different location before being buried in a shallow grave. These new findings led to the fresh charges after a previous case against him was dismissed.</p>

          <p>Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's Supreme Leader, made his first public appearance on Saturday since the conclusion of a 12-day war with Israel. His attendance at a religious mourning ceremony in Tehran ended speculation that he was in seclusion following the conflict, during which the U.S. and Israel targeted key Iranian military and nuclear sites. The war, which Iran acknowledges killed over 900 of its people, has escalated regional tensions. In response to the attacks on its nuclear facilities, Iran has suspended cooperation with the UN's atomic watchdog, further complicating international oversight of its program.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has detailed how the UK's Security Service, MI5, provided false and misleading evidence to multiple courts to conceal its relationship with a violent, neo-Nazi agent. The case centers on an agent who abused women, with MI5 attempting to cover its tracks by lying about its policy of neither confirming nor denying an agent's status. Despite an internal inquiry, MI5 continued to withhold damning material and provide inaccurate summaries to the High Court. The court has since ruled the inquiries "deficient" and ordered a new investigation, raising serious questions about the agency's credibility and accountability.</p>
