        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has confirmed that the government is in talks with over 120 dissenting Labour MPs regarding proposed changes to the welfare system. The legislation, which aims to save Â£5 billion annually by tightening eligibility for disability benefits, has faced significant backlash within the party due to concerns it could push 250,000 people into poverty. Discussions are ongoing to find common ground and potentially amend the bill before a crucial vote, as ministers emphasize the need for reform to control rising costs while rebels demand a fairer approach with proper impact assessments.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are pushing back against a leaked Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) report that suggested U.S. strikes did not completely destroy Iran's nuclear capabilities. Lawmakers, including Senators Kevin Cramer and Roger Wicker, expressed confidence in President Trump's assessment that the facilities were "totally obliterated," citing the DIA's past inaccuracies and information from the Israeli ambassador. While publicly defending the mission's success, senators are still seeking a more detailed briefing from administration officials to confirm the full extent of the damage to Iran's nuclear program, particularly the fortified Fordow facility.</p>

          <p>Six individuals were temporarily taken into police custody during a protest that blocked the entrance to Palantir's New York office. The demonstration, organized by the group Planet Over Profit, involved over 30 people protesting the data analytics company's contracts with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Israeli military. Protestors accused the Peter Thiel-cofounded firm of being complicit in deportations and the conflict in Gaza, stating, "If your company kills for profit, we will disrupt you." The event highlights growing public scrutiny over the ethical implications of tech companies' government and military collaborations.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 has rebounded to near-record levels, surprising some analysts given persistent geopolitical tensions, trade disputes, and uncertainty. This resilience is attributed to several factors, including strong corporate earnings, particularly in the tech sector, and the enduring investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence. Additionally, the robust U.S. economy, characterized by low unemployment, and the Federal Reserve's indication of potential rate cuts later in the year have bolstered market confidence. The perception that major trade conflicts are being de-escalated has also helped ease investor anxiety and fuel the market's recovery.</p>

          <p>A restructured federal advisory panel, now under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has recommended Merck's new antibody shot, Enflonsia, to protect infants from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). This decision allows the shot to be launched before the upcoming RSV season and included in the government's childhood immunization program, ensuring broad insurance coverage. The vote is seen as a relief to the public health community, which had expressed concern after Kennedy, a known vaccine critic, overhauled the committee. The shot is designed to compete with a similar product from Sanofi and AstraZeneca.</p>

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren, along with other senior Democrats, is formally questioning oil majors ConocoPhillips and Ovintiv about their lobbying efforts to secure a significant tax break. The proposed exemption, included in the Senate Republican's reconciliation bill, would shield fossil fuel companies from the 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) established in 2022. The senators' letters demand details on lobbying expenditures and the potential tax savings for the companies, highlighting the perceived hypocrisy of granting tax handouts to profitable oil corporations while the same bill proposes cuts to healthcare and clean energy incentives.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's new "Trump Card" program, which offers a path to U.S. residency for a $5 million investment, is attracting interest but faces substantial obstacles. Immigration attorneys and advisors point to fundamental legal challenges, including the need for congressional approval to alter the existing EB-5 visa program and the critical issue of U.S. worldwide income taxation, from which buyers would likely need an exemption. While the White House touts high interest, experts suggest the actual market of buyers is likely much smaller than projected, with demand potentially limited by these legal complexities and capital controls in countries like China.</p>

          <p>In a significant tactical move, the defense team for Sean "Diddy" Combs rested its case without calling a single witness, betting that federal prosecutors have failed to prove their racketeering and sex trafficking charges beyond a reasonable doubt. Legal experts suggest the strategy aims to convince jurors that while Combs' behavior may have been reprehensible, it did not meet the legal definition of the crimes alleged. The defense's case now hinges on whether their cross-examinations of 34 government witnesses, including ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura, successfully planted enough doubt about the prosecution's narrative of a criminal enterprise built on violence and coercion.</p>

Cammack attributed the threats to "pro-abortion activists" and noted that law enforcement is investigating.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant setback for Senate Republicans, Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough has ruled that a key Medicaid provision in President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" violates Senate rules. The provision, which aimed to cut costs by cracking down on states' use of provider taxes, cannot be passed through the budget reconciliation process that requires only a simple majority. This decision forces Republicans to either redraft the section, risking the loss of conservative support, or scrap it, potentially alienating members who were concerned about its impact on rural hospitals, all while facing a tight July 4th deadline.</p>

She told the BBC that the killer, who was sentenced to three whole-life orders, was filled with a hatred for women that is fueled and emboldened by hateful content on social media platforms. Hunt directly linked the killer's actions to his consumption of content from figures like Andrew Tate, arguing that society has an obligation to address this "acceptable form of extremism" and change the behavior of men.</p>

          <p>Following the approval of U.S. Steel's merger with Japan's Nippon Steel, President Donald Trump personally holds a "golden share" that grants him unprecedented veto power over the company's key operations. According to a corporate charter filed with the SEC, this power allows him to block decisions such as moving the headquarters, closing production facilities, or cutting employee salaries. This arrangement was part of a national security agreement that secured Trump's approval for the deal. After Trump leaves office, the veto authority will be transferred to the Treasury and Commerce Departments, representing the U.S. government.</p>

To achieve this "moonshot" goal, she will utilize rotating pacers to reduce air resistance, a strategy famously employed by Roger Bannister in his record-breaking 1954 run.

          <p>This article traces the cultural history of how getting little sleep became a marker of dedication and success in America, from early exhortations about great men being early risers to modern tech CEOs bragging about all-nighters. This mindset is rooted in the Protestant work ethic and the more recent phenomenon of "workism," where college-educated individuals derive their identity from their careers. This cultural pressure to defy the body's natural need for rest has also created a market for products promising to keep people awake, from coffee to energy drinks. Despite growing awareness of sleep's importance, the perception of rest as laziness remains deeply ingrained.</p>

Drawing on a Zen Buddhist story, the author suggests this can be achieved through three steps: focusing on intrinsic rewards rather than just pay, finding aspects of the work that are genuinely interesting, and actively looking for opportunities to be of service to others. The author reflects that this approach can transform even a seemingly mundane or unsatisfying job into a vehicle for life's purpose, creating satisfaction and a sense of vocation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines five ways consumers can deal with a charged-off credit card account, a situation where a lender writes off a debt as a loss but the consumer is still legally obligated to pay it. The options include paying the full balance immediately if possible, or negotiating a lump-sum settlement for a lower amount, which creditors often accept. For those without immediate cash, setting up a payment plan with the creditor is another viable path. Alternatively, one can dispute the debt if there are inaccuracies or, as a last resort, let the account age off the credit report after seven years, though this risks continued collection efforts.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist who won the Democratic primary for New York City mayor, has been subjected to a torrent of Islamophobic and xenophobic attacks online and from conservative political figures. Prominent Republicans and far-right activists have labeled him a "terrorist sympathizer" and called for his deportation, weaponizing his Muslim faith and immigrant background. Mamdani has reported receiving multiple death threats. The coordinated nature of the rhetoric, which frames his potential leadership as a civilizational threat, reflects a familiar pattern of targeting Muslim politicians in American politics, raising concerns about rising political violence.</p>

Two individuals, the driver and one student, sustained serious but not life-threatening injuries. A witness who helped rescue students stated the driver told her the brakes had failed and he was trying to avoid hitting other cars. Emergency services conducted a major rescue operation to free trapped passengers, and an incident center was set up for concerned parents.
