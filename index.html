          <p>The head of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), Paul Nowak, is publicly calling on the UK's Labour government to demonstrate its commitment to working-class communities. This comes amid warnings from other major unions, like Unite, which is considering severing its significant financial ties with the Labour Party due to a perceived lack of support. Union leaders express concern that the government may dilute a forthcoming Employment Rights Bill, urging ministers to make "the right political choices" to prove they are on the side of workers and avoid losing voters to other parties.</p>

Japan's Nikkei 225 saw a notable rise despite the news, while the yen weakened against the US dollar. Market watchers are also keenly awaiting August trade data from China to gauge the economic health of the region's largest economy. Meanwhile, oil prices saw a slight increase after OPEC+ announced it would continue to lift production, albeit at a slower pace than in previous months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has issued what he termed a "last warning" to Hamas, urging the group to accept a ceasefire proposal that he claims the Israeli side has already agreed to. In a social media post, Trump stated there would be consequences if Hamas does not accept the terms for releasing the remaining hostages from Gaza. Reports from Israeli media suggest Trump's proposal involves Hamas freeing all hostages on the first day of a truce in exchange for thousands of Palestinian prisoners. Hamas later acknowledged receiving new ideas from the US through mediators and is currently discussing them.</p>

The event was also marked by several other strange occurrences, including the surprise birth of a baby to a woman who was unaware she was pregnant. Other reported incidents that required medical evacuation included a man being struck by a vehicle and another person who may have been electrocuted after stepping into a puddle. Police have not yet named a suspect in the homicide, which they believe to be an isolated incident.</p>

          <p>The family of Raish Ahmed, a 50-year-old man stabbed to death by his neighbor in Canning Town, London, states that he was "failed by London." They criticize the police and local council for not taking sufficient action despite numerous complaints about the perpetrator's aggressive and anti-social behavior prior to the murder. The neighbor, Daniel Whybrow, was sentenced to life in prison for the killing, which occurred during a dispute over a communal door being left open. Ahmed's family and friends remember him as a dedicated father and a joyful community member, and they feel the tragedy was preventable.</p>

The Rams' defense was crucial in the victory, limiting the Texans to three field goals and securing the win with a forced fumble in the final two minutes.

Built in 1926, the carousel is one of the few remaining four-across wooden carousels of its type and features hand-carved horses.

This shift is driven by the region's burgeoning artificial intelligence sector, more attractive valuations compared to U.S. stocks, and expectations of a weaker dollar and looser U.S. monetary policy. While U.S. markets attracted over a trillion dollars from 2020 to 2024, investment flows have slowed this year.

To qualify, an individual must have earned an income at or above the maximum taxable earnings limit for at least 35 years of their working life. This limit, which adjusts annually, means a worker has paid the maximum amount of Social Security payroll taxes for those years.

          <p>Germany's national football team earned a crucial 3-1 victory over Northern Ireland in a World Cup qualifying match in Cologne. After an early goal from Serge Gnabry, Northern Ireland fought back to equalize through an Isaac Price volley, frustrating the home side. However, two German goals in a three-minute span from Nadiem Amiri and Florian Wirtz ultimately secured the win for the hosts. Northern Ireland's manager, Michael O'Neill, expressed pride in his team's performance but also disappointment, citing a lack of depth and some soft defending as key factors in the defeat.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has expressed confidence that the Supreme Court will uphold President Trump's tariff plan, which was recently deemed illegal by a federal appeals court. In a television interview, Bessent warned that if the tariffs are ultimately struck down, the Treasury would be forced to issue massive refunds, potentially totaling between $750 billion and $1 trillion. The administration has requested an expedited ruling from the high court to resolve the uncertainty. The tariffs, which apply to most U.S. imports, have been a cornerstone of Trump's trade policy but face significant legal and economic challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz has won the 2025 US Open, defeating his rival Jannik Sinner in a four-set final with a score of 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4. This victory marks the 22-year-old Spaniard's sixth career Grand Slam title and his second championship in New York, allowing him to reclaim the world number one ranking from Sinner. The final, which was delayed due to security measures for former President Trump's attendance, showcased Alcaraz's superior serving and powerful performance. The win gives Alcaraz a 2-1 advantage over Sinner in their three Grand Slam final meetings this year, further cementing their status as the sport's dominant rivalry.</p>

          <p>The California Republican Party has found a unifying cause in its opposition to Proposition 50, a ballot measure proposed by Governor Gavin Newsom to redraw the state's congressional districts. At their recent convention, party members were energized to fight the measure, which will be decided in a November special election. Republicans argue the proposal is a Democratic power grab designed to counter gerrymandering in other states, potentially costing the GOP up to five seats in the U.S. House. This issue has brought together different factions of the state party, which sees defeating the proposition as crucial for its political survival.</p>

          <p>According to Ian Goldin, a professor of globalisation and development at the University of Oxford, globalisation is not dead but is instead "alive and well in Asia." In a recent interview, Goldin asserted that the Asian region's rapid economic growth and poverty reduction are direct results of its integration into the global economy. He noted that while globalisation is becoming more fragmented and regional, its center of gravity is shifting towards Asia as the U.S. pulls back. Goldin also cautioned that the interconnectedness of globalisation brings not only benefits but also growing risks, such as pandemics, that must be managed.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer argues that while President Donald Trump dominates media headlines, focusing on his political initiatives has not been a profitable strategy for stock market investors. Cramer suggests that the recent weak jobs report, which he partly attributes to Trump's policies, may ironically be the most significant market mover by creating a stronger case for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. He contends that despite the constant news cycle, the president's direct impact on the economy and job creation is less significant than underlying factors. Cramer advises investors to focus on company fundamentals rather than political rhetoric. (not investment advice)</p>

The forecast includes a thick marine layer and the possibility of light drizzle or showers in some coastal regions due to a low-pressure system.

This milestone performance comes ahead of a crucial Ashes tour in Australia, where his aggressive batting style is seen as well-suited to the conditions.
