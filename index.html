          <p>Multiple alleged victims of abuse by the late Mohamed Al Fayed are initiating legal action against his estate.  These women, who worked for Al Fayed between 1995 and 2012, allege serious sexual abuse, harassment, and mistreatment.  The BBC's reporting, while aiming for objectivity, may carry a subtle bias towards portraying Al Fayed negatively given the focus on the allegations.</p>
