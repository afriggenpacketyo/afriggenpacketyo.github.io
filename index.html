          <p>President Trump announced a "planned partnership" between U.S. Steel and Japan-based Nippon Steel, asserting that U.S. Steel will maintain its headquarters in Pittsburgh, which is welcome news for the local economy. Nippon Steel's bid to acquire U.S. Steel had previously faced opposition from former President Biden, and the deal is currently undergoing another national security review. Trump stated that the partnership would generate at least 70,000 jobs and contribute $14 billion to the U.S. economy, although specifics of the agreement and ownership structure remain unclear. Shares of U.S. Steel experienced a significant surge following the announcement, and a rally is planned in Pittsburgh to celebrate the deal.</p>

The author emphasizes Milgrim's commitment to fostering understanding and coexistence, particularly between Jews and Muslims, and warns against exploiting her death for political gain. Milgrim's work focused on the shared humanity and mutual right to dignity for all, and her legacy should be honored by continuing her efforts to build bridges and seek peaceful solutions in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to dismiss criminal charges against Vladimir Antonio Arevalo-Chavez, a high-ranking MS-13 leader, to deport him to El Salvador, raising concerns about political motivations. Arevalo-Chavez possesses knowledge of a secretive pact between the Salvadoran government and MS-13, and critics suggest the deportation aims to prevent him from testifying in a U.S. court and revealing details about President Bukele's past ties to the gang. The Justice Department cites "sensitive and important foreign policy considerations" for dismissing the charges, while Arevalo-Chavez's attorneys claim it's an effort to support a deal with El Salvador and suppress the truth about Bukele's negotiations with MS-13 leaders.</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge has overturned an executive order issued by Donald Trump that targeted the law firm Jenner & Block, suspending security clearances and restricting their access to government facilities. Trump's order accused the firm of engaging in activities that "undermine justice and the interests of the United States," specifically citing their employment of Andrew Weissmann, who worked on the Mueller investigation. The judge ruled that Trump's directive violated core rights under the U.S. Constitution, mirroring a similar ruling against an executive order targeting law firm Perkins Coie. The judge stated that Trump's order targeted Jenner & Block because of the causes it champions and the clients it represents.</p>

          <p>Harvard University filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration after the Department of Homeland Security moved to block international students from attending the university. The lawsuit accuses the administration of a "campaign of retribution" and argues that the restrictions would harm the university's mission and academic environment. Harvard President Alan M. Garber condemned the action as unlawful and unwarranted, stating that it endangers the futures of thousands of students and scholars. A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order against the federal edict, agreeing that Harvard had shown that its implementation would cause “immediate and irreparable injury” to the university.</p>

          <p>According to a border official, new sanctions from the Trump Treasury Department are a "full-frontal assault" on the Cartel del Noreste (CDN), one of the deadliest cartels operating along the southern border. The sanctions target high-ranking CDN members, blocking their property and interests in the U.S., and aim to disrupt the cartel's ability to obtain drugs, money, and weapons. Despite reduced illegal crossings due to the Trump administration's border crackdown, cartels like CDN continue to pose a threat to American citizens, engaging in violence, intimidation, and fentanyl trafficking. The sanctions are expected to weaken the cartel by creating a power vacuum and causing infighting.</p>

The administration claims that Musk’s group is a presidential advisory body, not a federal agency, and therefore not subject to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled his upcoming concerts due to a diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (N.P.H.), a brain disorder affecting hearing, vision, and balance. N.P.H. occurs when excess cerebrospinal fluid accumulates in the brain, leading to difficulties in walking, bladder control issues, and memory problems. The condition is often underdiagnosed and its symptoms can be mistaken for normal effects of aging, but early diagnosis and treatment, typically involving surgery to insert a shunt, can significantly improve symptoms. Physical therapy can also aid in improving gait stability, and while N.P.H. is rare, the risk increases with age, and the singer is undergoing physical therapy to recover.</p>

          <p>Military air traffic controllers briefly lost contact with an Army helicopter near the Pentagon, resulting in two commercial jets aborting their landings at a Washington airport. The 20-second loss of contact led to confusion and prompted the airport's air traffic controllers to direct "go-arounds" for the commercial aircraft. The Army attributed the lost contact to a temporary antenna's location and stated that the aircraft's location was continuously broadcast through its ADS-B Out system. The incident has raised concerns about air traffic safety near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.</p>

President Xi Jinping's attendance at Russia's Victory Day celebrations and the confirmation of North Korean troop deployment to Russia underscore this alignment. The piece suggests that China risks appearing reactive to Moscow's agenda and that this diplomatic ambiguity allows other actors, such as the US, to reinsert themselves into the conversation. The deployment of North Korean troops and the heavy casualties they suffered in Russia's war are also highlighted.</p>
