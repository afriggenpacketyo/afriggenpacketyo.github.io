          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 16:36:09 EDT</div>

          <p>Netflix announced second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, with revenue growing 16% year-over-year to $11.08 billion. The streaming giant raised its full-year revenue forecast, citing healthy membership growth, increased advertising sales, and a weaker U.S. dollar. The company highlighted a significant increase in free cash flow and operating margin but cautioned that the margin would be lower in the second half of 2025 due to higher content costs for major releases like "Stranger Things" and "Wednesday." This is the second quarter Netflix has not released specific subscriber data.</p>

          <p>The White House announced that President Donald Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency following medical tests prompted by mild swelling in his lower legs. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt described the condition as benign, common in individuals over 70, and stated that it does not cause the president any discomfort. The evaluation also found no evidence of more serious conditions like deep vein thrombosis, and an echocardiogram showed normal heart function. Bruising on Trump's hand was attributed to frequent handshaking and aspirin use.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. appeals court has overturned the fraud conviction of former HSBC trader Mark Johnson, who was jailed in 2017 for allegedly manipulating foreign exchange rates. Johnson was accused of 'front-running' a $3.5 billion currency trade for a client, a practice his defense and industry bodies argued was a standard risk-management technique known as 'pre-hedging'. After a nine-year legal battle, which included serving time in U.S. and U.K. prisons, Johnson has been fully acquitted. His lawyer stated the case never should have been brought forward in the first place.</p>

          <p>Model Brooks Nader and Olympic skier Lindsey Vonn both encountered wardrobe malfunctions while attending the 2025 ESPY Awards. Nader's silk dress shifted, causing a brief unwanted exposure, which she quickly adjusted before continuing along the red carpet with confidence. Vonn's strapless gown was caught by a gust of wind, exposing more than intended until her sister assisted in holding the dress down. Both celebrities are known for their daring fashion choices and handled the incidents with poise, with Vonn later changing into a second revealing gown for the event.</p>

Attorneys for Taylor's family condemned the recommendation as an "insult," arguing it sends a message that officers can act with impunity. Prosecutors argued that Hankison did not fire the fatal shots and that additional prison time would be unjust, given his conviction already ensures he will never work in law enforcement again.</p>

          <p>A Russian crew member from the Greek-owned cargo ship Eternity C, which was sunk by Houthi militants, is being treated for injuries in Yemen. The Liberia-flagged vessel was attacked with sea drones and grenades over two days, leading to its sinking. Ten of the 25 people on board were rescued and taken to Saudi Arabia, while the remaining 15 are considered missing and the search for them has been called off. The attack is the latest in a series of over 100 strikes on commercial shipping by the Iran-aligned Houthis since November 2023.</p>

          <p>Recent actions by the Supreme Court's conservative majority indicate a strong belief in the president's power to control federal agencies, siding with the Trump administration in several cases. The court has allowed the administration to proceed with significant staff layoffs at the Departments of Education and other agencies by setting aside lower court orders that had blocked them. These decisions align with the "unitary executive theory," which posits that the president has broad authority over the executive branch. Critics argue the court is enabling an expansion of presidential power without providing full legal reasoning.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially rescinded $4 billion in federal funding for California's high-speed rail project, citing a lack of a viable path forward for the beleaguered development. The Department of Transportation pointed to missed deadlines, budget shortfalls, and a failure to secure an additional $7 billion needed for an initial segment. The project's cost has ballooned from an initial $33 billion to an estimated $128 billion. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the move, which reverses a 2021 decision by the previous administration to restore funding that Trump had also revoked during his first term.</p>

          <p>Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York and daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, has been abruptly fired by the Department of Justice. The termination is widely seen as politically motivated, stemming from President Trump's long-standing animosity toward her father. Comey was a key prosecutor in high-profile cases, including those against Ghislaine Maxwell and Sean "Diddy" Combs. In an email to colleagues, she urged them not to let fear, which she called "the tool of a tyrant," influence their work in the wake of her dismissal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A bipartisan group of lawmakers has introduced legislation to classify extreme heat as a major disaster under the Stafford Act, which would allow states to receive federal emergency funding from FEMA. Currently, events like hurricanes and floods are eligible, but extreme heat waves, which kill more Americans than any other weather event, are not explicitly listed. The push comes after a June heat dome broke temperature records across the country. Proponents argue the change is necessary to fund cooling centers and heat adaptation projects, while some, including a former FEMA head, say the existing law already allows for such requests.</p>

          <p>The UK Labour Party has suspended veteran MP Diane Abbott pending an investigation into comments she made about racism. In a BBC interview, Abbott reiterated controversial views she expressed in 2023, suggesting that prejudice against Jewish and Traveller people is not the same as racism based on skin color because their ethnicity is not always visible. Abbott, who was previously suspended for a year over similar remarks, has lost the party whip and will now sit as an independent MP. The comments were criticized by party leadership, while some colleagues defended her right to discuss different forms of racism.</p>

The man, who reportedly overstayed his visa but was married to a U.S. citizen and had applied for a green card, was stopped in his car by agents. According to ICE, he resisted arrest after being allowed to drop off his child, prompting officers to break a car window to apprehend him. The incident is the first confirmed federal immigration arrest at an Oregon school since the Trump administration overturned a policy that restricted enforcement at sensitive locations.</p>

This unprecedented early sale highlights the immense anticipation for the film, which boasts a star-studded cast including Matt Damon, Zendaya, and Charlize Theron.

Officials defended the move as a tool to combat fraud and ensure benefits are not used by ineligible individuals. However, privacy advocates and lawmakers warn it weaponizes data and could deter people, including citizens and eligible immigrants, from seeking necessary medical care.</p>

          <p>NBCUniversal has agreed to a proposed $3.6 million settlement with Los Angeles County to resolve a lawsuit alleging its Peacock streaming service made it difficult for consumers to cancel subscriptions. The lawsuit claimed Peacock's practices violated state and federal laws by not clearly disclosing auto-renewal terms and by obstructing the cancellation process. As part of the settlement, the company will pay civil penalties and fund consumer protection enforcement. Peacock must also make its renewal and cancellation policies more transparent and provide an easy, immediate method for subscribers to terminate the service.</p>
