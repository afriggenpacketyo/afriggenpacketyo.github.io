        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has increased his criticism of Senator Rand Paul regarding the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." Trump voiced his disapproval of Paul's stance against the bill due to concerns about the debt ceiling increase, which Paul believes will lead to escalating deficits. Paul stated that he has been consistent on his position regarding the deficit regardless of whether there is a Republican or Democrat president. Trump is actively engaging with senators to push the bill through Congress, but faces challenges due to some Republican senators' concerns about spending cuts. Optimism is tempered by the political wrangling and the potential for the bill to stall in the Senate.</p>

          <p>The Dutch government collapsed after Geert Wilders' far-right party withdrew from the coalition due to disagreements over immigration policy. Prime Minister Dick Schoof will lead a caretaker government until new elections are held in the Netherlands. Wilders expressed frustration over the slow pace of implementing stricter immigration policies, including border closures and deportation of dual nationals convicted of crimes. Coalition partners criticized Wilders' move as irresponsible given the current national and international challenges, but the opposition called for elections to form a stable government.</p>

          <p>Chin Chin, a well-known Chinese American restaurant in Los Angeles, is closing its original location on the Sunset Strip after nearly 45 years. The closure is due to the landlord's decision not to renew the lease, though the restaurant hopes to reopen in a new location. Chin Chin is credited with popularizing Chinese chicken salad and other Cantonese specialties in Los Angeles since its debut in 1983, attracting a large celebrity following. The restaurant chain's other locations in Studio City, Brentwood, and Las Vegas will remain open, while staff are being relocated and a GoFundMe campaign has been launched to support those affected by the closure.</p>

          <p>In the Karen Read murder trial, a Boston police officer, Kelly Dever, who previously stated she saw key figures near Read's SUV, retracted her statement, claiming the FBI provided a timeline proving her initial account incorrect. Dever accused Read's defense team of pressuring her to lie, a claim Read denied. The defense is attempting to cast doubt on the investigation, highlighting alleged missteps by the Canton police and suggesting Read's SUV was not responsible for O'Keefe's death. Legal experts have differing opinions on Dever's testimony, with some seeing it as damaging to the prosecution and others viewing it as a sign of the defense's desperation.</p>

          <p>Antonio McDowell, now 49, has been exonerated after serving 23 years in prison for a wrongful murder conviction linked to retired Chicago Police Detective Reynaldo Guevara. McDowell was initially a shooting victim who was framed as a perpetrator in an unrelated murder after refusing to falsely identify Guevara's suspect. McDowell's attorneys emphasized that he was trying to do the right thing when he walked into CPD's Grand Central Area Headquarters to report that he had been shot. McDowell is the 51st person to be exonerated in a case investigated by Guevara, who has been accused of coercing false confessions for years.</p>

          <p>Millions of legal immigrants are facing difficulties in obtaining employment due to a quiet rule change by the Social Security Administration that halted the automatic issuance of social security numbers. The Enumeration Beyond Entry program, which began in 2017, was paused without public notice, requiring immigrants to apply separately for a social security number. This change is causing delays and barriers for immigrants needing a social security number to start jobs, open bank accounts, or receive loans. Critics argue that the freeze is an attack on immigrants with no actual benefits, while Democrats urge the Social Security Administration to reverse the decision.</p>

The think tank highlighted the UK's limited fiscal flexibility and urged Chancellor Rachel Reeves to consider tax increases and spending cuts. The OECD suggests a balanced approach of targeted spending cuts and tax increases, such as closing tax loopholes and re-evaluating council tax bands, to improve the UK's public finances (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A new CDC study found that bismuth subsalicylate, the active ingredient in Pepto Bismol, may not be effective in preventing travelers' diarrhea. The study compared participants who took the medication for prevention with those who took a placebo and found "no significant difference" in diarrhea symptoms. While bismuth subsalicylate is FDA-approved for treating diarrhea, heartburn, and other stomach issues, its off-label use for prevention may not be beneficial. The authors suggest further studies are needed to determine if certain traveler groups or circumstances could benefit from the medication.</p>

          <p>Lee Jae-myung, South Korea's president-elect, is known for his personal politics rooted in his impoverished youth, from factory work to night school. He frames his political mission as creating a society with a "thick safety mat" for the vulnerable. After losing the 2022 election, Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment set the stage for Lee's comeback in the recent snap presidential election. Lee's career includes serving as mayor of Seongnam, where he implemented welfare policies despite opposition from the central government, and his track record inspires loyalty in working-class neighborhoods.</p>
