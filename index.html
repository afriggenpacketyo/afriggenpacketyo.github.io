          <p>Japan reported that at least one of the missiles launched by North Korea may have followed an irregular trajectory, raising concerns about the advancements in North Korea's missile technology. This launch prompted immediate responses from neighboring countries, including South Korea, to assess the situation and enhance their defense readiness. The details regarding the type of missile and its potential range remain under investigation, but the irregular trajectory is a key focus for defense analysts. Such actions by North Korea are a recurring source of regional tension and international condemnation, further complicating diplomatic efforts in the Korean Peninsula.</p>

          <p>President Trump selected Dr. Casey Means, a best-selling author and wellness influencer, as his new pick for U.S. Surgeon General, replacing Janette Nesheiwat after she withdrew her nomination. Means is known for her views against the influence of pharmaceutical and food industries and is aligned with Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. She has also raised concerns about some vaccines and the FDA. Means' appointment signals a continued focus on alternative approaches to health and nutrition within the administration.</p>

          <p>Salt Lake City and Boise adopted official pride flags to circumvent Republican-led state bans on flying “unofficial flags” on government property. Salt Lake City approved three new city flags featuring the city's traditional sego lily design imposed over a pride flag, a trans flag, and a Juneteenth flag. Boise's mayor issued a proclamation retroactively making the pride flag an official city flag. These actions are in response to restrictive flag measures passed in Utah and Idaho, which limit the types of flags that can be flown on government property.</p>

          <p>UnitedHealth Group is being sued by investors who allege the company misled them by withholding information about the impact of a backlash following the death of CEO Brian Thompson. The lawsuit claims UnitedHealth artificially inflated prices by initially forecasting high earnings per share despite mounting criticism of its claims denial practices. The complaint argues that the company's aggressive tactics became increasingly controversial after Thompson's death, triggering public outrage. Following a lower performance forecast, UnitedHealth's stock price experienced a significant drop, prompting the lawsuit seeking unspecified damages.</p>
