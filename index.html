          <p>Federal prosecutors have rested their case against Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump at his Florida golf course. The prosecution's final witness detailed how Routh allegedly conducted surveillance for a month while living out of a gas station before the incident. Routh, who is representing himself, is accused of hiding in bushes with a military-grade rifle and faces five criminal charges, including attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate. He plans to call three witnesses for his defense.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military executed a third "lethal kinetic strike" on a boat in international waters suspected of trafficking narcotics, resulting in the deaths of three individuals described as "narcoterrorists." The announcement, made on Truth Social, included a video of the strike but did not specify the vessel's origin, unlike two previous incidents which were linked to Venezuela. This action is part of a broader administration crackdown on drug cartels, which has heightened tensions with Venezuela and drawn criticism from some Democratic lawmakers who question the legal justification for such military force.</p>

          <p>President Trump has stated that he and Chinese Premier Xi Jinping have approved a deal concerning the future of TikTok's U.S. operations, which would see the business sold to a group of American investors. However, Chinese state media offered a more ambiguous account, stating that Beijing welcomes negotiations. A key point of contention appears to be the ownership of the powerful algorithm that serves content to TikTok's 170 million American users. The leaders also reportedly plan to meet at the upcoming APEC summit in South Korea.</p>

          <p>The arrest of Harjit Kaur, a 73-year-old Sikh woman who has lived in California for over three decades, has caused shock and concern within her community. Kaur, whose asylum application was denied years ago, was detained during a routine check-in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Despite having no criminal record and regularly reporting to authorities, her detention is seen by critics as an example of the Trump administration's stringent immigration policies targeting non-criminals. Lawmakers are now calling for her release, while her family expresses deep concern for her well-being in the detention facility.</p>

          <p>A short-term funding bill passed by the Republican-led House failed to advance in the Senate, leaving the path to avoid a government shutdown by the October 1 deadline uncertain. The bill, which would fund the government until November 21, did not secure the necessary 60 votes in the Senate, with Democrats opposing it over the exclusion of their priorities. With both chambers heading into recess, President Trump has acknowledged the possibility of a shutdown, while congressional leaders from both parties blame each other for the impasse.

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. The National Hurricane Center forecasts that the storm will strengthen into a hurricane by Sunday but is expected to remain over open waters for the next several days. While its current track keeps it away from the Caribbean islands and the U.S. mainland, the system could pass east of Bermuda next week. So far, the 2025 hurricane season has been quieter than initially predicted by forecasters.</p>

          <p>In a satirical opinion piece, the author uses the controversy surrounding Jimmy Kimmel's suspension and President Trump's threats against broadcast networks to highlight what they frame as the administration's hypocrisies. The column humorously juxtaposes the president's defense of free speech with actions seen as undermining it, while also touching on other administration policies with a cynical tone. The author concludes by sarcastically suggesting everyone, including Kimmel, should wear hats proclaiming they were "right about everything," mocking a hat worn by Trump.</p>

Trump confirmed he wanted Siebert "out," citing his nomination's support from Democratic senators. Siebert's departure leaves a leadership vacuum in a key prosecutor's office and has been condemned by James's lawyer as a "brazen attack on the rule of law."</p>

This legal battle is part of the administration's broader effort to tighten immigration policies and remove protections for specific groups of migrants.

          <h2>Major US Tech Investments in the UK Spark Debate on Economic Future</h2>

          <p>A recent flurry of multi-billion-pound investments in the UK by American tech giants like Nvidia and Microsoft has been championed by the government as a sign of the nation's future as an "AI superpower." Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, expressed surprise at British pessimism, praising the country's research capabilities. However, the growing reliance on U.S. capital has drawn criticism from figures like Sir Nick Clegg, who warned that Britain was just getting "crumbs from the Silicon Valley table." The trend suggests the UK economy may become a key laboratory for U.S. tech firms, aligning it closely with American policy in the global AI race. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actor Cillian Murphy has stated that he is very different from his iconic "Peaky Blinders" character, Tommy Shelby, noting that he is not a "psychopathic gangster." Reflecting on playing the role for a significant part of his life, he called it a "defining" privilege and confirmed a film sequel is in the works, though the plot remains secret. Murphy is currently promoting his new film, "Steve," in which he plays the headteacher of a 1990s reform school for troubled boys. He described the new film as a "love letter to teachers" and their role as custodians for the next generation.</p>

          <p>Federal law enforcement agents used tear gas and pepper balls to disperse approximately 100 protesters outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Chicago. Demonstrators, including two Democratic congressional candidates, were attempting to block vehicles during a crackdown dubbed "Operation Midway Blitz." At least three people were arrested during the clashes, which one candidate described as a "violent abuse of power." The protest follows the fatal shooting of a man by an immigration officer in the Chicago area and comes amid a surge of ICE enforcement in the city.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UCLA has released new, formalized rules for campus protests ahead of the fall term, which come as the university faces pressure from the Trump administration. The guidelines ban unauthorized demonstrations in key areas like Royce Quad, the site of a major pro-Palestinian encampment last spring, and prohibit disruptions that interfere with campus operations. While some rules align with federal demands, others, such as allowing pre-approved overnight events, diverge from the administration's call for a total ban. University officials state the policies are "content neutral" and aim to balance free speech with campus safety and order.</p>

          <p>The "Pupusas and Punchlines" comedy show, held in a Los Angeles Salvadoran restaurant, provides a vital and welcoming venue for Latinx and other underrepresented comedians. Created by producer Justin Alexio, the show combines food and culture, allowing comics to perform for a supportive audience and joke about the immigrant experience. In a competitive L.A. scene where Latinx comics often struggle for bookings, the event has grown from a monthly show to a sold-out weekly staple. It fosters a sense of community for both performers and audience members who connect over shared food and experiences.</p>

          <p>Estonia has requested an urgent NATO consultation under Article 4 after three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets violated its airspace for 12 minutes over the Gulf of Finland. The Estonian government condemned the incursion as "brazen," and NATO confirmed its jets intercepted the Russian aircraft in what it called "reckless Russian behaviour." This is the second time in a week a NATO member has invoked Article 4, following a similar incident with Russian drones in Poland. The event has heightened tensions along NATO's eastern flank, with EU officials calling it a dangerous provocation.</p>
