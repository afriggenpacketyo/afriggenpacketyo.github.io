          <p>Two women were found dead in a pool within Eryri National Park, also known as Snowdonia, in Wales. North Wales Police responded to the incident in Nant Gwynant, Gwynedd, after receiving a report about a woman in the water on the Watkin Path, a popular route to the summit of Yr Wyddfa. A second woman was later pulled from the water but was pronounced dead at the scene, prompting an ongoing investigation. Authorities are urging potential witnesses to come forward, and the thoughts and sympathies of Det Ch Insp Andy Gibson are with the families and friends of both women. </p>

          <p>Israel initiated a series of strikes against Iran, targeting nuclear facilities, scientists, and senior military commanders, leading to a state of emergency declaration by Defense Minister Israel Katz. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched "Operation Rising Lion" with airstrikes aimed at diminishing Iran's nuclear capabilities and eliminating key figures in the Iranian regime. Iran retaliated by launching over 100 drones at Israel, triggering air raid sirens in Tel Aviv, but Israel intercepted many of the UAVs. The United States stated it had no involvement in the Israeli strikes, and NATO chief Mark Rutte urged de-escalation while asserting that a nuclear clash was "not close."</p>

          <p>Liverpool Football Club has reportedly reached an agreement to sign German attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen for a fee of Â£116 million.

          <p>Authorities are investigating the Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner crash that occurred minutes after takeoff from Ahmedabad, resulting in at least 241 fatalities on board and several casualties on the ground. The charred remains of passengers are complicating identification efforts, necessitating DNA testing. Investigators are exploring potential causes, including a loss or reduction in engine thrust, while searching for the aircraft's black boxes, with initial reports suggesting one may have been recovered. The lone survivor, Vishwaskumar Ramesh, reported hearing an unusual noise immediately after takeoff followed by a sudden descent, according to his account.</p>

          <p>Israel's recent military operation against Iran marks a significant escalation compared to previous engagements, targeting not only missile bases but also key members of Iran's leadership. The attack, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicated could continue for days, has reportedly eliminated high-ranking military officials and nuclear scientists. This strategy mirrors tactics used against Hezbollah in Lebanon, aiming to cripple Iran's ability to mount a sustainable counter-offensive. The extent of the damage inflicted on Iran's elite is expected to necessitate a stronger response than seen in previous attacks, potentially straining Tehran's capacity to do so.</p>

          <p>China's central bank has set the yuan's daily fixing rate against the US dollar at its strongest level in over two months, reflecting the dollar's recent decline. The People's Bank of China fixed the midpoint rate at 7.1772 per US dollar, the highest since late March, as the US dollar index fell to a three-year low. This decline follows lower-than-expected producer price index data in the US, leading to increased expectations of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Concerns over US tariff policy and debt levels have also contributed to the dollar's weakness, bolstering the yuan's relative strength. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Economists assert that the recent decline in white-collar job openings is primarily due to structural economic issues rather than the displacement of workers by artificial intelligence. Despite a decrease in hiring within professional and business services, sectors like healthcare, construction, and manufacturing are experiencing job growth. Experts emphasize that AI technology is still in its early stages and requires human intervention to execute key skills effectively. While acknowledging the potential for future transformation, economists suggest that the current decline is more closely tied to broader economic factors than to AI-driven disruption.</p>

          <p>An appeals court has temporarily halted a lower court's order compelling President Donald Trump to return control of National Guard troops to California Governor Gavin Newsom. The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals issued the stay following an appeal by the Trump administration, scheduling a hearing on the matter for the following Tuesday. Previously, Judge Charles Breyer ruled that the deployment of the Guard exceeded Trump's authority and was against the law, prompting Governor Newsom to seek an emergency motion to block the troops during anti-immigration protests in Los Angeles.

The Strait of Hormuz sees approximately 20 million barrels of oil and oil products pass through daily, accounting for nearly one-fifth of global oil shipments. Experts argue that impeding oil passage would not benefit Iran, especially since Iranian oil infrastructure has not been directly targeted. Moreover, such action could provoke further retaliation and draw backlash from China, Iran's largest oil customer, which relies on stable oil flows and prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Millions of Americans enrolled in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace could face significant premium increases next year as extra subsidies put in place during the pandemic are set to expire. Without these enhanced subsidies, ACA insurance premiums could rise by more than 75% on average, potentially leaving many unable to afford coverage. Low-income enrollees would experience the largest percentage increases, while middle-income enrollees could lose eligibility for subsidies altogether. Experts warn that allowing the enhanced subsidies to expire would increase the number of uninsured Americans and disproportionately affect Hispanic and Black communities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A document from the Department of Health and Human Services, sent to lawmakers to support Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s decision to change U.S. policy on COVID vaccines, has been criticized for citing unpublished or disputed studies and mischaracterizing others. Health experts have labeled the document "willful medical disinformation" regarding the safety of COVID vaccines for children and pregnant women. Kennedy's announcement that the CDC would no longer recommend COVID vaccines for pregnant women or healthy children bypassed the agency's formal process, sparking outrage among pediatricians and scientists. Medical experts who reviewed the citations in the FAQ said it distorts some legitimate studies and cites others that are disputed and unpublished.</p>

Concerns around mental health and financial worries are key issues for young men, according to a recent report by the Speaking with American Men (SAM) project. Democrats are exploring online spaces like YouTube, Reddit, and Discord to engage with young men, and some are appearing on podcasts and other new media platforms to connect with this demographic authentically.</p>

          <p>A Zambian pastor's frantic search for HIV medication for a 9-year-old AIDS orphan named Diana Lungu highlights the impact of frozen foreign aid on vulnerable populations. Diana's access to medication and food packages, previously provided by the U.S.-funded PEPFAR program, was disrupted following President Trump's executive order freezing foreign aid. This has led to concerns about the well-being of millions of AIDS orphans and vulnerable children who rely on PEPFAR for essential support. The situation evokes the pastor's personal experience with his twin sister's death from AIDS, underscoring the urgency of ensuring continued access to lifesaving treatment and care.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s decision to dismiss all 17 members of the CDC's vaccine advisory panel (ACIP) and replace them with individuals, some of whom have criticized government policies on school closures, lockdowns, and mRNA vaccines, has raised concerns among immunization and infectious disease specialists. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices plays a crucial role in determining vaccine recommendations, insurance coverage, and access for low-income children.

Following the initial strikes, Israel reported conducting a large-scale strike against Iranian air defenses, and both countries closed their airspace to civilian traffic.
