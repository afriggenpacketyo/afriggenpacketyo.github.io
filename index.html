          <p>Storm Amy has impacted the UK with severe weather, including heavy rain and wind gusts up to 96mph. The storm has caused significant power outages, affecting tens of thousands of homes in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and led to the closure of London's royal parks for safety. A man in his 40s died in a weather-related incident in the Republic of Ireland, and extensive travel disruptions, including suspended rail services, have been reported. The storm also set a new record for the lowest atmospheric pressure recorded in the UK for October.</p>

          <p>Israeli military strikes have reportedly continued in Gaza City and other areas, resulting in several fatalities, even as diplomatic efforts for a ceasefire progress. Hamas's ally, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, has endorsed key elements of a peace plan proposed by US President Donald Trump, which Hamas had also partially accepted. Despite this, the Israeli military has described Gaza City as a "dangerous combat zone" and warned residents against returning. The main Israeli group representing hostage families has urged Prime Minister Netanyahu to immediately begin negotiations to end the war.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reportedly ordered the Israel Defense Forces to cease all offensive operations in the Gaza Strip, permitting only defensive actions. This move aligns with a peace plan proposed by US President Donald Trump, which has also received support from the World Health Organization. According to sources, getting all hostages out of Gaza is a top priority for Israel, which is preparing to send a negotiating team to advance the ceasefire talks. The IDF continues to warn Gaza residents that the northern part of the strip remains a dangerous combat zone.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has called on organizers to reconsider planned pro-Palestinian protests, citing the "distress" they could cause following a recent synagogue attack. He urged demonstrators to "respect the grief of British Jews," a sentiment echoed by the Home Secretary and the Met Police Commissioner, who also raised concerns about stretched police resources. Protest group Defend Our Juries has stated its intention to proceed with the march, arguing that "cancelling peaceful protests lets terror win" and that participants would show respect for those affected by the attack.

          <p>A federal budget expert suggests that two critical deadlines could intensify pressure on Congress to resolve the ongoing government shutdown. The first is October 10, when essential federal workers are scheduled to miss a paycheck, followed by October 15, the payday for military service members. The article notes that neither political party wants to be blamed for these groups going unpaid, making these dates pivotal. The shutdown began after Democrats rejected a temporary spending bill, demanding extensions for Affordable Care Act tax credits, a provision Republicans opposed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Election Commission (FEC) is at a standstill after the resignation of another commissioner has left it with only two members, far short of the four required for a quorum. This paralysis prevents the agency from issuing penalties, starting or concluding investigations, or making any policy decisions regarding campaign finance laws. While core functions like maintaining the public database of campaign finances continue, experts warn that the absence of enforcement creates a "no cop on the beat" scenario for the upcoming elections. This is the third time in the last decade the FEC has lost its quorum, raising concerns about the regulation of money in politics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An 81-year-old Manchester United season ticket holder, who has sat in the same seat since 1980, describes his frustration after being relocated to make way for a corporate zone. Michael Carney's new seat is not as good, and due to a cut in pensioner discounts, the price has doubled from £420 to £840. The move is part of minority shareholder Sir Jim Ratcliffe's strategy to increase revenues and cut the club's significant financial losses. The fan expresses a feeling that the club's "soul" is gone, replaced by a purely business-oriented approach that prioritizes corporate clients over long-standing supporters.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury is reportedly considering a proposal to mint a new one-dollar coin featuring an image of President Donald Trump to commemorate the nation's 250th anniversary in 2026. A draft design shows Trump's face on one side and a depiction of him after his 2024 near-assassination on the other, engraved with the words "Fight, Fight, Fight." The move is potentially enabled by a 2020 law signed by Trump, but it could face legal hurdles, as U.S. law generally prohibits living persons from appearing on currency. A Treasury spokesperson confirmed a final design has not been selected but praised the draft for reflecting the nation's enduring spirit.</p>

          <p>A new study by Italian researchers proposes that the iconic bronze statue of the winged Lion of St. Mark in Venice may have originated as a tomb guardian in Tang dynasty China. The research, published in the journal Antiquity, points to stylistic similarities with Chinese mythical beasts and uses lead isotope testing to trace the copper to ore sources in the Lower Yangtze River basin. The researchers speculate that the 2.8-tonne statue could have been transported to Venice by the father and uncle of explorer Marco Polo before being altered. This theory challenges the long-held beliefs about the origins of one of Venice's most important symbols.</p>

The film, directed by Benny Safdie, has been a passion project for Johnson and represents a second chance at notoriety for Kerr, who has been sober since 2018 and is actively involved in the film's promotion.</p>

The UK government is attempting to encourage investment through price guarantees, but challenges remain, including Shell's decision to halt a major biofuel plant and potential US policy changes.

          <p>Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is seeing a notable rise in support, particularly among "Russia Germans"—ethnic Germans who resettled from the former Soviet Union. A recent study indicates that 31% of this group is prepared to vote for the AfD, a figure significantly higher than the party's average among all voters with a migrant background. This trend was evident in recent municipal elections where the AfD dominated integration councils in cities with large Russia German populations. The party's success is attributed to its direct outreach, its Russia-friendly stance, and its alignment with the group's stricter views on citizenship and culture.</p>

          <p>With Sunderland returning to the Premier League, many are recalling the 1998 BBC documentary "Premier Passions," which gave viewers an unprecedented, raw look into the club's dramatic 1996-97 season. The series famously captured manager Peter Reid's expletive-filled team talks and documented the club's move from its historic Roker Park to the new Stadium of Light. The fly-on-the-wall production offered a candid view of the pressures of top-flight football and the commercial transformation of the game. Despite ending in relegation, the series is remembered fondly for its honesty and for helping to grow the club's profile and fanbase.</p>

          <h2>Decline in Mooncake Sales Signals Weakening Consumer Spending in China</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-04 02:00:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Early sales figures for mooncakes, a traditional food exchanged during China's Mid-Autumn Festival, are softer than in previous years, indicating continued weakness in the country's domestic consumer demand. The practice of gifting these pastries is often seen as a barometer for consumer and corporate sentiment. One administrative manager reported her firm's budget for employee mooncake gifts was cut by 40% this year due to a sluggish business environment and recent layoffs. This trend in a non-essential but culturally significant item suggests that Chinese consumers are cutting back on discretionary spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is offering a one-time payment of $2,500 to unaccompanied migrant children aged 14 and older if they agree to be voluntarily deported to their home countries. According to a letter from the Department of Homeland Security, the stipend is intended as "resettlement support" and would be provided after an immigration judge grants the request and the individual arrives in their country of origin. The program, funded by an allocation for voluntary deportations, has been criticized by rights advocates as a "cruel tactic" that could pressure vulnerable children into making decisions against their long-term safety.</p>

          <p>The first supermoon of 2025, known as the Harvest Moon, is set to appear on the night of October 7th. This event will kick off a series of three straight supermoons, with the next two occurring in November and December. A supermoon occurs when a full moon coincides with its closest point to Earth in its elliptical orbit, making it appear up to 14% larger and 30% brighter than other full moons. This year's Harvest Moon is the one closest to the autumn equinox, providing extra evening light.</p>

          <p>A new defense pact between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan is raising questions about nuclear proliferation and creating a strategic dilemma for China. A senior Saudi official stated the agreement would "encompass all military means," suggesting it could place Saudi Arabia under Pakistan's nuclear umbrella. This development poses a challenge for China, which maintains strong ties with both nations and has a civilian nuclear partnership with Riyadh. Analysts believe Beijing will be hesitant to see this partnership expand into military applications to avoid provoking the U.S. or appearing to encourage the spread of nuclear weapons.</p>
