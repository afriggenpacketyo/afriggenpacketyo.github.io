            <p>Donald Trump's ambitious plans to expand AI infrastructure in the US could face significant delays due to proposed legislation in Texas that imposes new regulatory hurdles on data centers. The Texas legislation, SB6, introduces measures including a six-month review process, potentially extending approval times to 24 months and increasing construction costs. This could lead tech companies to scale back data center construction in Texas, potentially hampering Trump's AI initiative. While Texas aims to protect its power grid, critics argue these mandates risk stifling investment in crucial AI infrastructure.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>An article in The Atlantic sparked debate on the left regarding pronatalism, the belief that encouraging higher birthrates is a societal good. Pronatalism is motivated by declining birthrates, particularly in countries like South Korea, and has been promoted by figures like Elon Musk and Viktor Orbán. Some advocates argue that progressive politics require higher birthrates to ensure future generations care about the environment. However, critics argue that pronatalism often carries ethnonationalist undertones, focusing on the "right kind of people" rather than embracing migration and diversity.</p>

            <p>An amphibious boat, dubbed Rosie, is bringing Bond-style glamour to the RSPB's conservation efforts on Coquet Island in Northumberland. The boat will help wardens access the island more easily, as there is no safe mooring point or harbor at low tide, which has made transporting people and equipment difficult. The boat is named after an RSPB supporter who helped fund the project, and also after the roseate terns that the island is known for, and it will be used to manage the island's nature reserve.

            <p>Robert F Kennedy Jr, the secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), is facing increasing pressure to release nearly $400 million in congressionally allocated funds for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). The funds are meant to help low-income families with air conditioning costs during the summer. The delay stems from the Trump administration's elimination of the division overseeing the program, resulting in the firing of its staff. Advocates warn that failure to release the funds could leave vulnerable households at risk of utility shutoffs during expected record-breaking heat waves.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court is set to hear Mahmoud v. Taylor, a case that could extend policies similar to Florida's "Don't Say Gay" law to public schools across the US.

Critics argue that granting this request would impose burdensome obligations on teachers, potentially hindering discussions on LGBTQ topics.

            <p>Senators Lisa Murkowski and Jon Ossoff have issued a bipartisan rebuke of the White House's decision to end legal aid for unaccompanied minors. They argue that terminating the contract puts children at risk of trafficking and exploitation, and harms any hope of a fair legal process. The senators raised concerns that ending the legal funding would violate the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, which requires HHS to ensure that all unaccompanied children have counsel to represent them in legal proceedings. The administration has agreed to extend the contract for six more months to wind down programmatic work and find new representation for the children.</p>

            <h2>Debate Surrounds Safety of 'Chlorinated Chicken' in Europe</h2>

            <p>Europeans have long been wary of American poultry, often referring to it as "chlorinated chicken" due to the use of chlorine rinses during processing. While the practice is less common in the U.S. today, the debate persists over whether chemical treatments mask subpar food safety practices. European regulators believe that disinfecting poultry with chemicals is a way to cover up a lack of adequate hygiene. Both regions have high rates of infection from Salmonella and Campylobacter, and research suggests neither approach is entirely effective at eliminating the risk.</p>

            <p>British Steel's blast furnaces are set to continue running with a delivery of raw materials from the US, enough to keep them lit for the "coming weeks". The government has seized control of the business following a breakdown in talks with its Chinese owner, Jingye, amid accusations it was planning to switch the furnaces off. Industry minister Sarah Jones said the government had reached "a steady state" in terms of how the blast furnaces will be operated, and hopes to bring in a private sector partner as part of the future of Scunthorpe. The government has appointed two long-standing British Steel employees to run the plant on an interim basis.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump has blamed Volodymyr Zelensky for starting the war with Russia, a day after a massive Russian attack killed 35 people and injured 117 others in Ukraine. Trump said the Ukrainian leader shared the blame with Russian President Vladimir Putin for "millions of people dead" in the Ukraine war. He also blamed former US President Joe Biden for the conflict. Trump has repeatedly clashed with Zelensky since he returned to office this year, and has previously appeared to blame Ukraine for starting the war.</p>

Columbus stated that Trump's cameo was a condition for filming inside New York's Plaza hotel, which Trump owned at the time.

            <p>Chinese semiconductor traders are feeling the pinch of tariffs, with orders plummeting and prices increasing significantly. A chip distributor in Huaqiangbei, Shenzhen, reported a sharp decline in orders due to price increases of 10 to 40 percent for common CPUs. The US-China trade war has resulted in a cumulative tariff rate of about 156 percent on US imports into China, with Beijing retaliating with 125 percent levies on US goods. This has created challenges for chip traders who primarily source from the US and serve domestic buyers.</p>

            <p>NPR's reporting on a whistleblower report details how the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), effectively led by Elon Musk, may have accessed sensitive data from the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). DOGE appeared to ignore standard security practices, and the NLRB's data is highly sensitive and unrelated to DOGE's cost-cutting mission. There are also concerns about conflicts of interest, as Musk's businesses are subject to NLRB investigations. Labor experts fear the release of this data could harm organized labor, and DOGE has a history of seeking sensitive data without protecting it.</p>

            <p>As special education students are increasingly integrated into general education classrooms, teacher training programs are evolving to equip educators with the necessary skills. Many universities are infusing inclusive practices throughout their teacher preparation programs, emphasizing Universal Design for Learning (UDL) to meet the diverse needs of students. Dual-licensure or "unified" degree programs, which prepare teachers to work in both general education and special education classrooms, are also becoming more common. These changes aim to create more confident and capable teachers who can effectively support all students.</p>

            <p>A U.S. Justice Department investigation into the hacking of prominent American climate activists has revealed a connection between the company allegedly commissioning the attacks and some of the victims. Public tax filings show that DCI Group, a lobbying firm working for ExxonMobil, was also consulting for New Venture Fund, a nonprofit supporting progressive causes. During this period, a senior advisor at New Venture Fund was working with climate activists targeted by the hacking operation. The Justice Department's investigation has focused on Amit Forlit, an Israeli private investigator, for allegedly orchestrating the hacking to gather information against lawsuits targeting the fossil fuel industry.</p>
