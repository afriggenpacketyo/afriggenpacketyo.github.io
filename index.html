          <p>President Trump's travel ban is creating new hardships for individuals in war-torn nations like Afghanistan and Myanmar, diminishing their hopes of seeking sanctuary in the United States. The order impacts people already facing immense challenges due to conflict and instability in their home countries, further limiting their options for safety and refuge. The ban adds another layer of difficulty for those attempting to escape violence and persecution, complicating their journey to find a more secure life. This policy shift highlights the challenges faced by vulnerable populations seeking asylum and the impact of geopolitical decisions on their prospects for resettlement.</p>

Despite the initial enthusiasm, questions linger about the Switch 2's ability to match its predecessor's success, particularly due to higher game prices.

          <p>The New Zealand Parliament has suspended three lawmakers for performing a haka, a traditional Maori dance, during a debate on Indigenous rights. Two members were suspended for 21 days, and one for seven days, marking the longest suspensions in New Zealand's parliamentary history. The incident occurred during the reading of a controversial bill rewriting a treaty between the British crown and Maori leaders.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent efforts by FEMA to address long-standing inequities in disaster relief are at risk due to the Trump administration's program cuts and staff reductions. Under the Biden administration, FEMA took steps to simplify application forms and provide immediate assistance to vulnerable populations. However, the Trump administration has canceled some of these initiatives, raising concerns about the agency's ability to serve all Americans adequately after disasters. Experts warn that the rollback of equity programs could disproportionately affect poor people, racial minorities, and those in rural and tribal areas.</p>

The Department for Education has allocated Â£1 billion to fund the initiative until 2029, and Prime Minister Starmer emphasized that feeding more children is a significant intervention to alleviate poverty and support children's learning.

          <p>Divorce lawyers report a seasonal pattern in filings, with peaks in late summer and early spring, according to family law attorney Kirk Stange. This trend is attributed to families delaying divorce proceedings until after holidays and vacations. A University of Washington study supports this, finding divorce filings consistently peak in March and August, driven by a "domestic ritual" calendar. While some attribute this to sentimental reasons, others point to tax returns and the end of summer vacations as factors, with a growing trend of "gray divorces" among those over 50.</p>

          <p>Maryland is failing to protect young inmates in adult jails, with minors spending up to 23 hours a day in isolation and facing risks of sexual assault. The state violates federal standards more frequently than any other, leading to a loss of federal funds. Minors describe sharing cells with adults, experiencing threats, and fearing sexual assault. Despite these issues, legislation to prohibit minors from being held in adult jails has failed to advance, highlighting the ongoing challenges in addressing this problem.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new travel ban includes an exemption for athletes, coaches, and immediate relatives traveling for the World Cup, Olympics, or other major sporting events. The ban restricts travel from 12 countries and partially restricts travel from seven others. However, it remains unclear whether the exemption applies to both the 2026 World Cup and the 2025 Club World Cup. The ban's impact on US-based players who play internationally for affected countries is also uncertain.</p>

          <h2>Women Warned About Weight-Loss Jabs Affecting Contraception</h2>

          <p>The UK's medicines regulator has warned women using weight-loss injections like Wegovy and Mounjaro to use effective contraception. There are concerns that these medicines may harm unborn babies and reduce the effectiveness of the contraceptive pill, especially in overweight or obese women. The MHRA advises women to use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a period afterward before trying to become pregnant. The agency also urges women to consult with their healthcare providers about the risks and benefits of these drugs.</p>

          <p>Three unexploded U.S. bombs from World War II were defused in Cologne, Germany, after the city's largest evacuation since the end of the war. More than 20,000 residents were evacuated from the city center following the discovery of the bombs during road construction. Experts successfully defused the bombs within an hour, and the evacuations included homes, hotels, schools, a hospital, nursing homes, museums, and office buildings. Unexploded bombs from wartime air raids are frequently found in Germany, requiring large-scale precautionary evacuations.</p>
