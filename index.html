        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report indicates that the U.S.-China trade war significantly disrupted global supply chains, pushing them near a breaking point before the recent trade truce. The GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index showed a steep decline in manufacturing activity in North America and Asia due to tariffs, leading to aggressive stockpiling by U.S. companies. While the tariff pause provides some relief, manufacturers remain anxious about long-term risks associated with China. The Port of Virginia is positioning itself for potential growth from Southeast Asia and Europe as supply chains diversify. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UnitedHealth Group's CEO, Andrew Witty, has unexpectedly stepped down for personal reasons, leading the company to suspend its 2025 forecast. Stephen Hemsley, former CEO, will succeed Witty. The company's decision to pull guidance is partly attributed to higher medical costs, impacting other insurance stocks as well.

          <p>The annual inflation rate in the U.S. fell to 2.3% in April, the lowest since February 2021, according to a Labor Department report. The consumer price index rose 0.2% for the month, slightly below expectations, with shelter prices being the main driver of the increase. Economists suggest that the impact of President Trump's tariffs is yet to be fully felt, as importers may have absorbed some costs initially.

          <p>The U.S. and China have agreed to a 90-day tariff truce, providing temporary relief to businesses but prolonging economic uncertainty. The U.S. will reduce its maximum tariff rate on Chinese imports to 30%, while China will lower its tariff on American goods to 10%. Experts caution that a long-term trade deal remains challenging, and the reduced tariff rate could still lead to price increases for consumers.

          <p>Despite a slight cooling of U.S. inflation in April, economists and policymakers are anticipating a resurgence due to companies adapting to President Trump's trade war. The Consumer Price Index rose 2.3% annually, but economists predict prices will accelerate as import taxes take effect. The Trump administration has agreed to temporarily reduce tariffs with China, but economists warn that tariffs still in place will stoke inflation and dent growth.

          <p>A fossil discovered nearly three decades ago in Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, has been identified as a new genus and species of pterosaur, named Nipponopterus mifunensis. This is the first pterosaur to be formally named as a distinct species based on a fossil found in Japan. The cervical vertebra fossil, dating back to the Late Cretaceous Period, is expected to provide insights into the evolutionary process of pterosaurs. The research was a collaboration between the Mifune Dinosaur Museum, Kumamoto University, and Hokkaido University.</p>

          <p>Consumer prices in the U.S. rose 2.3% in April compared to a year ago, slightly cooling from the previous month, defying fears of an inflation surge following President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs. While egg prices fell, gasoline prices dropped significantly over the past year. Economists anticipate a potential rekindling of inflation as retailers replenish inventory with goods imported after the tariffs took effect, though a rollback of some levies may soften the impact. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that Trump's tariff policy could cause higher inflation and an economic slowdown.</p>
