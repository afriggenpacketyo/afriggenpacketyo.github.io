          <p>China's Ministry of Transport projects a record-breaking 2.4 billion trips during the eight-day "Golden Week" holiday, a significant increase from the previous year. To accommodate the surge in travelers, railway operators have added nearly 1,900 extra trains, with popular routes like Shenzhen-Guangzhou and Shanghai-Beijing seeing high demand. This travel boom, fueled by both rail and electric vehicle traffic, signals a strong rebound in domestic tourism and consumer activity within the country.</p>

          <p>Kemi Badenoch, leader of the UK's Conservative party, is set to announce a new economic "golden rule" aimed at cutting government borrowing and taxes. The proposal dictates that half of all savings from government efficiencies would be used to reduce the national deficit, while the other half would fund economy-growing policies like tax cuts. Badenoch will frame this as a fiscally responsible plan to restore economic stability, contrasting it with the Labour government's approach which she will label a "borrowing and tax doom loop."

          <p>The Jolly Roger flag from the popular Japanese manga "One Piece" has become a significant symbol of resistance for youth-led protest movements around the world. The flag, representing the series' freedom-seeking protagonists, has been prominently displayed in anti-corruption and pro-democracy demonstrations in countries like Nepal, Indonesia, and Madagascar. Experts note that for Gen Z, which grew up immersed in popular culture, such symbols serve as a powerful and unifying tool to communicate shared ideals against oppressive or corrupt authorities.</p>

          <p>The recent resignation of French Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu after just 27 days has intensified concerns over France's fiscal instability, particularly its high national debt and budget deficit. As the euro zone's second-largest economy, France has repeatedly failed to meet EU rules limiting deficits to 3% and debt to 60% of GDP, with current figures at 5.8% and 113% respectively. The political deadlock in Paris makes it highly unlikely that the necessary fiscal consolidation measures can be implemented, leading economists to forecast continued budget slippage.

          <p>Tropical Storm Jerry has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean, marking the tenth named storm of the current hurricane season. The system is currently far from land but is tracking west-northwest and is expected to strengthen into a hurricane within a day or two. While not projected to make landfall, Jerry is forecast to pass near or north of the northern Leeward Islands, prompting tropical storm watches for several Caribbean islands due to the risk of heavy rain, flash flooding, and life-threatening surf conditions.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla has intensified into a Category 2 storm off the western coast of Mexico, with its outer bands already affecting the Baja California Sur peninsula. The storm is expected to bring heavy rainfall and gusty winds to the region, prompting a tropical storm watch for the area from Cabo San Lucas to Cabo San Lazaro. Forecasters predict the storm will move parallel to the coast while remaining offshore, but it will still generate dangerous swells and a risk of flash flooding before moisture from the system potentially impacts the U.S. Desert Southwest later in the week.</p>

          <h2>Dodgers Manager Explains Cautious Use of Reliever Roki Sasaki in Playoff Game</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts has clarified his decision-making regarding the use of star rookie reliever Roki Sasaki, confirming he is the primary closing pitcher but will be managed carefully. Roberts initially used a different pitcher in a key save situation to give Sasaki rest, a plan that nearly failed, forcing Sasaki to enter the game anyway to secure the final out. The team remains conscientious about the 23-year-old's workload, as he has never pitched in a relief role before this season, creating a delicate balance between leveraging his talent and preventing injury.</p>

          <p>Charlie Mackesy, the celebrated author and illustrator of "The Boy, The Mole, The Fox and the Horse," has revealed that his new book was significantly delayed after his iPad, containing many drawings and ideas, was stolen. The theft forced him to recreate much of the work from memory, a setback compounded by the personal grief of losing his mother and his dog, who inspired one of the book's characters. Despite these challenges, Mackesy completed his new book, "Always Remember," continuing the journey of his beloved characters.</p>

          <p>Residents of a Portland, Oregon, apartment complex located opposite a federal ICE facility describe living in a "war zone" due to months of nightly clashes between protesters and federal agents. The situation has drawn national attention, with President Trump threatening to deploy the National Guard, a move currently blocked by a federal judge. While some residents blame agitators for the violence, others, including the city's mayor, accuse federal agents of inflaming an otherwise peaceful situation, leaving the community caught in the middle of a tense political standoff.</p>
