          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs became emotional and sobbed in court during his sentencing hearing for transportation to engage in prostitution, as his defense team presented a video highlighting his community service and family life. His lawyers argued he has "untreated trauma" from poverty and a severe drug addiction, emphasizing his reform and the reputational damage already incurred. Prosecutors, however, requested an 11-year sentence, citing his "unrepentant" actions, while Combs' ex-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, expressed fear of retaliation. The article details the emotional pleas from his children and the atypical length and content of the defense's presentation.</p>

          <p>Storm Amy is causing significant disruption across the UK, with recorded wind gusts up to 102mph and heavy rain, leading to an Amber weather alert for parts of Northern Ireland and Scotland. The severe weather has resulted in power cuts for approximately 50,000 properties, widespread flight and train cancellations, and school closures. A derelict building collapsed in Glasgow, and a train carrying passengers hit a tree in Aberdeenshire, though no injuries were reported. Authorities are urging caution and advising travelers to check services, as transport networks face severe and substantial impacts.</p>

          <p>The Senate once again failed to pass government funding bills, ensuring the federal shutdown will likely continue into next week due to an impasse between parties. Senate Majority Leader John Thune insists on a "clean" funding resolution, while Minority Leader Schumer blames Republicans for threatening healthcare provisions. Both GOP-backed and Democrat-proposed bills failed, with no votes changing since previous attempts. Congressional leaders remain unwilling to negotiate on the Affordable Care Act tax credits until the government reopens, prolonging the fiscal gridlock.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to reduce US forces in Syria and Iraq is raising alarms among security experts who fear it will create a power vacuum, benefiting Iran's expanding influence. Iran has cultivated a deeply embedded military, political, and economic presence in the region for decades, utilizing Shia militant forces to establish a "parallel military infrastructure." Experts warn that without a unified government in Syria or a strong bulwark against Iranian influence, Tehran is well-positioned to further its regional interests. The article suggests the US has historically underestimated the threat posed by Iran's long-term, patient strategy to counter Washington's presence.</p>

          <p>George Michael's estate publicly thanked Taylor Swift for incorporating his 1987 song "Father Figure" into her new album, "The Life of a Showgirl," praising the association between the two artists. Swift's track reportedly explores a relationship between a mentor and protégé, leading fans to speculate about its inspiration, possibly referencing her former music executive, Scott Borchetta. The lyrics hint at themes of being "lost in the cold" and turning "rags to gold," then later a shift to conflict, suggesting a narrative mirroring her past professional disputes. The article invites speculation on the song's autobiographical nature.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration froze $2.1 billion in Department of Transportation funding for two major Chicago transit projects, including the Red Line Extension. The DOT cited concerns over "unconstitutional practices" related to race and gender in contracting, blaming congressional Democrats for the federal shutdown's impact on review capabilities. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson condemned the move as political, arguing it harms the local economy and essential public transit. This action follows similar freezes in New York and other Democratic-led states, intensifying political tensions during the shutdown.</p>

          <p>Two men, Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz, were killed in a car-ramming and stabbing attack outside a Manchester synagogue on Yom Kippur, with one victim potentially hit by police gunfire targeting the attacker. The suspect, Jihad Al-Shamie, 35, was fatally shot by police and was reportedly on bail for alleged sexual assault. Worshippers and security staff bravely prevented the attacker from entering the synagogue, with the victims hailed as heroes. The incident is being treated as a terrorist act, prompting widespread condemnation and increased police presence.</p>

          <p>A satirical bronze-painted statue depicting President Trump skipping hand-in-hand with Jeffrey Epstein, titled "Why Can't We Be Friends?," has reappeared on the National Mall after its abrupt removal last week. The Secret Handshake group, responsible for the statue, had obtained a permit, but it was removed by Park Police for alleged non-compliance, then recovered in pieces. The statue, celebrating a "long-lasting bond," challenges Trump's attempts to downplay his friendship with the convicted sex offender. Its return highlights ongoing political commentary and public pressure for the release of "Epstein files."</p>

          <p>American book banning efforts are intensifying, moving beyond traditional objections to sexual content to target broader viewpoints, including LGBTQ themes and challenging historical narratives. The article notes that while books like Judy Blume's "Forever" faced censorship decades ago, today's social media amplifies challenges, leading to rapid bans of works like Maia Kobabe's "Gender Queer." Critics argue that vague definitions of "obscene" or "inappropriate" allow for deliberate efforts to remove books deemed to have "wrong viewpoints." This trend reflects a concerning shift in censorship, impacting educational institutions and access to diverse literature.</p>

          <p>Congressional Republicans and the White House falsely claim that Democrats caused the federal government shutdown by demanding healthcare for undocumented immigrants. Experts confirm that undocumented individuals are already barred from Medicaid and Affordable Care Act exchanges, making the GOP's assertion a distortion. The standoff is actually rooted in Democratic demands to extend ACA subsidies and reverse Medicaid cuts, which the Trump administration's "One Big Beautiful Bill" aims to reduce. This article highlights how complex issues are simplified for political gain, obscuring the true reasons behind the shutdown.</p>

The video, which circulated on social media, claimed these "magical" medical beds could cure diseases and reverse aging. DW Fact Check identified several AI-generated inconsistencies in the footage, including distorted facial features and disproportionate objects. Experts dismiss MedBeds as a conspiracy myth originating from far-right communities and QAnon, highlighting how such deceptive content is used to mislead the public, particularly regarding healthcare policy.</p>

          <p>A Texas man, Raunaq Alam, was sentenced to six months in jail for spray-painting "Fuck Israel" on a church, after a judge overruled a jury's recommendation of community supervision. Prosecutors had added a hate crime enhancement, arguing the graffiti targeted a group by national origin/ancestry/religion, but the jury rejected this, finding him guilty only of criminal mischief. Alam's defense argued his statement was protected free speech. This high-profile case highlights ongoing debates about free speech, hate crimes, and the clampdown on pro-Palestinian protests in the US, particularly amid accusations of antisemitism in educational institutions.</p>
