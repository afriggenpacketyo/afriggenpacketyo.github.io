        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Berkshire Hathaway board has unanimously voted for Greg Abel to succeed Warren Buffett as CEO, effective January 1, 2026, while Buffett will continue as chairman. This decision, revealed at the annual shareholder meeting, aims to reassure investors amidst disappointing earnings due to insurance losses from wildfires and concerns about tariffs. Buffett, 94, will still assist with major acquisition opportunities, while Abel, 62, will oversee company operations and capital deployment. This succession plan provides stability as Berkshire Hathaway manages its substantial cash reserves in potentially volatile markets.</p>

          <p>U.S. crude oil futures experienced a decline after OPEC+ countries agreed to increase production in June, adding 411,000 barrels per day to the market. This decision, following a similar production surge in May, has raised concerns about an oversupplied market amidst fears of a recession triggered by U.S. tariffs. Service firms like Baker Hughes anticipate reduced investment in exploration and production due to the weak price environment, and oil majors Chevron and Exxon have reported lower earnings compared to the previous year. Goldman Sachs forecasts U.S. crude and Brent prices to average $59 and $63 per barrel this year.</p>

          <p>An article suggests that Donald Trump's policies, particularly his trade agenda, pose a risk to the long-term economic prosperity of Americans by potentially undermining the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency. The article explains that the dollar's reserve status keeps borrowing costs low for the U.S., and Trump's erratic trade policies have shaken global investors' confidence. The article argues that the decline in the dollar's value, despite tariffs that should have increased its value, indicates capital is fleeing the United States, potentially leading to higher interest rates and reduced living standards.

          <p>British counterterrorism police arrested seven Iranian nationals in two separate operations, with four men suspected of plotting a terrorist act and three others detained for a national security offense. The government described these operations as the most significant "counter-state threat and counterterrorism" efforts in recent years. MI5 has warned of increasing threats from attackers linked to Tehran, with at least 20 potential plots since 2022 targeting Iranian dissidents in the UK. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper emphasized the complexity of the challenges to national security and the importance of determining if the arrests are connected to the Iranian state.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on movies made in foreign countries, citing a need to revitalize the American movie industry and combat what he views as "messaging and propaganda." The proposal raises questions about its application to American production companies filming abroad and films on streaming services. Industry unions warn that the tariffs could severely harm the film industry, prompting concerns about potential retaliatory tariffs from other countries and the impact on global film production. It is unclear whether the proposals would affect films like Wicked, which was filmed in the UK but produced by an American studio.</p>

          <p>The Israeli security cabinet has approved a plan to expand its military offensive against Hamas by mobilizing tens of thousands of reservists. The goal is to intensify pressure on Hamas, secure the release of remaining hostages, and achieve operational superiority in Gaza. However, questions remain about how this strategy will differ from previous operations and whether it will lead to the end of hostilities. Concerns are growing about the impact on Palestinian civilians and the safety of Israeli hostages, with some officials suggesting a focus on negotiations rather than further military escalation.</p>

          <p>A mainland Chinese military magazine reports that China's developing sixth-generation fighter jet, unofficially called the J-36, could potentially block airspace up to 1,000km from the Chinese coast, including foreign bases in Guam. The article suggests this fighter could hinder U.S. naval and air force operations in the Western Pacific, particularly in a conflict over Taiwan. The development of the J-36 is seen as a response to perceived weaknesses against the American B-21 stealth bomber, with recent flight tests indicating rapid progress. The US also announced its sixth-generation fighter, the F-47, but has revealed little further detail.</p>

          <p>This article argues that Trump's tariffs are not solely based on economic theory but reflect a broader political vision of protecting a way of life. The author connects this protectionist spirit to the historical "spirits of capitalism" that have justified economic policies beyond mere profit. The article suggests that while Trump's tariffs aim to help those who lost out from globalization, they mask more sinister desires and fail to address underlying economic issues. The author advocates for a democratizing spirit that prioritizes collective well-being over protecting some at the expense of others.</p>

          <p>This article reviews Wally Lamb's novel, "The River Is Waiting," which follows a stay-at-home dad who is imprisoned for involuntary manslaughter after a tragic accident. The review critiques the protagonist's self-centeredness and the clichÃ©d portrayal of prison life. The reviewer finds that while the novel attempts to explore themes of guilt and redemption, it falls short due to a lack of authentic emotional depth and a satisfying resolution. The reviewer notes that Lamb has great sympathy for his character's plights, yet much of what occurs feels cliched, as does much of the language and dialogue.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the impact of Lewis Hine's early 20th-century photographs of child labor, which helped to pass laws protecting children, and contrasts it with today's media-saturated landscape where such images struggle to generate the same outrage.

          <p>Learning new languages physically alters the brain and enhances cognitive abilities, as neuroscientists say people who speak multiple languages process information differently than those who speak one language. Learning a new language is like working out your brain. As muscles get stronger with physical training, neural pathways in the brain reshape when you learn a new language. The Broca's area located in the frontal lobe is primarily responsible for syntax and helps construct grammatically correct sentences and understand sentence structure. Learning languages as a child is an advantage as children's brains are more adaptable to neural plasticity and learning.</p>
