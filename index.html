          <p>The Trump administration is sending 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to protests against immigration enforcement operations, which have seen clashes between demonstrators and authorities. President Trump signed a memorandum to address what the White House calls "lawlessness" in California. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the move as "purposefully inflammatory" and stated that it would only escalate tensions, asserting that local law enforcement already has the situation under control. The deployment raises legal questions under Title 10 of the U.S. Code, which allows the federalization of National Guard units, and there is precedent for such deployments during civil unrest and natural disasters.</p>

          <p>Italian voters are participating in a two-day referendum that could alter citizenship and labor laws, with results expected after polls close on Monday. The referendum, triggered by an NGO-led grassroots campaign, includes questions on reducing the time required for non-EU residents to apply for citizenship and increasing worker protections. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's right-wing coalition is urging supporters to abstain from voting, hoping to prevent the referendum from reaching the required 50% turnout threshold. Opinion polls suggest turnout will be low, and the outcome of the referendum remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Michelino Sunseri, a mountain runner, is facing federal charges for running a trail in Grand Tetons National Park that authorities secretly deemed off-limits. Despite the trail being well-worn and lacking clear signage, the National Park Service is prosecuting Sunseri, potentially subjecting him to fines, imprisonment, and a ban from the park. The author argues that this case exemplifies government overreach, where vague rules and hidden signs are used to prosecute individuals without clear intent to harm. This situation serves as a warning about the erosion of liberty and the growing divide between citizens and an out-of-touch bureaucracy.</p>

          <p>India is experiencing a resurgence in chess, becoming a global hub for the game with numerous grandmasters and young, top-ranked players. The country's men's and women's teams excelled at the Chess Olympiad, and Gukesh Dommaraju became the youngest-ever world champion at age 18. Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu, is considered the epicenter of Indian chess, fostering talent through grassroots training and supportive parents. The rise of chess in India is also attributed to the increasing opportunities for players to make a living from the game and the efforts to make chess education accessible in local languages.</p>

          <p>Tinder is testing a new feature that allows premium users to filter potential matches by height, sparking mixed reactions among daters. Some worry it may stifle connections, while others believe it could help shorter men find matches. Ashley, who is 5ft 1in, found love with her 5ft 6in partner Joe on Tinder and believes the filter could have prevented them from meeting. Experts note that such filters are common on dating apps, but Tinder's size gives the experiment significant weight in the dating world.</p>

          <p>Colombian senator and presidential hopeful Miguel Uribe Turbay was shot in the head at a BogotÃ¡ campaign event, raising concerns about a return to political violence. The politician's condition is critical after being attacked by a 15-year-old, leading to widespread condemnation and calls for greater protection for candidates. The incident highlights the deepening political polarization between the leftist government and the right-wing opposition. Comparisons are being drawn to a dark era of political violence in Colombia, with many observers noting similarities to the assassination of presidential candidate Luis Carlos GalÃ¡n in 1989.</p>

          <p>The article argues that institutions are engaging in "anticipatory compliance" by preemptively catering to Donald Trump's agenda, thus enabling autocracy. Examples include universities censoring course content, media outlets settling baseless lawsuits, and corporations reducing diversity programs. The author advocates for "anticipatory noncompliance," highlighting instances where institutions and individuals are pushing back against Trump's actions. These include colleges challenging demands, states contesting administration policies, and consumers boycotting companies that scale back diversity programs, ultimately urging citizens to resist authoritarianism through various tactics.</p>

          <p>The article argues that recent anti-Jewish attacks in the United States, such as the firebombing in Colorado and the shooting in Washington, D.C., inadvertently strengthen the Zionist cause. These acts of violence, perpetrated by individuals who see themselves as avengers against Zionism, raise the costs of being Jewish in America and remind Jews of the need for a safe haven. The author suggests that a rational anti-Zionist movement would focus on making Jews feel welcome outside of Israel, but instead, anti-Semites are proving the necessity of a Jewish state.</p>

          <p>A provision in President Trump's spending package, known as Section 899, is causing concern on Wall Street. The measure would impose a tax of up to 20% on foreign entities with U.S. investments if their home country levies "unfair foreign taxes" on U.S. companies. Some analysts fear this "revenge tax" could limit foreign investment in the U.S. and negatively impact the asset management industry. Experts are still assessing the potential impact of the provision as the Senate reviews the bill.</p>

          <p>A top state regulator is raising concerns about the rapid expansion of the US gambling industry, describing it as a "highway without speed limits." Jordan Maynard, chair of the Massachusetts gaming commission, is urging lawmakers to consider nationwide rules on advertising by betting firms and establish nationwide exclusion lists for problem gamblers. He believes that regulators need to balance the industry's growth with protections for patrons and citizens, as AI is transforming the gambling sector. Maynard hopes to foster a regulated market that prioritizes safety and responsible behavior.</p>
