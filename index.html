          <p>Manchester City was unexpectedly knocked out of the inaugural 32-team Club World Cup after a 4-3 extra-time loss to Al-Hilal in Orlando. Head coach Pep Guardiola lamented his team's lack of clinical finishing, as they failed to convert numerous opportunities throughout the match. The defeat was compounded by a significant setback for key midfielder Rodri, who suffered a recurring injury after being brought on as a substitute. Guardiola expressed his disappointment but acknowledged the quality of the Al-Hilal side, while his team now heads home to rest before the new season.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, the man accused of murdering four University of Idaho students in November 2022, has agreed to plead guilty to all charges. This plea deal will spare him the death penalty, resulting instead in four consecutive life sentences plus ten years for burglary, with no possibility of appeal. Prosecutors informed the victims' families of the agreement, stating it provides certainty and avoids a prolonged and painful trial.

          <p>A brutal surge in cartel violence in CuliacÃ¡n, the capital of Mexico's Sinaloa state, has resulted in at least 20 deaths within 24 hours. The gruesome discoveries included four decapitated bodies hanging from a highway bridge and another 16 bodies found in a nearby van. This violence stems from an escalating war for control between two factions of the Sinaloa Cartel, known as Los Chapitos and La Mayiza. The conflict has turned the city into an epicenter of violence, with daily killings and a pervasive sense of fear, leading officials to acknowledge the need to re-evaluate their security strategies.</p>

          <p>A 26-year-old former teacher at Oakside Prep Academy in Michigan, Jocelyn Sanroman, is facing charges for third-degree criminal sexual conduct. She is accused of engaging in a sexual relationship with a 16-year-old male student in 2023. The alleged relationship came to light after Sanroman reportedly confided in a coworker, who then reported the matter to the police. The Oakland County Prosecutor emphasized the severe breach of trust involved, noting that while a 16-year-old can legally consent, the power dynamic with a teacher makes such a relationship exploitative. If convicted, Sanroman could face up to 15 years in prison.</p>

          <p>California's fire season has started intensely, with over a dozen wildfires breaking out in a 72-hour period, primarily in Southern California. The largest blazes, the Wolf fire and Juniper fire in Riverside County, have burned thousands of acres and forced community evacuations. Another significant blaze, the Lake fire, is active in San Bernardino County. Fire officials warn that this is just the beginning of what is expected to be a challenging fire season due to dry conditions.

          <p>A coalition of more than 130 international charities, including Oxfam and Save the Children, is demanding the immediate closure of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The organizations argue the aid system, backed by Israel and the US, is unsafe and has led to the deaths of over 500 Palestinians seeking aid since it began in May. They claim Israeli forces and armed groups routinely fire on civilians at the four militarized distribution sites. The joint statement condemns the GHF for violating humanitarian norms and calls for it to be replaced by a United Nations-led system to address the severe hunger crisis.</p>

          <p>This opinion article explores the significant absence of France's colonial and slave-trading history in its national cinema, contrasting it with the prevalence of American films on the subject. The author notes that despite France having the second-largest colonial empire, French audiences often learn about slavery through Hollywood productions. The piece highlights recent, though marginalized, French films like "No Chains No Masters" and a biopic on Frantz Fanon that are beginning to address this historical blind spot. It argues that while these films are finding an audience, they remain on the periphery of a film industry not yet ready to fully confront these compelling narratives.</p>

The People's Bank of China has been setting a stronger daily reference rate, reflecting a less bearish outlook on China's domestic growth and resilient economic data. Concurrently, growing concerns about the sustainability of US government debt and fiscal policies are contributing to an expected depreciation of the dollar. Investment bank Goldman Sachs forecasts the yuan will strengthen past 7 per dollar within six months and reach 6.9 in a year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At a recent tech conference, panelists emphasized the need for emerging economies to develop "sovereign AI"â€”the ability to control their own AI technologies, data, and infrastructure. This approach counters the dominance of English-based models from companies like OpenAI, allowing nations to create systems tailored to their specific languages and cultures. Experts suggested that the ASEAN region is well-positioned for this, and that utilizing open-source AI models and accessible cloud computing services can democratize AI development. This strategy aims to foster local talent and ensure the economic benefits of AI are distributed more inclusively, rather than being concentrated in a few nations.</p>

          <p>A private survey has indicated that China's factory activity among export-oriented manufacturers unexpectedly grew in June, contrasting with official data that showed a third consecutive month of contraction. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI rose to 50.4, beating estimates and suggesting improving market conditions. This divergence is attributed to differences in survey timing and company coverage, with the Caixin survey potentially reflecting a delayed response to a mid-May U.S.-China tariff reduction. Despite the expansion in production, new export orders declined and employment remained weak, signaling potential headwinds for the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is conducting a marathon voting session, known as a "vote-a-rama," on former President Trump's major tax, border, and defense bill. Republicans are pushing to pass the legislation before a self-imposed July 4 deadline, while Democrats are using the procedure to force votes on numerous controversial amendments. The bill, which the CBO estimates will add $3.3 trillion to the deficit, advanced over the weekend despite some GOP opposition. The process highlights deep partisan divides as lawmakers debate significant cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs to offset new spending.</p>

School districts, which had already budgeted for this funding for the new fiscal year, are facing immediate disruption.

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has successfully pushed major housing reform legislation through the California Legislature, aimed at speeding up construction by easing environmental review standards. The new laws, Assembly Bill 130 and Senate Bill 131, exempt most urban housing projects from the lengthy California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) process. To ensure passage, Newsom tied the legislation to the state budget with a "poison pill" provision, forcing lawmakers to approve it. Experts believe the reforms could be the most significant changes to CEQA in its 55-year history, potentially unblocking numerous housing projects across the state.</p>

Critics within the party are concerned that tightening eligibility criteria will harm vulnerable people and argue the government's approach is driven by fiscal targets rather than social need.

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has discovered that betaine, a compound naturally produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise, can help slow down the aging process. Their research, published in the journal Cell, reveals that betaine acts as a messenger that prevents inflammation and aging in multiple organs. It achieves this by inhibiting a specific enzyme associated with the body's aging pathways. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind the anti-aging benefits of exercise and suggest potential new strategies for promoting longevity by simulating exercise's effects at a cellular level.</p>
