          <p>President Trump praised Elon Musk as a 'patriot' and 'brilliant guy' during an executive order signing, defending Musk's work with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Trump addressed criticism of Musk and Tesla, citing unfair treatment despite Musk's efforts to help the country. Trump also highlighted Musk's aerospace achievements with SpaceX and his broad technological contributions, expressing hope for continued involvement even as Musk refocuses on his business empire. The remarks follow heightened tensions for Tesla, including a firebombing at a Kansas City dealership and security threats in Europe.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed executive actions aimed at reshaping higher education and K-12 schools, including efforts to rein in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.

Another promises new discipline guidance for K-12 schools, aiming to base policies on objective behavior rather than DEI. The actions seek to cement Trump's conservative agenda in education, rolling back Biden administration policies, bolstering workforce training, and improving AI education in schools.</p>

Trump hinted that the U.S. might be willing to formally recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea as part of a peace deal. US Vice-President JD Vance outlined a US vision for a deal, saying it would "freeze the territorial lines close to where they are today", with both sides giving up some territory. Zelenskyy has long maintained that Ukraine will not concede Crimea, citing the constitution and international law.</p>

          <p>Trading Standards officers in England have seized over six million illegal vaping products in the past three years, revealing a sophisticated network involved in the illicit trade. These vapes often exceed legal limits for tank size and nicotine strength, posing health risks to consumers, especially youth. Authorities are preparing for a ban on single-use disposable vapes, hoping it will curb the illegal market, which is linked to serious criminal activities.

          <p>President Trump's job approval rating has steadily declined during his first three months in office, according to polling averages. His approval rating has fallen to approximately 45%, down from 52% shortly after taking office, with about half of the country now disapproving of his performance.

While the Justice Ministry reports thousands of deportations annually for immigration violations, some argue that overstaying a visa should not be equated with crimes like theft or assault. A Buddhist temple provides shelter to Vietnamese residents, emphasizing that some overstay due to unavoidable circumstances and deserve a second chance.

The executive order directs the Department of Education to hold accreditors accountable for failing to meet recognition criteria, including those requiring unlawful discrimination under the guise of DEI initiatives. Trump questioned whether the order would "look into" people who attend prestigious schools but lack basic math skills.</p>

One of these mammals was related to Repenomamus, a mammal known to prey on small dinosaurs. This discovery suggests a complex relationship where dinosaurs preyed on mammals that themselves preyed on dinosaurs, creating a striking ecological loop.</p>

          <p>England's NHS safety watchdog warns that extreme tiredness and exhaustion among hospital staff poses a significant risk to patients. Common problems associated with fatigued staff include medication errors, impaired decision-making, reduced attention, and rude behavior. The watchdog cited examples of mistakes made with pregnancy scans and chemotherapy drugs, where fatigue was a contributing factor. The report calls for better systems to monitor fatigue and raise awareness about it as a safety issue.</p>

          <h2>States Sue Trump Over His Tariffs</h2>

          <p>A dozen states, primarily led by Democrats, have filed a lawsuit against President Trump over his tariffs, asserting that he lacks the authority to impose them. The states argue that only Congress has the power to legislate tariffs and are seeking a court order to block the administration from enforcing what they deem unlawful. This legal challenge follows a similar lawsuit filed by California, alleging economic harm from the tariffs.</p>
