            <p>Former President Donald Trump again called on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, criticizing Chairman Jerome Powell's handling of monetary policy. Trump stated that the European Central Bank is expected to cut rates for the seventh time, while Powell's recent report was a 'mess.' He argued that lower oil prices and reduced grocery costs warrant rate cuts to boost economic growth, hinting at his desire to replace Powell. Powell's speech the previous day noted that the administration's tariffs put the central bank in a tricky spot as it decides whether to tame inflation or boost growth. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Dozens of Democratic lawmakers are raising concerns that President Donald Trump's tariff-heavy trade agenda could lead to corruption and self-dealing. In a letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, the lawmakers requested details on the administration's plans to prevent the misuse of tariffs for personal enrichment. They argue that the administration's tumultuous rollout of new tariffs presents opportunities for undue influence by administration officials and their allies. (not investment advice)</p>
