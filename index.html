The protest was organized to oppose the government's ban, which makes supporting the group a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Officers moved in after numerous protesters displayed signs with messages backing the organization. The arrests come as the first individuals are being prosecuted under the new ban.</p>

          <p>William Bengen, the financial advisor who developed the famous "4% rule" for retirement withdrawals in the 1990s, now suggests that many retirees can safely withdraw more. In a new book, he argues that a well-diversified portfolio allows for a starting withdrawal rate closer to 4.7%, and potentially as high as 5.5% for current retirees. Bengen emphasizes that his original rule was a conservative, worst-case scenario and that inflation remains the biggest threat to retirement savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a landmark heat safety law enacted in California 20 years ago, farmworkers are still suffering and dying from preventable heat-related illnesses. Advocates and lawmakers argue that a lack of enforcement by the state's occupational health and safety agency, Cal/OSHA, is to blame. A recent state audit found the agency was understaffed and failed to take proper action in many cases. As temperatures rise, undocumented workers often hesitate to complain about unsafe conditions for fear of retaliation.</p>

          <p>Sandra Grimes, a pivotal CIA officer who helped unmask Soviet mole Aldrich Ames, has died at age 79. In 1991, Grimes agreed to postpone her retirement to investigate why CIA informants in the Soviet Union were disappearing. Her meticulous analysis of financial records and activity logs was crucial in identifying Ames, the CIA's counterintelligence chief, as the spy responsible for betraying numerous agents. Ames was arrested in 1994, and Grimes' work is remembered as a vital contribution to U.S. national security.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Carronade Capital Management is urging satellite communications company Viasat to separate its Defense and Advanced Technologies (DAT) division. In a letter to the board, Carronade argues that Viasat is "materially misunderstood" and undervalued by the market, which focuses too heavily on its legacy satellite business. The firm believes that spinning off the high-growth, high-margin DAT business as a standalone entity would unlock significant value for shareholders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Trump administration's economic policies effectively amount to a "degrowth" strategy, which will result in a smaller U.S. economy. The author contends that actions such as prosecuting a global trade war, reducing immigration, and cutting funding for scientific research and renewable energy will lead to higher prices, suppressed consumption, and lower productivity. These policies, the article suggests, will ultimately make most Americans worse off by shrinking the overall economic pie.</p>

CEO Elon Musk stated it no longer makes sense to divide resources between different AI chip designs. The company will now rely more on external partners like Nvidia while focusing on its next generation of in-house inference chips.</p>

The case underscores criticism from human rights groups, who call the facility a health and human rights disaster, while the administration defends it as secure and humane.</p>

          <p>A captain with the Los Angeles County Fire Department is facing multiple felony charges for allegedly faking a work-related injury to fraudulently collect over $25,000 in disability insurance payments.

The L.A. County District Attorney's office stated that false claims will not be tolerated, especially from first responders.</p>

According to NASA and other astronomers, a full moon will coincide with the shower's peak on the night of August 12-13. The bright moonlight is expected to wash out the view of all but the brightest meteors. The Perseids, which originate from debris left by the Swift-Tuttle comet, are known for their bright fireballs and are typically one of the most popular viewing events of the year.</p>
