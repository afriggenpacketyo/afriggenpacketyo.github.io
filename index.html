          <p>President Trump has deployed 2,000 National Guard members to Los Angeles in response to protests sparked by recent immigration enforcement operations. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt criticized California's Democratic leaders for allegedly failing to maintain order, while Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth indicated potential mobilization of active-duty Marines if violence escalates. California Governor Gavin Newsom condemned the move as inflammatory, asserting local authorities are capable of managing the situation. The protests followed immigration raids in the fashion district and other areas, leading to clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement, as officials trade blame over the appropriate response.</p>

Charlo was last seen at The Badlander bar in Missoula, Montana, with her ex-boyfriend, Michael DeFrance, who gave conflicting accounts of her whereabouts after leaving the bar. Cellphone data indicated Charlo's phone pinged near DeFrance's residence after he claimed to have dropped her off in town, and he later admitted to discarding the phone in Idaho.

Gaines also addressed Biles' comments about her loss to a trans swimmer, suggesting Biles was body-shaming her and contradicting her own history of facing scrutiny for her muscular physique.

          <p>A referendum on Italian citizenship is polarizing the country, with a proposal to halve the waiting time for citizenship applications from 10 years to five. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has announced she will boycott the vote, deeming the current citizenship law "excellent" and "very open." The referendum aims to streamline the process for legal immigrants who contribute to Italy's economy, but faces opposition from right-wing parties concerned about national identity. The outcome of the referendum could impact the lives of many long-term foreign residents and their children.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to launch a new registration system aimed at encouraging people to maintain connections with rural areas affected by depopulation. The initiative, a key part of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's efforts to revitalize regional areas, seeks to enlist over 10 million users in the next decade. Registered nonresidents would receive information on local events and services, but the program's effectiveness in broadening its appeal remains uncertain. The government also aims to promote living and working in multiple areas to facilitate the flow of city dwellers into rural regions.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump and Elon Musk's relationship reportedly soured due to disagreements, insults, and a physical altercation, leading to Musk's recent critical posts on X. Trump allegedly called Musk a "big-time drug addict" and disapproved of a physical fight between Musk and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent over spending. The conflict escalated after Trump rejected Musk's candidate for NASA administrator, leading to Musk's public criticism and Trump's threat to cut federal contracts to Musk's businesses. While some hope for reconciliation, insiders believe the relationship is permanently damaged.</p>
