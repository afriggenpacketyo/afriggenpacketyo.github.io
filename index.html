          <p>Senate Republicans have largely expressed their support for President Trump's approach to the conflict between Israel and Iran, trusting his judgment on potential U.S. involvement. While some in Trump's MAGA base are divided, citing his campaign promise to avoid foreign wars, defense hawks like Sen. Lindsey Graham advocate for the use of force if diplomacy fails to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Most Republicans agree that Iran must not possess nuclear capabilities, emphasizing the balance between American values and interests. Democrats, however, urge de-escalation and congressional approval before any military action, highlighting constitutional requirements and accountability for the use of force. The senators are trying to find the right balance between foreign policy and domestic values. Optimism surrounding the conflict is low as there is a general consensus that the situation is dangerous and could escalate further.</p>

          <p>In a Massachusetts retrial, Karen Read was found not guilty of murdering her Boston police officer boyfriend, John O'Keefe, in 2022, but was found guilty of operating under the influence of liquor, receiving a one-year probation sentence. The jury acquitted her of second-degree murder, manslaughter, and leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death, leading to cheers from her supporters outside the courthouse. Prosecutors alleged Read hit O'Keefe with her car after a night of drinking and left him to die in a blizzard, while the defense argued O'Keefe was attacked by others and left in the snow. Following the verdict, witnesses who testified against Read expressed disappointment, calling the result "a devastating miscarriage of justice," as Read thanked her supporters for their financial and emotional support.</p>

          <p>The case of Karen Read, accused of murdering her boyfriend John O'Keefe, has become a focal point of public scrutiny and mistrust in the criminal justice system, as her second trial ended with a not guilty verdict. The prosecution argued that Read deliberately struck O'Keefe with her SUV while intoxicated, leaving him to die in the cold, but the defense claimed she was framed in a conspiracy involving the Boston Police Department. The defense alleges the crime scene was staged after O'Keefe was injured at a party, and that the investigation was mishandled due to personal links between investigators and witnesses. The case has sparked intense public interest and debate, highlighting concerns about police corruption and the reliability of evidence, with supporters rallying behind Read and questioning the integrity of the investigation.</p>

Sentenced to 3-10 years in prison in August 2023, Ruggs pleaded guilty to felony DUI causing death and misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the conflict between Israel and Iran intensifies, the U.S. is considering direct military involvement, potentially using "bunker buster" bombs to target Iran's fortified nuclear facilities. These bombs, like the GBU-57 MOP, are designed to penetrate deep below the surface before exploding, with the GBU-57 specifically developed with Iran's facilities in mind. However, only the U.S. possesses the B-2 stealth bombers required to deploy these weapons, putting Israel in a difficult position as they cannot carry out such strikes independently. Experts debate whether these bombs would effectively halt Iran's nuclear program, with some suggesting it would only delay it by a year or two, and concerns exist about the potential release of radioactive material if nuclear sites are attacked.</p>

          <p>Experts in radiation hazards suggest that the risk of widespread contamination is low if the U.S. were to drop a "bunker buster" bomb on Iran's Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant. The plant primarily processes uranium isotopes, which are heavy gas molecules unlikely to travel far, limiting contamination to the immediate area. While there are concerns about uranium hexafluoride reacting with water to form hydrofluoric acid, the underground nature of the site would inhibit any significant environmental release. The International Atomic Energy Agency has monitored strikes on Iranian facilities, noting that while there was radiological and chemical contamination inside the Natanz Fuel Enrichment Plant, the radioactivity outside remained at normal levels.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved lenacapavir, marketed as Yeztugo by Gilead Sciences, as a twice-yearly injection for HIV prevention. Clinical trials demonstrated a 99.9% effectiveness rate among participants who received the drug, leading Gilead's CEO to call the approval a "milestone moment" in the fight against HIV. While the approval addresses an existing need, concerns remain over the Trump administration's decision to cut funding for HIV vaccine research, which some experts warn could set back progress in the field. Despite the effectiveness of lenacapavir, researchers emphasize the continued need for a vaccine to fully combat the HIV epidemic.</p>

The central bank anticipates inflation to worsen in the coming months but still projects two interest rate cuts by the end of the year, mirroring its March forecast. Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited solid labor market conditions and economic growth but cautioned that new tariffs are likely to drive up inflation and slow economic growth this year. The Fed expects inflation to reach 3% by year-end and unemployment to rise to 4.5%, emphasizing the need to understand the impact of tariffs before making any rate adjustments.

The organizers also referenced a report highlighting the increasing strain on the Metropolitan Police during large-scale public events, calling for increased investment in stewarding and crowd management.

          <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth suggested he might disregard a federal court ruling against deploying National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles, raising concerns about the Trump administration's willingness to defy judicial orders. Hegseth stated that district courts should not determine national security policy and indicated he would abide by a Supreme Court ruling on the matter. During a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, Hegseth faced questions about the deployment of troops, potential use of force against protesters, and the firing of top aides. Democrats criticized Hegseth's responses and expressed concerns about the influence of far-right activists on personnel decisions within the Department of Defense.</p>

Kuo cautioned that Apple's plans are subject to change, and the company has not commented on the reports. The foldable iPhone represents a potential avenue for Apple to attract new customers and encourage upgrades to more expensive devices, as iPhone revenue peaked in 2022.</p>

While these tools can be helpful when used cautiously with human verification, their widespread deployment is exacerbating existing problems on the internet and introducing new malfunctions.

This approach undermines the core principles of the U.S. regulatory system, where agencies are expected to demonstrate a compelling need for regulation backed by real-world data.
