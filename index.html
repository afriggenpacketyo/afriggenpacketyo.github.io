          <h2>US Inflation Remains Stable Despite Concerns Over New Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-27 15:13:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite widespread predictions that new tariffs would trigger a rise in consumer prices, U.S. inflation has remained unexpectedly stable. Economists attribute this to several corporate strategies, including pre-ordering inventory to front-run the duties, absorbing some costs to protect consumers, and utilizing trade loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay payments. While these measures have provided a temporary buffer, experts caution that the effects of the tariffs are likely to become more apparent in the coming months, potentially leading to increased inflation later in the year.

          <p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has become the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 for June, driven by positive regulatory news, new product introductions, and its recent inclusion in the index. Analysts suggest that diminishing concerns over fee compression and regulatory uncertainty, particularly with the passage of the GENIUS Act for stablecoins, have fueled its growth. The company's close revenue-sharing relationship with the soaring Circle Internet Group (USDC issuer) is also seen as a significant, undervalued asset, suggesting potential for further appreciation.

          <p>British tennis player Heather Watson has spoken out about the persistent online abuse she has faced throughout her career, revealing she received her first death threat at the age of 18. Her comments follow similar disclosures from compatriot Katie Boulter and support from Sir Andy Murray for stronger measures against the abuse of athletes. Watson described the abuse as a daily occurrence but stated she now views it as originating from "sad people" and that it no longer affects her as it once did. The discussion highlights a troubling and long-standing issue within professional sports.</p>

          <p>The victory of democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary has intensified the ongoing conflict between the progressive and moderate wings of the Democratic Party. While Republicans have quickly labeled Mamdani an extremist, Democrats are grappling with the implications of his win, which is seen as a rejection of the party's established figures like former Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Progressive leaders celebrate the win as a shift toward a new generation of leadership, while moderate strategists worry his policy proposals are politically vulnerable and will be used by Republicans in upcoming elections.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has abruptly ended all trade discussions with Canada, citing Ottawa's decision to implement a digital services tax that would affect major American technology companies. President Trump announced the move on social media, calling the tax an "egregious" attack on the U.S. and stating that new tariffs against Canada would be announced within a week. This development jeopardizes the significant trade relationship between the two nations, which totaled approximately $762 billion last year, and caused a downturn in U.S. stock markets.

The decision follows a request from his lawyers, who cited conflicting statements from the Department of Justice regarding whether he would be immediately deported upon release. His legal team expressed a lack of faith in the government's representations, leading to the unusual request to delay his own court-ordered release to prevent his potential removal from the country before his trial concludes.</p>

          <p>A nearly three-decade-old story about Binti Jua, a female gorilla at the Brookfield Zoo, continues to captivate audiences for her heroic actions. In 1996, after a 3-year-old boy fell 24 feet into her enclosure and was knocked unconscious, Binti Jua gently picked him up and carried him to a service door for zookeepers. Her maternal and protective behavior, which occurred while her own baby was on her back, garnered international praise and stands in stark contrast to the tragic 2016 incident involving the gorilla Harambe. Binti Jua, now 37, still resides at the Brookfield Zoo.</p>

During a 20-minute rampage, Monzo used a samurai sword to fatally wound Anjorin as he walked to school and also injured five other people, including two police officers. The judge noted that Monzo's actions were the result of psychosis induced by his own cannabis consumption.

U.S. officials, including President Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, claimed Iran's nuclear program suffered a "major setback." However, some Democratic lawmakers expressed concern after a classified briefing, worrying that Iran's stockpile of highly enriched uranium may not have been destroyed, potentially leaving the country with a short breakout time to a nuclear weapon.</p>

          <p>President Trump celebrated a Supreme Court ruling that significantly limits the power of lower federal court judges to issue nationwide injunctions against executive actions. The 6-3 decision stemmed from legal challenges to his executive order aiming to end birthright citizenship. While the court did not rule on the constitutionality of the order itself, it restricted judges' ability to block a policy for anyone beyond the specific plaintiffs in a lawsuit. Trump called the decision a "monumental win," while critics and dissenting justices warned it dangerously weakens judicial checks on executive power.</p>

Newsom's legal team stated the suit will be dropped if Fox News issues a formal on-air retraction and apology.

The Department of Homeland Security argued that conditions in Haiti have improved sufficiently since the 2010 earthquake to allow for their safe return. This decision will revoke the legal status and work permits for over 260,000 Haitians, making them eligible for deportation if they do not qualify for other forms of legal immigration.

Medical bills are also frequently negotiable, while other debts like buy now, pay later plans and payday loans can be more challenging to settle due to their structure and the practices of the lenders.

          <p>A legal analysis argues that the Supreme Court's decision to curb nationwide injunctions is a "stunning and tragic" blow to the separation of powers. The ruling, which arose from challenges to an executive order on birthright citizenship, prevents federal courts from halting unconstitutional government actions for anyone not directly involved in a lawsuit. This effectively means an unconstitutional policy can remain in force across the country until numerous separate lawsuits are won. Dissenting justices warned this creates an "existential threat to the rule of law" by severely limiting the judiciary's ability to protect constitutional rights.</p>
