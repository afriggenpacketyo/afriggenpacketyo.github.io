During the match, Paolini adjusted her strategy by hitting the ball harder and expressed gratitude for the supportive crowd.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments regarding President Trump's executive order aiming to limit birthright citizenship to children born to legal permanent residents. The justices debated the legality of nationwide injunctions blocking the order, with some expressing concerns about limiting judicial power to check executive actions. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued for limiting injunctions, while Justice Sotomayor questioned the order's constitutionality. The court also considered whether eliminating nationwide injunctions would create a chaotic legal landscape, requiring individual lawsuits across the country. The decision in this case is expected by early summer and could have significant implications for presidential authority and immigration policy.</p>

          <p>Becky Hill, the former court clerk in the Alex Murdaugh murder trial, was arrested and released on bond after being charged with obstructing justice, misconduct, and perjury. The charges stem from allegations of jury tampering and misusing her position for financial gain, including promoting her book about the Murdaugh case. Murdaugh's defense attorneys believe these charges could lead to a new trial for their client. Hill is also accused of misusing thousands of dollars in federal bonuses for personal expenses and gifts, and previously resigned from her position following the jury tampering allegations.</p>

          <p>Homeowners are finding it increasingly difficult to access their home equity due to elevated interest rates and stricter lending requirements, leading to what experts call "trapped" equity. With many homeowners reluctant to give up their historically low mortgage rates, tapping into equity through cash-out refinancing becomes less appealing. Alternative options like HELOCs and home equity loans can provide access to equity without affecting the existing mortgage rate. Improving credit scores and stabilizing employment history are also crucial steps for homeowners seeking to unlock their trapped equity.</p>

The statue's creator, American artist Brad Downey, expressed sadness and speculated that the theft might be related to Donald Trump's recent election. The incident adds to the ongoing saga surrounding the statue, which has become a symbol of Melania Trump's connection to her homeland.</p>

          <p>A new analysis reveals a growing shortage of affordable homes for middle-income families in the U.S., with only a small fraction of listed homes within their reach. Rising home prices and mortgage rates are pushing homeownership out of reach for many, particularly in cities with restrictive zoning regulations. The lack of affordable homes is driving up prices further, creating a challenging market for middle-class buyers. Some cities are showing improvements in housing availability, while others remain stagnant, highlighting the need for innovative housing solutions and policy changes.</p>

          <p>Scientists have unlocked the genetic code responsible for the distinctive ginger coloring in cats, particularly males. Researchers discovered that ginger cats are missing a section of DNA within the ARHGAP36 gene, leading to lighter pigment production in skin, eye, and fur tone. This breakthrough, crowdfunded by cat lovers, may also shed light on potential health conditions linked to orange coloring. The discovery explains why ginger cats are more commonly male, as the gene is carried on the X chromosome.</p>
