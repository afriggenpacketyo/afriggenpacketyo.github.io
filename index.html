          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 20:04:57 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>SK Hynix, a South Korean chipmaker, reported a significant increase in quarterly revenue and operating profit, exceeding estimates due to robust demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) used in AI chipsets. The company's first-quarter operating profit rose by 158% year-on-year, demonstrating the impact of AI on the memory market. SK Hynix anticipates continued spending on AI by Big Tech and the expansion of the AI ecosystem, driven by open-source AI models and sovereign AI projects, which will further fuel memory demand. However, the company also cautioned about macroeconomic uncertainties and tariff policies potentially affecting demand in the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services, under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is planning to phase out eight synthetic food dyes in the American food supply due to concerns about potential health risks. The FDA is looking to revoke authorization for two dyes and collaborate with manufacturers to eliminate six others commonly found in cereals, snacks, and beverages. Studies have suggested links between synthetic dyes and behavioral issues in children, as well as cancer in animals, though experts remain divided on the extent of these risks. While the industry defends the safety and necessity of these dyes, the FDA is fast-tracking the review of natural alternatives like watermelon and carrot juice.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has unsealed terrorism charges against Jose Enrique Martinez Flores, an alleged high-ranking member of the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang, marking the first terrorism case against a TdA member since the gang was designated a terrorist organization. Flores, arrested in Colombia, is accused of conspiring to provide material support to TdA and participating in international drug distribution. Attorney General Pamela Bondi emphasized that TdA is a structured terrorist organization, not just a street gang, and vowed to dismantle it, while FBI Director Kash Patel stated that TdA poses a direct threat to national security.

          <p>South Korea's GDP experienced a contraction of 0.1% year-on-year in the first quarter, marking the first economic downturn since late 2020, primarily due to a significant drop in construction activity. This figure fell short of expectations and reversed the growth seen in the previous quarter, influenced by ongoing political uncertainties including impeachment trials and trade war tensions with the U.S. The Bank of Korea had already warned of slower growth for 2025, and analysts anticipate potential rate cuts in response to the weaker economic performance. As a team from South Korea heads to the U.S. for trade talks, the country hopes to resolve trade issues and achieve mutually beneficial outcomes.</p>

His role as a government efficiency advocate had both supporters and detractors, with some praising his efforts to cut government waste and others criticizing the impact on specific services and jobs.

          <p>Following a controversial women's pool tournament championship featuring two transgender athletes, Ultimate Pool in the UK has revised its policies to bar biological males from competing against women. The organization cited an expert report concluding that pool is a "gender affected sport" where biological males retain competitive advantages. This decision aligns with a recent UK Supreme Court ruling defining "woman" biologically, influencing the Equality and Human Rights Commission to advise organizations to update their policies accordingly. Ultimate Pool's move contrasts with earlier, more inclusive guidelines from the World Eightball Pool Federation, which initially allowed transgender competitors under certain conditions before reversing course.</p>

Fire officials expect the acreage to increase as they work toward full containment, and smoke from the fire has led to an Air Quality Health Advisory in New York City.

Trump asserts that a deal to end the war was "very close," but Zelensky's refusal to accept US terms "will do nothing but prolong" the conflict. This comes as US Vice-President JD Vance outlined a US vision for a deal that would "freeze the territorial lines" close to their current positions, requiring both Ukraine and Russia to cede some territory. Meanwhile, Russia has intensified its attacks on Ukraine, despite a brief lull over Easter, and London talks aimed at securing a ceasefire were downgraded after key US officials withdrew.</p>

          <p>Sophie Lloyd, a magician who initially gained membership to the Magic Circle by disguising herself as a man in 1991, is finally being granted full membership after being expelled for her deception. Lloyd's act was intended to challenge the society's then-exclusive policy against female members. The Magic Circle, now under its first female chair, has apologized to Lloyd and is formally presenting her with a membership certificate, recognizing her as a role model for women magicians. Lloyd's story highlights the historical barriers faced by women in magic and the ongoing efforts to promote inclusivity within the field.</p>

          <p>A coalition of a dozen states has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging the legality of its tariff policy in the U.S. Court of International Trade. The states argue that President Trump's tariffs, imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, are unlawful and have disrupted the American economy. The lawsuit seeks a court order declaring the tariffs illegal and preventing the government from enforcing them. The states assert that only Congress has the constitutional authority to impose tariffs, and Trump's actions are an overreach of presidential power.</p>

While the food dye industry defends the safety and importance of these additives, citing consistency and visual appeal, health officials point out that they have no known nutritional value and raise safety concerns.</p>

The top five emitting companies, including Saudi Aramco, Gazprom, Chevron, ExxonMobil, and BP, are linked to over $9 trillion in climate damage.
