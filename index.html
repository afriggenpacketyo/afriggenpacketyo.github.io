          <p>Pfizer's CEO, Albert Bourla, reportedly attended a high-value fundraiser for President Trump just one day after the president publicly demanded that pharmaceutical companies significantly lower drug prices. The White House had sent letters to 17 drug companies, including Pfizer, urging them to match the lower prices paid in other countries. This event highlights the complex relationship between the pharmaceutical industry and the administration, as drugmakers argue that price controls could stifle innovation while facing political pressure to make medications more affordable for Americans.</p>

          <p>Lifeguards in Seal Beach, California, are warning beachgoers of a significant rise in stingray-related injuries, with daily incidents jumping from one to as many as fifteen. Officials attribute the increase to calm, warm waters attracting stingrays closer to the shore, coinciding with hot weather drawing more people to the ocean. The area, known locally as “ray bay,” has a historically high stingray population. To avoid stings, experts advise shuffling one's feet in the sand to alert the camouflaged fish, which typically only sting when they feel threatened.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A review of the Environmental Protection Agency's own regulatory analysis indicates that repealing Biden-era greenhouse gas emission standards would lead to higher gasoline prices and significant job losses. The analysis, citing data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, projects that disincentivizing electric vehicles would increase demand for gasoline, thus driving up its cost for all consumers. This finding contrasts with the administration's claims that the rollback would result in substantial savings for Americans by making cars more affordable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's executive order to increase tariffs on imports is expected to raise consumer prices and create prolonged uncertainty for businesses, according to trade experts. With a new baseline tariff of at least 15% for most countries, the U.S. effective tariff rate has reached its highest level in decades. Economists warn this could lead to higher costs for everyday goods like clothing, furniture, and cars, potentially costing the average American household over $2,000 annually. The administration argues the policy is necessary to revive U.S. manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Charlie Woods, the 16-year-old son of golf legend Tiger Woods, narrowly missed earning an automatic spot on the U.S. Junior Ryder Cup team. After entering the final round of the Junior PGA Championship tied for second place, he shot a 74, dropping him into a tie for ninth. The top two finishers secured qualifying spots for the prestigious junior event. Despite strong performances in the second and third rounds, his final-day performance left him four strokes short of the qualifying position needed to represent the United States.</p>

          <p>President Trump has escalated his criticism of the Federal Reserve's independence, calling its chair, Jerome Powell, a "stubborn MORON" and urging the board to take control if interest rates are not cut immediately. The attacks came after the Fed held rates steady and just before a report showed a significant slowdown in the job market. This break with the presidential tradition of respecting the central bank's political independence raises concerns about interference in economic policy as the administration prepares for a new wave of tariffs.

          <p>A coalition of 16 states and the District of Columbia has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging an unconstitutional pressure campaign to stop hospitals from providing gender-affirming care to transgender youth. The lawsuit argues the White House and Justice Department are using threats of criminal prosecution and demands for patient data to create a de facto national ban on the care. This legal action follows the closure of several prominent gender-affirming care clinics, even in states where the treatment remains legal, due to the federal pressure.</p>

          <h2>Jury Finds Tesla Partially Liable for Fatal Crash Involving Autopilot Software</h2>

          <p>A Florida jury has found Tesla partly liable for a 2019 crash that killed a pedestrian, ordering the company to pay up to $243 million in damages. The lawsuit argued that Tesla's Autopilot driver-assistance software should have alerted the driver and applied the brakes before the collision. Tesla maintained that the driver, who admitted to being distracted, was solely at fault and has vowed to appeal the verdict. This case marks a significant legal setback for the company and the first time a jury has ruled against Tesla in a fatal crash involving Autopilot.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Supreme Court has issued a ruling that closes off a major avenue for millions of motorists to claim compensation over hidden commissions in car finance deals. The court did not uphold an earlier finding that secret commission payments were inherently unlawful. However, the judgment left open the possibility for claims based on unfairness due to large, undisclosed commissions, meaning lenders could still face a reduced but substantial compensation bill. The decision was described as a "bitter pill to swallow" by one of the claimants in the landmark case.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers made several moves at the trade deadline to strengthen their roster for the remainder of the season. The team acquired right-handed relievers Brock Stewart and Paul Gervase to reinforce their bullpen and added versatile outfielder Alex Call for lineup depth. Manager Dave Roberts expressed confidence that these additions raise the team's overall floor. The Dodgers are also hopeful that injured rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki can return in late August, serving as another key late-season addition to the pitching staff.</p>

          <p>A psychotherapist who specializes in helping cult survivors outlines several warning signs for identifying manipulative and controlling groups. Key indicators include "love bombing," where excessive affection is used to gain control, and offering simple answers to life's complex problems. Other red flags are the use of insider language, restricting access to outside information, and creating a high barrier to exit, making members fear losing their identity or facing retaliation if they leave. The expert emphasizes that cults are not always religious and can form around any ideology.</p>

          <p>At an internal town hall meeting, social media giant ByteDance revealed that the median service length for its current employees is 2.9 years. The company, which owns TikTok and its Chinese counterpart Douyin, shared that about half of its 120,000-person workforce has been with the company for over three years. This disclosure appears to counter online speculation about high turnover rates. The figures suggest ByteDance is a relatively attractive employer within China's competitive tech industry, especially after it abandoned the infamous "996" work culture.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for tens of thousands of immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling provides a reprieve for over 60,000 individuals who have been living and working legally in the U.S. for years. The judge found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in arguing the administration's decision was "preordained" and potentially motivated by racial animus, citing statements from the president and the DHS Secretary.

          <p>An Ohio woman, Tiah McCreary, took a unique form of revenge after a Kia dealership repossessed her car a month after purchase. Upon discovering the dealership had let its business name registration lapse with the state, she registered the name "Taylor Kia of Lima" for herself and sent them a cease-and-desist letter. The dealership's attempt to move the case to arbitration was partially overturned by an appeals court, which ruled that the dispute over the trade name is a separate matter from the car purchase and can proceed in court.</p>
