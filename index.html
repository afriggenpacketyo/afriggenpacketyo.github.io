            <p>The Trump administration is ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of Afghans who entered the U.S. after the 2021 withdrawal. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem stated that the situation in Afghanistan no longer meets the requirements for TPS renewal. This decision will impact over 14,000 Afghans, making them eligible for deportation. Critics argue that conditions in Afghanistan have worsened, and the move undermines America's commitment to its allies.

            <p>President Trump's changing tariff policies are causing confusion and anxiety among consumers and businesses. The tariffs, including a 10% tax on most imports and a 145% duty on goods from China, have led to panic buying and concerns about rising prices. While some companies stockpiled goods, the tariffs are expected to increase costs for consumers, potentially leading to a slowdown in spending.

            <p>Three youths overdosed at Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall in Downey, California, the latest in a series of issues for the troubled facility. A large quantity of Xanax was found before the overdoses, and Narcan was used during the incident. The facility was ordered to close last year due to staffing issues, but the probation department ignored the order. Concerns about drug prevalence in L.A. County's juvenile halls have been ongoing. The incident has led to visitation restrictions and an investigation.</p>

            <p>The author argues that President Trump's recent tariff policies have weakened his position, creating an opportunity for Europe and the UK to take advantage. The near collapse of the US government debt market and Trump's subsequent policy reversals have diminished his economic and political power. The author suggests that the EU, Britain, and other rule-of-law democracies should work together to create a new trade order without the US, while remaining vigilant about China's growing influence. A deeper trade deal between the UK and the EU is recommended. (not investment advice)</p>
