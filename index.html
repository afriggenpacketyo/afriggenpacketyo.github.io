        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has rejected a request from two toy companies, Learning Resources and hand2mind, to expedite their challenge to President Trump's tariffs. The companies argued that Trump lacked the authority to impose the tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). This decision means the Trump administration has the standard 30-day window to file its response to the challenge. The companies previously won a temporary block on the tariffs in the U.S. Court of International Trade, but a federal appeals court allowed the tariffs to remain in effect pending arguments. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Columbia University pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, who was arrested by ICE agents in New York City in March. Judge Michael Farbiarz denied the government's motion to stay the ruling for seven days, asserting that the government failed to prove Khalil's release would cause irreparable harm or that he posed a flight risk. Khalil's attorney argued that his detention was retaliatory for his protected speech and viewpoint, referencing his leadership in Columbia's encampment protests against the war in Gaza. The ruling supersedes an immigration judge's decision in Louisiana to deny Khalil's asylum request and keep him detained. </p>

The parents, Jessica Ross and Treveon Taylor Sr., had hired Gates to perform a private autopsy after their baby died during a complicated delivery.

          <p>Top diplomats from the U.K., France, and Germany are engaging in last-minute diplomacy with Iran in Geneva as Washington considers joining Israel's military campaign against Tehran. President Trump has set a two-week deadline for deciding whether to intervene militarily. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated that negotiations with the U.S. cannot occur until Israeli aggression ceases. Markets have been rattled by the potential for the conflict to destabilize the Middle East, leading to a flight to safe-haven assets. </p>

The analysis found that borrowers at all income levels would face higher monthly payments under RAP compared to SAVE. Critics argue that larger bills could push more borrowers into default, while the repayment timeline would stretch over three decades. (not investment advice)</p>
