            <p>President Trump authorized the military to take control of a strip of public land along the southern border, citing threats to the United States. The order directs the Secretaries of Defense, Interior, Agriculture, and Homeland Security to transfer jurisdiction of federal land along the southern border to the Department of Defense. The military will be tasked with building a border wall and implementing detection and monitoring equipment. This action follows previous executive orders aimed at reshaping federal immigration and border policies, including declaring a national emergency at the southern border. The order references the Roosevelt Reservation, a swath of land along the border that goes through California, New Mexico and Arizona.</p>

            <p>A 52-year-old Florida woman was arrested for allegedly buying and selling human bones online through her business, "Wicked Wonderland." Police initiated an investigation following a report about the business selling human bones on Facebook Marketplace. The business was advertising human skulls, a human clavicle and scapula, a human rib, human vertebrae, and a partial human skull for sale on its website. While one shop owner claimed they didn't know it was illegal, another owner, Schopper, told police the bones were "educational models." Experts found that the cranium and skull fragment were likely archaeological finds, some being more than 100 years old and others being more than 500 years old.</p>

            <p>The law firm Susman Godfrey filed a lawsuit to block President Trump's executive order targeting the firm, calling it "blatantly unconstitutional." The firm, which represented Dominion Voting Systems in a defamation case against Fox News, argues that Trump is retaliating against them for defending the integrity of the 2020 presidential election. The executive order seeks to block the firm's access to government buildings and cancel government contracts. Susman Godfrey argues that the order would irreparably harm their ability to represent clients in federal courts and interact with federal agencies.</p>

            <p>Lando Norris expressed confusion and frustration after qualifying sixth for the Bahrain Grand Prix, despite his McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri securing pole position. Norris, who leads the world championship, admitted feeling "clueless" on the track and struggling to find the right approach. McLaren team principal Andrea Stella attributed Norris's struggles to difficulties in extracting the best performance from the car during qualifying due to specific handling characteristics. Stella remains optimistic that the issue can be resolved with adaptations from both Norris and the team.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has exempted smartphones, computers, and some other electronic devices from "reciprocal" tariffs, including those imposed on Chinese imports. The move comes after concerns from US tech companies that the price of gadgets could skyrocket, as many of them are made in China. The exemptions, backdated to April 5, also include other electronic devices and components, such as semiconductors and memory cards. Some estimate iPhone prices in the US could have tripled if the costs were passed onto consumers.</p>

            <p>Jordan Spieth hinted at censorship from the Masters organizers regarding the issue of mud balls affecting play. Spieth explained that mud attaching to the ball, a common occurrence at Augusta National, can significantly impact approach shots. He expressed frustration that players are not supposed to talk about mud balls, as they can affect scores, especially on certain holes. Spieth emphasized that the issue is a difference maker and should be acknowledged, despite the perceived taboo.</p>

            <p>The UK government is taking control of Chinese-owned British Steel after emergency legislation was rushed through Parliament. The government's likely next step is to nationalize the Scunthorpe plant, which employs 2,700 people, to prevent owners Jingye from shutting down its two blast furnaces. The new law grants sweeping powers to control management and workers at the plant to ensure production continues. The government remains hopeful it can secure private investment to save the loss-making plant, but ministers concede there are currently no companies willing to make an offer.</p>

            <p>Dive teams are searching the Hudson River to recover the remaining wreckage from a fatal helicopter crash that killed all six people on board. Experts believe that one of the missing parts, the main rotor, could be key to determining the cause of the crash. A preliminary investigation suggests a rotor may have broken off, causing the helicopter to shake uncontrollably before crashing. Authorities are considering several theories, including bird strikes, drone interference, and mechanical failure.</p>
