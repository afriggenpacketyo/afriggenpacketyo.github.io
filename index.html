        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NHS is urging 200,000 new blood donors to register, citing ongoing shortages that have impacted patient care. A previous "amber alert" highlighted critically low supplies, especially for O negative blood, which is universally compatible. The NHSBT aims to increase regular donors from 800,000 to over one million to ensure a stable supply and prevent a "red alert" situation, which would delay treatments. The NHSBT is also emphasizing the need for more black donors to help treat sickle cell disease, as only a small percentage of the population donates regularly.</p>

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is the only cabinet minister yet to finalize her department's budget ahead of the upcoming Spending Review, despite an offer of above-inflation increases for police funding. Cooper's team argues they followed the Treasury's negotiation timetable, while some suggest an earlier agreement would have been more favorable. The impasse raises the possibility of the Treasury imposing a settlement on the Home Office, as police chiefs lobby for more funding amid concerns about maintaining police numbers and delivering policy commitments. The spending review is expected to include increased funding for the NHS and investments in technology and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's new travel ban has taken effect, barring citizens from 12 countries from entering the United States. The ban affects nationals from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, and others, while imposing heightened restrictions on people from Burundi, Cuba, and other nations. The administration argues the ban is necessary to protect the U.S., while critics condemn it as discriminatory. A similar policy enacted during Trump's first term was reversed by President Joe Biden.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts suggest that the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) recent surprise rate cut may weaken the rupee due to depressed foreign exchange forward premiums. The rupee has underperformed its Asian counterparts amidst weak capital flows, and a narrowing interest rate differential with the U.S. could exacerbate this trend. The decline in forward premiums makes the rupee less attractive for carry trades and may increase hedging activity among importers, potentially leading to sharper depreciation.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's export growth in May fell short of expectations, primarily due to a sharp 34.5% decline in shipments to the U.S., the steepest drop since February 2020. This decline occurred despite an overall increase in exports by 4.8%, driven by shipments to Southeast Asia, the European Union, and Africa. Imports from the U.S. also decreased by over 18%, resulting in a 41.55% reduction in China's trade surplus with America. Analysts attribute the decline to the impact of prohibitive tariffs that were lifted in mid-May, with expectations that the effects of the Beijing-Washington trade truce will be visible in June data.
