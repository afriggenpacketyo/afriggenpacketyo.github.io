          <p>Wales' national rugby team has ended an 18-match losing streak with a 31-22 victory over Japan in Kobe. The win, their first in 21 months, leveled the two-match series at 1-1. Despite a spirited second-half comeback from Japan that narrowed the score to within two points, a late try by fly-half Ioan Edwards secured the long-awaited victory for the touring Welsh side. The match took place under the closed roof of the Noevir Stadium, with both teams battling intense heat and humidity.</p>

          <p>The Association of Volleyball Professionals (AVP) hosted a league event inside the Intuit Dome, home of the LA Clippers, by bringing in 300 tons of sand. This move aimed to reimagine the sport for a new audience, providing a different fan experience with arena seating and amenities. Players expressed feeling like true professional athletes in the high-profile venue, which offered a controlled environment without wind, leading to faster and more powerful gameplay. The event represents a significant effort by the AVP to grow the sport beyond its traditional coastal settings.</p>

          <p>A proposal by German Education Minister Karin Prien to introduce a quota for students with immigrant backgrounds in schools has ignited a national debate. The suggestion, aimed at addressing educational challenges in schools with high migrant populations, has faced significant criticism from educators, researchers, and student bodies. Opponents argue the policy would be impractical to implement, discriminatory, and stigmatizing, suggesting that the focus should instead be on improving language support and resources for all students. The discussion highlights broader, systemic issues within Germany's education system, which has shown declining performance in recent international studies.</p>

          <p>Following large-scale immigration raids in Ventura County, California, families are desperately seeking information about the whereabouts of approximately 200 detained migrants and several activists. Relatives report that federal agencies and consulates have provided little to no information, leaving them to consider their loved ones missing. The raids, conducted by ICE and CBP at Glass House Farms, also led to the arrest of a university professor, Jonathan Caravello, whose location remains unknown to colleagues. Community organizations and Mexican and Guatemalan consulates are being inundated with calls from desperate families seeking assistance.</p>

Shehadeh suggests that accountability will not come from legal institutions but from the eventual revelation of the full truth of Palestinian suffering.

          <p>Law firms from China are expanding their international footprint, establishing a growing number of overseas offices to meet the legal needs of Chinese companies operating abroad. This global push is encouraged by Beijing and driven by a preference among Chinese businesses for legal support from their compatriots. As of the end of last year, Chinese firms had established 180 offices in 65 countries and regions. While they are successfully serving Chinese clients, lawyers note that attracting non-Chinese clients remains a significant challenge amid current geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <h2>Cockpit Audio Reveals Mystery in Air India Crash as Fuel Switches Were Cut Off</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 22:59:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The investigation into the fatal Air India Flight 171 crash has deepened with the discovery that both engine fuel-control switches were moved to the "cut-off" position moments after takeoff. Cockpit audio recorded one pilot asking the other why they had cut the fuel, with the other denying they had done so, leading to a total loss of power. The switches, which require a deliberate two-step action, were returned to the normal position, but the engines did not recover power in time. The crash in Ahmedabad killed 260 people, and investigators are now focused on determining who manipulated the switches and why.</p>

          <p>Federal immigration authorities arrested approximately 200 people suspected of being in the U.S. illegally during raids on two cannabis farm sites in Southern California. The operation, which involved criminal search warrants, led to a tense standoff between authorities and protesters in Camarillo. The Department of Homeland Security also reported that four U.S. citizens were arrested for assaulting or resisting officers during the protest. The raids are part of a ramp-up in federal immigration enforcement in the region, which has stoked fear in immigrant communities and led to legal challenges.</p>

          <h2>Explainer Details How Defective Power Banks Led to Chinese Flight Ban</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 22:30:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A series of incidents involving defective power banks catching fire on commercial flights has prompted China's aviation authority to enact an emergency ban. As of June 28, air passengers are prohibited from carrying portable batteries that do not have the mandatory China Compulsory Certification (3C) safety mark. This rule, intended as a safety precaution, has caused confusion and led to large numbers of power banks being abandoned at airports. The issue highlights a significant public safety and manufacturing quality control problem for the ubiquitous electronic accessories.</p>
