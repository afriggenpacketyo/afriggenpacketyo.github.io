          <p>Automotive conglomerate Stellantis has announced preliminary figures indicating an expected net loss of 2.3 billion euros for the first half of 2025. The company, which owns major brands like Jeep, Fiat, and Peugeot, attributes the loss to significant pre-tax charges and the initial impact of U.S. tariffs. This forecast comes after Stellantis suspended its financial guidance in April, with full results scheduled for release on July 29. The projected net revenue of 74.3 billion euros marks a notable decrease from the 85 billion euros reported in the same period last year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alaska Airlines experienced a complete grounding of its flights for approximately three hours on Sunday evening due to a significant IT system outage. The airline requested a system-wide ground stop for both its own and Horizon Air flights around 8 p.m. Pacific Time. Operations began to resume around 11 p.m. PT after the issue was resolved. The company has apologized to customers for the inconvenience, warning of residual delays and advising travelers to check their flight status before heading to the airport.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Investors in China are increasingly turning to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track bonds, pushing the total assets under management in this category past $50 billion. This surge, up from $10 billion at the start of last year, is driven by a search for low-risk investments in an economic environment marked by deflation and policy support for the corporate sector. These bond ETFs are attractive due to their lower costs, diversified exposure, and better liquidity compared to direct bond investments. The trend reflects investor caution about China's economic outlook amid trade tensions and weak domestic consumption. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is meeting with executives from approximately 30 major companies, including Siemens and Deutsche Bank, to encourage new domestic investment and restore economic confidence. The "Made for Germany" initiative aims to revive the nation's economy, which has faced two years of recession. The government has already approved billions in tax relief and a €500 billion infrastructure and climate fund. However, Berlin emphasizes that private sector participation is crucial to supplement public spending and overcome challenges like inflation and energy price shocks.</p>

          <p>China is set to begin importing iron ore from Guinea and Algeria this year, as Chinese-led projects complete crucial railway and port infrastructure.

The Simandou project, a joint venture involving Rio Tinto and Chinese firms, is expected to start shipments in November.

The conflict, which also drew in Israeli airstrikes against government forces siding with the Bedouins, displaced over 128,000 people. While a cautious calm has returned, tensions persist as some fighters remain on the city's outskirts, demanding accountability from a local Druze leader.</p>

          <p>A protest outside the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, which is being used to house asylum seekers, escalated into what police described as "mindless thuggery," resulting in six arrests. Over 1,000 demonstrators gathered, with some throwing bottles and smoke flares at police vehicles. The unrest follows the recent arrest of an asylum seeker on suspicion of sexual assault in the town. Police implemented a dispersal order to prevent further disorder, warning that they would deal robustly with any criminal behavior, while noting that previous clashes had already injured eight officers.</p>

          <p>An early morning incident outside a nightclub in Los Angeles is being investigated as an intentional act after a vehicle plowed into a crowd, injuring 36 people. According to the LAPD, the driver made a U-turn before deliberately slamming into people waiting outside the Vermont Hollywood club, with at least seven victims reported in critical condition. Bystanders reportedly removed the driver, identified as 29-year-old Fernando Ramirez, from the car and attacked him; he was later found to have been shot. Police are searching for the shooting suspect while Ramirez has been booked for assault.</p>

          <p>Adolfo Macías Villamar, the notorious Ecuadorian gang leader known as "Fito," has been extradited to the U.S. to face drug and arms trafficking charges. Fito, leader of the Los Choneros gang, was recaptured in June after escaping from a high-security prison where he was serving a 34-year sentence. His gang is linked to a dramatic rise in violence in Ecuador and is suspected in the 2023 assassination of a presidential candidate. This extradition is a significant move for Ecuador, where voters recently approved allowing the extradition of citizens in a referendum aimed at cracking down on crime.</p>

          <p>A growing body of evidence suggests that popular GLP-1 weight loss drugs, like Ozempic and Wegovy, could be effective in treating symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Women with PCOS, a common hormonal disorder linked to insulin resistance and infertility, have reported significant improvements, including weight loss, regulated menstrual cycles, and reduced hair loss. While there is no standard treatment for PCOS, researchers believe the drugs' ability to improve insulin sensitivity may help rebalance hormones. However, large-scale clinical trials are still needed, and high costs and limited insurance coverage remain significant barriers for patients.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man, Keith McAllister, has died after being pulled into an MRI machine by a 9kg (20 lbs) metal weight-training chain he was wearing around his neck. The incident occurred at a clinic in New York when his wife, who was undergoing a scan, called out for his help. As he entered the room, the machine's powerful magnet snatched the chain, pulling him into the machine and causing a fatal "medical episode." Such accidents are rare but highlight the extreme danger posed by metallic objects near MRI machines due to their powerful magnetic fields.</p>

          <p>A significant contrast in energy policy is emerging between China and the United States, particularly as global demand for electricity rises due to technologies like AI. While China is forging ahead with investments in renewable energy to secure a global tech lead, the Trump administration is actively canceling tax credits for wind and solar power. This divergence in strategy highlights different approaches to tackling climate change and achieving energy security. China's push into green technology is part of its broader ambition for technological supremacy, creating a clear policy divide with the current U.S. approach.</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened to obstruct a deal for the Washington Commanders to build a new stadium in Washington, D.C., unless the team reverts to its former name, the "Redskins." In a social media post, Trump claimed there is significant public demand for the name change and that the heritage of Indigenous people is being "taken away." The team dropped the controversial name in 2020 after decades of criticism that it was a racist slur. It remains unclear how Trump could intervene in the stadium project, which involves redeveloping a site on federal property now controlled by the city.</p>

          <p>Canada is currently experiencing a significant measles outbreak, with over 3,800 cases reported in 2025, making it the only Western nation in the top 10 countries with outbreaks. The number of infections is nearly three times that of the U.S., despite Canada's smaller population, with Alberta being the hardest-hit province. Health officials attribute the spread to low vaccination rates, fueled by a rise in vaccine hesitancy and misinformation since the COVID-19 pandemic. The outbreak, which began in late 2024, has primarily affected unvaccinated children and infants in communities with historically lower immunization rates.</p>
