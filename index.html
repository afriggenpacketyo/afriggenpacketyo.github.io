          <p>Donald Trump has announced that any country aligning with what he terms "Anti-American policies of BRICS" will face an additional 10% tariff with no exceptions. This follows a statement from the BRICS bloc, which recently expanded, criticizing unilateral tariff measures as a threat to the global economy. The threat comes as the Trump administration prepares to enforce new general tariff rates on August 1st for countries without a trade deal, creating further uncertainty in international trade relations.

          <p>A report highlights growing concerns among economists and investors over the trajectory of the U.S. national deficit, which is currently exceeding 6% of GDP. Experts from institutions like the Wharton School and investors like Ray Dalio warn that the country shows classic signs of a late-stage debt cycle, which could risk market stability, fuel inflation, and strain international relations. The analysis suggests the U.S. has a limited window of less than 20 years to correct its fiscal course before facing severe economic consequences. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The upcoming EU-China summit is anticipated to yield limited strategic progress, according to Italy’s ambassador to China. He cited the complex context of ongoing trade tariff negotiations involving the EU, China, and the US as a major complicating factor. While the meeting marks the 50th anniversary of EU-Chinese relations and is seen as an important dialogue, expectations are low for significant breakthroughs on major issues like the war in Ukraine or trade disputes.</p>

          <p>The death toll for Turkish soldiers exposed to methane gas in a northern Iraq cave has risen to twelve, according to Turkey's Defense Ministry. The soldiers were on a mission to recover the remains of a comrade killed by Kurdish militants in 2022 when they were poisoned. The incident occurred in a cave system previously used as a field hospital by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), against whom Turkey has been conducting a long-term military operation.</p>

          <p>Camp Mystic, a Christian girls' camp on the Guadalupe River, became a scene of tragedy when floodwaters rose 26 feet in under an hour, killing at least 27 campers and counselors. Survivors describe terrifying moments as they were evacuated by military trucks, witnessing the devastation and first responders pulling girls from the water. The disaster has raised questions about the safety of locating camps so close to the river, though the focus remains on the ongoing recovery mission amid immense community grief.</p>

          <p>On the 20th anniversary of the 7 July 2005 London bombings, the driver of the number 30 bus that was attacked in Tavistock Square has returned to the city to pay his respects. George Psaradakis, who was uninjured but witnessed the blast that killed 13 of his passengers, recalls the day's horror but also emphasizes the importance of remembering the victims and the humanity shown in the aftermath. The coordinated attacks on London's transport system killed 52 people and injured over 770.</p>

          <p>Two soldiers in the British Army have been dismissed after a court martial found them guilty of sharing grossly offensive videos, including graphic helmet-cam footage from the October 7th Hamas attacks. The two signallers from the 10th Signal Regiment shared clips of corpses and an ISIS execution video with each other and other service personnel. The judge advocate general stated that their actions violated the values of the British Army, leading to their dismissal.</p>

          <p>Zambia has enacted a new Cyber Crimes Act that has drawn criticism from rights groups who argue it threatens freedom of expression and privacy. The law grants the government broad powers to intercept and surveil all electronic communications and brings the national cybersecurity agency directly under the president's office. While the government defends the legislation as necessary to combat digital crimes like fraud and identity theft, critics and legal associations fear it will be used to stifle dissent and undermine democracy.</p>

          <p>Newly released court documents show that Michigan utility DTE Energy facilitated a $100,000 donation to a dark money group that worked to sabotage Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s COVID-19 lockdown policies. The emails contradict DTE's previous denials of involvement, showing a company employee coordinated the contribution to the "Unlock Michigan" campaign. This revelation highlights how corporations can use opaque non-profits to influence policy while publicly claiming neutrality, raising questions about the appropriateness of the utility's political spending.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's persistent public attacks and demands for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, economists assert that his actual power over the central bank is limited. The Fed's independent and consensus-driven structure, with its board of governors serving long terms, insulates it from short-term political pressure. While Trump can appoint new members over time, his ability to force immediate policy changes or fire Chair Jerome Powell is constitutionally and structurally constrained, a design intended to prevent political interference from destabilizing the economy.

          <p>While the "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) movement, closely associated with Health Secretary Robert F.

The movement's leaders have successfully focused on diet and anti-vaccine policies, but have not articulated a legislative plan to address the nation's sleep deficit. This gap illustrates the challenge of the MAHA agenda: it is easier to identify health problems than it is to craft effective, large-scale government solutions.</p>

This move has sparked alarm among civil rights advocates, who fear it could be weaponized against political opponents, drawing parallels to the Red Scare era when denaturalization was used to repress dissent. Legal scholars warn that treating citizenship as revocable for political reasons sets a dangerous precedent and creates a chilling effect for the country's 24.5 million naturalized citizens.</p>
