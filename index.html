          <p>Campaigners are calling for stricter measures regarding the residency of individuals convicted of murder, manslaughter, and stalking, suggesting they should be confined to restricted zones after release from prison. Victims of stalking and violent crimes express feeling imprisoned themselves due to the fear of encountering their perpetrators. While the Ministry of Justice maintains that exclusion zones protect victims, concerns are raised about potential breaches of perpetrators' human rights. The proposal aims to shift the focus from protecting offenders' rights to prioritizing the safety and freedom of victims who have already suffered significant trauma.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is facing criticism for his handling of the military operation against Houthi attacks in Yemen, which has become an expensive and potentially escalatory engagement. Despite deploying significant firepower, including aircraft carrier strike groups and B-2 bombers, the U.S. has failed to restore regular traffic through the Red Sea. The operation's cost is projected to reach $2 billion in May, raising concerns about the long-term financial implications and the increasing difficulty of extracting American troops from the region. The bombing raids have also resulted in civilian casualties and the loss of expensive military drones.</p>

          <p>The Governor of the Bank of Korea, Rhee Chang Yong, expressed concerns about the negative impact of ongoing trade tensions, particularly those stemming from U.S. tariff policies. He emphasized that these tensions are creating headwinds for the South Korean economy and increasing downside risks to economic growth. These tariffs affect not only direct exports but also indirect channels like semiconductor production in Vietnam and car manufacturing in Mexico. Rhee hopes that political stability following the recent presidential election will alleviate some of the economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly uses the Signal messaging app on a computer in his Pentagon office to facilitate communication in areas where personal cellphones are restricted. According to sources, Hegseth had cables installed to connect a private computer to Signal.

This practice raises concerns about security protocols and the use of personal devices for official communication within the Department of Defense.</p>

          <p>During a meeting with wounded veterans, President Donald Trump noticed a "Let's Go Brandon" sticker, eliciting laughter from those present. The phrase, which originated from a misinterpreted crowd chant during a NASCAR interview, has become a popular way to criticize President Biden. Trump engaged in a lighthearted exchange with the veteran, before turning to a more serious discussion about the veterans' service and new executive orders related to education. The event highlighted both the political divide and Trump's continued popularity among some segments of the veteran community.</p>

          <p>The Jones Road Wildfire in Ocean County, New Jersey, has burned through 13,250 acres and is approximately 50% contained. Evacuations have been lifted for around 5,000 residents in Ocean and Lacey Townships, and no injuries have been reported. While a business was destroyed, no single-family homes were damaged. Fire officials are working to fully contain the fire, which could become the largest wildfire in New Jersey in 20 years. Smoke from the fire is a concern, leading to an Air Quality Health Advisory in New York City.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily paused discovery in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant who was wrongfully deported. The pause was requested by the Trump administration and agreed upon by Abrego Garcia's attorneys. The judge had previously ordered the government to provide more detailed information about the deportation and to respond to discovery requests. The Trump administration acknowledges the wrongful deportation but argues that Abrego Garcia's alleged gang affiliation makes him ineligible to return to the United States.</p>

The Bank of Korea had previously warned that GDP growth for 2025 is expected to fall below its February forecast.

This statement follows Vice-President JD Vance's proposal for a deal that would "freeze the territorial lines" near their current positions.
