          <p>Officials in Yolo County, California, have confirmed the discovery of remains belonging to all seven workers who were missing after a Tuesday explosion at a fireworks warehouse. The incident occurred at the unpermitted Devastating Pyrotechnics warehouse, which is located on property owned by a Yolo County Sheriff's Lieutenant. The coroner's office is now working on identifying the victims through autopsies and DNA testing. The investigation involves state and federal agencies, including the ATF, who plan to conduct controlled detonations of remaining hazardous materials at the site.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC investigation details how MI5 provided false and misleading evidence to three courts regarding its handling of a violent neo-Nazi agent. The Security Service initially lied about confirming the agent's status to a journalist to cover up its mishandling of the agent, who had abused his partner. Even after being exposed, subsequent internal and external inquiries were found to be "deficient," withholding key evidence and falsely attributing the errors to memory lapses. The High Court has ordered a new, robust investigation, highlighting a major crisis of credibility for the intelligence agency over its attempts to conceal its actions.</p>

          <p>Dan Biddle, the most severely injured survivor of the July 7, 2005, London bombings, shares his experience with enduring PTSD two decades after the attack. He was standing near suicide bomber Mohammad Sidique Khan on a Tube train and suffered catastrophic injuries, including the loss of both legs, an eye, and severe internal damage. Biddle describes the vivid and persistent hallucinations of the bomber and his difficult journey through recovery, which included multiple suicide attempts. Supported by his wife and therapy, he has since returned to the scene and now runs a company helping disabled people find employment.</p>

          <p>A massive search and rescue operation is underway in central Texas, where flash floods have claimed the lives of at least 51 people, including 15 children. The hardest-hit area is Kerr County, where 43 deaths occurred and 27 children from a Christian youth camp on the Guadalupe River remain missing. Governor Greg Abbott has expanded the disaster declaration, and federal agencies are assisting local rescuers who have already saved about 850 people. Officials maintain that it is still a rescue mission, not a recovery effort, as they search for anyone who may have been swept away.</p>

The Mail on Sunday reports on Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner's plans to overhaul employment rights, which critics claim could censor "workplace banter."

          <p>A new travel trend is emerging in China, with young people, particularly recent university graduates, fueling a boom in cruise ship holidays. These travelers see cruises as a unique and social way to vacation, offering communal spaces and activities that foster bonding among groups. An MBA graduate from Fudan University has capitalized on this by organizing weeklong cruises for fellow alumni, with trips costing between 3,000 and 10,000 yuan. Analysts note that this demographic is increasingly embracing ocean cruises over more traditional group travel like road trips or hiking.</p>

Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson stated the initiative will offer a "lifeline" to families and help break the link between a child's background and their future achievements.

          <p>After a lengthy trial, a Los Angeles jury found Monica Sementilli guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy in the 2017 killing of her husband, celebrity hairdresser Fabio Sementilli.

Key evidence included cell phone data, security footage, and testimony from Baker's accomplice. Baker pleaded no contest and was sentenced to life, while Sementilli maintained her innocence, with her defense arguing she was only guilty of having an affair.

Traveling to gather material for "Life on the Mississippi," Twain found the river both familiar and irrevocably changed, evoking a deep sense of nostalgia for his carefree days as a steamboat pilot. He considered piloting the only profession offering true freedom, a theme that would define his life's work. The journey highlighted the paradox of Twain's life: the more famous he became, the more he longed for the vanished world of his past.</p>

After assisting a goal in a 3-2 win over Borussia Dortmund, Alexander-Arnold spoke emotionally about Jota, calling him a close friend who "lit up the room." The funeral for Jota and his brother, who also died in the crash, was held on Saturday in Portugal.

          <h2>Israel to Send Negotiating Team to Qatar, But Calls Hamas's Ceasefire Demands "Unacceptable"</h2>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has announced that a negotiating team will be sent to Qatar for indirect ceasefire talks with Hamas. The decision follows Hamas's "positive response" to a U.S.-mediated proposal for a two-month truce. However, Netanyahu's office stated that the changes Hamas is demanding to the framework are "unacceptable to Israel," signaling that significant obstacles remain. President Trump expressed optimism that a deal could be reached soon, while humanitarian groups continue to raise alarms about the dire situation and civilian deaths in Gaza.</p>

          <p>An eight-year-old girl was killed on July Fourth in Buena Park, California, after being struck by illegal fireworks. According to police, a homeowner had set up a display in the street which began to misfire towards a residence. This ignited other illegal fireworks stored at the home, one of which struck and fatally injured the child. The homeowner has been arrested, and the incident is under investigation by multiple agencies. This tragedy was one of several fatal or serious fireworks-related incidents across Southern California during the holiday.</p>

          <h2>Narrative Emerges of Missed Warnings and Harrowing Escapes in Texas Floods</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the scale of the Texas flood disaster becomes clear, stories of harrowing survival and questions about warning systems are emerging. The National Weather Service issued increasingly dire alerts in the hours before the Guadalupe River surged, but many were asleep and caught unaware. One teenage boy from a home that was completely destroyed survived only by being caught in barbed wire, preventing him from being swept away. The devastation at Camp Mystic, where younger campers were in cabins closest to the riverbank, highlights the sudden and catastrophic nature of the flood.</p>

          <h2>First Full Images Emerge of China's Mysterious New Wing-in-Ground-Effect Craft</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 19:14:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New images have provided the first complete look at a mysterious Chinese wing-in-ground-effect (WIG) vehicle, or ekranoplan, being tested on the Bohai Sea. The aircraft, which flies low over the water on a cushion of air, appears similar in scale to China's AG600 amphibious plane and could be used for logistics, search and rescue, or even military applications. Key design features include a large v-tail and a blended nose, but questions remain about its propulsion system. This development signals a renewed global interest in WIG technology for efficient transport over large bodies of water.</p>
