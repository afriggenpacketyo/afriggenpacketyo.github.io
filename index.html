Jeffries cited Mamdani's focus on the affordability crisis and his commitment to representing all New Yorkers as key reasons for his support. This endorsement adds to a growing list of powerful backers for Mamdani, including Governor Kathy Hochul and Senator Bernie Sanders, consolidating Democratic establishment support around his campaign against former Governor Andrew Cuomo.</p>

          <p>The United States is significantly escalating its military presence in the Caribbean by deploying the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, to the region. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated the move is part of a campaign to target drug traffickers, following recent airstrikes that killed alleged narco-terrorists. This deployment, which includes other warships and F-35 aircraft, has drawn condemnation and sparked debate over its legality and true intentions, with some experts suggesting it is an intimidation tactic aimed at the Venezuelan government of Nicolás Maduro.</p>

          <p>Actress Denise Richards has publicly refuted a claim made by her ex-husband, Charlie Sheen, by posting a photo of a $1 million check from him that she never cashed. Sheen had recently stated on a podcast that Richards had surprisingly cashed the check, which he gave as a symbolic gift, a month after receiving it. Richards' Instagram story showed the check dated December 24, 2011, questioning if it was still valid, thereby challenging Sheen's narrative of the event. The exchange occurs amidst Richards' contentious divorce from Aaron Phypers.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Portland, Oregon, has rejected an immediate request from the Trump administration to lift an order that blocks the deployment of federalized National Guard troops to the city. Judge Karin Immergut stated she would make a final decision by Monday, citing the government's previous attempt to evade her initial ruling as a reason for the delay. This legal battle is part of a series of lawsuits across the country challenging President Trump's authority to send military forces into cities over the objections of local officials.</p>

          <p>A detailed examination of the Ontario-sponsored advertisement that led to the collapse of US-Canada trade talks reveals that while it used former President Ronald Reagan's exact words, it altered their original order and context. The ad compiled several of Reagan's anti-tariff statements from a 1987 radio address to create a powerful, seamless argument for free trade. However, the original speech also included context about Reagan's own decision to impose tariffs on Japan for unfair trade practices, a nuance omitted from the one-minute commercial that drew President Trump's ire.</p>

          <p>The recent significant U.S. military deployment to the Caribbean, publicly framed as an anti-drug trafficking operation, is likely an intimidation campaign aimed at forcing regime change in Venezuela, according to regional experts. The buildup, which includes warships, fighter jets, and the CIA, is seen as a strategy to pressure President Nicolás Maduro's inner circle and military to turn against him. Analysts argue that the operation's focus and scale are inconsistent with typical counter-narcotics efforts, suggesting the primary goal is to destabilize the Maduro government rather than solely combat drug smuggling.</p>

          <h2>UK's Top Prosecutor Blames Collapsed China Spy Case on Security Official's Testimony</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Director of Public Prosecutions, Stephen Parkinson, has stated that a high-profile espionage case against two men collapsed because a top national security official was unwilling to testify that China was considered an "enemy" of the state. Parkinson explained in a letter to MPs that the official's refusal to categorize China as hostile during the period of the alleged spying was "fatal to the case." This revelation shifts the focus of the controversy from political decisions to the specific testimony provided by government security advisors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicated that U.S. inflation rose at a 3% annual rate in September, a cooler pace than the 3.1% that economists had predicted. The report suggests that the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on consumer prices has so far been somewhat muted. This inflation data is particularly significant as it is used to calculate the annual cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security and could influence the Federal Reserve's upcoming decision on interest rates.

          <p>Dahbia Benkired, 27, has been given a whole-life sentence for the sexual assault and murder of 12-year-old Lola Daviet in Paris in 2022, a case that deeply shocked the nation. This is the harshest possible penalty in the French legal system, requiring her to serve a minimum of 30 years, and marks the first time it has been imposed on a woman. The case gained political attention as Benkired was an Algerian immigrant under an order to leave France, which was seized upon by right-wing politicians.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel is scheduled to travel to China next month as part of the Trump administration's effort to crack down on the international supply of fentanyl precursor chemicals. The visit aims to address the flow of these substances from China, which the administration blames for fueling the U.S. opioid crisis. This diplomatic effort aligns with President Trump's stated intention to make fentanyl a primary topic of discussion in his upcoming meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, highlighting the issue's high priority.</p>

          <p>With two months until Christmas, major retailers are preparing for a holiday shopping season marked by more cautious and price-savvy consumers. Companies like Kohl's are launching their holiday marketing campaigns earlier than usual to capture spending from shoppers who are making more frequent, smaller purchases to find the best deals. Executives expect consumers, particularly in the middle-income bracket, to be highly responsive to promotions and potentially trade down to private-label brands as they navigate budget constraints amid economic uncertainty.
