          <p>Small business owners are facing significant challenges due to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, with some fearing they may lose their businesses and even their homes. Beth Benike, owner of Busy Baby, is struggling to afford the tariffs on her products made in China and may be forced to sell out and close down. Retailers are also adapting, allowing customers to stockpile baby registry gifts due to uncertainty about product availability. Economic analysts suggest that tariffs could add thousands of dollars to families' expenses, making it a difficult economic environment for small businesses.</p>

          <p>After a four-day conflict, India and Pakistan have seemingly pulled back from the brink, but underlying tensions remain. The clash involved new military technology, including airstrikes, antiaircraft volleys, and weaponized drones, escalating the conflict. International diplomacy played a crucial role in de-escalation, but the political realities in both countries, gripped by religious nationalism, persist. The need for weapons sales from abroad provides outside influence, but both sides appear determined to maintain the upper hand, potentially leading to future confrontations.</p>

          <p>Despite business leaders laying off employees in anticipation of AI taking over their jobs, generative AI platforms are not yet at a point where they can fully replace human workers. Research indicates that AI chatbots have not had a significant impact on earnings or recorded hours in any occupation. Business owners would like to replace employees with AI, but the technology is not advanced enough, it's too expensive to build AI systems, and businesses are hesitant to give up data and intellectual property to tech companies. While AI is expected to advance, it is still years away from fully replacing human employees.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the selective application of "freedom of choice" by the Trump administration, which promotes expanding options for consumers while restricting political and intellectual choices. This divergence marks a shift toward a new form of authoritarianism that honors libertarianism only in the realm of consumerism. The administration's policies limit options in areas such as education, expression, and voting, contrasting with the historical link between economic and political freedoms in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The partnership between President Trump and Elon Musk is ending, with Musk's influence in Washington declining. Musk's reputation as a jack-of-all-trades has been damaged, and his Tesla sales have plummeted. After initially supporting Musk's cost-cutting efforts, Trump grew critical of Musk's public criticism of policies and appointees. Musk's attempt to influence a Wisconsin election backfired, leading to his diminished role in the administration. The article suggests that the American system of government has no room for an unelected co-president.</p>

President Trump praised the diplomatic efforts but did not indicate whether new sanctions would be imposed. Russia, however, has not agreed to a cease-fire and resumed long-range drone attacks on Ukraine, indicating continued tensions despite diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <p>President Putin's offer of direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul, without an immediate cease-fire, is seen as a potential attempt to divide the US and European leaders. The Kremlin's proposal is viewed with skepticism by Kyiv and may be a tactic to prolong the war and gain more territory. While Putin claims to want peace, his actions suggest he seeks peace only on Russia's terms, aiming to maintain a good relationship with the Trump administration and secure sanctions relief.</p>

While extreme preppers gain media attention, the practice is widespread, with about half of Americans engaging in preparedness measures. The author connects prepping to a neoliberal condition where inadequate government responses to disasters lead individuals to take responsibility for their own safety through consumption choices. The ultra-rich participate in conspicuous consumption by preparing for the end of the world, while middle-class individuals engage in smaller-scale prepping.</p>
