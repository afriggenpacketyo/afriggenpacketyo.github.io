This cultural shift includes adult children cutting off contact with parents, expecting them to ensure career success and mental well-being, which further contributes to the declining fertility rates among millennials.</p>

Examples like the tailorbird's nest-building and a border collie's herding instincts are used to illustrate the interplay between innate tendencies and learned behaviors.

          <p>China has signed a convention forming a global mediation-based dispute resolution organization in Hong Kong, seeking to grow its status similar to bodies such as the International Court of Justice (ICJ). More than 30 countries backed the Convention on the Establishment of the International Organization for Mediation in Hong Kong. This move comes amid the US's diminishing presence in global affairs as China seeks to fill the gap left by the US under President Trump.</p>

          <p>A lawsuit filed in Washington state claims oil companies are responsible for the death of a woman in Seattle during a record-breaking heat wave in 2021. The suit alleges that oil companies knew for decades that burning fossil fuels alters the Earth's atmosphere, resulting in more extreme weather, but deceived consumers about the risks.
