          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that President Trump can terminate the protected status of approximately 500,000 immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela while an appeal of the president's order is pending. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, arguing that the majority had "botched" the assessment and that the decision would inflict maximum pre-decision damage. She emphasized that court-ordered stays are meant to minimize harm to litigating parties, not maximize it, and that the balance of equities favored the immigrants. The ruling allows the Trump administration to proceed with its plans to end the humanitarian parole program, potentially leading to the deportation of those affected.

          <p>The United States is implementing a visa crackdown on Chinese students with ties to the Communist Party, echoing restrictions from President Trump's first term. While Beijing previously accused the U.S. of "regime change" in response to similar measures, its response this time has been more restrained, with the Foreign Ministry denouncing the move as discriminatory and lodging diplomatic protests. Observers suggest that China's measured approach stems from its focus on crucial trade negotiations with the Trump administration and a belief that such policies will ultimately harm the U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the U.S. would "aggressively revoke" visas for Chinese students with connections to the ruling party or studying in "critical fields," while tightening scrutiny of visa applications from mainland China and Hong Kong.

          <p>President Trump has reacted strongly to the viral "TACO trade" meme, which stands for "Trump always chickens out," a jab at his tariff policies. The phrase, coined by a Financial Times columnist, mocks the president's repeated delays and backing down on tariff demands against countries like China and EU nations. Investors engage in the "TACO trade" by buying stocks at lower costs after Trump announces new tariffs, then profiting when the markets rebound as he delays or softens the tariffs. When asked about the meme, Trump defended his decision to slash tariffs on China and push back deadlines for tariffs on European Union countries, calling the question "nasty."

          <p>A higher education expert says that the House Republicans' plan for student loans, included in the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," could lead to "indentured servitude" due to proposed 30-year repayment terms. Currently, most student loan repayment plans range from 10 to 25 years, which already raises concerns about people carrying education debt into middle age. Under the House GOP's bill, there would be two repayment options: fixed payments over 10 to 25 years, or an income-driven repayment plan called the "Repayment Assistance Plan" with loan forgiveness after three decades. Payments on RAP would range from 1% to 10% of a borrower's income, with higher earners paying more. The optimism score for this article is 30.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York Times opinion piece explores the reasons why millennials are increasingly hesitant about having children, noting that the U.S. fertility rate has fallen to a record low. The article suggests that this trend may result in millennials having the highest rate of childlessness of any generational cohort in American history. Explanations for this trend include the high cost of raising children, difficulty finding the right partner, career prioritization, concerns about climate change, and the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The author also posits that evolving definitions of harm and trauma, along with higher expectations for parental accountability, contribute to the pressure and perceived difficulty of parenting.

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has updated its guidance on COVID-19 vaccines for children, now stating that healthy children "may receive" the vaccines rather than issuing a broad recommendation for all children. This change follows an announcement by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that the agency would stop recommending COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women. The new guidance emphasizes "shared clinical decision-making," meaning that vaccination decisions are informed by the clinical judgment of healthcare providers and the preferences of parents. The agency still recommends COVID-19 vaccines for moderately or severely immunocompromised children and most adults. The optimism score for this article is 60.</p>

Senator David McCormick stated that U.S. Steel would have an American CEO and a majority of its board members from the U.S., and that the U.S. would have a golden share requiring government approval of board members to ensure production levels are maintained.

          <p>The Trump administration's actions against Harvard University, including stripping its Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification and demanding protest footage, are viewed as a threat to academic freedom. These actions began with demands for Harvard to abolish DEI offices, ban masks during protests, and audit departments for "viewpoint diversity," leading to a lawsuit from Harvard. The administration justified its actions by invoking Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, but critics argue that proper enforcement requires an investigation, negotiation, and formal hearing, none of which occurred. This has far-reaching implications for higher education, as the administration threatens other institutions to comply with its demands. The optimism score for this article is 30.</p>
