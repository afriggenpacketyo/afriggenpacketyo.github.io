          <p>Keurig Dr Pepper announced an $18 billion acquisition of Dutch coffee and tea company JDE Peet's, a strategic move to revitalize its struggling U.S. coffee division. The deal, valued at 15.7 billion euros, is projected to generate $400 million in cost synergies over three years. Following this, Keurig Dr Pepper plans to split its beverage and coffee units into two separate, U.S.-listed companies, effectively unwinding their 2018 merger. This aims to enhance appeal to at-home coffee drinkers and expand into cold coffee offerings. (not investment advice)</p>

This summer is already among the hottest on record, making the incoming rain welcome after a dry period.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 saw a slight dip, with Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 also falling. Shares of windfarm developer Orsted tumbled by approximately 18% after U.S. authorities ordered a halt to construction on a key project, impacting its capital-raising plans.

          <p>Daniil Medvedev was eliminated from the US Open in a dramatic first-round defeat to Benjamin Bonzi, a match marred by an on-court incident involving a photographer. As Medvedev faced match point, a cameraman entered the court, leading to a six-minute delay, a heated exchange with the umpire, and a change in momentum. Medvedev's furious reaction ignited the crowd, but despite his efforts to rally support, he ultimately lost a five-set thriller. The photographer's credential was revoked, and Medvedev expressed deep frustration, even contemplating ending his career.</p>

          <p>Singapore's inflation rate eased to a lower-than-expected 0.6% in July, marking its lowest point since January 2021, with core inflation also dipping to 0.5%. This moderation was primarily driven by falling retail, electricity, and gas prices, despite a rise in private transport costs. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) projects continued moderate inflation and has already eased monetary policy twice this year due to a "downshift" in global trade. Analysts suggest this data strengthens the case for further MAS monetary loosening in October. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following Donald Trump's re-election, a growing number of Americans are relocating to Europe, driven by concerns over the increasingly polarized U.S. political climate and perceived threats to personal safety. Relocation firms report a surge in inquiries, and applications for European citizenships have risen significantly. Personal accounts highlight relief at escaping issues like gun violence and policies affecting gender identity, but also express sorrow over leaving loved ones. Many believe the underlying societal issues extend beyond a single administration, prompting long-term emigration plans.</p>

          <p>China is on the verge of a significant turbine leap with the development of an airship-like floating wind power generation system, designed for remote and disaster-stricken areas. Developed by Beijing SAWES Energy Technology Company in collaboration with Tsinghua University, a 1MW unit is preparing for its test flight. An earlier, smaller iteration successfully transmitted electricity from 1,000 meters altitude in January, proving the technology's feasibility. This innovation promises a flexible and efficient power solution where conventional supplies are inadequate.</p>
