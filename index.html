          <p>Thousands of protesters, including families of hostages held in Gaza, have demonstrated across Israel against the government's plan to expand its military operation. Critics, including military leaders, fear the strategy endangers the remaining hostages and risks a protracted occupation, with some former soldiers now refusing to serve. The government, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, maintains that military pressure is necessary to secure the hostages' release. This internal dissent highlights a growing divide within Israel, as polls suggest a majority favor a deal with Hamas to end the war and bring the captives home.</p>

          <p>The Japanese boxing community is in mourning after two fighters, Shigetoshi Kotari and Hiromasa Urakawa, both 28, died from brain injuries sustained in separate bouts on the same day. Both men suffered subdural hematomas during an event at Tokyo's Korakuen Hall and passed away after undergoing emergency surgery. The tragedies have ignited an urgent debate over boxing safety in Japan, prompting calls for stricter regulations. In response, the Japan Boxing Commission has already announced that certain championship bouts will be shortened from 12 rounds to 10.</p>

          <p>Drawing on her grandmother's experience of surviving starvation in the Warsaw ghetto, the author presents a personal and historical perspective on the current hunger crisis in Gaza. The article argues that ensuring basic physiological needs like food and water must transcend political ideologies and security concerns. It critiques the semantic debates over terms like "genocide" while people are starving, emphasizing that human dignity demands immediate humanitarian action. The author concludes that intergenerational trauma should foster empathy and a collective cry for the most vulnerable, placing the need for sustenance above all else.</p>

          <p>A U.S. permanent resident, Luu Anh Tuan, has been sentenced to 16 years in a Vietnamese prison on charges his advocates claim are manipulated by pro-China actors. Tuan was developing rare earth separation technology that could have challenged China's near-monopoly on the critical minerals essential for modern electronics and defense systems. His arrest occurred shortly after he signed an agreement to transfer this technology to a U.S. company, a move seen as a direct threat to Beijing's market dominance. The case highlights China's aggressive tactics to maintain its stranglehold on the global rare earth supply chain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This speculative article imagines the first 200 days of a second Donald Trump term, portraying a rapid consolidation of power and an assault on democratic institutions. It describes a series of authoritarian actions, such as prosecuting political opponents, firing government statisticians, and using federal power to intimidate media and academia. While framed as a hypothetical future scenario, the piece serves as a stark warning from critics who see current political trends pointing toward an erosion of democratic norms. The analysis suggests that a potential second term would be far more systematic in its efforts to expand executive authority.</p>

The article asserts that policies such as tariffs, healthcare changes, and cuts to federal agencies like the NIH and FEMA are causing tangible harm to ordinary Americans. The authors, identifying as lifelong conservatives, suggest that the administration's actions are reckless and inept. They conclude that highlighting these failures of governance and their human cost is the most effective path for opponents to challenge his support.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is experiencing a new "gold rush" centered on artificial intelligence, with billions in venture capital funding transforming the city's economy and social fabric. The rise of major AI companies like OpenAI and Anthropic is filling office spaces left vacant after the pandemic and infusing the city with energy. However, this boom is accompanied by anxiety over the high cost of living, potential job displacement due to automation, and the ethical implications of the technology. From interactive museum exhibits to ubiquitous tech billboards, AI's presence is reshaping San Francisco's identity and future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 1988 film "Miracle Mile," which depicts a frantic, real-time race to escape Los Angeles before an imminent nuclear strike, has found a renewed audience and cult status in recent years. The movie begins as a romance before an errant phone call plunges its protagonist into city-wide chaos, all set against iconic locations along Wilshire Boulevard. Written and directed by Steve De Jarnatt, the film is noted for its unique blend of romance, dark humor, and suspense, capturing what one author called "the kind of apocalypse that L.A. people imagine." Its enduring appeal lies in its affection for the city and its poignant, bittersweet ending.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid confusion over recycling rules and the failure of many items to be properly processed, the reuse movement is emerging as a potential solution to the waste crisis. Instead of single-use items, this model promotes systems where food and beverage containers can be returned, washed, and reused. A successful 12-week pilot program in Petaluma, California, saw over 50% of reusable cups returned, surpassing the environmental break-even point compared to disposable cups. Backed by major corporations, the initiative demonstrated that community-wide participation can effectively drive new, sustainable consumer behaviors.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As cities like Los Angeles and Bangkok grapple with increasingly severe flooding and drought, some urban planners are championing the "sponge city" model. This approach uses green infrastructure, such as parks and wetlands, to absorb, clean, and store stormwater rather than quickly flushing it away through concrete channels. A park in Bangkok, built on the site of an old factory, successfully captures millions of gallons of runoff, demonstrating how this method can mitigate flood risk while creating recreational spaces. While L.A. has initiated similar projects, progress has been slow, facing bureaucratic and financial hurdles.</p>

          <p>Despite being a symbolic center of resistance to federal immigration enforcement, California has seen fewer total ICE arrests than Texas or Florida in the first five months of the Trump administration's second term. An analysis of federal data reveals that when adjusted for population, California ranks even lower, at 27th in the nation. Experts attribute this to a lack of cooperation from local law enforcement in "sanctuary" jurisdictions, which forces federal agents to conduct more visible and challenging street-level arrests. However, California did experience one of the country's most dramatic percentage increases in arrests during this period.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is dismissing the asylum cases of numerous immigrants, some of whom have been in the U.S. for years, because they did not undergo a "credible fear" interview upon entry. Immigration attorneys report their clients are receiving letters from USCIS administratively closing their applications, effectively forcing them to restart a years-long process. This situation arose because the U.S. lacked sufficient asylum officers to conduct these mandatory screenings during a period of high border crossings.

          <h2>Small Piece of a Bathroom Door Lock Becomes Key Evidence in Minnesota Murder Case</h2>

          <p>A small, round metal piece from a bathroom door lock proved to be the crucial evidence that led to a murder conviction in the 2022 death of Minnesota nurse Alexandra Pennig. Initially, her colleague Matthew Ecker claimed Pennig had locked herself in the bathroom and died by suicide. However, investigators found the piece of the lock underneath Pennig's body. This discovery indicated that Ecker had broken the door down *before* she was shot and fell, contradicting his story. This single piece of evidence allowed detectives to prove Ecker had lied, leading to his conviction for second-degree murder.</p>

          <h2>Los Angeles Officials Urge Porter Ranch and Granada Hills Residents to Stop All Water Use During Outage</h2>

          <p>Officials in Los Angeles are pleading with approximately 9,200 households in the Porter Ranch and Granada Hills neighborhoods to cease all water use, including flushing toilets, amid a multi-day service outage. The outage began Tuesday when a major water control valve broke, and a boil water advisory remains in effect. Although some water flow has been restored, officials warn that continued consumption is depleting pressure in a 10-million-gallon tank that crews are trying to refill. This is delaying the complex underground repairs and pushing back the timeline for a full restoration of safe, reliable water service.</p>

          <p>Northern China's traditional rainy season in July and August has once again brought severe flooding to the region, marking the fifth major disaster of its kind since 2012. This year's event is considered unusual because the storms and resulting floods have been concentrated in the northern parts of Beijing. In contrast, previous major floods in the capital, such as those in 2016 and 2023, primarily affected the southern areas. The recurring nature of these deadly floods raises ongoing questions about the city's infrastructure and its resilience to extreme weather events.</p>

          <p>New Barcelona signing Marcus Rashford is set to make his home debut, but his first weeks at the Spanish club have been overshadowed by chaos. The club has been navigating a dispute with captain Marc-Andre ter Stegen and a race to meet La Liga's financial rules to register new players. Furthermore, significant delays in the reconstruction of the Camp Nou stadium mean his debut will be at the small training ground stadium. Despite the off-field drama, Rashford has made a promising start in pre-season games, impressing with his performance and potentially securing a key role.</p>

          <p>This commentary expresses alarm over the accelerating global nuclear arms race and the conspicuous lack of widespread public protest seen in previous eras. The author points to Russia's abandonment of the INF treaty, the buildup of nuclear-capable weapons in Europe by NATO, and increased spending by all nine nuclear states as evidence of a dangerous trend. Unlike the Cold War, nuclear weapons are increasingly viewed as offensive, usable weapons, and the collapse of arms-control treaties removes crucial safety nets. The piece serves as a call to action, questioning why the public is not more vocal about the growing threat of nuclear oblivion.</p>

          <p>A BBC reporter provides a first-person account of going undercover to infiltrate a violent migrant-smuggling gang in northern France. Posing as a Syrian refugee, he navigated the dangerous environment of the smugglers' forest camps near Dunkirk to meet a senior gang member. The operation, which was the culmination of months of work, required a detailed cover story, careful management of multiple identities, and the use of a secret camera. The reporter describes the constant risk of the investigation, which has since led to an arrest, highlighting the perilous nature of these criminal networks.</p>

          <p>Despite finding security in Germany, female refugees face significant challenges entering the workforce, with employment rates far below their male counterparts. Studies show they face a "threefold disadvantage" as women, immigrants, and refugees, often compounded by childcare responsibilities and a lack of recognized qualifications. Various nonprofit and publicly funded projects are working to address these hurdles. They offer tailored support, including counseling, job fairs, and mentoring, often staffed by women who have been through the same experience, creating a chain of support to help others achieve economic independence.</p>
