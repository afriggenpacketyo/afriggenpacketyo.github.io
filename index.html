          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has filed a lawsuit against Fox News for at least $787 million, alleging the network defamed him. The suit centers on comments made by host Jesse Watters, who claimed Newsom lied about not receiving a phone call from President Donald Trump. The requested damages notably mirror the amount Fox paid to settle the Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit, with Newsom's legal team arguing the network willfully distorted facts to curry favor with the former president and attack a political opponent.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump celebrated a 6-3 Supreme Court decision that limits the power of lower court judges to issue nationwide injunctions against his administration's policies. The ruling came in a case related to his executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship, though the justices did not rule on the constitutionality of the order itself. Instead, the court's conservative majority focused on reining in the ability of a single federal judge to block a president's policy across the entire country, which Trump lauded as a "monumental win."</p>

          <p>In a landmark 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court affirmed that parents possess a constitutional right to exempt their children from public school instruction that conflicts with their sincere religious beliefs. The case originated from a lawsuit by a multi-faith group of parents in Montgomery County, Maryland, who opposed the school board's mandate to include storybooks with LGBTQ themes without an opt-out provision. Justice Samuel Alito's majority opinion found that denying this choice imposes an unconstitutional burden on the parents' right to guide their children's religious upbringing.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld a Texas law requiring pornography websites to verify their visitors' ages, a ruling with broad implications for online content moderation nationwide. In its 6-3 decision, the court dismissed claims from adult entertainment companies that such laws infringe on free speech and pose privacy risks. This ruling sets a significant legal precedent for the dozens of other states that have enacted similar age-verification laws, which have already led major sites like Pornhub to block access in those regions.</p>

          <p>In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court has limited the authority of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions, which have been used to halt policies from both Republican and Democratic administrations. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, in the majority opinion, stated that such sweeping orders likely overstep the power granted to courts by Congress. The ruling arose from legal challenges to President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship, but the court focused squarely on the scope of judicial power rather than the order's constitutionality.</p>

While the decision in the birthright citizenship case restricts the use of such broad orders, it does not eliminate them entirely. The opinion suggests that injunctions may still be issued when necessary to provide "complete relief" to plaintiffs, potentially allowing for a nationwide block in this very case and setting a standard that could also benefit future administrations by limiting the power of single judges.</p>
