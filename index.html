          <p>Protesters disrupted a photo opportunity for Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller with National Guard troops at Union Station in Washington, D.C. Demonstrators chanted "Free DC," effectively drowning out the officials who were there to thank the guardsmen and provide lunch. Vance and Miller dismissed the hecklers as "crazy" and "communists," asserting that the protesters disliked the idea of Americans enjoying their communities. Vance defended the troops' presence at Union Station by claiming it was overrun with homeless people and unsafe, though he offered no specific evidence for his broader assertions about crime statistics. The event took place as D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser was holding a separate news conference.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York has denied the Department of Justice's request to unseal grand jury materials from the criminal case of Jeffrey Epstein. The Trump administration had been actively seeking to release these records, which pertain to the investigation into the wealthy financier and convicted sex offender who died by suicide in jail in 2019. This judicial decision means that sensitive information from the grand jury proceedings will remain sealed, at least for the time being, impacting the public's access to further details about the high-profile case. The article highlights that this legal development is still unfolding.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has invested at least $100 million in bonds since assuming office in January, according to newly public filings with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics. These extensive purchases, outlined across 33 pages, include debt issued by local U.S. governments, various districts, and major American corporations like T-Mobile, United Health, Home Depot, Facebook, and Instagram parent Meta. The investments, which generate interest payments, indicate a significant increase in his net worth since his first term.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has publicly demanded the resignation of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, following allegations of mortgage fraud made by Bill Pulte, his appointee as director of the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency. Pulte claims Cook falsified bank and property records to secure more favorable loan terms by designating two homes as primary residences. This call for resignation comes as Trump continues to pressure the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, with Cook being a member of the committee that votes on rate decisions. The Federal Reserve and White House have not yet commented on the accusations, and Cook is unlikely to resign before the next FOMC meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

However, he noted Putin's current reluctance to commit to talks, warning that continued refusal would lead to further sanctions from Europe and the U.S. Wadephul also connected the Ukraine conflict to broader global stability, including the Taiwan Strait, and discussed Germany's strategy to diversify trade partners away from China.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has revoked the security clearances of 37 current and former U.S. intelligence officials, acting on President Donald Trump's orders.

While no specific evidence was offered for the accusations, Gabbard stated that holding a security clearance is a privilege, not a right. Democrats have criticized these actions as politically motivated distractions, particularly given the Trump administration's previous revocations and skepticism regarding Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While reverse mortgages can be a valuable financial tool for older Americans to access home equity, strict requirements often lead to disqualification. Common barriers include not meeting the minimum age of 62 (or 55 for proprietary loans), insufficient home equity (typically 50% needed), and failure to meet FHA property condition standards, which can require significant repairs. Additionally, issues with credit or the financial assessment—such as unresolved bankruptcies or inability to cover ongoing property expenses—can prevent approval. Mandatory counseling with a HUD-approved agency is also a prerequisite for this loan type. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has paused student loan forgiveness under the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan, a popular program designed to make loan bills affordable and cancel remaining debt after 20 or 25 years. Lawmakers, including Senator Bernie Sanders, have urged the Education Department to resume the debt cancellation, arguing it's legally mandated aid. The department cited recent court actions involving the SAVE plan as the reason for the freeze, needing time to establish correct payment counts. While the hold primarily impacts borrowers nearing forgiveness, payments made under IBR still count towards future cancellation. (not investment advice)</p>
