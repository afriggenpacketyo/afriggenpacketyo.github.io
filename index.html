          <p>OpenAI announced that its ChatGPT platform is poised to reach 700 million weekly active users, a fourfold increase year-over-year, with daily user messages surpassing three billion. This rapid expansion is supported by a recent $8.3 billion investment, part of a larger $40 billion fundraising round, as the company's annual recurring revenue hits $13 billion. The growth highlights intense competition in the AI sector, with rivals like Google and Anthropic also securing massive funding and expanding their user bases. OpenAI is heavily investing in global infrastructure, including a $500 billion Stargate joint venture, to support its continued push.</p>

The boy received a 12-month detention order, while the girl received a nine-month order; both are banned for life from owning animals. The investigation revealed the crime was premeditated, involving blowtorches and knives, and uncovered disturbing content on the teenagers' phones, including notes from the boy about his desire to murder a person.

          <p>Amazon is reorganizing its audio division, leading to the termination of approximately 110 positions at its Wondery podcast unit and the departure of Wondery's CEO, Jen Sargent. The restructuring involves consolidating Wondery's narrative podcast teams under Audible, while its creator-led shows will move to a new "creator services" unit. This move aims to better align the company's strategy with the evolving podcast landscape, particularly the rise of video podcasts on platforms like YouTube. The changes come nearly five years after Amazon acquired Wondery to expand its original audio content.</p>

          <p>Catherine Hoggle, a Maryland woman with a history of severe mental illness, has been re-arrested and charged with the murder of her two young children, who disappeared in 2014. The new indictment came shortly after Hoggle's release from a state psychiatric hospital where she was held for years after being repeatedly found incompetent to stand trial. Her children, Sarah and Jacob, were 3 and 2 when they vanished and have never been found. The case has seen numerous legal turns, including the dismissal of previous murder charges in 2022 due to a five-year competency restoration limit.</p>

          <p>Actor Josh Brolin is making his debut in the horror genre with the film "Weapons," where he portrays a father searching for his missing child. Brolin explained that he was drawn to the role as a creative challenge and an opportunity to confront themes of masculinity and vulnerability. Known for major roles in "Avengers" and "Dune," he stated he deliberately avoided horror projects while raising his children but was intrigued by the challenge of a new genre. The film, which explores a man's reaction when the thing he cares about most is taken away, is set to open in theaters soon.</p>

The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 837 turned down a proposal that included a 20% general wage increase and improved retirement benefits. The union stated the offer did not adequately reflect the workers' skill and dedication to national defense. This marks the first strike for this work group since 1996, while Boeing has activated a contingency plan to continue supporting its customers with non-striking employees.</p>

          <p>The European Union has announced it will suspend its planned retaliatory tariffs against the United States for six months, a move intended to de-escalate trade tensions and allow for further negotiations. The countermeasures were set to take effect this week in response to a U.S. trade deal that imposed 15% tariffs on most European goods. This decision follows a political agreement reached between European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and U.S. President Donald Trump in late July. The EU Commission stated the goal is to restore stability and predictability for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recent controversy surrounding Sydney Sweeney's American Eagle ad, coupled with revelations of her Republican voter registration, has sparked a debate about the risks celebrities face when engaging with politics. The situation was amplified by President Trump's praise for the ad, which some critics had labeled as promoting white supremacist ideas for its "great jeans/genes" wordplay. PR experts cited in this article suggest that declaring a political affiliation can be a massive risk, especially for a rising star, potentially alienating audiences and leading to reputational "carnage."

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More than 10,000 hotels across Europe have joined a class-action lawsuit against the online travel platform Booking.com, seeking compensation for alleged damages. The complaint, supported by European and national hotel associations, centers on the company's past use of "best-price" clauses. These clauses prevented hotels from offering lower room rates on their own websites, a practice a European court found to be illegal. The lawsuit claims these anti-competitive practices caused financial losses for hoteliers between 2004 and 2024, while Booking.com has stated it has not yet received an official lawsuit and rejects the claims.</p>

          <p>Eurostar passengers are experiencing significant delays and cancellations due to a power supply issue that closed a high-speed rail line in northern France. The problem, which began Monday morning, has forced trains between London and Paris to be diverted onto slower routes, with disruptions expected to last all day. At least nine services have been canceled and many more are delayed during a peak travel period. Eurostar has advised passengers to postpone their journeys if possible, marking another challenging incident for the cross-Channel rail operator in recent months.</p>

          <p>A 22-year-old man has been charged and remanded in custody for his alleged role in a protest at RAF Brize Norton that caused an estimated £7 million in damage to two military aircraft. The incident in June, claimed by the group Palestine Action, involved protesters breaking into the air base and spray-painting the planes. The man faces charges of criminal damage and compromising UK security and is the fifth person to be charged in connection with the break-in. Palestine Action was proscribed as a terrorist organization by the UK government shortly after the incident occurred.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department is proposing a pilot program that would require some tourist and business visa applicants to post a bond of up to $15,000 to enter the country. The proposal targets individuals from countries with high rates of visa overstays or deficient security controls. According to a notice, the program is intended to ensure the U.S. government is not financially liable if a visitor violates the terms of their visa. This move is part of a broader tightening of visa requirements by the Trump administration and could make travel to the U.S. unaffordable for many potential visitors.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has announced that a makeshift migrant detention center in the Florida Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," will serve as a model for a new federal strategy. The plan involves establishing similar state-run detention facilities near airports in states like Arizona, Nebraska, and Louisiana to expedite the processing and deportation of unauthorized migrants. Noem stated this model is more cost-effective and efficient than current contracts with private prison companies. The strategy has drawn criticism from legal experts who question the legality of state-run immigration detention and from attorneys citing inhumane conditions at the Florida site.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has vowed to protect the Texas Democratic lawmakers who fled their state to prevent a vote on a Republican-led redistricting plan. Describing their actions as a "righteous act of courage," Pritzker stated his administration would do everything possible to support them. This promise comes after Texas Governor Greg Abbott threatened to have the absent lawmakers expelled or even arrested for breaking quorum. The Texas Democrats' protest is aimed at blocking a new congressional map, backed by Donald Trump, that they argue is designed to rig elections and disenfranchise minority voters.</p>

          <p>NORAD fighter jets were scrambled to intercept a civilian aircraft that violated the temporary restricted airspace over President Trump's property in Bedminster, New Jersey. The incident was one of seven such violations over the weekend. To get the pilot's attention, the jets deployed flares before safely escorting the plane out of the area. NORAD routinely establishes temporary flight restrictions when the president is at his New Jersey or Florida properties and has urged pilots to be vigilant about checking for these notices, warning that "ignorance is not a defense."</p>

          <p>Military surgeons are raising alarms that the improper use of tourniquets on the battlefield in Ukraine is leading to a massive number of preventable amputations and deaths. One senior U.S. medical officer estimates that up to 75,000 of the 100,000 amputations on Ukrainian soldiers were caused by tourniquets being applied incorrectly or left on for too long. Due to prolonged evacuation times, the two-hour safe window for tourniquet use is often exceeded, causing tissue death. Experts argue that a "cult-like" dependence on the device, which should be a last resort, has created a tragedy for a generation of soldiers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts predict that interest rates for Certificates of Deposit (CDs) will likely remain stable through August, as the Federal Reserve holds its benchmark rate steady amid a recent uptick in inflation. While some banks have already started to slightly lower their CD rates in anticipation of future Fed cuts, the general forecast is for continued stability in the short term. Experts note that short-term CDs currently offer more competitive rates than long-term ones, as banks are hesitant to lock in high rates for extended periods. Savers are advised to research different banks to find the best available rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers have announced a major breakthrough, identifying the cause of the sea star wasting disease that has killed over five billion sea stars along North America's Pacific coast since 2013. The culprit is a bacteria, Vibrio pectenicida, which was also found to infect shellfish. The epidemic has devastated more than 20 species, with the sunflower sea star population declining by about 90%. This discovery solves a decade-long mystery and provides hope for recovery efforts, as scientists can now test for the bacteria, breed healthy sea stars, and work to restore the kelp forest ecosystems that collapsed in their absence.</p>
