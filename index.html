        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey is scheduled to appear in a Virginia court to face charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. The indictment stems from testimony he gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2020 regarding his handling of investigations into Hillary Clinton's emails and Russian election interference. The charges have reignited political debate, with critics of former President Trump alleging the weaponization of the Justice Department, while supporters view it as accountability for what they see as partisan actions during his tenure.</p>

          <p>France is experiencing significant political instability following the resignation of its fifth prime minister in under two years, raising alarms about the nation's fiscal health. The country's budget deficit and public debt levels far exceed European Union regulations, and the ongoing political deadlock makes implementing necessary economic reforms extremely difficult. President Emmanuel Macron has given the outgoing prime minister a 48-hour deadline to find a solution, but economists predict continued budget slippage and slow growth regardless of the outcome.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union has proposed measures to slash tariff-free quotas on imported steel and increase tariffs on excess imports from 25% to 50%, causing a rally in the stocks of major European steel producers. The move is intended to protect the industry from global overcapacity but has sparked concern among other sectors, particularly automobile manufacturers who fear rising production costs. The U.K.'s steel industry has warned that the new tariffs could pose an existential threat to its already struggling sector.</p>

          <p>Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel has sparked controversy with recent comments suggesting that Poland and the Baltic states enabled Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine by blocking a proposed EU-Russia summit in 2021. Her remarks drew sharp criticism from Polish and Baltic officials, who called the accusation absurd and accused her of deflecting from her own policy failures. Conversely, Merkel's statements were praised by the Kremlin, which claimed the EU is "held hostage" by the policies of those same nations.</p>

          <p>Josh Cavallo, who became the world's only openly gay top-flight male professional footballer in 2021, has revealed he receives daily death threats and homophobic abuse. In an interview, he stated that football still has a significant problem with homophobia and toxic masculinity, making it a difficult environment for LGBTQ+ players. Cavallo advocates for creating safer spaces within the sport and criticizes governing bodies like FIFA for hosting major tournaments in countries where same-sex relationships are criminalized, highlighting the ongoing struggle for inclusion.</p>

          <p>Kemi Badenoch, leader of the UK's Conservative party, is set to announce a new economic "golden rule" aimed at restoring fiscal responsibility. The proposed rule would mandate that half of all savings made by a future Conservative government be used to reduce the national deficit, with the other half allocated to economy-growing policies, including tax cuts. In her speech, Badenoch will contrast this plan with the Labour government's approach, which she will characterize as a "borrowing and tax doom loop."</p>

          <p>The government of Chad has terminated its 15-year agreement with African Parks, a prominent conservation charity where the Duke of Sussex serves on the board. The Chadian environment ministry accused the organization of failing to curb poaching and displaying a disrespectful attitude toward government authorities. This decision ends the charity's mandate to manage two major protected wildlife reserves in the country and adds to recent controversies surrounding the organization, including allegations of abuse by its employees in the Republic of Congo.</p>

          <h2>New Technique to Convert Blood Types in Donor Kidneys May Expand Transplant Access</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have successfully tested a method to convert the blood type of a human donor kidney, a breakthrough that could significantly reduce organ transplant waiting lists. By using enzymes to remove the blood type antigens from a donor organ, scientists aim to make it universally compatible, similar to type O blood. In an initial test, a converted kidney transplanted into a brain-dead recipient functioned for two days without signs of rejection, offering hope for more equitable and efficient use of the limited supply of donor organs.</p>

          <p>Members of the Texas National Guard have arrived at a military facility near Chicago, Illinois, in preparation for a controversial deployment to protect U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities. The deployment, ordered by the Trump administration, is being legally challenged by the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago, who argue it is an overreach of federal power. This novel situation, where one state's Guard is federalized and sent to another, has created a disconnect between federal and local governments, with local leaders largely uninformed about the mission's details.</p>

          <p>The tenth named storm of the hurricane season, Tropical Storm Jerry, has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean.

While a direct landfall is not anticipated, forecasters have issued tropical storm watches for several northern Leeward Islands, as the storm is projected to pass near or north of the region, bringing heavy rain and life-threatening surf conditions by late this week.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla has intensified into a Category 2 storm in the Pacific Ocean, with its outer bands already affecting Mexico's Baja California Sur peninsula.

Moisture from the storm system may also lead to heavy rainfall and flood risks in the U.S. Desert Southwest later in the week.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts has explained his decision to initially hold back relief pitcher Roki Sasaki in a key moment of a playoff game, citing the need to manage the rookie's workload. Sasaki, who recently returned from injury, has become the team's most dominant reliever, but the team is carefully monitoring his usage to prevent re-injury during the postseason. Although the initial plan to rest him nearly backfired, Roberts confirmed Sasaki is now the primary option for save situations, though his availability on consecutive days remains a strategic consideration.</p>

          <p>Charlie Mackesy, the acclaimed author and illustrator of the bestselling book "The Boy, The Mole, The Fox and the Horse," has revealed that his new book was significantly delayed because his iPad was stolen.

Mackesy described the theft as a setback that made him question his work, but he ultimately persevered through the loss, as well as the recent deaths of his mother and his dog.</p>

          <p>Residents of a Portland, Oregon, neighborhood are caught in the middle of nightly clashes between protesters and federal agents outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility. The unrest involves property damage and the use of tear gas, which seeps into nearby apartment buildings, creating what some describe as a "war zone." The situation has drawn national attention, with former President Trump threatening to deploy the National Guard, a move that has been temporarily blocked by a federal judge but highlights the deep divisions over protest tactics and federal authority.</p>
