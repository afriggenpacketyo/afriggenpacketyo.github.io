        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's industrial profits fell by 9.1% in May year-over-year, marking the most significant drop since last October. The National Bureau of Statistics attributed this decline to insufficient domestic demand and falling prices for industrial goods, which has squeezed profit margins. Despite a recovery in retail sales, businesses have not seen increased profitability due to widespread price wars and promotions. Economists are divided on whether this downturn will prompt Beijing to introduce further stimulus measures, as other economic indicators remain relatively robust.</p>

          <p>Approaching his first anniversary as Prime Minister, Keir Starmer's initial landslide victory has given way to a period of significant crisis and political struggle. The article explores the reasons for his short-lived political honeymoon, citing an overly cautious election campaign, internal tensions, and challenges in setting a decisive policy direction. Early decisions, such as cutting winter fuel payments, proved unpopular and were later reversed. Starmer now faces the dual challenge of navigating international conflicts and managing profound policy disagreements within his own party.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has executed a significant U-turn on its welfare reform plans following immense pressure from his own party's MPs. The capitulation occurred after a well-organized backbench campaign threatened a parliamentary defeat on the proposed cuts. This reversal has raised serious questions about the Prime Minister's authority, especially given his large majority and being less than a year in office. The event highlights the deep divisions within the Labour Party and complicates the government's efforts to project economic competence.</p>

          <p>A digest from Kyodo News highlights several major developments in Japan. The country carried out its first execution since 2022, hanging the man known as the "Twitter killer" for nine murders. The government also approved evacuation plans for the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear plant, a key step toward its restart. On the economic front, Toyota reported record global sales for May, and the White House indicated a potential extension of the 90-day pause on U.S. tariffs, easing trade tensions.</p>

          <p>The nuclear energy agreement between Germany and Brazil, signed in 1975, is now 50 years old, sparking renewed debate over its future. The treaty, which aimed to build eight nuclear plants in Brazil, has been criticized for its high costs, limited success, and environmental risks, with only one plant becoming fully operational. While the Green Party in Germany has long advocated for its termination, some politicians see value in maintaining technological partnerships. The agreement's fate is further complicated by Russia's involvement in the nuclear supply chain and a global resurgence of interest in nuclear power.</p>

Yoo had claimed she was bullied by some students, but the court found no evidence that the eight victims had insulted her.

          <p>Ahead of its tournament in Dallas, LIV Golf is emphasizing community engagement through its "Potential, Unleashed" initiative. The program partners with local school districts and charities to provide educational and training opportunities for young people, aiming to increase diversity and accessibility in the sport. The league's focus extends beyond the competition, with players like Cameron Tringale participating in golf lessons for students to break down barriers. This approach seeks to share life lessons and make the sport more inclusive for communities that have historically had less access.</p>

          <p>At a global forum in Bangkok, the UN agency UNESCO urged international collaboration to establish ethical standards for artificial intelligence.

The event highlighted a growing divide, as major AI companies from both the U.S. and China were absent.

          <p>The ACLU of Idaho has filed a federal lawsuit challenging a new state law that curtails public benefits for undocumented immigrants, including access to life-saving HIV/AIDS medication. The suit, filed on behalf of a doctor and four residents with HIV, argues the law is vague and contradicts federal statutes, putting patients' lives at risk and increasing public health dangers. The law, effective July 1, requires verification of legal U.S. residency for services like communicable disease testing and prenatal care, and appears to be the first of its kind since a 2017 Trump administration order.</p>

While Lamb states he is not currently running for office, his frequent appearances and criticism of Fetterman suggest he may be positioning himself for a future challenge.
