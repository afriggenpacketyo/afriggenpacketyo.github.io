          <p>Iran launched a barrage of missiles at Israel, resulting in casualties and prompting air raid sirens across the country, marking the fourth day of escalating conflict between the two nations. One missile landed near the American consulate in Tel Aviv, causing minor damage but no injuries to U.S. personnel. Israel responded with airstrikes on Iranian command centers in Tehran, and the Israeli Defense Minister warned that Tehran's residents would "pay the price" for the attacks. The ongoing fighting has led to the cancellation of nuclear program talks between the U.S. and Iran, raising concerns about regional stability. The situation remains tense, with both sides vowing further retaliation. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study indicates that ice jams in the Yellow River's estuary will become more frequent by the end of the century due to global warming, threatening coastal cities in eastern Shandong province. As warmer weather causes upstream ice to break apart, it drifts downstream and refreezes, forming ice jams that can lead to destructive flooding. Researchers analyzed 160 years of ice jam flood dynamics, finding that climate warming is shifting hotspots downstream. The Yellow River, known as both the cradle of Chinese civilization and "China's Sorrow," has a history of devastating floods. </p>

          <p>The owners of a formerly Michelin-starred restaurant in western Japan were arrested for defying an order to temporarily shut down following a series of food poisoning incidents. Hirokazu Kitano, his son Hirotoshi Kitano, and his wife Noriko, who operate the traditional Japanese restaurant Kiichi, allegedly violated the Food Sanitation Act. The restaurant received a two-day suspension order in February after 33 customers experienced vomiting and diarrhea, with norovirus detected. Subsequent investigations revealed that the restaurant continued to sell bento boxes during the suspension. </p>

          <p>Experts predict that up to 100 truckloads of Scotland's waste will be transported to England daily following the implementation of a landfill ban at the end of the year. The Scottish government acknowledges a lack of sufficient incinerator capacity to manage the extra demand, leading to the need for "bridging contracts" with waste handling operators in England. The ban, covering biodegradable municipal waste, aims to reduce methane emissions from landfill sites. While the long-term strategy involves increasing recycling rates, current rates have seen minimal improvement in the past decade. </p>

By engaging in conflict, the Israeli government seeks to restore its pact with its sponsors and revive the historical narrative of being the victim.

Max Yoeli from Chatham House suggests that this measure "threatens to further alienate foreign investors" by casting doubt on the U.S.'s openness.
