          <p>Senator John Fetterman has strongly criticized members of his own party, describing their shunning of Israel as “just gross” in response to proposals for recognizing a Palestinian state. The comments highlight a significant and growing rift within the Democratic party over U.S. policy toward the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This division is exemplified by differing views, such as Representative Ro Khanna's call to recognize a non-Hamas Palestinian state, which Fetterman and other pro-Israel Democrats argue rewards terrorism and weakens Israel's security. The article suggests this internal debate reflects a broader ideological struggle for the party's direction on foreign policy.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Donald Trump commented on the possibility of pardoning music mogul Sean 'Diddy' Combs, who was recently convicted on federal prostitution charges. Trump described Combs as “sort of half-innocent” but noted that a pardon would be “more difficult” due to Combs's past hostile statements against him. This situation underscores Trump's history of considering pardons for high-profile figures, while also weighing personal loyalty and public statements in his decisions. Combs is currently awaiting sentencing for flying people across the country for sexual encounters.</p>

The meeting took place amid protests in Tel Aviv where families urged for more decisive action, their desperation amplified by a recently released Hamas video showing a hostage looking emaciated. Witkoff's visit also occurred as the humanitarian situation in Gaza worsens, with reports of civilians being killed by Israeli fire near aid distribution sites, a claim that aid organizers dispute.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis highlights the stark differences in housing affordability across the United States, showing what $1,500 in monthly rent can secure in various cities. In Manhattan, that amount gets a renter an average of just 216 square feet, whereas in Wichita, Kansas, it affords a spacious 1,329 square feet. The report attributes this disparity to factors like housing supply, demand, and land availability, with large coastal cities being the most expensive. Conversely, markets in the Midwest and South offer significantly more space for the same price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Homeowners in California are experiencing a severe insurance crisis, exemplified by one Farmers Insurance customer whose premium increased by 381%. The situation reflects a broader trend where major insurers like Allstate and Nationwide have stopped issuing new policies in the state, citing increased risks from wildfires and other disasters. This problem is not confined to California, as experts project an average 8% rise in homeowners insurance nationwide. The article suggests homeowners can try to mitigate costs by increasing deductibles, bundling policies, and making their homes more disaster-resistant. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal jury in Miami ordered Tesla to pay over $240 million in damages after finding the company partially responsible for a 2019 fatal crash involving its Autopilot technology. The lawsuit argued that the system was defective and that Tesla's marketing misled drivers about its capabilities, contributing to the death of a 22-year-old woman. This verdict is highly significant, as it could embolden more lawsuits against the company, which has often settled similar cases before they reach trial, and it challenges the safety narrative of its driver-assist features.</p>

          <p>Convicted sex-trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell is pursuing a multi-faceted strategy to secure her release from a 20-year prison sentence, according to a new analysis. Her legal team is simultaneously pushing a Supreme Court appeal, leveraging a congressional subpoena, and engaging in high-profile meetings with the Justice Department. These actions are fueling speculation about a potential pardon from President Trump, as her case becomes increasingly entangled with the political fallout from her association with Jeffrey Epstein and his powerful connections.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece critiques the U.S. government's decision to deny travel visas to a Little League team from Maracaibo, Venezuela, which prevented the teenage players from competing in the Senior League World Series. Despite qualifying for the tournament, the team was barred due to a broad U.S. proclamation restricting entry from Venezuela and other nations. The author highlights the heartbreak for the young athletes and questions the application of the policy, which contains exemptions for major sporting events that were apparently not granted in this case.</p>

          <p>The European Union is debating punitive actions against Israel over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, but the 27-member bloc is deeply split on the issue. The European Commission has proposed a minor penalty involving research funds, but this faces resistance from allies like Germany and Hungary. Meanwhile, countries such as Spain, Ireland, and Sweden are advocating for more severe measures, like freezing the EU-Israel trade agreement, to pressure Israel into improving aid access. The internal discord highlights the EU's struggle to form a unified policy on the conflict.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposal to reopen the Alcatraz prison as a detention facility is being condemned by Indigenous leaders as an act of historical erasure. They argue the plan ignores the island's crucial role as a site of the 1969-1971 Native American occupation, a pivotal moment of resistance that led to significant changes in federal policy toward Indigenous sovereignty. Critics say that beyond the immense cost and logistical hurdles, the idea is a deeply insensitive affront to the legacy of Indigenous activism that the island represents.</p>

          <p>After football coach Deion Sanders underwent surgery for bladder cancer, medical experts are detailing the neobladder reconstruction he received. This complex procedure involves removing the diseased bladder and constructing a new one using a section of the patient's own small intestine. While it allows a person to urinate without an external bag, it requires significant retraining to manage bladder control and can lead to incontinence. Sanders has spoken publicly about this side effect, a move praised by doctors for reducing stigma around the condition.</p>
