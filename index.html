          <p>Former British boxing world champion Ricky Hatton has passed away at the age of 46, with no suspicious circumstances reported by Manchester police. Known as "The Hitman," Hatton held multiple world titles and was celebrated for his aggressive fighting style, retiring with a professional record of 45 wins and 3 losses. Tributes from figures like Tyson Fury and Amir Khan have poured in, remembering him not only as a boxing legend but also for his candidness about his struggles with mental health after his career. His death comes just two months after he announced a professional comeback.</p>

The victim, a woman in her 20s, was reportedly attacked by two men who made racist remarks, telling her she did not belong in the country. Community leaders at the protest called for greater safety for women and condemned the act as a violation of dignity and an expression of extremism.

          <p>Utah Governor Spencer Cox has stated that Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old suspect in the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, is not cooperating with the investigation. While the suspect remains silent, Cox confirmed that those around him, including his roommate, are providing information to authorities. Officials have not yet identified a clear motive for the killing, although the governor noted that acquaintances have described the suspect as being influenced by leftist ideology. Formal charges are expected to be filed soon, with more details anticipated in the coming days.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the arrest of 22-year-old Tyler Robinson for the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, prosecutors are facing public pressure to seek the death penalty. Both former President Donald Trump and Utah Governor Spencer Cox have called for capital punishment, framing the act as a "political assassination." However, pursuing the death penalty in Utah involves a high legal bar, requiring prosecutors to prove "aggravated murder" and file a notice of intent within 60 days of arraignment. While possible, capital cases are rare in the state, making the legal path forward complex despite the intense national focus.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is visiting Israel for discussions with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a trip that comes as Israeli forces continue to destroy residential buildings in Gaza City. The visit follows a recent Israeli strike in Qatar targeting Hamas leaders, an action that displeased the White House, though Rubio emphasized the U.S.-Israel relationship remains strong. Meanwhile, the humanitarian situation in Gaza worsens, with the UN warning of a catastrophe as thousands are forced to flee the ongoing Israeli offensive.

          <p>In a joint television appearance, Senators Chris Coons (D-DE) and James Lankford (R-OK) discussed the escalating political violence in the U.S. following the assassination of Charlie Kirk. Both senators condemned the killing and pointed to the internet and social media algorithms as major drivers of extremism and division, pushing people toward the most angry and radical content. They highlighted the rising number of threats against public officials and called for bipartisan efforts to reduce online harms, such as passing the Kids Online Safety Act. The senators agreed that leaders have an obligation to lower the rhetorical temperature and encourage civil discourse.</p>

          <p>The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has issued an urgent warning about unapproved weight-loss drugs being sold illegally on platforms like TikTok. The drug, Retatrutide, is still in clinical trials and has not been approved for human use anywhere in the world. However, sellers are marketing it as a cheaper and more effective alternative to approved medications like Mounjaro, whose price recently increased. Health experts caution that purchasing such substances from unregulated sources poses significant health risks, as they could contain incorrect dosages or dangerous ingredients with severe consequences.</p>

          <p>Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Jon Meacham commented that the United States is in a "dangerous place" following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. He argued that political violence historically erupts in America during periods of intense debate over fundamental questions of national identity, such as who qualifies as "an American." Meacham stated that while the nation's history is filled with contention, the current trend of resorting to violence instead of peaceful debate breaks the "American covenant." He urged leaders to draw on historical examples of overcoming division to guide the country through its present challenges.</p>

          <p>Veteran journalist James Fallows draws parallels between the recent wave of political violence, including the killing of Charlie Kirk, and previous tumultuous periods in American history, such as the assassinations of the 1960s. He warns that cycles of political violence are profoundly damaging and self-reinforcing, cautioning against loose talk of "civil war." Fallows urges for generous reactions in moments of crisis, recalling Robert F. Kennedy's impromptu speech calling to "tame the savageness of man" after Martin Luther King Jr.'s murder. He emphasizes that real American life is less fractured than social media suggests and that leaders should remind citizens of this.</p>

          <p>The Art Institute of Chicago is hosting a new exhibition on the work of Gustave Caillebotte, one of the lesser-known French Impressionist painters. While the museum has long housed his famous "Paris Street; Rainy Day," the new show, titled "Painting His World," offers a fresh perspective by highlighting his frequent focus on male subjects in domestic and intimate settings, which was unusual for the era. Some of his works, like "The Floor Scrapers," were considered scandalous by the 19th-century art establishment. The exhibition aims to re-integrate Caillebotte into the broader story of Impressionism and allow modern audiences to interpret his unique artistry.</p>

          <p>A commentary article criticizes the prevalent tipping culture in the United States, arguing that it will be exacerbated by the new "no tax on tips" law. The author contends that while the law may offer temporary and limited benefits to some workers, it ultimately enables employers to avoid paying living wages and places a greater burden on consumers. The piece also questions the eligibility criteria for the tax deduction, pointing out that professions like plumbers and digital content creators are included while essential workers like teachers and postal workers are not.

The Constitution was also shaped by tragic compromises, particularly regarding slavery, which later required a "second founding" through amendments after the Civil War.

Many undocumented workers now face a difficult choice between risking deportation by going to work or staying home and facing eviction for unpaid rent. In response, community organizers and volunteer groups are increasing their efforts to monitor for ICE activity and inform residents of their rights, creating a network of mutual support.</p>

          <h2>New Administration Health Report on Children Omits Focus on Nicotine and Smoking</h2>

          <p>A new 20-page report from the Trump administration titled "Make Our Children Healthy Again" is drawing criticism for its near-total omission of nicotine, smoking, and tobacco use as childhood health risks. Health advocates and parents are concerned by the lack of focus on what remains the top cause of preventable death in the U.S. Critics point out that the report's weak recommendations on vaping contrast with the administration's recent actions, which include cutting funding for the very FDA and CDC offices responsible for tobacco control. The report's focus appears to be on other areas, leaving a significant gap in youth public health strategy.</p>

          <p>Luke Donald, the captain of Europe's Ryder Cup team, has equipped his players with virtual reality headsets programmed to shout abuse at them. This unconventional training method is designed to prepare the team for the anticipated hostile crowd environment at the upcoming tournament at Bethpage in New York. Player Rory McIlroy revealed that he encouraged the simulation to "go as far as you want" to desensitize the team to the intense pressure and potential name-calling from American fans. The strategy is part of the team's detailed preparations as they aim to win the Ryder Cup on U.S. soil for the first time since 2012.</p>

          <p>As the 2025 WNBA playoffs begin, sports analysts are predicting the likely outcomes and highlighting the key factors for success. The Minnesota Lynx, who felt they were unjustly denied the 2024 title, are seen as a top contender on a "revenge tour," powered by MVP candidate Napheesa Collier and the league's best defense. The Las Vegas Aces, however, are entering the postseason on a 16-game winning streak, making them a formidable opponent aiming for a third title in four years. Other teams discussed as potential dark horses include the Atlanta Dream and the defending champion New York Liberty, who have battled injuries all season.</p>

Cybersecurity firm Zscaler is seeing high demand for its Zero Trust and AI security solutions, leading to strong billings growth. Oracle's stock surged after it reported a massive 359% increase in its remaining performance obligations, indicating a robust future pipeline for its cloud infrastructure services.

          <p>The family of the late Virginia Giuffre has called for a full investigation into Prince Andrew over the sexual abuse allegations she made against him. In a BBC interview, Giuffre's brother, Sky Roberts, stated that everyone, regardless of royal status, should be held accountable under the law and that the prince has not faced sufficient consequences. Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein, alleged that the prince sexually abused her three times when she was a minor. Prince Andrew has consistently denied the claims and reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022 without any admission of liability.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis suggests that right-wing influence over mainstream American news media is increasing, raising concerns about press freedom. The article points to several developments, including the installation of a Trump ally as ombudsman at CBS News shortly after a Trump-friendly billionaire's family gained control of its parent company, Paramount. It also notes Paramount's potential bid for CNN's parent company and a settlement that ensures Fox News will maintain its conservative direction for decades. These moves are seen by some media critics as a capitulation to the Trump administration's pressure and a shift in the editorial posture of storied journalistic institutions.</p>

          <p>The fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University has brought renewed attention to a recent state law that allows individuals with permits to openly carry firearms on college campuses. Previously, guns had to be concealed on campus. While it is not yet clear if the suspected shooter was legally carrying the rifle, the timing of the law's passage has intensified the debate over firearms in educational settings. Utah has some of the most permissive gun laws in the country, lacking red-flag laws and allowing permitless concealed carry, reflecting a legislative approach that prioritizes gun access as a deterrent to crime.</p>

          <p>The "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) campaign, led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is reportedly increasing the stress and workload for parents trying to provide healthy food for their children. The movement's strict guidelines, which condemn ingredients like seed oils and ultra-processed foods, force parents into a time-consuming and often expensive "scavenger hunt" across multiple stores to find compliant products. While the campaign resonates with parents' desires to feed their children well, critics argue it offers little practical support, especially for low-income families, and fails to address systemic issues like food insecurity, thereby adding to parental anxiety.</p>

It also points to a mass exodus of scientists from federal health agencies and drastic budget cuts that are halting critical research and public health programs.

          <p>A growing backlash is targeting social media influencers who post videos of themselves tormenting and illegally handling wildlife in Australia for content. One prominent US influencer recently posted videos of himself wrestling with crocodiles in Queensland, prompting an official investigation and calls from PETA for his deportation. Animal rights groups like World Animal Protection are condemning this behavior as "cruelty for the sake of content," warning that such viral videos encourage "copycat tourism" and trivialize the harm caused to animals. Australian law carries significant penalties for animal cruelty, including fines and potential prison sentences.</p>
