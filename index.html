          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 17:01:54 EDT</div>

          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing its third major heatwave of the year, with temperatures soaring to 34.7C and prompting water restrictions for over seven million people. Authorities have issued amber heat health alerts for a large portion of England, warning of risks to the entire population, while less severe warnings are active in the north. The prolonged dry and warm conditions have led to record-level demand for drinking water, and officials have also issued extreme wildfire warnings for parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland. Health experts advise the public to take precautions, as the extreme heat places an additional load on the body, especially for those with existing health conditions.</p>

          <h2>U.S. State Department Commences Layoffs of Over 1,300 Employees</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 16:52:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated a major reorganization by laying off more than 1,300 civil and foreign service employees, part of a broader plan to reduce its domestic workforce by approximately 15%. The move, which follows a plan submitted to Congress earlier this year, aims to streamline what the administration calls a "bloated bureaucracy" by consolidating offices and cutting redundancies. Critics, including Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, argue the indiscriminate cuts could undermine national security and weaken the department's ability to conduct diplomacy. The layoffs are based on an employee's assigned office on a specific date, a method that has drawn criticism for being arbitrary and not based on merit.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 16:50:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A preliminary investigation into the recent Air India crash in Ahmedabad has revealed a critical detail about the flight's final moments. According to India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, the fuel cutoff switches for both of the Boeing 787-8's engines were moved from "run" to "cut off" shortly after takeoff, causing an immediate loss of thrust. The crash resulted in the deaths of 241 of the 242 people on board and at least 19 fatalities on the ground. The report does not yet recommend any specific actions for the aircraft or engine manufacturers as the investigation is ongoing.</p>

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of the infamous drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, has pleaded guilty to federal drug trafficking and criminal enterprise charges in a Chicago court. As a leader of the "Los Chapitos" faction of the Sinaloa cartel, he admitted to overseeing a massive fentanyl trafficking operation that supplied a staggering amount of the opioid to the United States. As part of his plea agreement, Guzman Lopez must provide substantial cooperation to the government, which could lead to a sentence of less than life in prison. He also agreed to forfeit $80 million in assets, with his cooperation potentially requiring him to testify against other cartel members, including his own brother.</p>

The speculation follows President Trump's announcement of plans to host a UFC card to celebrate America's 250th birthday next year. White stated that Jones has re-entered the drug-testing pool and that his dream main event would be Jones versus Tom Aspinall for the heavyweight title. He also suggested that McGregor, who has shown interest in the event, could potentially fight on the same card, promising it would be the "baddest card of all time."</p>

He also characterized the January 6 Capitol attack as a matter of "significant political debate" and refused to denounce it.

          <p>The price of Bitcoin soared to a new all-time high, briefly exceeding $118,000, driven by a massive influx of institutional investment into cryptocurrency-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On Thursday, Bitcoin ETFs recorded their largest single-day inflow of the year, totaling $1.18 billion, signaling strong market confidence. The rally was also influenced by speculation that future Federal Reserve leadership may adopt a more dovish stance on interest rates, which can be a positive catalyst for assets like Bitcoin. This upward momentum triggered over $550 million in short liquidations, further fueling the price increase as traders rushed to cover their positions. (not investment advice)</p>

The judge ruled that the state's claims were specific enough and based on the app's allegedly dangerous features, not its user-generated content.

The judge cited specific incidents, such as an Australian reporter being hit by a rubber bullet on live TV, as evidence that an injunction was necessary to protect First Amendment rights.

According to data from career platform Handshake, job listings for these roles have fallen by 15%, while applications per job have surged by 30%. This trend has contributed to a higher unemployment rate for young degree holders compared to the national average. Experts suggest that AI is redefining the nature of entry-level work, increasing the need for graduates to develop skills in using AI tools, and potentially shifting focus towards skilled trades that are less susceptible to automation.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace is set to lose its hard-won place in the Europa League due to UEFA's multi-club ownership rules, with Nottingham Forest taking their spot. The issue stems from John Textor's ownership stake in both Crystal Palace and French club Lyon, which also qualified for the tournament. UEFA has deemed that both clubs cannot compete in the same competition, and because Lyon finished higher in their domestic league, they retain the position. Palace, who missed a deadline to alter their ownership structure, will be downgraded to the less prestigious Conference League and are expected to appeal the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines is planning to introduce more segmented fare options within its premium cabins, applying a strategy similar to the one that created different tiers in economy class. The airline's president, Glen Hauenstein, stated that the goal is to provide more choices for customers with different needs in first and business class. This move comes as revenue from premium seats continues to show strong growth, outperforming the main cabin. While specific details have not been released, the changes could involve creating new fare types with varying levels of perks, such as lounge access or seat assignments, to further capitalize on the robust demand for high-end travel.</p>

          <p>A massive Antonov An-124 cargo jet was seen flying over Kyiv, a rare sight since Ukrainian airspace was closed to most non-combat aircraft at the start of Russia's 2022 invasion. The flight sparked speculation, but it is believed to be the evacuation of an An-124 that had been stranded at the Antonov plant in Kyiv for years. Flight tracking data showed the aircraft, registered to Antonov Airlines, later landed in Leipzig, Germany, where the company relocated much of its operations. The successful flight is seen by some as a symbol of Ukrainian resilience and a logistical success, as it evaded potential Russian threats to depart the country safely.</p>

In a 2-1 decision, the court ruled that the defense secretary had the legal authority to withdraw from the deals.

          <p>The U.S. government recorded an unexpected budget surplus of $27 billion in June, a development largely driven by a massive increase in revenue from customs duties. Tariff collections for the month were 301% higher than in June of the previous year, following the implementation of broad new tariffs on imports. This monthly surplus is a rare occurrence, with the last one in June happening in 2017. Despite the positive monthly figure, the fiscal year-to-date deficit remains substantial at $1.34 trillion, and net interest payments on the national debt continue to be a major expense for the government.

These probes reportedly involve using AI to scan emails and chat logs for dissent and subjecting senior FBI employees to polygraph tests about whether they have said anything negative about Director Patel.

Other fast-track methods include applying for a low-documentation HELOC that minimizes paperwork, or choosing a lender that uses automated valuation models for property appraisals instead of slower, in-person ones. Working with the lender that already holds your primary mortgage can also streamline the process, as they have existing financial information on file. (not investment advice)</p>
