          <p>Bin worker strikes in Birmingham may continue until December, following a union vote to prolong industrial action over pay and jobs. The strike, initiated on January 6, has involved multiple walkouts and an indefinite all-out strike since March 11. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham stated that members voted by 97% to continue striking, demanding that Birmingham council present an acceptable offer. The dispute, initially over the removal of Waste Recycling and Collection Officer roles, has escalated due to concerns over temporary labor and pay reductions for bin lorry drivers. The ongoing strikes have resulted in significant rubbish accumulation in the city, raising public health and environmental concerns. </p>

          <p>A recent report indicates that home equity levels in the United States have reached a record high, with mortgaged residential properties holding an aggregate of $17.6 trillion in equity, a 4% increase from the previous year.

With rising home equity levels, homeowners have an opportunity to borrow large sums of money at lower interest rates compared to personal loans or credit cards. Additionally, interest paid on home equity loans or HELOCs used for home repairs and renovations is tax-deductible, offering further financial benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has blocked Mexico's lawsuit against major U.S. gun manufacturers, ruling in favor of the firearms industry by upholding a federal law that shields them from civil suits. Mexico had argued that the gunmakers were knowingly aiding and abetting the unlawful sale of firearms to straw purchasers, who then trafficked them to drug cartels. The court unanimously rejected Mexico's argument, citing the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which generally protects gun manufacturers from liability for the criminal use of their products. Justice Elena Kagan wrote that Mexico's complaint did not plausibly allege that the gunmakers criminally aided and abetted the unlawful sale of weapons to Mexican traffickers. The ruling is a significant win for the firearms industry, limiting their exposure to civil lawsuits related to gun violence. </p>

          <h2>Supreme Court Blocks Mexico's Lawsuit Against U.S. Gunmakers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 12:30:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously rejected Mexico's lawsuit against major U.S. gun manufacturers, delivering a victory for the firearms industry. Mexico argued that the manufacturers were liable for violence caused by drug cartels armed with their products. The court cited the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which shields gun companies from liability for harms stemming from the criminal misuse of their products by others. Justice Kagan stated that Mexico's complaint failed to plausibly allege that the gunmakers criminally aided and abetted retail dealers' unlawful sale of weapons to Mexican traffickers. The ruling affirms the legal protections afforded to gun manufacturers under federal law. </p>

          <p>The Supreme Court revived a lawsuit filed by an Ohio woman who claimed she was the victim of reverse discrimination after being denied a promotion because she is straight. The court unanimously rejected a federal appeals court ruling that had dismissed Marlean Ames' claims, concluding that the "background circumstances" requirement unfairly imposed a higher burden on members of a majority group. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote that the standard for proving disparate treatment under Title VII does not vary based on whether the plaintiff is a member of a majority group. The ruling makes it easier to pursue claims of reverse discrimination in several states. </p>

          <p>Older Americans are filing for Social Security benefits at a record pace this year, potentially driven by concerns about the program's stability amid administrative changes. The number of people claiming Social Security has increased by 17% compared to the previous year. The Urban Institute suggests this surge is influenced by staffing cuts at the Social Security Administration and general anxieties about the system's future. While President Trump has pledged not to cut Social Security, the agency's workforce has been reduced, even as the number of beneficiaries continues to grow. (not investment advice)</p>
