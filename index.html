          <p>Chelsea Football Club reported a pre-tax profit of Â£128.4m for the year ending June 2024, a significant improvement from previous losses. The profit is due to player registration sales and restructuring the women's team into a standalone entity.  Despite lower overall revenue due to the absence of Champions League football, increased matchday and commercial revenue contributed to the positive results. The women's team sale was a key factor.</p>
