          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for direct talks with Ukraine on May 15, following calls from European leaders for a 30-day ceasefire. Putin stated Russia seeks "serious negotiations" for a lasting peace and suggested the talks occur in Istanbul, Turkey. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov initially responded cautiously to the ceasefire proposal, warning against pressure. The European leaders warned of increased sanctions on Russia's energy and banking sectors if Putin does not agree to the ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, has returned to Massachusetts after being released on bail following her detention by ICE in March. Ozturk, who was detained for six weeks, spoke at a news conference alongside Senator Ed Markey and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, expressing gratitude for the support she received. A federal judge in Vermont ordered her release, citing concerns that her detainment violated her due process and First Amendment rights, particularly regarding an op-ed she co-authored criticizing Israel's war with Hamas. Leaders in Massachusetts, including Governor Maura Healey, celebrated her release, condemning the Trump administration's actions.</p>

          <p>Actor Danny Dyer has revealed that a letter from his daughter Dani convinced him to stay in rehab in 2016, a turning point in his struggle with addiction. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, Dyer shared that he was ready to leave the facility but reconsidered after the letter made him reflect on the pain he had caused his family. Dyer, who rose to fame in the film Human Traffic and later starred in EastEnders, discussed how fame led him to make bad decisions, including heavy drug use. He realized the extent of his addiction when he struggled to put on jeans and saw the toll it was taking on his wife and children.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has announced a ‚Äútotal reset‚Äù in US-China trade relations following the first day of talks between American and Chinese officials in Geneva. The negotiations aimed to de-escalate a trade war marked by high tariffs. China's vice-premier, He Lifeng, met with US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, and US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, to discuss reducing tariffs. Analysts have low expectations for a breakthrough, but the initiation of discussions is seen as a positive step.</p>

          <p>C.C. Opanowski's testimony was pivotal in convicting her ex-boyfriend, Shawn Doyle, of the murder of Lori Leonard, a mother of two. Opanowski, who was attacked by Doyle in 1996, initially declined to press charges out of fear. However, she decided to testify after learning of Leonard's murder in 2005. Doyle had a history of abusive behavior towards women, including Sarah Volmar, whom he also attacked. The case highlights the importance of taking domestic violence seriously, as every incident carries the potential for homicide.</p>

          <p>An international clinical trial led by Chinese and US scientists has found that a new medication, zongertinib, shows promise for treating HER2-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The oral medication outperformed the standard treatment option, an intravenous antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) therapy, while carrying fewer risks of adverse effects. The study was conducted at 82 sites globally, with a majority of the 188 NSCLC patients being Asian. Wang Xin, a professor at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Cancer Hospital, suggested that zongertinib could establish a new benchmark for targeted therapy in HER2-mutant NSCLC.</p>

Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio engaged in direct talks with leaders from both countries, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and General Syed Asim Munir, after initial statements downplaying the conflict's importance. The intervention followed evidence of intensifying military engagements and concerns that de-escalation messages were not reaching top officials.

          <p>Samii Wood, a professional cuddler in Bedfordshire, invites people to explore the healing power of touch, claiming it has measurable health benefits, such as boosting serotonin and oxytocin levels, while lowering stress hormones. She hosts "cuddle puddles" where people can experience platonic touch and comfort. While some might raise an eyebrow at the thought that people are paying for this, Samii stresses it is a "fully clothed, platonic, nurturing service", with consent forms and explicit boundaries. Experts agree that touch can benefit physical and mental health, though the relationship between the people involved is important.</p>

          <p>Starbucks and Luckin Coffee are experiencing renewed growth in China by targeting smaller, lower-tier cities amid sluggish consumption and intense price competition. Starbucks' same-store sales were flat, but increased transactions offset a decline in average spending, indicating efforts to maintain market share. Luckin Coffee has also seen expansion in second and new first-tier cities. The success in these areas suggests a potential for growth beyond wealthier urban centers.</p>

Surveys indicate that many Japanese do not see the need for app-based salary payments, while companies cite a lack of demand and increased administrative work as reasons for not introducing the option.</p>
