          <p>Argentine prosecutors have charged Patricia Kadgien, the daughter of a fugitive Nazi officer, with hiding a looted 18th-century painting. The artwork, "Portrait of a Lady" by Giuseppe Ghislandi, was discovered hanging in her home through an online real estate listing after being missing for 80 years. The heir of the original Dutch-Jewish owner, Jacques Goudstikke, has filed a legal claim to recover the piece. Authorities seized the painting after raiding Kadgien's properties, where other potentially stolen items were also found.</p>

          <p>A demonstration in London against the UK government's proscription of the campaign group Palestine Action resulted in over 425 arrests. Hundreds gathered in Parliament Square to oppose the ban, which criminalizes support for the group under the Terrorism Act. The Metropolitan Police reported that most arrests were for supporting a banned organization and noted exceptional abuse towards officers. Protest organizers accused the police of using excessive force against peaceful demonstrators, highlighting a growing resistance to the ban.</p>

          <p>More than 25 million people across the U.S. Northeast are under a severe weather alert due to a line of strong thunderstorms. A severe thunderstorm watch is in effect from Maryland to Maine, covering major cities like Philadelphia, New York City, and Boston. The primary threats include damaging wind gusts, large hail, and a slight chance of isolated tornadoes. Additionally, slow-moving storms with torrential rain pose a localized flash flooding risk, particularly in urban and poor-drainage areas, with the system expected to persist overnight.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposal to deploy the National Guard to Chicago to combat crime has elicited sharply divided reactions within the city's communities. While some residents welcome the intervention, citing high crime rates, others, particularly on the South Side, argue it is unnecessary and that community-led initiatives are already reducing violence. Local leaders and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker have vowed to resist the deployment, arguing that violent crime has already fallen significantly and criticizing the president's approach as politically motivated.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, secured their place in the World Cup last eight with a 47-7 victory over Australia, extending their winning streak to 30 matches. Despite the wide margin, the team delivered an unsettled and error-prone performance in the first half, struggling against Australia's intensity and effective tactics. Coach John Mitchell acknowledged the team was "untidy in attack" but praised their defensive effort, which kept the Wallaroos scoreless after the interval. The performance highlights areas for improvement as they head into knockout play.</p>

          <p>Jamie Borthwick, who portrayed Jay Brown on the BBC soap 'EastEnders' for 19 years, has been permanently dropped from the show. The decision follows his suspension earlier this year for using a slur against people with disabilities on the set of 'Strictly Come Dancing.' Borthwick, who had been one of the show's longest-serving cast members since his debut in 2006, had been expected to return to filming this month. The BBC confirmed his departure but declined to comment on the specifics of the individual matter.</p>

          <p>Director Oliver Laxe's new film, "Sirât," is gaining significant attention on the festival circuit for its unique premise of a dance party set during a vaguely defined apocalypse.

Shot in the deserts of Morocco and Spain, the movie follows a father and son searching for a missing daughter amidst the chaos.

          <p>England secured a 2-0 win against Andorra in a World Cup qualifier, but the uninspired performance has led to criticism that the team has regressed under new manager Thomas Tuchel. Despite dominating possession, England required an own goal and a Declan Rice header to defeat the team ranked 174th in the world. The lackluster display, marked by a lack of creativity and momentum, caused many fans to leave the stadium early. The result keeps England on track to qualify but raises concerns ahead of a more challenging match against Serbia.</p>

          <p>The recent Reform UK party conference in Birmingham demonstrates the party's significant growth and increasing ambition within the British political landscape. The event was substantially larger than previous gatherings, adopting the scale of a major party conference while maintaining an insurgent energy. Leader Nigel Farage's speech focused on the need for discipline and building a local volunteer network, signaling a serious intent to become a dominant political force. The conference attracted many new members, including former supporters of both the Conservative and Labour parties, reflecting the party's growing momentum.</p>

          <p>Postal traffic into the United States has dropped by over 80% since the Trump administration ended a long-standing tariff exemption for low-value imports, according to the Universal Postal Union (UPU). The rule change requires customs duties to be collected on parcels valued under $800, a task that many foreign postal operators and carriers are not equipped to handle. As a result, 88 postal services have suspended some or all shipments to the U.S., causing major operational disruptions and bringing the flow of international mail to a near standstill.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order authorizing the U.S. State Department to impose sanctions and other penalties on countries that wrongfully detain American citizens. The order creates a new "state sponsor of wrongful detention" designation, modeled after the existing terrorism sponsor list, to hold foreign governments accountable. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that any nation using an American as a bargaining chip will face consequences, including economic sanctions and visa restrictions. Advocacy groups report at least 54 Americans were wrongfully detained abroad in 2024.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has conducted a significant reshuffle of his ministerial team, prompted by the resignation of his deputy, Angela Rayner. Following Yvette Cooper's move from the Home Office to the Foreign Office, ministers Dame Angela Eagle and Dame Diana Johnson have also been moved to different departments. The changes are seen as an attempt by Starmer to reset his government's agenda, particularly on key issues like illegal immigration, and to bring in new figures to top departmental roles. Anna Turley has been promoted to attend cabinet and will also serve as Labour Party chair.</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced a volatile start to September as investors weighed conflicting economic signals. A weaker-than-expected August jobs report initially boosted markets, raising hopes that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates to stimulate the economy. However, this optimism was soon tempered by concerns that the slowing labor market could indicate a broader economic downturn, causing major indices to reverse their gains. This dynamic highlights Wall Street's current dilemma, balancing the potential benefits of lower borrowing costs against the risks of weakening economic fundamentals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he knew "nothing" about a classified 2019 SEAL Team 6 mission in North Korea, as reported by The New York Times. The article alleged that the mission, which Trump reportedly approved, was aborted after SEALs killed several unarmed North Korean civilians they mistook for a threat. The objective was to plant a device to intercept communications from leader Kim Jong-un during high-stakes nuclear negotiations. The Pentagon has declined to comment on the report, which cited numerous anonymous former and current government and military officials.</p>

LAPD officers had been assisting the California Highway Patrol after President Trump revoked Harris's Secret Service protection. The police union criticized the use of city resources to protect a private citizen who could afford her own security.
