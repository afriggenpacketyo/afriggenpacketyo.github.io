            <p>An Alabama woman, Towana Looney, had a pig kidney removed after a record 130 days due to her body rejecting it, after receiving dialysis since 2016. While the transplant was unsuccessful, doctors gained crucial information for future xenotransplantation efforts. Looney expressed gratitude for the opportunity to contribute to the research, despite the outcome. More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant waiting list, most needing a kidney, and biotech companies are working on genetically modifying pigs to make their organs more compatible with humans.</p>

            <p>Iran and the United States will hold further negotiations next week regarding Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program, according to Iranian state television. The initial round of talks, the first since President Trump's return to the White House, took place in Oman. US Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi briefly spoke in the presence of the Omani foreign minister. The stakes are high as Trump has threatened airstrikes on Iran's nuclear program if a deal is not reached.</p>

            <p>Big tech companies have gained a significant reprieve from Donald Trump's trade war as he exempted smartphones, computers, and other electronics from the 125% levies imposed on imports from China. Experts had warned that tariffs would cause electronic consumer prices to spike in the US, with Apple reportedly chartering cargo flights to bring in iPhones from India rather than China. Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities called the exemption a "game-changer scenario" for tech investors.</p>

            <p>The Indian "pot belly," once seen as a sign of prosperity, is now recognized as a major health concern as obesity rates in India are rapidly increasing. India had the second-highest number of overweight or obese adults in 2021, with 180 million affected, and this number could soar to 450 million by 2050. Abdominal obesity is linked to chronic conditions like Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Studies show that Indians tend to accumulate more body fat around the belly, disrupting insulin function and raising the risk of metabolic diseases.</p>

The reopening has been a success, with locals saying it's the first time they've been out socializing in years.</p>
