        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York appellate court has nullified the nearly half-billion-dollar penalty imposed on Donald Trump in his civil fraud case, deeming the amount excessive and a potential violation of constitutional protections against severe punishment. While the court upheld the finding of liability for fraud, it argued the financial harm did not justify such a large award to the state. The ruling keeps non-monetary penalties, such as a ban on Trump serving as a company director in New York, in place, though the panel of judges was divided on the overall merits of the case.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, a Category 2 storm, has begun moving away from the North Carolina coast after bringing tropical storm conditions and significant storm surge to the Outer Banks. While the hurricane is not expected to make a direct landfall in the U.S., authorities have issued warnings for life-threatening surf and rip currents along most of the East Coast, prompting beach closures and swimming prohibitions in several states. The storm's path is forecast to take it between the U.S. and Bermuda before it weakens and becomes post-tropical by the weekend.</p>

          <p>Chipotle has initiated an autonomous drone delivery service, named "Zipotle," in the Dallas area through a partnership with logistics provider Zipline. The service allows customers to receive their digital orders via small aircraft called Zips, which can deliver food within minutes by hovering and lowering the package to the ground. Initially available to a small number of customers, the program aims to provide faster delivery and keep food fresh, serving locations that are traditionally difficult to access, like parks and backyards.</p>

          <p>Walter Isaacson, a Tulane University professor and prominent biographer, has characterized President Donald Trump's recent dealings with tech companies Intel and Nvidia as a "scattershot method of crony capitalism." Isaacson argued that this approach, where the government favors specific companies, is a recipe for corruption and will not succeed in reviving American manufacturing. His comments follow the administration's push for a stake in Intel and an agreement where Nvidia and AMD will pay a percentage of their China revenues to the U.S. government for export licenses.

          <p>The Trent Rockets defeated the Oval Invincibles by six wickets in The Hundred women's cricket competition, keeping their slim chances for qualification alive. Despite a mid-innings wobble while chasing a target of 110, Heather Graham's unbeaten 19 runs guided the Rockets to victory with 16 balls remaining. The Oval Invincibles struggled to build partnerships, with Meg Lanning's 45 being the standout performance in their total of 109-7. Both teams must now win their remaining games to have a chance of advancing.</p>

          <p>Despite initial optimism from the U.S., plans for a direct summit between Russia's Vladimir Putin and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky appear to be stalling over significant preconditions from both sides. While potential host cities like Budapest, Vienna, and Istanbul have been discussed, fundamental disagreements on security guarantees remain a major obstacle, with Russia and Ukraine holding mutually exclusive positions. Diplomatic efforts are ongoing, but the likelihood of a near-term meeting seems to be diminishing as the war continues with ongoing strikes from both nations.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of the potential returns on a $25,000 Certificate of Deposit (CD) given the current elevated interest rates. While yields have decreased from their 2023 peaks, they remain attractive compared to standard savings accounts, offering fixed, predictable growth without market risk. The potential earnings vary significantly based on the CD's term, ranging from approximately $269 for a 3-month CD to over $5,250 for a 5-year CD, allowing savers to choose based on their financial goals and liquidity needs.

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. increased by 2% in July, contrary to analysts' expectations of a decline, reaching a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.01 million units. This uptick is attributed to a temporary dip in mortgage rates during May and June when these sales contracts were likely signed. Concurrently, housing inventory rose to its highest level since May 2020, which is helping to ease price pressure, with the median home price showing only a marginal 0.2% year-over-year increase.

The stories highlight that the "empty nest" is often a fluid state, sometimes repopulated by returning children, and serves as a period of profound transition and re-evaluation of identity, relationships, and life's purpose for parents.</p>

          <p>Chris Brain, the former Church of England priest who led the popular "Nine O'Clock Service" in Sheffield, has been found guilty of 17 counts of indecent assault. His nightclub-style services attracted hundreds of young people in the 1980s and 1990s, but the trial revealed he used his power to create a cult-like environment, manipulating followers and sexually assaulting women in his congregation. Witnesses described how Brain isolated members, controlled their finances, and used a team of young female assistants for personal services, during which many of the assaults occurred.</p>

The five lessons emphasize having faith in the future, embracing discomfort as a catalyst for growth, seeking deeper spiritual happiness over fleeting pleasures, and understanding that personal well-being is intrinsically linked to serving others. Originating in 19th-century Persia, the Baha'i faith's positive and resilient message was forged through persecution, offering a time-tested framework for finding meaning and joy amid life's challenges.</p>

          <p>A recent successful fundraiser for anti-factory farming charities has highlighted the concept of "moral offsetting," where individuals who feel guilty about eating meat can donate money to animal welfare causes instead of changing their diet. Proponents, like the organization FarmKind, argue it's a pragmatic way to fund effective advocacy in a world where veganism remains a niche choice. However, the article also explores the ethical complexities, questioning whether such offsets absolve personal responsibility and trivialize animal suffering, similar to how one wouldn't "offset" abusing a pet with a shelter donation.</p>

CEO Doug McMillon noted that while higher-income shoppers continue to seek deals, the gradual nature of the price increases has not yet caused dramatic shifts in overall consumer behavior.
