Ocasio-Cortez asserted that her actions, including hosting a "Know your Rights" webinar, were protected by free speech and dared Homan to take action against her. She criticized the Trump administration's immigration policies, describing deportations of Venezuelan gang members as sanctioned kidnappings and emphasized migrants' rights to demand warrants from ICE agents.

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese secured a second term, a significant victory for his center-left Labor Party despite trailing in polls due to a cost-of-living crisis. The conservative opposition, led by Peter Dutton, suffered a resounding defeat, partly due to associations with Trump's policies. The election, influenced by global turmoil from Trump's trade and diplomatic decisions, saw younger voters expressing disaffection with both major parties. Albanese's party may need support from smaller parties to maintain a majority in Parliament, reflecting broader dissatisfaction with traditional political solutions.</p>

          <p>A new lawsuit seeks to compel New Jersey police to allow DNA testing on envelopes from the Lindbergh baby kidnapping case, which occurred 93 years ago. Researchers believe saliva on the envelopes could reveal whether Bruno Hauptmann, convicted of the crime, acted alone. The state police cite concerns about damaging the evidence, but researchers argue that modern forensic techniques are non-destructive. The case has spurred conspiracy theories, including doubts about Hauptmann's sole involvement and speculation about Lindbergh's involvement, and plaintiffs argue that scientific access is essential for historical justice.</p>

These fantasies allow for visions of total corporate control, free from governmental oversight.

          <p>A new training program, CHAT, aims to reduce "elderspeak," a form of communication that resembles baby talk and is often used with older adults, potentially undermining their dignity. Studies show that elderspeak is common in nursing homes and can lead to resistance to care. The CHAT program, involving videos and training sessions, has proven effective in reducing elderspeak and resistant behaviors. Individuals and institutions can combat elderspeak by addressing clients respectfully and understanding cultural differences in communication styles.</p>

          <p>The Karen Read retrial, accused of murdering her boyfriend, is underway with the same courtroom and judge, but a different atmosphere due to a botched police investigation and public controversy. The trial centers on whether Read ran over her boyfriend or if he was killed inside a house and the scene staged, complicated by a flawed police investigation led by Michael Proctor. Proctor's conduct and questionable behavior from party attendees have fueled a conspiracy case, leading to a mistrial. The retrial faces the challenge of overcoming the specter of Proctor and reasonable doubt, with a new special prosecutor and defense strategies.</p>
