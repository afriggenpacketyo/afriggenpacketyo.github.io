          <p>A lawyer representing families of victims from the 2018 Lion Air crash has criticized the deal between Boeing and the US Justice Department as "morally repugnant," stating that it allows Boeing to evade true criminal accountability. The deal involves Boeing paying $1.1 billion to avoid prosecution over two fatal 737 Max crashes that killed 346 people. The settlement includes payments to the families, improvements to compliance programs, and a criminal penalty, but the lawyer argues that the payout is insufficient and akin to a minor ticket for Boeing. If approved by a federal judge, the deal will prevent a criminal fraud trial for the plane manufacturer, though victims' families retain the right to appeal. The lawyer believes the current payout is insufficient for his clients.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a full travel ban for 12 countries, drawing criticism from various ideological quarters. Congresswoman Judy Chu labeled the ban "bigoted and Islamophobic," arguing it contradicts American values and does not enhance safety. Immigration analyst Alex Nowrasteh pointed out that terrorists from these countries have killed only one person on US soil since 1975. Oxfam America warned that the ban marks a return to policies of fear, discrimination, and division, disproportionately targeting Muslim-majority countries and nations with predominantly Black and brown populations. The ban is expected to face legal challenges.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to restrict foreign student visas at Harvard University, citing national security concerns. The university has denounced the move as "yet another illegal retaliatory step" and a violation of its First Amendment rights. Trump's proclamation would suspend the entry of foreign nationals seeking to study or participate in exchange programs at Harvard for an initial six months. The administration claims Harvard has connections with China that could advance its military modernization and considers it a top "party school" for Chinese Communist Party bureaucrats. Harvard has stated it will continue to protect its international students.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has ordered an investigation into Joe Biden's actions as president, alleging that top aides masked his predecessor's "cognitive decline." The investigation will build on Republican-led efforts to discredit Biden and overturn some of his executive actions. Trump's memo targets Biden's use of an autopen to sign executive actions, questioning who wielded executive power during Biden's presidency. GOP lawmakers have requested testimony from Biden's top aides regarding his mental and physical faculties. Democrats have dismissed the investigations as a distraction.</p>

          <p>Newspaper headlines highlight Chancellor Rachel Reeves' expected "winter fuel U-turn," restoring payments to pensioners but clawing them back through higher taxes. There are fears of "chaos" over the plan, with potential recovery of sums from bereaved families. Immigration policies are also a major focus, with contrasting approaches from Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch. The Financial Times reports that Trump's tax bill will significantly increase US debt, while the Daily Mirror highlights an increase in free school meals.</p>

          <p>The Washington Department of Natural Resources (DNR) is using a firefighting helicopter to remove abandoned boats from Squaxin Island in Puget Sound. This operation, funded by a federal grant, aims to clean up derelict vessels that have drifted onto the island, which is of cultural importance to the Squaxin Island Tribe. The DNR has removed 14 vessels in this largest operation of its kind, opting for airlift to minimize disruption to the marine environment. Since 2002, the department has removed over 1,200 derelict vessels, with hundreds more still remaining.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers found in Burmese amber has shed light on how birds surpassed dinosaurs in conquering the skies. The study focused on the evolution of flight feathers during the Cretaceous period, revealing essential features that enabled birds to generate thrust and lift. Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences analyzed the structural details of these ancient feathers, providing insights into the development of flight capabilities. While most feathered dinosaurs could not fly, this research highlights the critical role of feather evolution in the emergence of avian flight.</p>
