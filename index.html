          <p>Elon Musk recently announced the formation of the "America Party," a third-party alternative he claims will challenge the U.S. political duopoly. He suggests it could win a few key congressional seats, acting as a deciding vote on contentious legislation. However, political science experts are skeptical, pointing to the immense structural and financial advantages of the Republican and Democratic parties, which have historically prevented third parties from gaining a significant foothold. Analysts note that successful third parties typically disrupt and influence major party platforms rather than winning elections, a role Musk's current approach seems to ignore.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly advancing its deep space exploration ambitions, aiming to land astronauts on the moon by 2030 and retrieve samples from Mars. Key hardware, including the Mengzhou crew capsule and the Long March-10 rocket, is now in advanced development and testing stages. While NASA's Artemis program officially has an earlier target for a crewed lunar landing, it faces significant technical challenges, such as the need for unproven in-orbit refueling for its Starship lander. This progress positions China as a serious competitor to the United States' long-held dominance in space exploration.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will impose 30% tariffs on all imports from the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1. In letters, President Trump cited persistent trade deficits and national security as reasons for the move, while also acknowledging Mexico's help on border issues but stating it was insufficient. This action escalates trade tensions and challenges long-standing global trade norms, which generally prevent countries from charging different tariff rates to different partners. The EU had hoped to reach a deal to avert the tariffs and has indicated it may retaliate with countermeasures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russia has intensified its aerial attacks on Ukraine, launching a large-scale assault involving nearly 600 drones and 26 cruise missiles overnight and into Saturday. The attacks targeted multiple regions, including Chernivtsi, Lviv, and Kharkiv, resulting in at least six fatalities and numerous injuries. Ukrainian air defense successfully intercepted a significant portion of the projectiles, but falling debris and direct hits caused casualties and damage. This recent escalation in long-range strikes coincides with a concerted Russian push along the front line, placing Ukrainian forces under severe pressure.</p>

          <p>Health officials in Coconino County, Arizona, have confirmed that a resident has died from pneumonic plague, the first such death recorded in the state since 2007. While rare in humans, plague is a bacterial infection endemic to rodent populations in western U.S. states and is typically transmitted by infected fleas. Pneumonic plague is the most severe form and can spread between people, though modern cases are effectively treated with antibiotics. Officials have not released the victim's identity but are reminding the public to take precautions around wildlife and sick or dead animals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Years before the catastrophic flood that killed dozens, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) approved multiple requests from Camp Mystic to remove numerous buildings from its 100-year flood map. This re-designation exempted the camp from mandatory flood insurance and eased regulations for its expansion within a high-risk area known as "flash flood alley." An analysis shows that even by FEMA's original standards, and more so by modern climate risk models, nearly the entire camp was vulnerable. Critics argue these exemptions highlight a flawed process that may prioritize property owners over public safety, raising questions about regulatory oversight preceding the tragedy.</p>

Two elderly female residents of the home, one in her 80s and another in her 90s, died the day after the incident, and police are investigating if the crash contributed to their deaths. The men are charged with robbery and kidnapping, as the car's owner was allegedly in the vehicle during a test drive when it was stolen.

          <p>New research suggests a potential link between the painkiller gabapentin, commonly prescribed for lower back pain, and a higher risk of dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The observational study, published in Regional Anesthesia & Pain Medicine, analyzed a large database of U.S. health records. It found that patients aged 35 to 64 who took the drug were more than twice as likely to develop these conditions within a decade. The risk appeared to increase with the frequency of prescriptions, though researchers caution that the study does not establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship.</p>

          <p>A new law signed by President Trump, titled the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," will significantly restructure the federal student loan system. The act reduces the number of repayment plans to just two options: a standard 10-25 year plan and a new income-driven plan called the Repayment Assistance Plan. It also phases out existing plans like SAVE, tightens eligibility for Pell Grants, and introduces borrowing caps for Parent PLUS and Grad PLUS loans. While the White House touts the changes as simplifying a confusing system, some advocates worry the new 30-year term for income-based repayment will force borrowers into debt for longer.

Ajjan suggests that these factors can create emotional distance and prevent genuine connection.

          <p>Researchers are concerned that political backlash against Covid-19 mRNA vaccines could jeopardize the future of promising cancer therapies that use the same technology. Groundbreaking research into personalized mRNA vaccines for treating cancers like pancreatic, melanoma, and brain tumors is now facing uncertainty. The Trump administration has implemented significant cuts to the National Institutes of Health, and some scientists report being told to remove "mRNA" from grant applications. Experts warn that stalling this progress could delay transformative treatments for a wide range of diseases beyond cancer, including autoimmune disorders.</p>

          <p>Josh Earnest, who served as Barack Obama's press secretary, recently described the day after Donald Trump's 2016 election win as his hardest on the job. He recalled the challenge of reconciling the administration's warnings about a Trump presidency with the constitutional duty of a peaceful transfer of power. Earnest shared that the mood in the White House was "emotional" and visibly demoralized. He recounted how President Obama gathered communications staff in the Oval Office to deliver an early, poignant version of his public speech urging national unity and patriotism.</p>

          <p>When 13-year-old Micah Clayborne complained of chest pains, his mother, a heart transplant recipient herself, sought immediate medical help.

After receiving a pacemaker and defibrillator, Micah was placed on the transplant list and successfully received a new heart.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This essay argues that modern children are increasingly deprived of free, unstructured physical play, which is crucial for their development. The author notes that, like young animals, children have a natural inclination to move wildly, but societal norms, safety fears, and lack of access to open spaces have led to more sedentary lifestyles. This inactivity has dire consequences for physical and mental health. The article cites experts who state that restricting risky play deprives children of developing "movement quality," which is essential for long-term athletic robustness and injury prevention.</p>

          <p>Following a Florida law empowering highway patrol to detain drivers based on immigration status, many immigrants are adopting new, self-imposed rules to avoid being targeted. These informal guidelines include removing Spanish-language stickers, playing English-language radio, avoiding work vans, and not wearing work uniforms in the car. The fear of detention and deportation has created a climate of anxiety, impacting daily life and the ability to work, with some construction sites reporting that dozens of workers have not shown up. Human rights advocates argue this trend reflects an effort to normalize border-style enforcement throughout the country.</p>

          <p>Germany's Interior Minister, Alexander Dobrindt, has dismissed concerns that a political spat over judicial appointments is damaging the nation's highest court. The controversy arose after the conservative CDU/CSU bloc withdrew its support for a Social Democratic Party (SPD) candidate for the Federal Constitutional Court, causing a vote to be postponed. Coalition partner SPD and opposition parties accused the conservatives of undermining democratic institutions. Dobrindt described the delay as a normal part of the political process. The article also notes a new labor agreement at industrial giant Thyssenkrupp aimed at cost-cutting.</p>

          <p>Financial author Katie Gatti Tassin argues that the high cost of beauty maintenance is an "insidious force" in women's financial lives, dubbing it the "hot girl hamster wheel." She points out that spending on aesthetic enhancements like hair, nails, and skincare are recurring expenses that function as a depreciating asset, requiring ever-increasing investment. Tassin suggests women conduct a "hot girl detox" by annualizing these costs to see their true financial impact and then experiment with cutting back. The saved money can then be used more productively to pay down debt, build savings, or invest for the future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The osprey, a conservation success story after rebounding from near-extinction, is facing a new threat in its key habitat around the Chesapeake Bay. Biologist Bryan Watts has documented an alarming decline in the number of chicks surviving to fledge, which he attributes to a lack of menhaden, a small, nutrient-rich fish. He argues that overfishing of menhaden for fish oil and other products is causing osprey chicks to starve. The fishing industry disputes this claim, pointing to other potential factors like climate change, but the findings have prompted regulators to consider new fishing restrictions.</p>

Graham warned that working-class voters are turning away from Labour "in droves" and suggested the £1.2 million in annual affiliation fees could be better spent on member services if the party does not change course.</p>

Despite its stylized branding, the reality of the camp is reportedly inhumane, with prisoners facing extreme heat, unsanitary conditions, maggot-infested food, and a lack of access to legal counsel.

They claim a mass exodus of experienced staff, plunging morale, and grant cuts under the Trump administration have left FEMA ill-equipped to handle multiple simultaneous disasters. Michael Coen, the agency's former chief of staff, expressed concern that FEMA may lack the funding and personnel to meet public expectations during the current hurricane season.
