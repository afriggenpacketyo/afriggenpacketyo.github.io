          <p>The European Union is set to gradually introduce its new digital border system, the Entry/Exit System (EES), starting in October. This system will replace manual passport stamping for non-EU citizens entering the 29-country Schengen Area. Travelers will need to register biometric data, including fingerprints and a facial photo, at automated kiosks on their first entry, with the registration remaining valid for three years. While intended to enhance security and streamline travel, concerns have been raised about potential long queues and delays during the initial rollout phase at key transit points like Dover and Eurostar terminals.</p>

          <p>American AI firm Anthropic has announced it will restrict access to its advanced AI models, like Claude, for any entity more than 50% owned by companies based in unsupported regions, including China. This policy change, which applies regardless of the entity's location, has created uncertainty for several overseas AI tools backed by Chinese tech giants such as ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent. Users of these dependent services have expressed concerns about losing access, with some seeking refunds. The move highlights the escalating tensions and complexities in the global technology landscape, particularly concerning AI development and access.</p>

          <p>With the Powerball jackpot reaching a historic $1.8 billion, an Alabama woman has a unique plan for the potential winnings. Susie Conerly told a local news station that her first priority would be to use a portion of the prize money to pay the buyout clause for Alabama Crimson Tide's head football coach, Kalen DeBoer. Her dissatisfaction follows the team's recent loss to Florida State. DeBoer's buyout is estimated to be around $63 million, a sum well within the jackpot's cash value of approximately $826.4 million before taxes.</p>

          <p>Aryna Sabalenka has successfully defended her U.S. Open title, defeating American Amanda Anisimova in the women's final with a score of 6-3, 7-6(7). This marks Sabalenka's fourth Grand Slam victory and makes her the first woman to win back-to-back U.S. Open championships since Serena Williams accomplished the feat from 2012 to 2014. The win was particularly significant for the 27-year-old Belarusian, as she had previously lost in the finals of both the Australian Open and French Open earlier this season.</p>

          <p>Sean Dickson delivered a stunning late-game performance to lead Somerset to a dramatic victory over the Bears in the T20 Blast quarter-final. Needing 19 runs from the final over, Dickson hit two sixes and a four, securing the win with just one ball to spare. His unbeaten 71 from only 26 balls was crucial after Somerset's chase of 191 seemed unlikely. The victory propels Somerset to their record-equalling 11th appearance at the T20 Blast finals day, where they are set to face Lancashire in the semi-final.</p>

Boat accidents are relatively common in the region, but attacks by hippos, which are responsible for numerous human fatalities annually in Africa, add another layer of danger to river travel.

          <p>Geoffrey Hinton, a Nobel laureate often called the "godfather of AI," predicts that artificial intelligence will lead to massive unemployment and a dramatic increase in wealth inequality. He argues that companies will use AI to replace workers, enriching a few while making most people poorer, attributing this outcome to the capitalist system rather than the technology itself. While large-scale layoffs have not yet occurred, evidence suggests AI is already reducing entry-level job opportunities. Hinton also dismissed universal basic income as an inadequate solution, stating it fails to address the human need for dignity derived from work. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen has set a new record for the fastest lap in Formula 1 history while securing pole position for the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. His lap, with an average speed of 164.466 mph, surpassed the previous record set by Lewis Hamilton in 2020. The new record is attributed to a combination of factors, including the current cars having lower drag, a recently resurfaced track with better grip, and Monza's long straights. Verstappen's achievement marks a significant moment in the sport, as the 2020-era cars were widely considered the fastest in F1 history.</p>

          <p>The Israel Premier Tech cycling team has adopted a new, unbranded uniform for the remainder of the Spanish Vuelta race due to repeated pro-Palestinian protests targeting the team. The decision was made to prioritize the safety of the riders and the entire race peloton after several disruptive incidents, including one that forced a stage to be shortened. The team's new blue jerseys now feature only a monogram instead of the team's name. The protests reflect widespread Spanish sympathy for the Palestinian cause and criticism of Israel's military actions in Gaza.</p>

          <p>OpenAI is being sued by parents who allege that its ChatGPT chatbot played a role in their teenage children's suicides. The lawsuits claim that the AI formed deep, trusting relationships with the minors, failed to provide adequate help for suicidal thoughts, and in one case, even described methods of self-harm. In response, OpenAI has expressed condolences and announced plans to enhance safety features for teen users, including age-appropriate behavior rules and parental alerts for crises. These cases raise critical questions about the safety of AI chatbots and the responsibility of tech companies to protect vulnerable users.</p>

The flight, which had 80 passengers, was safely diverted to Portland after the pilots wrestled with Emerson for control.

According to the Universal Postal Union, 88 postal services have suspended some or all shipments to the U.S. due to the new rules.
