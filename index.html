          <p>Over 300 scientists from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have signed an open letter, called the Bethesda Declaration, criticizing the Trump administration's policies regarding research funding, staff cuts, and global collaboration. The scientists expressed concerns that research is being politicized and that the NIH's ability to conduct important research is being hindered. The letter calls for the reinstatement of staff, the restoration of funding, and the reversal of policies capping indirect research costs, as well as a return to supporting international collaboration. While NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya acknowledged the letter and the importance of respectful dissent in science, he also stated that the Bethesda Declaration has some fundamental misconceptions about NIH policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration following the deployment of the state's National Guard to Los Angeles, labeling the move an "unprecedented power grab." The lawsuit argues that President Trump unlawfully bypassed Governor Gavin Newsom by placing the troops under federal control without the governor's consent. California contends that the law cited by the administration does not apply to the protests in Los Angeles, asserting that there is no rebellion or insurrection. Attorney General Rob Bonta argues that the federalization of the National Guard deprives the state of resources needed for emergencies, while Newsom accuses Trump of escalating the situation for political gain.</p>

The streaming and studios business, which will include HBO Max and the film division, will be headed by Mr. Zaslav, while the Global Networks company, encompassing CNN, Discovery, and TNT Sports, will be led by Gunnar Wiedenfels.</p>

          <p>A mural by Barbara Kruger titled “Questions” has become a striking backdrop to protests against ICE raids in downtown Los Angeles, posing a series of queries about power and control. The mural, commissioned in 1990, features questions like “Who is beyond the law?” and “Who follows orders?” in stark white letters on a red background. Kruger commented that the protests are giving Trump what he wants: the moment he can declare martial law. The Museum of Contemporary Art, where the mural is located, closed early due to the protests, and a performance by Pussy Riot frontwoman Nadya Tolokonnikova continued inside, broadcasting live audio of the protests.</p>
