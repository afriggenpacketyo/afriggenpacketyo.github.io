          <p>Venezuela's government has requested an emergency UN Security Council session, citing "mounting threats" from recent U.S. military operations in its coastal waters. Caracas alleges the U.S. is using anti-drug trafficking operations as a pretext for a "regime change" policy and stated an expectation of an "armed attack" in the near future. The request, addressed to Russia's ambassador, accuses the Trump administration of threatening regional peace and stability to seize Venezuela's natural resources.</p>

          <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has officially designated Google's search and search advertising services with "strategic market status," activating new regulatory powers. This follows an investigation that found Google holds "substantial and entrenched market power," with over 90% of UK searches on its platform. While not a finding of wrongdoing, the designation means the CMA can now impose conduct requirements, potentially enforcing fairer search rankings and giving publishers more control over their content.

This move escalates U.S.-China tech tensions ahead of anticipated meetings between the two nations' leaders and follows similar scrutiny of other American tech companies like Nvidia.

          <p>The Israeli cabinet has approved a ceasefire agreement to end the two-year war, initiating a withdrawal of troops from parts of Gaza. The deal includes the release of all remaining hostages held by Hamas in exchange for approximately 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 detainees. As Israeli forces pull back to a buffer zone, humanitarian aid is expected to flow into the famine-stricken territory, with a multinational force, including about 200 U.S. troops in a supporting role, set to monitor the pact.</p>

          <p>The recent bankruptcy of First Brands, a major auto parts manufacturer, has caused significant anxiety on Wall Street over potential systemic risks in the private debt market. The company's collapse was triggered by its heavy reliance on opaque, off-balance-sheet financing, which hid the true extent of its liabilities, estimated between $10 billion and $50 billion. The rapid implosion has raised fears of contagion, as investors worry that similar hidden risks and unsustainable debt arrangements could be present in other companies financed by the less-regulated "shadow banking" sector.

The author posits that the Founders, who valued rational debate and the capacity to change one's mind, would be appalled by modern political tribalism, sycophancy, and attacks on the free press.</p>

Lincoln confronted the "monstrous injustice" of slavery by arguing it threatened the founding principles of the Declaration of Independence, which he saw as a promise of equality to be "constantly approximated" over time. During the Civil War, he acted on this belief, framing emancipation and "a new birth of freedom" as the necessary fulfillment of the Revolution's original promise.</p>

          <p>An essay in The Atlantic examines Washington Irving's "Rip Van Winkle" as a foundational American folktale that explores the creation of national memory and identity. The article notes that the story, in which the protagonist sleeps through the American Revolution, is about connecting a new, bustling republic with its pre-revolutionary past. By becoming a "chronicle of the old times," Rip serves as a living link to a history that predates the nation's founding, helping to solve the very problem the story identifies: the need for a common culture and shared stories in a restless new country.</p>

          <p>Japan's Komeito party has reportedly withdrawn from the ruling coalition with the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), a move that could jeopardize Sanae Takaichi's bid to become the country's first female prime minister. The split, which ends a 25-year alliance, was attributed to the LDP's failure to address political funding issues. While the LDP remains the largest party, it now lacks a majority, forcing Takaichi's potential government to negotiate with different partners to pass legislation and complicating her conservative, pro-"Abenomics" agenda.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed Drake's defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group concerning Kendrick Lamar's highly successful diss track, "Not Like Us." The judge ruled that Lamar's lyrics, which included accusations of Drake being a pedophile, constituted "nonactionable opinion" and "hyperbolic vituperations" within the context of a rap battle. The court determined that a reasonable listener would not interpret the incendiary language of a diss track as a source of verifiable, fact-checked content, but rather as part of a "vitriolic war of words."</p>

This approach, sometimes used in Italy, would involve a leader "completely disconnected from the presidential ambitions for 2027" to focus solely on passing a budget and stabilizing the country. While a technocratic government could reassure investors and pause the crisis, the article questions whether such a solution would be accepted by the deeply political French public, especially when tough economic decisions are required.</p>
