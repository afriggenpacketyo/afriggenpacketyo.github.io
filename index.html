          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is cutting short his visit to South Africa and returning to Kyiv in response to deadly Russian strikes on the capital. He announced his decision on Telegram, stating that the Ukrainian Foreign Minister will take over his meetings in South Africa to inform leaders about the situation in Ukraine. This move follows South Africa's recent support for a UN resolution affirming Ukraine's sovereignty, despite its historical ties with Moscow. The decision underscores the severity of the attacks and the urgent need for Zelenskyy's presence in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Japan will implement a revised road traffic law from April 2026, imposing fines for minor traffic violations by cyclists, such as using a mobile phone or ignoring traffic lights. Police will issue "blue tickets" to offenders aged 16 and older, allowing them to avoid indictment by paying a fine. The revised law aims to address the rising popularity of bicycles and reduce accidents involving cyclists. In addition, the law requires cyclists to keep to the left and vehicles to pass bicycles at a safe speed.</p>

Analysts predict gold prices will continue to rise, citing its inflation-hedging qualities and independence from any single nation's monetary or fiscal policy.
