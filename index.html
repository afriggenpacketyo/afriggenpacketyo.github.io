          <p>Iran and the United States are set to begin a third round of talks concerning Iran's nuclear program, raising hopes for a new agreement to de-escalate tensions in the Middle East.

The talks aim to reduce the likelihood of a U.S.-backed Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear facilities and prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, potentially easing sanctions and opening the country to foreign investment.</p>

          <p>In Alberta, Canada, separatist sentiments are growing, fueled by perceived neglect from the federal government and comparisons to the United States. Some Albertans express feeling more culturally aligned with states like Montana and Texas than with the rest of Canada. With national elections approaching, the possibility of Alberta seeking independence or even joining the U.S. is being openly discussed, though polls indicate limited support for outright separation. This regional divide presents a challenge for Canada's next prime minister, particularly if the Liberal Party wins again.</p>

          <p>Google argues it is the only company capable of running Chrome due to its integration with other Google services, as the Justice Department pursues antitrust actions. The government is seeking to force Google to sell Chrome and share search data, while Google contends that Chrome's features rely on shared infrastructure. A computer science expert testified that divesting Chrome is technically feasible, but Google claims it contributes over 90% of Chromium's code, suggesting other companies aren't meaningfully involved. Google also plans to integrate AI further into Chrome, positioning it as an 'agentic browser'.</p>

          <p>A Japanese research team has found that listening to a specific sound for one minute may help prevent motion sickness symptoms. The 100 hertz sound stimulates the inner ear, improving balance and reducing motion sickness. This finding could offer an alternative to medication, especially with the rise of self-driving vehicles where passengers are more prone to motion sickness. Studies showed that 70-80% of participants experienced alleviated symptoms after exposure to the sound.</p>

Senator Ed Markey has urged the Small Business Administration to provide relief, highlighting the vulnerability of small businesses to rising costs. While the Trump administration defends the tariffs as a means to protect domestic manufacturing, critics argue they disproportionately impact small enterprises without the resources to absorb price shocks. Isabel Guzman notes that small businesses lack the financial reserves and supply chain diversity of larger companies, making them more susceptible to the tariffs' negative effects.</p>

Attorney General Pam Bondi cited the need to stop government employees from leaking sensitive information, arguing that such leaks undermine the DOJ's ability to uphold the rule of law. The policy allows for subpoenas, court orders, and search warrants, subject to DOJ leadership approval and advance notice to journalists.

          <p>The Trump administration has launched an investigation into the University of California, Berkeley, regarding foreign funding, making it the latest university targeted by the federal government. The investigation revives criticism about the university's partnership with China's Tsinghua University. The Department of Education will investigate UC Berkeley's apparent failure to fully disclose funding from foreign sources. UC Berkeley denies the government’s claims.</p>

          <p>Border Force officers at Manchester Airport became suspicious of a couple's behavior with a baby, leading to the discovery that the child was not related to either of the adults. The couple, Raphael Ossai and Oluwakemi Olasanoye, were found to be carrying a false birth certificate. The child, named Lucy, was born in Nigeria and given to an orphanage. Ossai and Olasanoye pleaded guilty to immigration offenses, while Lucy has been in care in Manchester for nearly two years as the High Court tries to determine her true identity and future.</p>
