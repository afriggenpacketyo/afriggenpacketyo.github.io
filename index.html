          <p>Warren Buffett announced at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting that he will recommend Greg Abel as his successor as CEO by year-end. Buffett, 94, will remain involved but cede operational and capital allocation decisions to Abel, currently the vice chairman of non-insurance operations. The announcement, a surprise to most board members, marks a significant transition for the conglomerate, which Buffett has led since 1965, transforming it into a $1.2 trillion powerhouse with diverse holdings. Buffett emphasized his intent to retain his Berkshire shares, citing confidence in Abel's leadership and the company's future prospects.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California Democratic Party is considering a resolution to explore a mandatory retirement age for state and local politicians, reflecting concerns about leaders holding power past their prime. Sparked by issues surrounding older politicians like the late Senator Dianne Feinstein and former President Joseph R. Biden, the proposal aims to address the need for generational change. While some argue this is ageism, others point to instances where leaders' health has impacted their ability to serve effectively. The resolution faces opposition and would require a state law to be enacted, with Governor Gavin Newsom expressing skepticism about arbitrary age limits.</p>

          <p>The Daniel K. Inouye Telescope in Hawaii has achieved a milestone by capturing a detailed image of sunspots using its new Visible Tunable Filter (VTF). Scientists hope this instrument will enhance the prediction of solar storms, which can disrupt Earth's radio communications and electrical grids. The VTF, designed by the Leibniz Institute for Solar Physics in Germany, is described as the telescope's 'heart,' and its success promises to help mitigate the damage caused by geomagnetic disturbances. The telescope's construction faced protests due to its location on land considered sacred by native Hawaiians.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has filed a lawsuit against Colorado and Denver, challenging laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The lawsuit targets state and city policies that restrict information sharing, prohibit holding individuals solely on immigration detainers, and limit the use of city resources for immigration enforcement. The administration argues these policies are unconstitutional and endanger residents by providing safe havens for criminals. Colorado officials maintain they are not a sanctuary state and cooperate with law enforcement, while Denver emphasizes the need to protect sensitive locations from immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. apparently doesn't believe that germs cause disease, which may explain recent public health decisions. Based on RFK's own words in his book, he embraces the debunked miasma theory and argues that germ theory was wrongly adopted. This belief is reflected in his decision to eliminate health officials in charge of sanitation and disease prevention.

          <p>The United States imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, potentially raising prices for new and used vehicles and repair costs. These tariffs follow earlier levies on imported cars, and aim to incentivize domestic production. However, even cars made in the U.S. often use imported components. Exemptions exist for parts from Canada and Mexico meeting trade agreement requirements, and some companies receive temporary relief. Experts predict rising car prices, supply chain disruptions, and financial stress on suppliers.</p>
