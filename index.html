          <p>The Wisconsin Supreme Court, which holds a liberal majority, recently opted not to hear two lawsuits that sought to redraw the state's eight congressional districts. This decision is widely seen as a significant advantage for Republicans in the lead-up to the 2026 midterm elections, as it likely solidifies the positions of Republican Representatives Derrick Van Orden and Bryan Steil in their competitive districts. While Democrats acknowledge this as a setback, they express continued confidence in their capacity to contest these seats effectively. Republicans, conversely, interpret the court's action as a clear rejection of what they term politically motivated efforts to manipulate electoral maps, underscoring the profound impact of such rulings on national political dynamics.</p>

          <p>Netflix continues to successfully attract some of Hollywood's most esteemed directors, such as Martin Scorsese and Greta Gerwig, despite its unconventional approach of largely bypassing wide theatrical releases. The streaming service leverages lucrative contracts, substantial creative freedom, and immediate access to its vast subscriber base of over 300 million to entice top talent. Industry insiders highlight that Netflix has also become a crucial platform for auteurs whose high-budget or genre-risky films might not otherwise secure production. While some analysts question the financial implications of this strategy, Netflix prioritizes delivering content directly to its subscribers and significantly reduces marketing costs, solidifying its distinctive and influential role in the global entertainment landscape.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to introduce a significant legal change, extending bereavement leave entitlements to parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy. This amendment to the Employment Rights Bill marks a crucial expansion from the current policy, which only grants such leave for losses occurring after 24 weeks or for children under 18. The proposed new right to leave would be unpaid and last for a minimum of one week, with specific details subject to further consultation. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner emphasized that this initiative aims to provide grieving parents with necessary time away from work, formally recognizing early pregnancy loss as a legitimate and profound bereavement.</p>

Victoria's body was later found in a shed, with evidence suggesting she died in a tent during January 2023. The prosecution contends that the baby perished due to exposure to "cold, damp and windy conditions with wholly inadequate clothing."

          <p>Stephen Doohan, a former clinical team leader with the Scottish Ambulance Service, has been sentenced to 10 years and six months in prison for secretly administering an abortion drug to a pregnant woman, leading to the tragic loss of their unborn child. Doohan, who was married, crushed pills into a syringe and injected the woman while she was in bed at his Edinburgh home in 2023. The victim subsequently experienced significant pain and suffered a miscarriage, later uncovering his deceptive actions. The judge harshly condemned Doohan's premeditated use of his paramedic knowledge to manipulate and inflict profound harm upon the woman, leaving her with enduring pain and loss. His employment with the ambulance service was terminated.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article identifies Fluor (NYSE: FLR) as a compelling investment opportunity within the nuclear power sector, largely owing to its substantial 57% majority ownership stake in NuScale, a company at the forefront of developing innovative small modular reactors. While many emerging nuclear startups, including NuScale, are not yet profitable, Fluor itself is currently generating earnings. The analysis points out that a significant portion of Fluor's market capitalization is directly supported by its interest in NuScale, and the company boasts a healthy balance sheet with more cash than debt. Despite acknowledging potential risks such as NuScale's elevated valuation, analysts project robust profitability for Fluor in the near future, suggesting it may be currently undervalued.

          <p>Dow, a prominent chemicals company, has announced its intention to close three upstream plants across Europe and eliminate approximately 800 jobs over the next two years. This strategic decision is a direct response to persistent structural challenges within the European market, notably high production costs, subdued demand, and increasingly stringent environmental regulations. The affected facilities include an ethylene cracker in Böhlen, Germany; chlor-alkali and vinyl assets in Schkopau, Germany; and a Basics siloxanes plant in Barry, UK. These closures are part of Dow's broader effort to streamline its portfolio by divesting higher-cost operations, and they complement an earlier announcement of 1,500 global job reductions, leading to substantial financial charges for the company.

          <p>This article offers a sharp critique of the new nationwide Medicaid work requirement, asserting that it will not strengthen the program but instead impose significant burdens on low-income Americans. It challenges the Republican rationale that the measure prevents abuse, arguing that the vast majority of Medicaid recipients are already employed or have legitimate reasons for not working. The author redefines the policy as a "work-reporting requirement," predicting it will create immense bureaucratic red tape and substantial costs for taxpayers, ultimately causing millions to lose crucial health coverage. The article concludes that this policy is likely to disproportionately weed out eligible participants rather than genuinely motivating noncompliant individuals, leading to adverse health outcomes.

          <p>Recent ARD Deutschlandtrend polls indicate a notable decline in support for Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD), which has fallen to 13%, marking its lowest result since 1887.

The polls underscore public anxieties regarding armed conflicts, though migration and the economy remain the most pressing issues for Germans. A majority also supports the reintroduction of compulsory military service, including for women, and a substantial portion believes current sanctions for the unemployed are fitting, reflecting evolving public priorities and a challenging political landscape for the SPD.</p>

Modi's social media post extended warm wishes, describing the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader as an "enduring symbol of love, compassion, patience and moral discipline."

The Chihuahua's steadfast presence and indicative behavior enabled rescuers to accurately pinpoint the accident site, leading to the successful extraction of the injured man.
