          <p>This article highlights two uplifting stories of resilience and serendipity. Two childhood cancer survivors, who were treated for the same leukemia 17 years ago, have unexpectedly reunited as first-year medical students, inspiring them to become the kind of doctors who once saved their lives. In a separate account, an Arkansas hairstylist's sharp observation during a routine appointment led to the early detection of skin cancer on her client's scalp, ultimately saving her life. Both narratives underscore the profound impact of shared experiences and the life-changing importance of attentiveness in everyday situations.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has stated his belief that the artificial intelligence market is currently experiencing a bubble, characterized by excessive investor excitement around a "kernel of truth." He compared the current surge in AI investment to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, acknowledging both the immense long-term importance of AI and the present overvaluation risks. Altman's cautionary remarks align with similar warnings from other financial experts who have noted speculative capital chasing companies with weak fundamentals, even as OpenAI itself continues to attract massive investment and is reportedly on track for significant revenue growth.

          <p>A federal judge is poised to rule on the legitimacy of Alina Habba's position as the acting U.S. attorney for New Jersey, a role she assumed after President Trump utilized procedural loopholes to bypass Senate confirmation. The legal challenge was initiated by a criminal defendant who argues that the unconventional maneuvers to install Habba, Trump's former personal lawyer, violate his constitutional rights. The Department of Justice defends the appointment, asserting that all actions complied with federal vacancy laws, while critics, including legal associations, have called the process an unprecedented circumvention of established statutes.</p>

          <p>Conservative media network Newsmax has agreed to a $67 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems to resolve a defamation lawsuit. The suit alleged that Newsmax knowingly spread false claims about Dominion's voting machines rigging the 2020 presidential election. This settlement follows a similar, much larger payment made by Fox News and another substantial settlement from Newsmax to a different voting machine company. Despite the agreement, Newsmax maintains its coverage was fair and balanced, while internal documents revealed during the case showed that network officials were aware the election fraud claims were baseless.</p>

He expressed skepticism that U.S. export controls on advanced semiconductors are a sufficient strategy to curb China's ambitions, suggesting that workarounds like building domestic facilities are likely. Altman noted that competition from Chinese open-source models was a significant factor in OpenAI's recent decision to release its own open-weight models, aiming to prevent Chinese technology from dominating the global developer landscape and maintain a competitive U.S. presence.</p>

          <p>Southern California and the Southwest are bracing for the most dangerous heat wave of the summer, with temperatures expected to soar 10 to 20 degrees above normal. The National Weather Service has issued extreme heat and fire weather advisories, warning of triple-digit highs in many inland areas, including up to 108 degrees in Woodland Hills and 120 in Death Valley. Officials are urging residents to take precautions against heat-related illnesses by staying hydrated and avoiding outdoor activities during peak hours. The combination of extreme heat and low humidity also creates exceptionally favorable conditions for explosive fire growth.</p>

          <p>With average credit card interest rates nearing 22%, carrying a significant balance of $25,000 can result in approximately $5,500 in interest charges annually. This breaks down to about $456 per month in interest alone, meaning that typical minimum payments barely reduce the principal debt. The article explains that relying solely on minimum payments could take decades to clear the debt and cost tens of thousands in total interest. To mitigate these costs, consumers are advised to pay more than the minimum, consider a 0% APR balance transfer, or consolidate debt with a lower-rate loan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Democrats have unveiled a controversial proposal to redraw the state's congressional district maps mid-decade, a move aimed at gaining up to five U.S. House seats for their party. This plan is a direct response to a similar Republican-led effort in Texas and is intended to help Democrats in their fight to control Congress in the upcoming midterm elections. The proposal would require a state constitutional amendment, needing a two-thirds vote in the legislature and subsequent approval from voters in a special election. Critics argue this move prioritizes partisan advantage over the independent redistricting process voters previously approved.</p>

          <p>The recent era of high employee turnover known as the "great resignation" has given way to a new trend dubbed "job hugging," where workers are clinging to their current roles amid economic uncertainty. The rate at which employees voluntarily quit their jobs has fallen to its lowest consistent level since 2016, reflecting growing worker anxiety about finding new employment. This stagnation is linked to a cooling labor market, characterized by a slower hiring rate and reduced job openings.

          <p>U.S. Representative LaMonica McIver of New Jersey is facing felony charges for allegedly assaulting federal officers during a congressional oversight visit to an immigration detention center. Her legal team argues the charges are an unconstitutional and politically motivated effort by the Trump administration to silence her oversight of immigration policy. They have filed motions to dismiss the case, citing legislative immunity and selective prosecution, and comparing her treatment unfavorably to that of many January 6 defendants. The indictment accuses McIver of striking and pushing agents during a chaotic encounter, charges that could result in up to 17 years in prison.</p>

          <h2>Experts Advise Reinvesting Stock Dividends to Harness the Power of Compound Interest</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 13:28:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts recommend that investors utilize dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs) as a simple and effective strategy to boost long-term returns through compound interest. A DRIP automatically uses the cash dividends paid by a stock to purchase more shares of that same stock, often including fractional shares. This passive approach ensures that money is consistently put to work, steadily growing an investment over time. For example, over a recent 10-year period, the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) saw a total return of 239% with dividends reinvested, compared to just 185% based on price return alone. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two American tourists in their 70s drowned in two separate incidents on the same day at Celebration Key, a new private resort in the Bahamas for Carnival Cruise Line passengers. The first incident involved a 79-year-old man who was found unresponsive while snorkeling off a beach. A few hours later, a 74-year-old woman was discovered unconscious while swimming in a resort pool. Both guests were traveling on different Carnival ships with their families, and despite resuscitation efforts by lifeguards and medical staff, both were pronounced dead. Local authorities are investigating the incidents.</p>

          <p>A source within Hamas has indicated that the group has agreed to the latest ceasefire proposal presented by Egyptian and Qatari mediators. The framework would reportedly involve an initial 60-day truce during which Hamas would release about half of the remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for negotiations on a permanent ceasefire. This development comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously stated he would only accept a deal that releases all hostages at once. It remains unclear how Israel will respond, as its cabinet is also expected to approve plans for a wider military offensive in Gaza City.</p>

          <p>Zarah Sultana, a Member of Parliament who recently co-founded a new political party with former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, has criticized him for having "capitulated" on the definition of antisemitism. In an interview, Sultana claimed that Corbyn's acceptance of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition was a mistake because it equates antisemitism with anti-Zionism. Her comments drew immediate criticism from Jewish groups, who called them a "grave insult." Sultana argued that the Corbyn movement was "far too conciliatory" when attacked and should have recognized the state and media as "class enemies."</p>

          <p>Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada, a long-time and influential leader of Mexico's Sinaloa cartel, is scheduled to plead guilty in a Brooklyn federal court to a range of charges including drug trafficking, money laundering, and conspiracy to commit murder. The 77-year-old was arrested in Texas last year after decades of evading capture. Under his leadership with co-founder "El Chapo" Guzmán, the Sinaloa cartel became one of the world's largest and most violent drug trafficking organizations.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest that while homeowners can qualify for a reverse mortgage at age 62, the best time to take one out is often later, typically in one's late 60s or early 70s. The amount of equity a borrower can access increases with age, as lenders factor in a shorter life expectancy and thus less time for interest to accrue. The decision should also depend on a retiree's immediate income needs, long-term goals, and commitment to aging in place. A reverse mortgage can be a useful tool to supplement a fixed income or delay drawing on other retirement assets. (not investment advice)</p>

This renews his disproven claims about the 2020 election and comes despite the fact that his own 2024 campaign had previously encouraged Republican voters to use mail-in and early voting options.</p>

He asserted that Bayindir had performed well during the preseason and earned the start, emphasizing a team philosophy where players are not dropped without cause.

The outbreak, centered in West Texas, resulted in the deaths of two unvaccinated children. The Texas Department of State Health Services credited the containment to the tireless work of public health professionals in testing, vaccination, and public education efforts, but warned that providers should remain vigilant for new cases.</p>

This price reversal led to a wave of forced liquidations, with over $576 million in long positions sold off across the market in 24 hours.

The lawsuit challenges the government's assertion that all detainees have criminal records, stating that many have deep roots in the U.S. and no criminal history.
