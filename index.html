          <p>Elon Musk announced the end of his tenure as a "special government employee" leading President Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), expressing gratitude to Trump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending. Musk's departure follows his criticism of Trump's budget bill, which he believes undermines DOGE's efforts to cut spending. Despite stepping down, Musk affirmed that the DOGE mission to streamline government operations will persist. Musk had previously indicated his intention to dedicate more time to his companies, including Tesla and SpaceX, and less time to government work.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal court has blocked President Trump's sweeping tariffs, ruling that he overstepped his authority and dealing a blow to a key part of his economic policies. The Manhattan-based court said the U.S. Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations, which is not superseded by the president's remit to safeguard the economy. The court also blocked levies imposed on China, Mexico, and Canada in response to drug and illegal immigration concerns. The Trump administration swiftly lodged an appeal, asserting its commitment to using executive power to address the crisis and restore American Greatness.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts directed the Trump administration to lift a pause on various immigration applications, stating that it is not in the public interest for immigrants to lose their legal status. The ruling is a reprieve for immigrants from Afghanistan, Latin America, Ukraine, and other regions whose ability to remain and work in the U.S. was threatened. The judge agreed with pro-immigrant advocates that the government's actions were arbitrary and capricious, violating federal administrative law. The programs affected by the order rely on a legal immigration authority known as parole, which allows temporary admission on humanitarian or public interest grounds.</p>

Farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi called Tamaki's remark unfortunate, especially as the government works to release the rice effectively. Rice prices in Japan have hit record highs, increasing 98.4 percent from the previous year, prompting the government to intervene with stockpiled rice.</p>

          <p>Grant Hardin, a former police chief and convicted killer known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," escaped from a medium-security prison in Arkansas. Hardin, who was serving a decades-long sentence for murder and sexual assault, escaped by impersonating a corrections officer. Authorities are conducting an active search using canines, drones, and helicopters in the rugged Ozark Mountains. Hardin had been held at the prison since 2017 after pleading guilty to first-degree murder and had also been sentenced for a 1997 sexual assault.</p>

          <p>Pedestrian deaths have surged by 78% in the past 15 years, partly due to the increasing size and weight of vehicles like SUVs and trucks, which create large blind zones and require longer braking distances. The average passenger vehicle has gained 1,000 pounds and eight inches in height over three decades. Demonstrations show that blind spots in front of larger vehicles make it difficult for drivers to see pedestrians, especially small children.

          <p>A panel of federal judges blocked President Trump from imposing some of his steepest tariffs on China and other U.S. trading partners, stating he overstepped his authority under federal law. The U.S. Court of International Trade found that the 1977 federal economic emergency law did not authorize the president to issue tariffs. The ruling is a setback to Trump's campaign to reorient the nationâ€™s trading relationships, setting up a legal fight that could reach the Supreme Court. The White House sharply rebuked the court for its ruling, asserting that unfair trade relationships have harmed American communities.</p>
