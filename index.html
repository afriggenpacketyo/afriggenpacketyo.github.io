          <p>Following two days of discussions in London, U.S. and Chinese representatives have agreed on a framework to implement the Geneva trade consensus, which aims to stabilize the relationship between the two countries after recent trade tensions. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the agreement addresses Chinese restrictions on rare-earth exports to the U.S. and potential rollbacks of U.S. tech sales restrictions to China, contingent on approvals from both President Trump and President Xi Jinping. This framework signifies a commitment to de-escalation, though the specifics and potential for breakthroughs remain uncertain, and both sides will brief their respective leaders on the details of the agreement. This development signals a move towards resolving trade disputes and fostering bilateral trust between the world's two largest economies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chris Newman, the lawyer representing Kilmar Abrego Garcia, argues that his client's case extends beyond immigration issues, highlighting it as a crucial moment for due process rights in the U.S. Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. after being mistakenly deported to El Salvador, where he was held in a supermax prison, despite a previous court ruling against his deportation. Newman accuses the Trump administration of defying court orders and denying Abrego Garcia due process, while the administration asserts compliance with court orders. Democratic lawmakers who visited Abrego Garcia in El Salvador conveyed a warning about the erosion of democratic institutions, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding constitutional protections. The legal proceedings aim to ensure Abrego Garcia has the opportunity to defend himself in court against the charges of human smuggling.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has announced a curfew for downtown Los Angeles in response to ongoing anti-ICE protests, which have resulted in nearly 200 arrests and instances of looting. The curfew, effective from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m., covers a one-square-mile area of downtown L.A., with exemptions for residents, workers, credentialed media, and individuals experiencing homelessness. Protests began following immigration raids, drawing attention from President Trump, who deployed National Guard troops and Marines to protect federal buildings, a move opposed by California Governor Gavin Newsom. Bass emphasized that the curfew is a necessary measure to protect lives and property, and that the unrest is not representative of the entire city, while Newsom is taking legal action against Trump's commandeering of the state's National Guard.</p>

The Dawn Project and other activist groups are planning protests to highlight safety concerns with Tesla's driver assistance features and to express opposition to Musk's political activities. Musk's other ventures include SpaceX and xAI, and he recently concluded a period leading the Department of Government Efficiency, where he implemented significant cuts to federal agencies.</p>

A hiking party reported spotting a hiker matching Decker's description in the Enchantments area, prompting a search that led to the discovery of a solo hiker near Colchuck Lake who fled upon seeing a helicopter. Decker's truck was found at a campsite where the girls' bodies were discovered, and blood found at the scene has been confirmed to belong to a male, and authorities have reopened popular camping areas in the Icicle Creek area, near where the girls were discovered. Decker, a former soldier with survival skills, is also charged in federal court with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution, and search teams are focusing on the Ingalls Creek area.</p>

          <p>A UN panel is urging the UK to renegotiate its deal with Mauritius regarding the Chagos Islands, asserting that the current agreement fails to adequately protect the rights of the Chagossian people. The deal, signed last month, returned sovereignty of the archipelago to Mauritius, while the UK retained the right to operate a military base on Diego Garcia. The panel of UN experts argues that the UK's continued operation of the military base hinders the Chagossian people's ability to exercise their cultural rights and access their ancestral lands. The panel recommends suspending the current deal and negotiating a new agreement that guarantees the Chagossians' right to return to Diego Garcia.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has removed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP), asserting that it has become a "rubber stamp for any vaccine." Kennedy plans to appoint new members comprised of highly credentialed physicians and scientists who will apply evidence-based decision-making. The move has been met with criticism from medical groups, who fear it will erode public confidence in vaccine science and endanger public health. Experts and health authorities closely watch the committee's decisions, since their recommendations are tied to a number of federal policies, including requirements for insurance coverage and liability protections.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that Army bases which had their names changed to honor Confederate leaders before 2023, will have their original names restored. The announcement was made during a speech at Fort Bragg to celebrate the Army's 250th birthday, with Trump stating, "We won a lot of battles out of those forts. It's no time to change. And I'm superstitious. I like to keep it going." This reverses a previous decision by the Biden administration to rename the bases following Black Lives Matter protests, and Trump criticized the move as unnecessary.</p>

          <p>Residents in Japan with foreign roots are increasingly speaking out about racial profiling by police, with some taking legal action to address discriminatory interrogations. A recent survey indicated that over 71% of foreign nationals in Japan have been questioned by police in the past five years, significantly higher than the rate for Japanese citizens. The National Police Agency issued an advisory in December 2021 urging officers to avoid questioning people based solely on appearance, and has begun trialing body cameras to enhance transparency. However, some view recent comments by the justice minister as potentially encouraging discriminatory attitudes, highlighting the ongoing challenges in addressing prejudice.</p>

By taking a large stake in Scale AI rather than acquiring it outright, Meta appears to be following a strategy similar to Google and Microsoft.
