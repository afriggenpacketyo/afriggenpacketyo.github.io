          <p>Liverpool's transfer deadline day bid to acquire Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi has collapsed despite the clubs agreeing on a fee of at least £35 million. The 25-year-old was set to complete a medical and sign a long-term contract with the Premier League champions. However, the deal was called off because Crystal Palace was unable to secure a suitable replacement in time. Palace's primary target, Igor Julio, chose to move to West Ham, leaving them unwilling to sanction Guehi's departure without another defender lined up.</p>

          <p>Benny Safdie's new film, "The Smashing Machine," features Dwayne Johnson in a dramatic role as pioneering MMA and UFC champion Mark Kerr. The movie, based on a 2002 documentary of the same name, explores the personal crisis Kerr faced after his first professional loss, which triggered struggles with substance abuse and relationship anxieties. Johnson's performance is central to the film, which also co-stars Emily Blunt as Kerr's girlfriend, Dawn. While the article praises moments of vulnerability, it notes the film focuses heavily on the fighting aspect, not fully exploring the emotional depth of Kerr's life outside the ring.</p>

          <p>Nine former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have publicly condemned Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s leadership. In a New York Times op-ed, they argue his actions, including the recent firing of CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez and dismantling vaccine research, are undermining the nation's health security. The bipartisan group, whose service spans multiple administrations, expressed alarm over what they describe as an unprecedented attack on the public health system. They are calling on Congress to exercise its oversight authority to address the situation at HHS.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders is urging Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to resign, citing grave concerns over his vaccine policies and their potential to create a public health crisis. Sanders emphasized that the scientific evidence overwhelmingly supports the safety and efficacy of vaccines in saving millions of lives. The call for resignation follows the controversial firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez, who reportedly refused Kennedy's directives to limit vaccine availability. The White House has defended the administration's actions, stating the president has the authority to remove officials not aligned with his mission.</p>

          <p>Chicago endured a violent Labor Day weekend, with police reporting at least 54 people shot, seven of whom died. This surge in violence occurred as President Donald Trump renewed threats to deploy federal agents and the National Guard to the city, a move strongly opposed by Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson. In response to the threats, Mayor Johnson signed an executive order to protect the city from what he termed "federal overreach." Despite a significant drop in violent crime earlier in the year, the holiday weekend saw numerous shootings, including a mass shooting that wounded seven people.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has called on pharmaceutical companies to publicly release data to "justify the success" of their COVID-19 drugs. The demand comes shortly after the FDA limited the approval of new COVID vaccines to high-risk individuals and amidst leadership turmoil at the CDC, where Director Susan Monarez was recently fired. Trump stated he wants an answer "NOW" regarding the effectiveness of the medications, mentioning he has seen "extraordinary" information from Pfizer that has not been made public. He urged for transparency to resolve the public and political disputes surrounding vaccine efficacy, which have been central to HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s agenda.</p>

          <p>According to an analysis of federal data, the number of immigrant workers in the United States has decreased by 1.2 million in the first seven months of the year, reflecting the impact of President Trump's immigration policies. This decline, which includes both legal and undocumented workers, coincides with a significant slowdown in the flow of immigrants into the country. Economists note that this trend could affect sectors heavily reliant on foreign labor, such as agriculture and construction, and potentially complicate labor market signals for the Federal Reserve. The reduction in the workforce is already being felt in states like Texas and California.</p>

Experts suggest the Houthis are increasingly paranoid about espionage and use foreign and local aid workers as valuable bargaining chips in their political and military strategies.

A board-certified psychiatrist explains this behavior as a sign of parasocial relationships—one-sided bonds with media figures—which can be amplified by social media anonymity. The phenomenon may also point to a deeper societal void where people are longing for connection, leading to an unhealthy emotional investment in fictional characters.</p>

The federation's decision, which would ban Khelif from competition until she undergoes the test, followed controversy during the 2024 Paris Olympics. Khelif's appeal seeks to have her declared eligible for the upcoming World Boxing Championships without submitting to the test. The case has ignited a broader debate over gender eligibility in sports, with Khelif being one of two boxers whose participation in the Olympics sparked significant public and media commentary.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian authorities have announced the arrest of a suspect in the assassination of former parliamentary speaker Andriy Parubiy and claim there is a "Russian trace" in the crime. Parubiy, a key figure in Ukraine's pro-European movements, was shot and killed in the western city of Lviv on Saturday. Police stated the suspect, disguised as a food delivery courier, shot Parubiy eight times in a carefully planned attack. The killing of the prominent pro-Western politician has heightened tensions, with Ukrainian officials suggesting Russian involvement in a pattern of assassinations since the 2022 invasion.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in China, signaling deepening ties between the two nations. The meeting is particularly significant as it comes days after the U.S. imposed steep tariffs on Indian imports in response to New Delhi's continued purchase of discounted Russian oil. Both leaders hailed their countries' long-standing partnership, with Putin calling Modi a "dear friend." Analysts suggest that recent U.S. trade policies are pushing India to work more closely with China and Russia against perceived economic unilateralism.</p>

          <p>Denim giant Levi's has warned that "rising anti-Americanism" resulting from President Trump's tariffs and government policies could negatively impact its sales in the United Kingdom. In its UK financial report, the company listed potential shifts in consumer sentiment towards national or European brands as a key risk. Despite reporting increased sales and profits, Levi's is one of the first major U.S. brands to openly voice concerns about the potential commercial fallout from the current U.S. administration's trade policies. This reflects a broader trend where some consumers in other countries have reportedly boycotted American products.</p>

          <p>ScotRail, the publicly-owned railway operator in Scotland, has permanently scrapped peak-time fares, making all tickets off-peak in an effort to attract more passengers. The move follows a trial period and reflects changes in travel patterns since the pandemic, with commuter rush hours being less congested. An anytime day return from Glasgow to Edinburgh has been reduced from £32.60 to £16.80. The initiative raises questions about whether the rest of the UK could adopt a similar model, though experts are divided on the potential impacts, citing risks of overcrowding on busy routes and the need for fare adjustments to maintain revenue.</p>

Trump argues these measures unfairly target American tech giants and has demanded their immediate removal. This renewed dispute comes shortly after a deal was reached to cap transatlantic tariffs, and it has caught EU policymakers off guard. The conflict centers on the EU's sovereign right to regulate its digital market versus U.S. objections to what it considers discriminatory practices against its largest technology companies.

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump overstepped his authority by using national emergency declarations to impose widespread tariffs on most of the country's trading partners. The court found that the use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to justify the levies was likely not intended by Congress to grant unlimited tariff power. While the ruling is a significant legal setback for the administration's trade agenda, the court has allowed the tariffs to remain in effect temporarily to give the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court.
