          <p>Oregon Governor Tina Kotek and Portland Mayor Keith Wilson have strongly opposed President Trump's directive to send federal troops to the city, stating there is "no need" for such an intervention. In an open letter, 110 community leaders argued that a military presence would be counterproductive to the city's recovery, citing economic harm and drawing parallels to the divisive 2020 federal deployment. Officials emphasized that local law enforcement efforts have already led to a decrease in violent crime and that a federal show of force is an unwanted and un-American overreach.</p>

          <p>The German government intends to begin direct negotiations with the Taliban to establish a formal process for deporting Afghan nationals convicted of crimes or considered security threats. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt stated that ministry officials will travel to Kabul in October to discuss the new policy. This move aims to make deportations a regular occurrence, utilizing commercial flights instead of special charters. The initiative is part of a broader push by Germany to manage immigration and national security, which also includes similar deportation discussions with Syria.</p>

          <p>The stock market is closely watching key economic indicators this week, particularly the September nonfarm payrolls report, which will heavily influence the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decisions. Investors are anticipating whether the labor market data will support further rate cuts before the end of the year. Compounding the uncertainty is the looming threat of a government shutdown, as funding is set to expire on Tuesday. President Trump is scheduled to meet with congressional leaders, but the outcome of negotiations remains unclear, adding another layer of volatility for the markets. (not investment advice)</p>

He argued that such a move would wrongly target people who are legally living and working in the UK, causing deep societal divisions. While condemning the policy, Starmer distinguished between the policy itself and Reform UK's supporters, whom he believes are primarily frustrated with years of Conservative government failure. The comments were made as Labour faces pressure from Reform's rising poll numbers and questions about Starmer's own leadership.</p>

          <p>China's advanced Type 076 amphibious assault ship, the Sichuan, is reportedly preparing to begin sea trials. Recent social media images show that covers have been removed from its electromagnetic catapult system, a key feature that has led to the vessel being described as the world's first dedicated drone carrier. This new class of warship is expected to significantly enhance the PLA Navy's unmanned aerial vehicle capabilities. Such ships are considered crucial assets for potential military operations, particularly in scenarios involving Taiwan, by expanding the operational range and power of Chinese naval strike groups.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Latinos in the U.S. are installing personal air quality sensors to gather local data on pollution in their neighborhoods, which are disproportionately affected by toxic air. This community-led initiative, supported by groups like the Hispanic Access Foundation, aims to fill data gaps left by official government monitoring and advocate for regulatory action. From industrial hubs in Los Angeles to agricultural areas in Idaho, residents are tracking harmful pollutants like PM2.5, which are linked to asthma and other serious health issues. The effort comes as the Trump administration moves to roll back numerous environmental protection regulations.</p>

          <p>China is increasing its cultural and diplomatic influence in Africa by establishing Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) centers, with new facilities recently opening in Tunisia and Chad. These centers are part of a long-standing health diplomacy strategy where Beijing sends medical teams and promotes TCM to build goodwill on the continent. The new facility in Tunisia, located at a university hospital, is a result of recent health cooperation agreements between the two nations. This expansion of TCM across Africa is a key component of China's broader strategy to enhance its soft power through cultural and health-related exchanges.</p>

          <p>A court filing from legal watchdog groups alleges that children held at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center in Dilley, Texas, are enduring "prolonged" and inhumane conditions. Attorneys who monitored the facility reported shortages of clean drinking water, chronic sleep deprivation due to lights being left on all night, and inadequate medical care. The filing describes a "prison-like environment" where families are held for weeks or months, far exceeding the usual 20-day legal limit for detaining children. These allegations highlight severe concerns about the welfare of children in the privately-run CoreCivic facility.</p>

          <p>OpenAI's aggressive dealmaking, including multi-billion dollar infrastructure partnerships with Nvidia, Oracle, and CoreWeave, is drawing scrutiny from investors and analysts. While the company, now valued at $500 billion, argues that massive investment is necessary for AI innovation, some see parallels to the vendor financing patterns of the dot-com bubble. The web of deals is increasingly interconnected, with partners like Nvidia and CoreWeave also being investors in OpenAI, creating a self-referential ecosystem. This raises questions about the long-term sustainability of the AI boom if a key player must provide the capital that later becomes its own revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs is scheduled to be sentenced next week after being found guilty of two counts of transportation for engagement in prostitution. While he was acquitted of more serious sex-trafficking and racketeering charges, he still faces a maximum of 20 years in prison. The convictions relate to Combs orchestrating and paying for travel for sexual encounters between his girlfriends and male sex workers. Prosecutors are recommending a sentence of at least four to five years, while his defense team is arguing for a much shorter term of 14 months, which would result in his immediate release due to time already served.</p>
