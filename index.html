          <p>An international anti-discrimination body has questioned the England Lionesses' decision to stop taking the knee as an anti-racism gesture before matches. This comes after defender Jess Carter experienced racist abuse on social media, prompting calls for social media platforms to face stronger regulation under the UK's Online Safety Act. While some, like The Three Hijabis campaign, see the Lionesses' move as a powerful statement that the symbol is no longer effective, others argue it abandons a potent anti-racist act when it is most needed.</p>

The U.S. Air Force confirmed a B-52 was in the area for a state fair flyover and is investigating the incident. The Federal Aviation Administration is also gathering information on the near-miss.</p>

          <p>Alaska Airlines and its subsidiary Horizon Air experienced a system-wide ground stop for approximately three hours due to a significant IT outage. The airline attributed the failure to a critical piece of hardware in its data centers, which impacted key operational systems. The carrier stated the issue was not related to a cyberattack and that flight safety was never compromised. The outage resulted in over 150 flight cancellations, and the airline warned of residual impacts as it works to normalize operations.</p>

Instead, they recommend using the maturity date as an opportunity to reassess financial goals and consider alternatives like high-yield savings accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At least 85 Palestinians were killed in separate incidents while attempting to access humanitarian aid convoys across Gaza, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry. The deadliest event occurred in northern Gaza, where at least 67 people died near an aid distribution point; witnesses claimed Israeli forces fired into the crowd, while the IDF stated they fired warning shots at a threatening crowd. The violence comes as Israel issues new evacuation orders for parts of central Gaza, further complicating aid distribution for a population facing a catastrophic humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>According to a Reuters poll of economists, Brazil's economy is expected to maintain its growth trajectory despite the threat of significant U.S. tariffs. Analysts forecast GDP growth of 2.2% this year and 1.7% in 2026, supported by a strong domestic labor market. However, the poll also indicates an increased risk of worsening inflation if trade negotiations with the U.S. fail. Most economists believe the August 1 deadline for the threatened 50% tariff will be extended to allow for diplomatic talks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's ruling coalition, led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, has lost its majority in the upper house of parliament following significant gains by right-wing populist parties in a recent election. Dissatisfaction with declining real wages, inflation, and increased immigration fueled a surge for new parties like Sanseito, which ran on a "Japanese First" platform. Although the Prime Minister has vowed to remain in power, his government is now on shaky ground and could face a no-confidence vote, signaling growing political instability in the country.</p>

          <p>A new JPMorganChase Institute study reveals a growing trend of Americans shifting money from standard checking and savings accounts to vehicles that provide investment income, such as brokerage accounts and money market funds. This shift helps explain the surprising resilience of U.S. consumer spending despite high inflation and economic uncertainty. The analysis of 4.7 million households shows that while balances in traditional accounts are flat, total cash reserves are growing when these other accounts are included, indicating a strategic change in how people are managing their money.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that involving children in household chores is crucial for developing motor skills, responsibility, and confidence, but parents often hinder this process. By prioritizing speed and neatness, parents may take over tasks or micromanage, discouraging a child's natural desire to help and contribute to the family. Researchers suggest that chores serve as "social glue," integrating children and giving them a sense of purpose. The most effective approach is to make chores a collaborative activity and allow children to participate from a young age, even if their initial efforts are imperfect.</p>
