          <p>Tropical Storm Imelda is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane, moving away from the southeastern U.S. but approaching Bermuda by Wednesday. As the ninth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, it follows Hurricane Humberto and is expected to bring 1 to 4 inches of rain to parts of Florida and the Carolinas. Swells from both storms are causing life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the U.S. East Coast. A 60-year-old man in Santiago de Cuba has already died due to landslides linked to Imelda.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have agreed on a new 20-point peace plan for Gaza, urging Hamas to accept its terms. The proposal outlines an immediate cessation of military operations, the release of Israeli hostages for detained Gazans, and aims for a future Palestinian state while excluding Hamas from governance. While welcomed by some regional and international leaders, the article highlights significant obstacles to its implementation and potential for continued negotiations. Netanyahu has publicly accepted the principles despite internal coalition dissent.</p>

          <p>Thousands of British military personnel have initiated legal action against 3M, alleging that faulty combat earplugs supplied between 2003 and 2015 caused life-changing injuries like tinnitus and deafness. This follows a $6 billion settlement for 240,000 US servicemen and women in 2023 over similar claims. 3M maintains its product was effective if used correctly and is prepared to defend itself in English courts.

Between 2014 and 2017, Qian defrauded more than 128,000 victims in China, converting their stolen funds into bitcoin. She fled to the UK using false documents and attempted to launder the money through property. This conviction, following a seven-year international investigation, aims to return funds to victims, some of whom have already received compensation.</p>

          <p>The Miami Dolphins secured their first victory of the season, defeating the New York Jets 27-21, but the win was overshadowed by a feared season-ending knee injury to star receiver Tyreek Hill. Darren Waller, playing his first NFL game in nearly two years, contributed significantly with two touchdown catches. The Jets, under coach Aaron Glenn, remain winless after a performance marred by 13 penalties and three turnovers. Quarterback Tua Tagovailoa led the Dolphins effectively, while Justin Fields returned for the Jets, showing flashes but ultimately falling short.</p>

          <p>YouTube has agreed to a $24.5 million settlement with US President Donald Trump regarding the suspension of his account after the January 6, 2020 Capitol Hill riot. The settlement, which does not constitute an admission of liability, allocates $22 million to a White House construction project and $2.5 million to pro-Trump organizations. This makes the Google subsidiary the latest major tech firm to settle a lawsuit with Trump, who claimed wrongful censorship. Meta and X (formerly Twitter) previously settled similar lawsuits for $25 million and $10 million, respectively.</p>

Manufacturers have grappled with tepid demand, exacerbated by higher U.S. tariffs impacting exports.

          <p>Afghanistan is experiencing a nationwide internet blackout after the Taliban government cut fibre-optic internet connections, citing "immorality." This action follows weeks of internet disruptions in several provinces and has severely impacted mobile internet, satellite TV, and international communications, including for news agencies in Kabul. Business leaders had previously warned of serious economic consequences from such a ban. The Taliban's move, in line with their strict interpretation of Islamic Sharia law since seizing power, has been likened to North Korea's internet isolation, further isolating the country.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily suspended the Trump administration's plan to eliminate 532 jobs at the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), the parent agency of Voice of America (VOA). The judge cited "concerning disrespect" from the administration in response to earlier orders to restore VOA programming to its statutory mandate. President Trump had signed an executive order effectively shutting down the taxpayer-funded broadcaster, calling it "radical propaganda," leading to the suspension of broadcasts and employees being placed on administrative leave. The ruling aims to preserve VOA's ability to fulfill its mission.</p>

          <p>A BBC undercover investigation has revealed widespread unsafe and illegal Botox practices by nurses, pharmacists, and a bogus doctor across England. The investigation documented professionals supplying Botox without proper in-person consultations or prescriptions, coaching clients to falsify records, and selling unlicensed Korean toxin. These shortcuts carry significant health risks, including severe complications like respiratory failure or death, as highlighted by a recent botulism outbreak. Regulators expressed "very concerned" and promised enforcement action, while the Department of Health and Social Care is assessing reforms for the cosmetics industry.</p>

          <p>The Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) is set to open, aiming to significantly ease congestion at Mumbai's current overworked airport and become India's first fully digital hub. With two parallel runways and a capacity for 90 million passengers, NMIA is connected to the city by India's longest sea-bridge. However, it faces major challenges, including traffic woes and last-mile connectivity issues, which could hinder its ambition to compete with global hubs like Singapore and Dubai. Policy revisions and airline optimization are also needed to facilitate smoother transfers and international expansion.</p>

          <p>Oregon has sued the Trump administration over its plan to deploy 200 National Guard troops to Portland, authorized by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to protect federal property. State Attorney General Dan Rayfield argues President Trump lacks the authority to federalize the National Guard for this purpose, emphasizing that local officials can manage public safety. The White House defends the deployment as lawful, citing months of "violent riots" and threats to federal personnel. This lawsuit mirrors California's earlier action against similar federal interventions in sanctuary cities.</p>

Javice, 33, expressed remorse in court, but the judge emphasized the need for deterrence. In addition to prison, she was ordered to pay $22.36 million in forfeiture and $287 million in restitution to JPMorgan. She remains on bail pending appeal. (not investment advice)</p>
