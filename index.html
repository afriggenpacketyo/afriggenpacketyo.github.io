            <p>Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan are exploring investments in a massive natural gas project in Alaska to navigate trade demands from President Trump and avoid U.S. tariffs. The Alaska LNG project, long stalled, is now being touted by Trump as a national priority, potentially playing a crucial role in trade negotiations. Taiwan's CPC Corp. has already signed a letter of intent to purchase gas from the project, highlighting the geopolitical advantages it offers. The project aims to produce 20 million metric tons of LNG per year, significantly boosting U.S. energy exports. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>An Israeli military inquiry determined that an "operational misunderstanding" caused the deaths of 14 emergency workers in Gaza. The IDF claimed its troops believed they were facing a threat from enemy forces when they opened fire on a convoy of Palestinian Red Crescent Society ambulances and a UN vehicle. The report cited poor night visibility as a contributing factor, though video evidence later contradicted initial claims that the vehicles were operating without lights.

The order also suggests shifting diplomatic staff assignments to specific regions for their entire careers and reforming Fulbright scholarships to focus on national security-related disciplines.

            <p>Astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope have observed a planet seemingly sinking into its star, offering a unique glimpse into planetary demise. Contrary to initial assumptions of a red giant engulfment, the star was not bright enough, suggesting the planet plunged inward due to tidal forces. The impact ejected the star's outer layers, forming a cold dust ring, while closer to the star, a hot molecular gas ring resembled a planet-forming region. This discovery raises questions about the prevalence of this type of planetary engulfment compared to the red giant hypothesis.</p>

Rebalancing portfolios based on risk tolerance and timeline is recommended, with potential shifts towards a 60/40 investment portfolio.
