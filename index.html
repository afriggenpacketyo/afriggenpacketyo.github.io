          <p>New government data reveals that Japan's birth rate fell below 700,000 in 2024, marking a 5.7% decrease from the previous year and highlighting the ongoing issues of delayed marriages and childbirths. The total fertility rate also dropped to a record low of 1.15. Both figures have been declining for nine consecutive years, with the pace of decline outpacing government projections by 15 years. While marriages saw a slight increase, deaths reached a postwar high, resulting in a record natural population decrease. The National Institute of Population and Social Security Research had projected these low birth rates wouldn't occur until 2039.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an order doubling tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50%, a move intended to bolster the American steel industry. Critics argue that these protections could harm steel producers outside the U.S., provoke retaliatory measures from trade partners, and increase costs for American consumers. The UK has been granted an exemption from the increased duties, maintaining a 25% tariff due to ongoing trade discussions with the U.S.. Economists warn that the tariffs could lead to job losses in sectors that rely on these metals as intermediate inputs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk, a tech entrepreneur, has publicly criticized President Donald Trump's "Big Beautiful Bill," labeling it a "disgusting abomination" due to its impact on the national debt. Musk expressed his disapproval on X, formerly Twitter, stating that the bill would increase the budget deficit to $2.5 trillion and burden citizens with unsustainable debt. Surprisingly, Senator Bernie Sanders, a frequent critic of Trump, echoed Musk's sentiments, also calling the bill an "abomination" because of tax breaks for the wealthy and cuts to food aid. This bill aims to extend tax breaks while cutting social benefits.</p>

          <p>Police have launched an investigation into patient deaths following heart operations at Castle Hill Hospital, an NHS facility, amid concerns of avoidable harm and inaccurate death certificates. Documents reveal that patients undergoing TAVI procedures experienced complications, with the department's mortality rate significantly higher than the national average. Staff concerns led to multiple reviews, none of which were made public to the affected families. The investigation was triggered by concerns raised about the safety and transparency of the TAVI service and the accuracy of death certificates failing to reflect the role of the procedure in patient deaths.</p>

          <p>Ukraine conducted a successful drone attack on military airfields and critical assets deep inside Russia, marking a significant shift in modern warfare. The mission, Operation Spiderâ€™s Web, involved smuggling over 100 explosive-laden quadcopter drones across the border, evading air defenses, and damaging or destroying numerous high-value aircraft. This operation highlights the increasing threat posed by inexpensive, readily available drones that can inflict substantial damage against well-equipped adversaries. The success of this operation could inspire similar asymmetric attacks, posing a challenge to military bases and infrastructure worldwide.</p>

Players claim that Knight and head athletic trainer Tim Garl instructed them to continue seeing Bomba, even after complaints were raised.

          <p>Denmark's decision to ban the question of Palestine from the national school elections has sparked controversy and criticism. The government parties argue that the issue is too explosive for classroom deliberations, risking discomfort for minority groups. Critics argue that this decision contradicts Denmark's tradition of prioritizing free speech and controversial deliberation. The real reason behind the ban appears to be the government's desire to avoid questions about the war in Gaza, Danish arms exports, and the tension between Denmark's alliances with the US and Israel.</p>

          <p>Karen Read's defense team's decision to not call her to the witness stand in her second murder trial is a strategic gamble. The prosecution played damaging interview clips, allowing the jury to hear Read's version of events. Legal experts suggest the choice to keep a defendant from speaking may not always be the best strategy. The defense likely seeks to avoid Read being cross-examined about her statements, potentially opening the door for days of tense questioning from the state.</p>
