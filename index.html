          <p>The Conservative Party has unveiled a five-year plan to remove 750,000 illegal immigrants from the UK if they win the next election. The proposal includes banning asylum claims for those who enter without permission and replacing the Immigration Tribunal with a Home Office appeals process. This move, which includes leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, is seen as an effort to counter the Reform UK party and establish a clear policy distinction from the Labour government.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed hope for a hostage release in the coming days after Hamas partially agreed to a peace plan outlined by former U.S. President Trump. The proposal includes the release of all hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, though Israel has indicated it will not fully withdraw from Gaza. U.S. officials view Hamas's response as a positive step, with negotiations on technical details, such as weapons decommissioning, set to begin in Egypt.</p>

The demonstration in Trafalgar Square proceeded despite calls from ministers to postpone it following a recent deadly synagogue attack in Manchester.

The executions are part of a broader surge in capital punishment following the Iran-Israel war in June.

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has stated that only "law-abiding Americans" should attend the upcoming Super Bowl, warning that ICE agents "will be all over that place." In an interview, Noem also criticized the NFL's choice of Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny as the halftime performer, due to his past criticism of the Trump administration's immigration policies. The White House press secretary later clarified that there was no tangible plan for a large-scale ICE presence at the event.</p>

          <p>Marcus Fakana, a 19-year-old British teenager who was recently pardoned and released from a Dubai prison, has died in a car crash in north London. Fakana was a passenger in a vehicle that crashed following a brief 60-second police chase. He had been sentenced to a year in a Dubai prison for a consensual relationship with a 17-year-old girl but received a royal pardon in July, making his death just three months after regaining his freedom particularly tragic.</p>
