          <p>General Motors announced plans to integrate new software and technology into its vehicles by 2028, including a conversational AI assistant powered by Google's Gemini and an advanced driver-assistance system permitting hands-free, "eyes-off" operation in certain conditions. The company aims to transform its cars into intelligent assistants as part of a broader "GM Forward" software initiative to usher in a new era of mobility. These announcements follow a strong third-quarter earnings report and are seen as a renewed push into software-driven revenue streams after previous initiatives were curtailed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting interest rates, credit card borrowers are faced with a complex financial landscape. While rate cuts may seem beneficial, their impact on high-interest credit card debt is often minimal and slow to materialize, as card rates are also influenced by the prime rate. The article suggests that waiting for these incremental changes may be less effective than proactively exploring debt relief options like forgiveness or consolidation programs, which can offer more immediate and substantial relief from compounding interest.

          <p>Alphabet, Google's parent company, is contributing $22 million towards the construction of a new White House ballroom as part of a legal settlement with Donald Trump. The settlement resolves a lawsuit over Trump's ban from YouTube following the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot. This contribution accounts for nearly 10% of the project's estimated $250 million cost, which Trump has insisted will be privately funded by donors and "Great American Companies" rather than taxpayers. The project has drawn public criticism following the demolition of parts of the White House East Wing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that Andrew Cuomo's independent bid for New York City mayor hinges on his ability to win over Republican voters. After losing the Democratic primary to a far-left candidate, Cuomo's path to victory requires him to move beyond simply not being a communist and make substantive promises to conservatives. The author suggests Cuomo should offer Republicans a significant role in his administration, pledge to cooperate with federal law enforcement like ICE, and commit to working with President Trump's administration. Without these overtures, he risks looking too similar to his progressive opponent to attract necessary conservative support.</p>

          <p>Oregon Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley delivered an overnight marathon speech on the Senate floor, lasting over 20 hours, to protest the policies of the Trump administration. He described the moment as the "biggest threat to our republic since the Civil War," criticizing the administration's deportation efforts, use of the Justice Department, and plans to deploy the National Guard in American cities. The speech, one of the longest in recent Senate history, was intended to "ring the alarm bells" about what Merkley views as an erosion of the Constitution. The protest occurred amid an ongoing government shutdown, drawing both praise from Democrats and criticism from Republicans.</p>

The NHL views the partnership as an opportunity to engage a new and broader audience beyond traditional sports fans. However, the move has drawn criticism from the American Gaming Association, which raises concerns about unregulated gambling and the platforms' accessibility to individuals under 21.</p>

          <p>A CBS News poll indicates that support for California's Proposition 50, a state redistricting measure, is strongly linked to national politics, particularly opposition to President Trump. Voters in favor of the proposition overwhelmingly cite their desire to oppose the Trump administration, which they feel treats California unfairly, as a key reason for their vote. Conversely, those who view the measure as a purely state-level issue tend to oppose it, fearing a shift of power to urban areas. This national sentiment in the heavily Democratic state is currently giving the "yes" campaign a majority lead.</p>

          <p>Following the high-profile theft of French crown jewels from the Louvre, a master jeweler suggests the culprits will struggle to profit from their crime. The stolen pieces, valued at approximately $102 million intact, would lose about 90% of their value if dismantled to sell the individual stones and metal on the black market. The global jewelry network is small and well-informed, and dealers worldwide are on alert, making the intact pieces nearly impossible to sell.

          <p>For married retirees considering a reverse mortgage to supplement their income, the process involves specific rules that differ from those for single borrowers. When a couple applies for a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), both spouses are typically listed as co-borrowers, and both must meet the age requirement of 62. The loan amount is calculated based on the age of the younger spouse, which can result in access to less equity than if based on the older spouse's age. This financial tool can help eliminate existing mortgage payments and create a safety net, but couples must carefully consider the long-term implications.</p>

Farmers are facing a halt in crucial aid, small-business lending in rural areas has been decimated, and a majority of furloughed federal workers live outside the Washington D.C. area.

          <p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has affirmed that Bad Bunny will remain the headline performer for the Super Bowl halftime show, despite criticism from Donald Trump and his supporters. Goodell stated that the decision was "carefully thought through" and that backlash is common when selecting an artist for such a massive platform. Bad Bunny, a vocal opponent of Trump, was chosen for his immense global popularity, and the league is confident he will deliver an "exciting and a united moment." Trump had previously criticized the choice, stating he had never heard of the Puerto Rican artist and calling the decision "ridiculous."</p>

          <p>A social media trend known as "Group 7" has gone viral on TikTok, created by singer-songwriter Sophia James as a "science experiment" to promote her new single. James posted a series of seven videos to see which one the platform's algorithm would show to the most users, labeling them as different "groups." The seventh video, in which she welcomes viewers to "Group 7," exploded in popularity, attracting millions of likes and engagement from celebrities and brands. Digital media experts explain her success came from turning the post into a participatory game, effectively leveraging the algorithm's preference for user engagement.</p>

          <p>Sir Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrats, has called for Prince Andrew to be questioned by a parliamentary committee regarding the terms of his lease on Royal Lodge in Windsor. The request follows revelations that the Prince's deal with the Crown Estate allowed him to make large upfront payments for renovations in lieu of ongoing rent on the 75-year lease. Critics, including a former committee chair, have called the arrangement a "rotten deal" for taxpayers and demanded greater transparency in royal finances. While a committee could invite the prince, an appearance by a royal in such a setting would be unprecedented.</p>

          <p>The director of the Louvre, Laurence des Cars, has publicly admitted that security failures, including "aging" and poorly positioned CCTV cameras, allowed thieves to steal €88 million worth of French crown jewels. Speaking to French senators, she revealed that the only camera monitoring the exterior wall where the gang broke in was pointing in the wrong direction. Des Cars stated, "We failed these jewels," and conceded that the museum did not spot the thieves' arrival early enough due to known weaknesses in its perimeter protection. She has tendered her resignation, which was refused, and is now pushing for a major security overhaul.</p>

The report highlights specific cases from facilities in Louisiana and Georgia where women were allegedly denied timely medical attention and subjected to procedures without consent.

          <p>The North Carolina legislature has passed a new congressional map designed to strengthen the Republican party's hold on the state's U.S. House seats. The redrawn map specifically targets the district of Democratic Rep. Don Davis, a major battleground seat, by shifting its boundaries to make it more favorable to a conservative candidate. This move is part of a broader national strategy by Republicans in states like Texas and Missouri to use redistricting to bolster their narrow majority in the House. Since the North Carolina governor's veto power does not extend to standalone maps, the new districts are expected to be implemented.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes how Russia is emulating and repurposing "soft power" strategies once used by the U.S. to promote democracy, but is now using them to advance its own authoritarian and imperialist goals. The Kremlin has established foundations and grant programs, similar in structure to former U.S. agencies like USAID, to fund cultural events and youth programs that promote a nationalistic, pro-Russian worldview. These tactics are being deployed in occupied Ukrainian territories to erase local identity and are used globally to sanitize Russia's image. The author argues that as the U.S. retreats from its global role, Moscow is exploiting the vacuum.</p>

The situation is complicated by the fact that key DOJ leadership positions are held by his former defense lawyers. Trump has suggested he might use any funds received for pet projects.</p>

          <p>A large-scale study published in The Lancet has found that different antidepressants cause a wide range of physiological side effects, with clinically significant variations in their impact on weight, heart rate, and cholesterol. Researchers analyzed data from over 58,000 participants and found some drugs were associated with weight gain, while others were linked to weight loss. Similarly, some medications increased heart rate while others decreased it. The study's authors emphasize that these findings should not discourage use of the effective medications, but rather encourage doctors to better tailor treatments to individual patient health profiles and preferences.</p>

The decision has been met with mixed reactions; while some welcome the additional consultation, others called it "massively disappointing," warning that the current system is in crisis and financially unsustainable. The delay means comprehensive changes to the system, which has been described as "broken," will not be implemented until 2026.</p>

Ellis, a 28-year-old nightclub hostess, was hanged for shooting her lover, David Blakely, whom her family's lawyers now describe as an "abusive, violent partner." The application argues that the long-standing abuse Ellis suffered would likely lead to a manslaughter charge today, under a modern understanding of domestic violence and battered woman syndrome.
