          <p>Dame Esther Rantzen has urged the House of Lords to support the Terminally Ill Adults Bill, which would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to an assisted death. The bill has already passed in the House of Commons, but faces opposition in the Lords, with critics raising concerns about potential coercion of vulnerable individuals. Rantzen, who joined Dignitas after being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, argues that the bill includes rigorous safeguards to protect against abuse and ensures that only those with six months or less to live and who are mentally competent can access assisted dying. The bill requires two declarations, assessments by independent doctors, and approval from a multi-disciplinary panel, but its future remains uncertain as it moves to the House of Lords.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kris Jenner's recent appearance has sparked speculation about potential plastic surgery, with experts suggesting she may have undergone a deep plane facelift. Dr. Patrick Davis notes that Jenner's appearance is "youthful and natural," indicative of a well-performed procedure that likely involved lifting the structural elements of her face. Dr. Jonathan Kaplan agrees, adding that a deep plane facelift can provide an "incredible result" by resetting a greater proportion of facial tissues, but carries risks such as nerve damage. Recovery from such a procedure can take several months, with experts emphasizing the importance of choosing a qualified surgeon and discussing medical history and aesthetic goals before undergoing surgery.</p>

          <p>The People's Liberation Army (PLA) has been conducting maneuvers around Taiwan with increasing frequency and intensity in recent years. These operations, which have evolved from occasional sorties to well-coordinated campaigns, serve both as combat training and strategic signalling. The PLA's activities can be categorized into near-daily aerial patrols, combat-readiness patrols, and large-scale joint forces exercises, each varying in scale, intensity, and purpose. Near-daily patrols have increased sharply since 2024, particularly after William Lai Ching-te assumed office as Taiwanese leader, indicating a form of constant pressure and monitoring.</p>

          <p>Reporters for Voice of America and other U.S.-funded networks are expressing concerns about their safety and job security following mass layoffs and political pressure. The Trump administration's actions, including significant job cuts at the U.S. Agency for Global Media, have raised doubts about the government's commitment to protecting non-American journalists working for these networks, especially those who have risked their lives to cover sensitive issues in their home countries. The sentencing of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reporter Farid Mehralizada in Azerbaijan on charges deemed false by the network highlights the dangers faced by these journalists. With their visas expiring, many VOA journalists are now seeking asylum or other jobs in the U.S., fearing imprisonment or worse if they return home.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's real estate sector is facing a deepening downturn, compounded by a shrinking population. Goldman Sachs estimates that demand for new homes in Chinese urban cities will remain suppressed, potentially reaching only a fourth of the 2017 peak. The country's population decline is expected to reduce home demand by 0.5 million units annually in the 2020s and 1.4 million units in the 2030s, in contrast to the positive contribution of 1.5 million units in the 2010s. Despite Beijing's efforts to incentivize child-bearing, stagnant incomes, job instability, and a weak social security system continue to dissuade young people from having more children, limiting the effectiveness of pronatalist policies.

          <p>Japan has been proactive in building supply chain resilience, particularly in response to China's dominance in rare earth minerals. After experiencing a rare earth export ban from China in 2010, Japan has diversified its supply sources by investing in non-China projects like Australia's Lynas. This has reduced Japan's reliance on Chinese rare earths to below 60% from over 90% previously. The country is reportedly planning to further decrease its dependence on Chinese rare earth imports to below 50% this year, with a focus on stockpiling, recycling, and promoting alternative technologies.

          <p>An article examines the current trend of online criticism directed towards female celebrities, questioning whether it constitutes genuine feminist critique or merely judgmental remarks. Recent instances of celebrities like Sabrina Carpenter, Sydney Sweeney, and Addison Rae facing backlash for their choices raise concerns about the direction of online discourse. The author argues that meaningful critique should involve a nuanced understanding of history, economics, and the complexities of female sexuality, rather than resorting to puritanical chastisement. By drawing on the history of the "sex wars" and the work of feminist thinkers like Angela Carter, the article calls for a more thoughtful and informed approach to discussing women in popular culture.</p>

          <p>A heatwave is intensifying across the UK, with temperatures expected to reach up to 34C, accompanied by a yellow thunderstorm warning issued by the Met Office for parts of northern England, the Midlands, and Wales. The heat and humidity are expected to fuel torrential downpours, potentially leading to localized flash flooding, large hail, and lightning. An amber heat-health alert is also in effect, warning of significant pressures on health and social care services, including a rise in deaths among vulnerable populations. Firefighters are responding to a surge in wildfires, and the public is urged to be cautious.</p>

          <p>Towns and cities in eastern German states are offering free stays to attract new residents and combat depopulation. The "trial living" scheme allows people to stay for up to four weeks free of charge, with the aim of encouraging long-term relocation. Guben, for example, has seen some success with this initiative, attracting new residents who appreciate the affordable accommodation, lack of traffic, and sense of community. These efforts are part of a broader strategy to address demographic challenges and revitalize communities in the former East Germany.</p>

          <p>Protests broke out in southeast Los Angeles County after federal agents conducted an immigration raid at a car wash in Bell, detaining at least three people. The action led to confrontations between protesters and masked agents, with reports of property damage and arrests. Local officials, including Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, have questioned the tactics used by the agents, who were described as being masked and driving unmarked vehicles. The Department of Homeland Security stated that its vehicles were violently targeted during lawful operations, but protesters claim that the agents incited violence.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist and Columbia University graduate student, has been released after spending 104 days in immigration detention in the US. A judge ruled that Khalil, a legal US resident, should be released, making him a symbol of the Trump administration's crackdown on pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses. Despite his release, the administration is seeking to deport Khalil over his role in the protests, which they consider antisemitic. Civil rights groups argue that the administration is conflating antisemitism with criticism of Israel to silence dissent.</p>

          <p>The head of Chinaâ€™s United Front Work Department has cautioned religious groups to guard against "hidden dangers" and resist foreign infiltration. This warning was delivered during visits to various religious organizations, emphasizing the need to promote the "Sinicisation of religion." The call follows similar warnings from senior figures, including President Xi Jinping, highlighting the government's ongoing efforts to control and manage religious practices within China. The timing of these warnings comes shortly before the Dalai Lama's 90th birthday, adding a layer of sensitivity to the matter.</p>

          <p>The Daily Star is reporting that Pope Leo XIV believes that Artificial Intelligence is "doing [the] devil's work" and that it could be bad for kids. However, it is important to note that this is a different article than the articles covering the assisted dying bill, so the Daily Star article is not just about the assisted dying bill. This is an important distinction because the Daily Star article also covers Pope Leo XIV's views on Artificial Intelligence, which is a separate topic. The coverage of the assisted dying bill has sparked joy among supporters, but the Times warns that the bill faces an "uphill battle" to become law, in the face of opposition from the House of Lords.</p>

Despite the disruption and civilian casualties, a significant majority of Israelis support the decision to attack Iran, viewing it as a necessary measure against a long-standing threat. The author suggests that Netanyahu sees the conflict as an opportunity to rewrite his legacy and consolidate his power, even as critics question the motivations and potential consequences of the war. The long-term implications of the conflict remain uncertain, but it has brought a moment of unity and relief for Netanyahu.</p>
