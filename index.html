          <p>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong argues that stablecoin legislation should permit interest payments to users, aligning with the higher yields available in Treasuries.  He believes this would be fairer to consumers who currently earn minimal interest in savings accounts.  Armstrong's stance contrasts with proposed legislation in both the House and Senate, which currently prohibit such interest payments. This highlights the ongoing debate surrounding stablecoin regulation and its impact on consumer benefits.</p>
