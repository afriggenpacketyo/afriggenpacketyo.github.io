Although Nawrocki ran as an independent, he was supported by the Law and Justice (PiS) party, which aligns with outgoing President Andrzej Duda.

          <p>Erin Patterson, accused of murdering three relatives of her ex-husband with poisonous mushrooms, testified in an Australian court about her marital issues. Patterson is charged with killing her former parents-in-law and their sister, and attempting to murder the sister's husband, after they consumed a meal at her home in July 2023. She revealed personal battles with low self-esteem and a growing distance from her estranged husband's family.

          <p>Britain's defence review outlines ambitious goals for transforming the armed forces and preparing for potential war, but hinges on increased funding. While the review welcomes the government's aim to spend 3% of GDP on defence by 2034, it suggests that faster progress may be necessary given current global turbulence. The report emphasizes the need for a revolution in military approaches to address rising threats from Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea. Even achieving the government's submarine target would require defence spending to reach at least 3% of GDP.</p>
