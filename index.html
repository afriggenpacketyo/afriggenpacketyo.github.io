          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first major Atlantic hurricane of the 2025 season, is projected to move up the U.S. East Coast without making landfall. Despite remaining offshore, the powerful Category 3 storm is expected to generate life-threatening surf and dangerous rip currents along the entire Eastern Seaboard for much of the week. Officials have issued tropical storm warnings for the Bahamas and watches for North Carolina's Outer Banks, where mandatory evacuations are in effect due to the risk of coastal flooding.</p>

The game was a disappointment for Dodgers fans, though Shohei Ohtani performed well with two singles.

While no concrete agreements were finalized, Zelensky mentioned a possible $90 billion U.S. arms deal and appeared upbeat, successfully avoiding confrontation and buying more time for Ukraine's diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has handed the Trump administration a partial victory by dismissing part of a lawsuit concerning the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" immigrant detention center in Florida. The judge ruled that the claim regarding a lack of clarity on court jurisdiction was moot after the government designated a specific court for the detainees' cases. However, claims alleging violations of the First Amendment due to restricted and non-confidential access to lawyers were not dismissed and will proceed in a different federal court.</p>

          <p>Four masked robbers executed a brazen daylight heist at a Seattle jewelry store, stealing an estimated $2 million in valuables in just 90 seconds. The thieves used a hammer to smash the door and threatened staff with bear spray and a stun gun before escaping. A police source reported that Seattle Police Chief Shon Barnes was having lunch at a nearby business during the robbery, though a department spokesperson confirmed he and his plainclothes security detail were unaware of the crime as it unfolded.

          <p>President Trump stated his intention to end mail-in voting before the 2026 midterm elections, claiming the practice is corrupt and susceptible to fraud. He announced that an executive order is currently being drafted to enact this ban, although constitutional experts note that Article I, Section 4 grants states, not the president, the authority to regulate elections. The White House asserted that the move aims to restore integrity to elections, despite officials and experts having previously affirmed the security of mail-in voting systems.</p>

          <p>Investigation documents recently released by Idaho State Police show that Bryan Kohberger exhibited alarming behavior while he was a doctoral student at Washington State University. Fellow students and faculty members described him as creepy and sexist, with one professor expressing fears that he might stalk or sexually abuse students in the future. The documents detail multiple complaints about his conduct, including an instance where he allegedly blocked female students in an office, leading the university to hold mandatory behavioral training for graduate students.</p>

          <p>State Rep. Nicole Collier, a Democrat from Fort Worth, has confined herself to the Texas Capitol after refusing to sign a document authorizing a mandatory escort by the Department of Public Safety.

Collier stated she is challenging the decision as a matter of principle, asserting her right to resist what she and the Democratic Caucus call a tactic to monitor and control lawmakers.</p>

          <p>A new report from S&P indicates that China's exports to the Global South have doubled since 2015, with a significant acceleration following the U.S.-China trade war. Over the last five years, these exports grew by 65%, far outpacing the growth of exports to the U.S. and Western Europe. Analysts suggest that ongoing trade uncertainties and China's domestic slowdown are motivating Chinese firms to increasingly focus on developing nations, potentially shifting the center of global commerce toward South-South trade.

          <p>Despite being the second-largest global supplier of sailors, India has the highest number of seafarers abandoned on vessels by shipowners. In 2024, Indian nationals accounted for 899 of the 3,133 abandoned sailors worldwide, often left without pay, provisions, or a way home. The issue is largely attributed to the practice of registering ships under "flags of convenience" in countries with weak regulations, which obscures ownership and allows unscrupulous owners to evade responsibility, trapping crews in difficult and often dangerous situations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's stringent anti-immigration policies and campaigns urging self-deportation are reportedly causing some U.S. citizens, particularly those with immigrant parents, to consider leaving the country. Citing fears over their long-term safety and quality of life, some are seeking dual citizenship and exploring options to live abroad. This trend is not limited to the Latino community, as a record number of Americans have also recently applied for British and Canadian citizenship, often citing political divisions in the U.S. as a primary motivator.</p>

          <p>Alibaba's AI coding model, Qwen 3 Coder, has rapidly gained popularity in the competitive AI-assisted coding market since its release in July. According to data from the AI marketplace OpenRouter, the model's usage share has surpassed 20%, second only to Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4. The Qwen team attributes the model's high performance to expanded, high-quality training data and large-scale reinforcement learning. This comes as numerous Chinese tech firms, including ByteDance and Tencent, are also releasing their own AI coding tools.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 20 states and the District of Columbia has filed a lawsuit against the Justice Department over a new rule tying billions of dollars in crime victim grants to immigration enforcement. The rule denies funding to programs that do not cooperate with federal immigration agents, a move the lawsuit argues is an illegal attempt to coerce states into enforcing federal policy. The states contend they face an untenable choice: forfeit critical resources for vulnerable victims or accept unlawful conditions that erode trust between law enforcement and immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>The opening of Camp East Montana, a new large-scale migrant detention center at Fort Bliss, Texas, was met with protests from immigration advocates over the weekend. The facility, which can eventually hold up to 5,000 migrants, is part of the Trump administration's effort to expand detention capacity for mass deportations. Critics, including Rep. Veronica Escobar, are demanding better access for legal counsel and have questioned the high cost of the facility, arguing the funds could be better used for community services in El Paso.</p>

          <p>MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred has indicated that future league expansion could provide an opportunity to geographically realign teams, potentially doing away with the traditional American and National Leagues in favor of Eastern and Western Conferences. He argued that such a move would reduce travel wear on players and create more appealing postseason broadcast schedules, particularly for West Coast audiences. While the idea may face resistance from traditionalists, Manfred believes it is a logical step to take when the league expands beyond its current 30 teams.</p>

By analyzing the layers of sediment, which act like a historical record, scientists can learn about past marine life and the impact of human activities, such as industrial whaling. This research, part of the Convex Seascape Survey, uses environmental DNA analysis to measure how the whale population's decline affected the ocean's ability to absorb and store carbon from the atmosphere.</p>

          <p>Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear has issued an emergency regulation to ban the sale of bromazolam, a potent synthetic drug often called "designer Xanax." The action makes the substance a Schedule 1 controlled substance in the state, empowering law enforcement to make arrests for its possession or sale. This move follows a request from Kentucky's attorney general, who is also leading a coalition of 21 attorneys general urging the federal DEA to enact a nationwide ban on the unregulated drug, which was linked to nearly 50 overdose deaths in Kentucky last year.</p>
