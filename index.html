          <p>Sony Group shares experienced a rise of over 3.5% amidst volatile trading following the announcement of a share buyback of up to 250 billion yen ($1.7 billion). The company's operating income for the last three months of the financial year surpassed analyst estimates, coming in at 203.6 billion yen, though it marked an 11% decrease from the previous year. Sony also detailed a partial spinoff of its financial unit, planning to distribute over 80% of the shares to shareholders through dividends, with the financial unit set to list this year. However, the company's outlook for the current financial year ending in March 2026 was described as lackluster. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Pennsylvania has approved the use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan citizens identified as members of the Tren de Aragua gang, marking a significant legal precedent. The ruling, however, stipulates that those facing deportation must receive at least 21 days' notice in both English and Spanish and be given the opportunity to voice any objections. This decision comes amid multiple lawsuits challenging the Trump administration's use of the AEA to expedite deportations, with other judges raising concerns about due process violations. The case underscores the ongoing debate over immigration enforcement and the rights of immigrants facing deportation.</p>

          <p>Burberry announced organizational changes that could lead to a reduction of approximately 1,700 roles globally by 2027, as the company continues its turnaround efforts amidst a luxury market slump.

Burberry had previously identified the U.S. as a strong area in third-quarter sales but cited increased macroeconomic uncertainty due to geopolitical developments.

          <p>President Trump's administration is attempting to halt funding already approved for green energy projects and threatening to repeal parts of the Inflation Reduction Act.

Despite incentives from the IRA, the administration's actions are injecting uncertainty into the future of clean technology in the United States.

          <p>BBC Director General Tim Davie vowed to tackle Britain's 'crisis of trust' by expanding fact-checking services, countering disinformation, and enhancing local journalism. Davie argued that the BBC can play a key role in making the UK a global leader in trusted information, support democracy, boost education and economic growth, and improve digital access. Proposed measures include using artificial intelligence in its Bitesize educational service and calling for a national plan to switch off traditional broadcast transmissions in the 2030s for internet-only delivery of programs. The BBC is considering launching its own streaming media device with simplified user interface to help those yet to benefit from IP services.</p>

The decision grants the company a $400 million cash infusion to alleviate financial strain caused by the Los Angeles-area wildfires.

          <p>U.S. retail egg prices experienced a decline in April, falling from record-high levels earlier this year, according to government data. The average price for a dozen Grade A eggs decreased to $5.12 after hitting a record $6.23 in March, marking the first month-to-month drop since October 2024. Despite the decrease, egg prices remain significantly higher than the previous year due to a persistent outbreak of bird flu that has decimated egg-laying hen populations. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is investing $1 billion to help farmers improve biosecurity measures to combat bird flu.</p>

          <p>U.S. energy officials are reassessing the risk posed by Chinese-made power inverters after unexplained communication equipment was found inside some of them. These undocumented devices, including cellular radios, could allow firewalls to be circumvented remotely, potentially destabilizing power grids and triggering widespread blackouts. The U.S. Department of Energy is working to address gaps in disclosures through inventories of all software components and other contractual requirements. Some utilities are attempting to minimize the use of Chinese inverters by sourcing equipment from elsewhere.</p>

          <p>Concerns have been raised about safety at HMP Five Wells, a UK prison now housing a high number of sex offenders. Reports indicate a rise in violence, self-harm, and drug use since the integration of these prisoners with the general inmate population. Some inmates and their families report feeling unsafe and claim that attacks on sex offenders are commonplace. G4S, the company running the prison, says incidents in videos were dealt with appropriately, however the article raises questions about the prison's ability to rehabilitate prisoners in this environment.</p>

The change in attitudes is attributed to the ongoing war, the polarising presidential election campaign, and the spread of misinformation. While many Poles still support Ukraine, some have expressed resentment and hostility towards refugees. Research suggests that Poland's public opinion of Ukrainians is worsening, with fewer Poles in favor of accepting Ukrainian refugees.</p>
