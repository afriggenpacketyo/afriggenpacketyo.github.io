          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has issued a nationwide injunction, blocking a recent executive order from President Trump that aimed to terminate birthright citizenship for children born in the United States to non-citizen parents. The ruling prevents the policy from being implemented anywhere in the country while legal challenges proceed. This decision marks a significant judicial check on the administration's immigration policies, centering on the interpretation of the 14th Amendment, which has historically been understood to grant citizenship to nearly all individuals born on U.S. soil.</p>

          <p>Astronomers have identified a new interstellar object, named 3I/Atlas, which they believe could be the oldest comet ever observed, potentially predating our solar system by three billion years. Preliminary findings from University of Oxford scientists suggest it originated from the Milky Way's "thick disk," a region of ancient stars. Composed largely of water ice, the object is expected to develop a glowing tail as it approaches the Sun later this year, making it visible with amateur telescopes. This discovery marks the third known interstellar visitor, offering a rare glimpse into a distant part of our galaxy.</p>

          <p>Mel Owens, the new lead for "The Golden Bachelor," has generated controversy after stating his intention to only consider contestants between the ages of 45 and 60, despite the show's premise focusing on older adults finding love. His ex-wife has also issued a cautionary statement to potential participants. The comments, which included a preference for "fit" women without "artificial hips," have sparked a debate online about ageism and dating preferences for the senior-focused reality show. Despite the backlash, producers have confirmed that Owens will remain the star of the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>In response to growing concerns that billions of dollars from opioid settlements are being misused, two advocacy organizations have launched a crowdsourced database for the public to report potential waste and fraud. The initiative allows individuals to submit examples of questionable spending by state and local governments, which are then reviewed and published. This effort aims to increase transparency and pressure state attorneys general to ensure the funds, intended to combat the addiction crisis, are not diverted to fill unrelated budget gaps or for non-approved purposes.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has invested $400 million to become the largest shareholder in American miner MP Materials, a significant move in the U.S. effort to reduce its reliance on China for rare earth elements. These materials are critical for defense, technology, and green energy applications. However, an industry executive warns that achieving supply chain independence faces major hurdles, including a lack of midstream processing technology and environmental challenges associated with mining. The goal is to build a domestic capacity that could meet a substantial portion of U.S. strategic needs by the late 2020s.</p>

          <p>A recent tax bill signed by President Trump has been promoted as eliminating federal income taxes on Social Security, but experts clarify the mechanism is more complex. The law introduces a new $6,000 deduction for seniors, which will reduce or eliminate the overall tax liability for many, thereby indirectly making their benefits untaxed. However, critics note the change primarily benefits middle-income seniors, while lower-income recipients who already pay no tax see no change. The legislation is also projected to accelerate the insolvency of Social Security's trust funds. (not investment advice)</p>

Experts agree that sirens can be effective for alerting people outdoors, especially in rural and tourist areas, but caution they are only one part of a comprehensive warning system that must include public education.

          <p>The UK and France have signed a new migrant returns agreement, which will operate initially as a pilot program. Under the "one in, one out" scheme, for every migrant the UK returns to France, it will accept one who has made a legal asylum claim there. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the deal is designed to be "robust" against legal challenges and will be accompanied by a crackdown on illegal work. The opposition has criticized the plan as a "gimmick," arguing it will not be as effective as the previous government's now-axed Rwanda deportation policy.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis explores the paradox of global sports achieving their long-held goal of breaking into the American market just as the U.S. adopts a more isolationist political stance. With major events like the FIFA World Cup and the Olympics scheduled in the U.S., sports organizations now face a host nation whose policies, such as travel bans and tariffs, can conflict with the globalist spirit of their competitions. This article argues that the commercial triumph of attracting these events is tempered by the challenge of navigating a political climate that is often at odds with international cooperation and engagement.</p>

          <p>A high-ranking Chinese military official has accused the Philippines of escalating tensions in the South China Sea, warning that Beijing expects further provocations from Manila. The official claimed the Philippines is attempting to occupy new maritime features and expand disputes over contested areas like the Second Thomas Shoal and Scarborough Shoal. Beijing also criticized Manila for allowing the deployment of a U.S. mid-range missile system, viewing it as a move that disrupts regional peace and targets China. These statements signal a hardening stance amid a series of recent maritime confrontations between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Tesla is experiencing a significant sales boom in Norway, with a 54% year-on-year increase in June, standing in stark contrast to declining sales across much of Europe. This success is largely driven by the popularity of the revamped Model Y, which meets Norwegian demand for space and all-wheel drive at a competitive price. The trend persists despite a backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political activities, which a survey found would deter 43% of Norwegian EV drivers. Norway's robust EV market, supported by strong government incentives, has created a unique environment where the brand's appeal currently outweighs political concerns for many buyers.</p>

The assailants stopped two passenger buses, checked passengers' identification, and abducted ten individuals with addresses in the Punjab province. The bodies of nine of the victims were later found with bullet wounds. No group has claimed responsibility, but officials have blamed the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), an insurgent group known for attacking state targets and people from Punjab.

          <p>Novak Djokovic has raised concerns about his fitness ahead of his Wimbledon semi-final against Jannik Sinner by canceling a scheduled practice session on Thursday. The 38-year-old had an awkward fall during his quarter-final match, and his opponent, Sinner, is also nursing an elbow injury from a previous round. While Sinner has stated he will be 100% fit, Djokovic has been less definitive about his condition. Given his age and recent injury history, the cancellation has cast some doubt on whether the 24-time Grand Slam champion will be at full strength for the highly anticipated match.</p>
