          <p>Switzerland's foreign minister, Ignazio Cassis, during a visit to China, advocated for a global coalition to address the economic uncertainty caused by US President Donald Trump's tariffs.  He highlighted the impact of these tariffs on Switzerland's open economy and emphasized the need for international cooperation to mitigate the negative effects of a trade war. Cassis stressed that China is a crucial partner but also acknowledged the importance of the EU and the US as trading partners.  The call for a coalition reflects a growing concern among nations about the destabilizing effects of unilateral trade actions.</p>

          <p>The author, having extensive experience in Africa, suggests China could enhance its soft power and improve relations with African nations by developing a robust NGO sector.  While China has invested heavily in infrastructure, its government-to-government approach lacks the grassroots engagement and community ties fostered by Western NGOs. This lack of engagement contributes to the perception of China as a neocolonial power. The article proposes a shift towards a more decentralized, NGO-based approach to improve public image and build stronger relationships.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's administration faced multiple challenges, including a deadly attack in Kyiv prompting a public plea to Vladimir Putin to stop the violence.  Simultaneously, a federal judge blocked Trump's attempt to alter voting rights, which advocates argued would disenfranchise millions.  These events highlight the range of domestic and foreign policy issues facing the Trump administration.  The contrast between Trump's public appeal to Putin and the judicial rebuke regarding voting rights underscores the complexities of his presidency.</p>

          <p>The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), a US foreign aid agency, is facing significant cuts under the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

The cuts contrast with the Trump administration's previous justifications for cuts to USAID.

He highlighted positive surprises from several companies and contrasted them with declines in some "safety stocks."  Cramer also emphasized the market's positive reaction to the White House's restraint in criticizing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.  His analysis underscores the interplay of corporate performance and political factors in influencing market movements. (not investment advice)</p>
