          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its acquisition of Hess for $53 billion, a move aimed at securing access to Guyana's significant offshore oil reserves. The deal was finalized after an international arbitration panel ruled against Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the region. While the outcome is a major victory for Chevron, the company anticipates some headcount reductions as it integrates Hess, continuing its ongoing efforts to streamline operations and cut costs.</p>

          <p>Catholic leaders in Washington, supported by the U.S. Justice Department, are legally challenging a new state law that requires clergy to report child abuse information learned during confession. The law, which removes the traditional priest-penitent privilege, is being called an act of religious discrimination by plaintiffs, who argue it unconstitutionally forces priests to violate their sacred duties. The state's Democratic governor signed the bill, which is set to take effect, creating a standoff over religious freedom and child protection.</p>

          <p>The United States is introducing a new, non-waivable "visa integrity fee" of at least $250 for all nonimmigrant visa applicants, effective from the 2025 fiscal year. This fee is in addition to existing visa application charges and is intended to be reimbursed if the visitor complies with the terms of their visa, such as not overstaying. However, significant uncertainty remains about the implementation and reimbursement process, leading travel industry experts and immigration lawyers to advise treating the fee as nonrefundable.</p>

          <p>A recent University of Michigan survey indicates that U.S. consumers' short-term and long-term inflation expectations have fallen to their lowest points since February, before new tariff announcements. The one-year inflation outlook dropped to 4.4%, and the five-year forecast slid to 3.6%, reflecting a decrease in fears about tariff-induced price hikes. Despite this improvement, the survey director noted that consumers still perceive a substantial risk of future inflation, as expectations remain above the levels seen in late 2024.

Key questions remain as the IRS has yet to clarify which occupations are eligible and how the deduction interacts with new, higher reporting thresholds for freelance and gig work.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has dismissed the Trump administration's proposal to reopen Alcatraz prison, sarcastically stating it would happen the "same day Trump lets her release the Epstein files. So, never." The comment follows a visit to the historic island prison by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Attorney General Pam Bondi. Newsom's remark connects the prison idea to the ongoing controversy surrounding the administration's handling of files related to Jeffrey Epstein, a sensitive issue that has caused a rift among Trump's supporters.</p>

          <p>The first known criminal conviction related to the Post Office's Capture accounting software, a precursor to the notorious Horizon system, has been referred to the Court of Appeal. The case involves former sub-postmistress Patricia Owen, who was convicted of theft in 1998 over a £6,000 shortfall. The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) referred the conviction on the grounds of abuse of process, marking a significant step for those who believe they were wrongly prosecuted due to flaws in the earlier software system.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the competitive streaming market, children's programming like "CoComelon" and "Bluey" has become a crucial tool for retaining subscribers. Industry experts note that kids' content is less expensive to produce and has high re-watch value, which helps reduce customer churn—a major challenge for services like Netflix, Disney+, and others. As media companies focus on profitability, the consistent engagement driven by children's shows provides a stable viewership base, making it a key strategic asset in a market where viewers often drop services due to a lack of use.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a bill, largely along party lines, to cut $9 billion in federal funding as proposed by President Trump. The package rescinds approximately $8 billion from foreign assistance programs and $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports NPR and PBS. The legislation, which now heads to the president's desk, was opposed by all Democrats and two Republicans, who argued the cuts undermine U.S. soft power and harm rural access to information.</p>

Last season, the team struggled for goals, raising questions about whether current striker Rasmus Hojlund can flourish with enhanced support or if another central forward is still needed. Pundits debate if the new signings' creativity will be enough to solve United's scoring woes or if the club is taking a major risk by not acquiring a proven goalscorer.</p>

          <p>This article explores the profound ethical questions facing engineers in the field of artificial intelligence, where massive salaries are offered to develop technology with potentially world-altering consequences. While AI promises significant benefits, leaders in the field also warn of existential risks, such as deceptive or hostile AI systems and the potential for misuse in surveillance or bioterrorism. The author argues that working at a frontier AI lab is only ethical if one has a defensible plan to mitigate these dangers, as the immense financial incentives can easily lead to overlooking catastrophic risks.</p>

The doctor's statement also confirmed there was no evidence of more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis and noted that bruising on Trump's hand was unrelated, likely caused by frequent handshaking.</p>
