          <p>After a 1-0 aggregate win over Fredrikstad, Crystal Palace has qualified for the Conference League league phase for the first time. Manager Oliver Glasner called it a "huge achievement" and the club's second goal of the season after winning the Community Shield. Despite recent success, the team faces challenges with a weakened squad following key player departures and is looking to make new signings before the transfer deadline to remain competitive in both domestic and European competitions.</p>

The man, who fled Somalia, described facing hostility and intimidation from anti-immigration protestors, which has confined residents to the hotel. While critical of some fellow residents' behavior, he also expressed an understanding of local frustrations with mass migration, highlighting the complex and tense situation surrounding the use of hotels for asylum housing.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York has denied Saudi Arabia's motion to dismiss a long-running lawsuit, allowing families of 9/11 victims to continue their legal action against the kingdom. The lawsuit alleges that Saudi officials provided material support to some of the hijackers, focusing on assistance given to two hijackers in California before the attacks. The judge ruled that the plaintiffs have provided reasonable evidence of the roles played by alleged Saudi agents, which the kingdom's "innocent explanations" were not strong enough to overcome.</p>

The piece suggests that China, as a major importer, has the leverage to help Indonesia shift towards more sustainable practices, thereby rewriting the destructive narrative associated with the industry.</p>

          <p>A long-standing U.S. import tax exemption known as "de minimis" is being suspended, a change that will affect consumers who purchase low-cost goods from foreign online retailers like Temu and Shein. The rule, which since 2015 allowed packages valued under $800 to enter the country duty-free, has been eliminated by an executive order from President Trump. Consequently, all incoming shipments will now face an import tax, which is expected to increase prices on many inexpensive items previously purchased online from abroad.</p>

          <p>The Reform UK leader of Nottinghamshire County Council, Mick Barton, has banned reporters from the Nottingham Post and its online affiliate from speaking with him or his councillors. The ban, which also includes BBC-funded Local Democracy Reporters, was reportedly prompted by a disagreement over a story about local government reorganization. The newspaper's editor called the move an "unprecedented" and "direct attack on the free press," while Barton stated his party would not allow "misinformation to shape the narrative of our governance."</p>

          <p>San Diego-based Dexcom, a leading developer of continuous glucose monitors for people with diabetes, is laying off 350 employees, which amounts to 3% of its global workforce. The company stated the job cuts are part of a strategic realignment to position itself for long-term success. This move follows a previous reduction of 536 positions in San Diego last year as the company shifted manufacturing operations to Arizona. Despite the layoffs, Dexcom reported a 15% year-over-year revenue growth in its most recent quarter.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that while President Trump's attacks on the Federal Reserve are concerning, the larger threat to the central bank's independence comes from unsustainable U.S. fiscal policy. The author explains the concept of "fiscal dominance," where massive government debt and rising interest payments could compel the Fed to keep interest rates low to make government borrowing cheaper, regardless of inflation. This pressure will exist no matter who is president, and without Congress addressing spending and debt, the Fed's ability to conduct independent monetary policy will be severely constrained.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dell Technologies stock fell despite the company reporting second-quarter revenue and earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations. The decline was attributed to a third-quarter earnings-per-share forecast that came in below analyst predictions. While Dell raised its full-year revenue outlook, driven by a 69% annual increase in its Servers and Networking division from strong demand for AI servers, the softer near-term profit guidance and a 3% decline in its storage business concerned investors. The company now expects to ship $20 billion in AI servers in its next fiscal year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For seniors facing rising costs, gaps in Medicare coverage for expenses like copays and deductibles can create significant financial strain. This article outlines several strategies to address these shortfalls and ensure healthcare costs are fully managed. Options include purchasing Medicare supplemental insurance (Medigap) to cover out-of-pocket expenses, utilizing a reverse mortgage to tap into home equity for tax-free funds, or buying an annuity to guarantee a consistent future income stream. These tools can provide both financial security and peace of mind for older adults navigating their healthcare needs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that existing laws fail to prevent individuals who pose a clear safety risk from legally obtaining firearms, as exemplified by a recent Manhattan shooter who had twice been on emergency psychiatric holds. While federal law prohibits gun ownership after a formal judicial commitment, many states' temporary emergency holds do not trigger this restriction. The author advocates for states and Congress to enact laws that create a temporary, reviewable pause on gun rights for individuals subjected to such holds, as is already done in California and Washington, to better balance public safety with individual liberties.</p>

          <p>Minneapolis police have stated that the locked doors of the Annunciation Catholic School's church "likely saved countless lives" during the recent mass shooting. The attacker, Robin Westman, was unable to enter the building where mass was being held and instead fired through the windows from outside, killing two children and injuring 17 others. Investigators also found evidence that Westman had planned to barricade the church's emergency exits from the inside, which would have trapped congregants had the initial entry been successful. The new details highlight the shooter's intent to cause maximum casualties within the church.</p>
