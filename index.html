            <p>US Senator Chris Van Hollen recently traveled to El Salvador to meet with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported by the Trump administration. Van Hollen emphasized that his mission was to defend Abrego Garcia's right to due process, rather than defending the individual himself, and stressed the importance of upholding the rule of law for everyone. The senator criticized the Trump administration for allegedly flouting court orders related to the case and raised concerns about potential constitutional issues. He recounted Abrego Garcia's trauma from imprisonment, underscoring the human impact of the situation. </p>

            <p>Asian nations, including Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, are considering investing in Alaska LNG, a massive natural gas project, to mitigate the impact of Trump's tariffs and strengthen trade relations. The project, estimated to cost over $40 billion, involves constructing a pipeline and liquefaction plant to export Alaskan gas to Asia. The Trump administration views Alaska LNG as a strategic asset, offering a direct route to Asian markets and supporting U.S. energy dominance. However, analysts note the project's commercial viability remains uncertain, facing competition from existing LNG options and potential political risks.</p>

            <p>An Israeli military inquiry concluded that the killing of 14 emergency workers in Gaza last month resulted from an "operational misunderstanding." The IDF stated that troops opened fire believing they faced an immediate threat from enemy forces in a hostile combat zone, compounded by poor night visibility that hindered the identification of ambulances. The report also indicated that six of the casualties were Hamas members, a claim that was not backed up by evidence. The deputy commander of the unit involved was dismissed for providing an incomplete and inaccurate report during the debriefing.</p>

            <p>A draft executive order from the Trump administration proposes a significant overhaul of the US State Department, including substantial cuts to sub-Saharan operations and bureaus related to climate, refugees, human rights, and gender equality.

The order also suggests eliminating the Bureau of International Organizations and reducing diplomatic operations in Canada. The White House and State Department have not commented, though Secretary of State Marco Rubio dismissed the reports as "fake news."</p>

The court's order followed an emergency appeal by the ACLU, which argued that immigration authorities were moving to deport individuals without due process.

Examples include retailers like Walmart and Amazon, banks like Citibank and JPMorgan, and payroll companies like Paychex, as their reports provide real-time insights into economic health.

            <p>Germany is attempting to deport an American and three EU citizens who participated in pro-Palestinian protests, citing alleged actions at a protest against Israel's war in Gaza. The Berlin Immigration Office revoked their residence permits, claiming their actions violated the concept of Staatsräson, which prioritizes Germany's responsibility toward Israel's existence and security. The move has drawn criticism, with concerns raised about the potential conflict with EU law regarding freedom of movement and parallels to the Trump administration's handling of pro-Palestinian student protests in the U.S.</p>

            <p>The recent stock market pullback reflects ongoing uncertainty surrounding Trump's tariff policy, particularly regarding trade relations with China. Despite recent electronics tariff exclusions, the market remains cautious due to the lack of scheduled high-level discussions between U.S. and Chinese officials. The Treasury Secretary's comments suggest that comprehensive tariff deals with major trading partners are unlikely within the near term, contributing to continued market volatility. Any rallies in stocks should be treated as short-lived until there is a clear resolution.</p>
