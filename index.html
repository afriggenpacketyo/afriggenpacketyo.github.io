          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily delayed a lower court's order that would have prevented the Trump administration from deploying the California National Guard in response to protests over immigration raids in Los Angeles. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an administrative stay and scheduled a hearing for June 17, after a federal judge initially ruled that Trump's actions exceeded his statutory authority and violated the Tenth Amendment, ordering control of the National Guard to be returned to Governor Gavin Newsom. The Trump administration argued that the judge's order was an "extraordinary intrusion" on the President's constitutional authority as Commander in Chief, while Newsom expressed gratitude for the initial ruling and stated his intention to redeploy the National Guard to border security, counter-drug enforcement, and wildfire prevention efforts. The appeals court will consider the administration's appeal. Optimism remains somewhat subdued given the legal back-and-forth.</p>

          <p>Israel's military launched preemptive airstrikes targeting Iranian nuclear facilities and research scientists, initiating what could be a multi-day operation dubbed "Operation Rising Lion." Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated the strikes aimed to eliminate the Iranian threat, while Iranian state television reported the death of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps head Hossein Salami. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed a harsh response, escalating tensions in the region. The United States denied involvement, emphasizing its priority to protect American forces, and the U.S. Embassy in Israel advised personnel to shelter in place. The strikes occurred amid ongoing US-Iran nuclear talks, with President Trump aware of the operation in advance.</p>

The average age of all mothers rose from 28.7 in 2016 to 29.6 in 2023, while the average age of first-time mothers increased from 26.6 to 27.5 during the same period. Experts attribute this shift to various factors, including changing social expectations, advancements in fertility technology, and the rising cost of raising children. The report also noted a continuing decline in teen pregnancies, which have decreased from 11.8% of first births in 2016 to 8.7% in 2023.</p>

Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz declared a state of emergency for the entire country following the "preemptive" attack on Iran. Iranian media reported an explosion in the city of Natanz, which hosts a uranium enrichment facility, and the United States said it was "not involved" in Israel's action.</p>

          <p>Democrats have expressed outrage over the forcible removal and handcuffing of Senator Alex Padilla by Secret Service and FBI officers at a news conference held by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. The incident occurred after Padilla posed a question about the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, with Democrats describing the senator's treatment as "violent," "horrifying," and "a stunning abuse of power." Tensions have been high between Democrats and the Trump administration over the deployment of the National Guard and Marines to quell protests against the administration's anti-immigration program in Los Angeles.</p>

With a significantly larger number of STEM graduates compared to the United States, China's focus on engineering is evident in its leadership and national policies. This emphasis on building and innovation highlights the grandeur and potential tragedy of China's ambitious pursuits.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary ruling against the Trump administration's deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, siding with the state of California's argument that the president erred in how the guard was being activated. The order requires Trump to return control of the National Guard to California Governor Gavin Newsom, though the administration has filed an appeal. The judge stated that the president's actions were illegal and that the military belongs on the battlefield, not on city streets. The Trump administration had said it took over California's National Guard to restore order and to protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.</p>

The order requires Trump to return control of the National Guard to California Governor Gavin Newsom by noon Friday (Pacific Time). The judge rejected the administration's argument that the courts do not have the authority to review a president's decision on whether the National Guard is needed. Trump had deployed 4,000 California National Guard and several hundred U.S. Marines to Los Angeles, over the objections of Democratic Gov. Newsom.</p>
