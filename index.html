The uncertainty caused by the tariffs is already hindering innovation, new product launches, and investments, according to industry leaders. This situation highlights the significant economic interdependence between the US and European pharmaceutical markets.</p>

          <p>Congressional Republicans plan to use a controversial budget maneuver to pass their $5 trillion tax cut package, potentially violating Senate rules.  Their strategy involves using a "current policy" baseline to minimize the apparent cost of the tax cuts, despite its impact on the deficit.  Democrats strongly oppose this approach, calling it "nuclear" and a violation of established norms. This situation highlights the intense political battles surrounding tax policy and the potential for procedural maneuvers to circumvent established rules.</p>
