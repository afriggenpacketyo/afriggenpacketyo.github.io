          <p>According to a CNBC study, North Carolina has been ranked as America's premier state for business, attributed to its robust economy, highly-rated workforce, and business-friendly regulations. The state has successfully attracted major investments from companies like JetZero and Amazon, bolstering its GDP and creating tens of thousands of jobs. However, this top ranking is contrasted by significant challenges, including a low quality of life score, minimal worker protections, and potential economic risks from federal policy shifts and the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.</p>

          <p>Popular weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy are being linked to a growing number of side effects beyond common digestive issues. Medical professionals are increasingly concerned about reports of more severe conditions, including acute pancreatitis, which has been associated with at least ten deaths in the UK. Recent studies have also found increased risks for musculoskeletal disorders, arthritis, and a rare but sight-threatening optic nerve disease. While experts stress that the drugs' benefits often outweigh the risks, they call for more research into their long-term effects.</p>

          <p>Former "MasterChef" host Gregg Wallace is facing criticism after appearing to link his recent autism diagnosis to allegations of misconduct, which he denies. Amid claims from dozens of people of inappropriate comments and touching, Wallace stated that TV bosses failed to investigate his disability or protect him in a "dangerous environment." Disability charities and advocates have responded by stating that autism is not an excuse for misconduct and warned that such comments risk stigmatizing the autistic community, as Wallace reportedly plans to sue for discrimination.</p>

          <p>Police in Northern Ireland have declared a major incident over a large bonfire in south Belfast built for the annual Twelfth of July celebrations. There are serious concerns that the structure's proximity to a major electricity substation poses a risk to the power supply for two major hospitals. Despite bonfire builders voluntarily removing some pallets as an "olive branch," the city council has requested police assistance to dismantle the bonfire, leading to heightened tensions and a planned legal challenge from a loyalist activist to prevent its removal.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has suspended six personnel without pay following the assassination attempt on President Trump in Pennsylvania nearly a year ago. The disciplinary action, ranging from 10 to 42 days of leave, comes after a security failure that allowed a gunman to open fire at a campaign rally. A Secret Service deputy director stated the agency is accountable for the "operational failure" and is focused on fixing systemic deficiencies rather than simply firing staff, addressing issues identified in a critical bipartisan House report.</p>

          <p>A 67-year-old man from Texas has died while hiking in the Grand Canyon, according to the National Park Service. The hiker was found unresponsive on the popular South Kaibab Trail while attempting a multi-day hike to the Colorado River. His death comes as the park service issues stark warnings about extremely hazardous conditions, with temperatures in the inner canyon expected to exceed 110 degrees Fahrenheit. Officials strongly recommend that hikers avoid the inner trails during peak heat hours from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. to prevent heat-related illness or death.</p>

          <p>This article provides a deep historical analysis of the policy decisions that led to Los Angeles having the largest homeless population in the United States. It argues that a scarcity of affordable housing, not primarily mental illness or substance abuse, is the root cause. Key factors include the demolition of thousands of single-room occupancy hotels, the halt of public housing construction due to anti-communist sentiment, the loss of manufacturing jobs, and zoning changes that drastically reduced the city's housing capacity, all of which created the current crisis.</p>

These images, captured by a secret military unit, served as both scientific records and Cold War propaganda, showcasing America's technological might. Decades later, they are viewed as a form of disconcerting art, depicting surreal, man-made fireballs against desolate landscapes. The article notes that after the 1963 Test Ban Treaty moved tests underground, this visceral public record of the government's nuclear activities effectively vanished.</p>

Arguing against "deglobalisation," he asserts that the solution is not to abandon institutions like the UN, but to rebuild them on fairer, more inclusive foundations that reflect today's global realities and can address inequality, war, and climate change.</p>
