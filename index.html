          <p>The White House has appointed Mary "Maggie" Cleary as the new acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, an office currently investigating New York Attorney General Letitia James. The appointment follows the abrupt departure of Erik Siebert, who allegedly faced pressure from the Trump administration to pursue charges against James, a prominent critic of the president. Cleary, a conservative lawyer who previously wrote about being wrongly targeted in connection to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, takes over an office in turmoil over claims of political interference.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard reportedly revoked the security clearances of 37 individuals, including senior CIA officials, without prior notification to the White House. This action caused significant internal frustration, as it prevented a thorough vetting of the list and included career intelligence officers and Democratic congressional staffers. While a senior intelligence official claimed Gabbard was executing a direct order from President Trump to remove individuals involved in the 2016 Russia intelligence assessments, the move has reportedly deepened tensions between the DNI's office and the CIA.</p>

While the storm is not projected to make landfall in the U.S., its center is forecast to pass near Bermuda on Sunday night or Monday. The National Hurricane Center has advised that swells generated by Gabrielle will likely affect the U.S. East Coast from North Carolina northward, as well as Atlantic Canada, creating potentially dangerous surf conditions early next week.</p>

          <p>While deadly flash flooding in the U.S. Southwest has eased, forecasters warn the threat will return as more monsoonal moisture moves into Southern California and Arizona. This renewed risk comes as Tropical Storm Gabrielle continues to strengthen in the Atlantic, where it is expected to become the season's second hurricane. Although Gabrielle poses no direct threat to the U.S. mainland, it is generating dangerous surf and rip currents along the East Coast, highlighting a period of dynamic and hazardous weather across different regions of the country.</p>

          <p>Efforts to establish trilateral nuclear arms reduction talks involving the United States, Russia, and China remain at a standstill following President Trump's proposal. Beijing has firmly rejected the call for "denuclearisation" talks, deeming the proposal unrealistic and unreasonable. China maintains its long-standing policy of keeping its nuclear arsenal at the minimum level required for national security and has refused to engage in an arms race. This impasse raises concerns about the future of arms control treaties like the New START agreement.</p>

          <p>Researchers have made a significant breakthrough with implications for fusion energy by observing diamond capsules undergo shock-induced amorphization for the first time. Using powerful lasers to compress the capsules, scientists were able to better understand how extreme pressure causes the diamond's atomic structure to collapse, a key factor in achieving the symmetrical implosion needed for nuclear fusion. This discovery marks a crucial step toward harnessing fusion, a potentially limitless and clean energy source that could reduce global dependence on fossil fuels and combat climate change.</p>

          <p>A court in Islamabad, Pakistan, has formally charged a 22-year-old man with the murder of Sana Yousaf, a 17-year-old medical student and TikTok creator. Yousaf was shot and killed in her home in June after reportedly rejecting the man's advances, an act he allegedly confessed to police before pleading not guilty in court. Her killing has sparked outrage and protests across Pakistan, drawing renewed attention to the pervasive issue of violence against women and girls in the country. The case highlights a tragic pattern of patriarchal violence.</p>

          <p>Correctional officers at the California Rehabilitation Center (CRC) in Norco are appealing to the state to reverse its decision to close the facility by 2026. In letters to the Attorney General, officers argue that the prison has available beds and effective rehabilitation programs that could help alleviate severe overcrowding in county jails, such as those in Los Angeles County. The state's Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) cited high infrastructure costs and an aging population as reasons for the closure, a claim the officers contest by highlighting the prison's cost-effectiveness and operational capacity.</p>

          <p>The Indian government has officially responded to the new $100,000 fee for U.S. H-1B skilled worker visas, stating the policy will have serious "humanitarian consequences" by disrupting families. As Indian nationals receive over 70% of H-1B visas, the impact is expected to be particularly severe there. The statement expressed hope that U.S. authorities would address the disruptions, highlighting the strong people-to-people ties and mutual economic benefits that have been built on skilled worker exchange. The move adds another layer of tension to ongoing trade negotiations between the two countries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Southern Inyo Healthcare District, a critical access hospital in Lone Pine, California, is on the verge of financial collapse, with officials reporting it had only eight days of cash on hand. Local and state officials have requested an emergency $3 million from the governor to prevent the hospital from closing, which would create a 136-mile gap in medical services in the remote Eastern Sierra region. The facility serves a small local population as well as over a million annual visitors to nearby national parks, and its potential closure reflects a growing crisis for rural hospitals nationwide.</p>

          <p>With a government shutdown looming on September 30, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries have formally requested a meeting with President Trump. In a letter, they accused Republican leadership of refusing to engage in bipartisan negotiations to pass a spending bill and keep the government open. Both parties appear determined to blame the other for a potential shutdown after competing short-term funding bills failed in the Senate, leaving Congress with little time to reach a compromise.</p>

In letters to California, New York, and Illinois, the acting ICE director warned that refusal to hold undocumented migrants for federal agents could lead to legal action from the Department of Justice. The states have laws limiting cooperation with federal immigration authorities, citing constitutional concerns and the need to build community trust, setting up a major legal battle over states' rights and immigration enforcement.</p>
