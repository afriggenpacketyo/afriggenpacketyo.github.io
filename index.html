          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 17:17:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's first-quarter earnings report revealed a significant drop in automotive revenue, plummeting 20% compared to the previous year, resulting in a miss on both top and bottom lines. The company cited factory updates for the refreshed Model Y, lower average selling prices, and sales incentives as contributing factors to the decline. Net income also took a hit, decreasing by 71% compared to the previous year, and CEO Elon Musk has been heavily involved in President Trump's administration, overseeing efforts to downsize the federal government, leading to investor concern about the company's direction. These factors, coupled with tariff implications, have caused Tesla's stock to suffer a substantial drop this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is initiating a phased removal of petroleum-based synthetic dyes from the U.S. food supply by the end of next year, targeting additives like red dye 40 found in products such as Flamin' Hot Cheetos and Skittles. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary cited concerns over the increasing exposure of American children to synthetic chemicals. The FDA is requesting food companies to transition to natural alternatives and is exploring various tools to ensure compliance, with the goal of eliminating the remaining six synthetic dyes from the market, including red dye 40, yellow dye 5, and blue dye 1. Companies are encouraged to use natural substitutes like watermelon or beet juice.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court appears inclined to side with parents objecting to LGBTQ+ themed books in public schools, focusing on a case in Montgomery County, Maryland, where parents sought opt-outs from classes using these materials. The conservative justices raised concerns about religious freedom and the feasibility of denying opt-outs, while liberal justices questioned where to draw the line on parental objections to curriculum content. The case centers on storybooks promoting respect for LGBTQ+ families, and the court's decision could significantly impact the balance between school curricula and parental rights.

          <p>Sarah Palin lost her defamation case against The New York Times for the second time, after a jury found the newspaper not liable for allegedly defaming her in a 2017 editorial about gun control. The case, which garnered significant attention due to the prominent figures involved and broader free speech implications, centered on an editorial that inaccurately linked Palin's political action committee to a 2011 mass shooting. Despite the Times issuing a correction and apology, Palin argued the error increased death threats against her. The verdict highlights the high legal standard of malice required for public figures to win defamation cases.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump suggested that revenue from tariffs could potentially replace the federal income tax, an idea he previously floated during his presidential campaign. Economists, however, remain skeptical, with Alex Durante of the Tax Foundation calling it "not a realistic proposal." The statement comes amid ongoing tariff negotiations and uncertainty, with the universal tariff rate on goods imported into the United States from most countries at 10%, and tariffs on imports from China as high as 145%.

          <p>The Supreme Court seems inclined to require a Maryland school board to allow parents to opt their elementary school-age children out of instruction involving storybooks on gender identity and sexual orientation. During arguments, the court's conservative majority expressed concerns about religious freedom and the feasibility of denying opt-outs, while liberal justices questioned the limits of parental objections to curriculum content. The case involves a group of families arguing that the school board's policy infringes on their First Amendment right to religious exercise. A decision from the Supreme Court is expected by early July.</p>

Notable examples include the long-delayed full self-driving (FSD) technology, which Musk has been promising since 2015, and the affordable $25,000 Tesla EV, now expected by early 2025. Other projects facing delays include the Cybercab robotaxi, the next-generation Roadster electric sports car, and the Cybertruck, which finally began production in 2023 after initial plans for late 2021.

Experts warn that the resumption of collections, which were paused during the COVID-19 pandemic, could contribute to an economic slowdown as borrowers face wage garnishments and reduced spending power. While the policy may add to government revenue, it could also damage borrowers' credit scores and hinder their ability to make large purchases. The policy will not impact all defaulted borrowers, and may provide needed clarity to loan repayment.</p>
