          <p>Thousands of customers of UK telecommunication providers EE and BT experienced a significant service outage, leaving them unable to make or receive calls. Downdetector, a service that tracks network issues, recorded a spike in reports, confirming the widespread nature of the problem. A spokesperson for BT, which owns EE, acknowledged the issue and apologized, stating that engineers were working urgently to restore services. The outage also potentially affected customers of smaller networks that use EE's infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon's Inspector General has reportedly found evidence that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's encrypted Signal messages contained details from a classified email regarding a planned bombing operation in Yemen. This information was allegedly shared in a group chat with other Trump administration officials. The Pentagon has denied that any classified information was shared, but sources indicate the details originated from a "SECRET//NOFORN" email, meaning its disclosure could cause serious damage to national security. The investigation into the use of commercial messaging apps for official business is ongoing.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, currently serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring, met with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. The meeting was initiated to determine what information Maxwell might have about other individuals involved in Epstein's crimes. This development occurs as the Trump administration faces increasing pressure to release files related to the Epstein investigation. The House Oversight Committee also intends to subpoena the files, which reportedly mention President Trump's name multiple times.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has stated that the social media app TikTok will "go dark" for American users unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, agrees to a deal that gives the U.S. control over its operations. This reiterates the stance of the Trump administration, which has cited national security concerns over potential Chinese government access to user data. The deadline for ByteDance to divest its U.S. business is September 17. Lutnick emphasized that any deal would require American ownership of the technology and control over the algorithm.</p>

          <p>As artificial intelligence becomes more sophisticated, experts are debating the practicality of a "kill switch" to shut down a potentially rogue superintelligence. AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton argues that once AI surpasses human intelligence, its power of persuasion will be its primary tool, making a physical off-switch ineffective. Other experts note that AI's distributed nature across global data centers makes a coordinated shutdown nearly impossible without causing a catastrophic collapse of essential global infrastructure. The focus, some researchers suggest, should be on instilling benevolent values in AI.</p>

          <p>A previously unreleased National Women's Soccer League investigation concluded that the San Diego Wave's front office could have been more proactive in addressing a sexual assault allegation from a staff member. However, the investigation found no specific policy violation because the victim did not use the term "sexual" when initially reporting her "traumatization." The report highlights systemic challenges in workplace reporting mechanisms for such incidents. The case has since escalated, with former employees filing a lawsuit against both the club and the NWSL for a hostile work environment.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the science and philosophy behind why time seems to speed up as we age, a phenomenon known as tachypsychia. It explains that our perception of time is subjective and can be influenced by age, circadian rhythms, and the intensity of our experiences. To make life feel subjectively longer and richer, the author suggests focusing on meaningful, emotionally evocative activities over simple fun, as these create denser memories. Other strategies include savoring moments fully and breaking from routine to introduce novelty, which can slow our internal clock.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit the Federal Reserve headquarters, continuing his public pressure campaign on its chair, Jerome Powell. The visit follows recent comments where Trump suggested that cost overruns on a Fed building renovation project could be grounds for firing Powell. The president has been highly critical of the Fed's decision to maintain current interest rates, demanding cuts to stimulate the economy. Firing the Fed chair would be a controversial move that could threaten the central bank's long-held independence and destabilize financial markets.</p>

In a joint statement, the co-leaders vowed to fight for the redistribution of wealth and to address injustices like child poverty.
