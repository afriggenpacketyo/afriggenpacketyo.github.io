          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials have reached an agreement on a trade framework following high-level talks in London, awaiting approval from President Trump and President Xi. The agreement aims to implement the Geneva consensus and de-escalate trade tensions, which had escalated due to accusations of violating the Geneva trade agreement. If approved, the framework signals a commitment to continue dialogue, though the uncertainty of concrete agreements remains. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will brief President Trump on the deal. Optimism remains cautiously optimistic as both countries navigate complex trade dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. defense sector relies on critical minerals for advanced weapon systems but depends heavily on China for these resources. China's dominance in rare earths, controlling over 90% of global processing and refining, poses a risk to U.S. military readiness and supply chain security. Beijing has used its control over critical mineral production as leverage in trade negotiations and to target the defense industries of the U.S. and its allies. These materials are essential for various American weapon systems, and the lack of substitutes makes the U.S. defense industry vulnerable to Chinese export restrictions.</p>

          <p>The UK Chancellor's Spending Review promises increased spending for Scotland in areas such as defense, computing, and carbon-capture technology. The review allocates Â£250m for the Royal Navy's nuclear submarine base on the Clyde, Â£750m for a supercomputer in Edinburgh, and funding for the Acorn Project in St Fergus, which focuses on carbon capture and storage. The review, covering the next few financial years, allocates day-to-day and capital spending, excluding funds spent by Holyrood. The Labour government is front-loading extra funds, but some departments may face real-term cuts as defense and the NHS take priority.</p>

          <p>Americans are divided on President Trump's decision to send National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles in response to protests against immigration enforcement. Some view the deployment as "un-American," worrying about the precedent of using the military against citizens, while others see it as necessary to quell violence and maintain order. The governor of California and the mayor of Los Angeles have criticized Trump's actions as overstepping authority and stoking tensions. Everyday Americans express varying opinions on whether the president or the protesters have gone too far.</p>

Newsom criticized Trump's deployment of the California National Guard and U.S. Marines, stating it was unnecessary and designed to incite violence. He claimed that Trump's government is traumatizing communities rather than protecting them. Newsom's remarks reflect escalating tensions between California and the Trump administration over immigration enforcement and the use of military force.</p>
