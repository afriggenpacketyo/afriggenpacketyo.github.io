          <p>Massive "No Kings" protests against President Trump's policies have swept across major US cities, drawing thousands with slogans like "Democracy not Monarchy." Critics warn of unconstitutional moves and a threat to American democracy, while Trump dismisses accusations of dictatorial behavior. Despite National Guard mobilization, organizers reported peaceful events, with New York City police estimating over 100,000 participants and no arrests. Democratic politicians joined the rallies, emphasizing love for America and the importance of preserving democratic principles and addressing issues like healthcare. The demonstrations highlight a deep national division regarding the president's actions and approval ratings.</p>

Engel's wife and two daughters were previously released in a November 2023 hostage exchange. The Israeli government expressed deep sorrow, while the second set of remains is still undergoing identification. This article highlights a somber aspect of the ongoing Gaza conflict, focusing on the return of human remains as part of a broader ceasefire agreement.

          <p>China has accused the United States of conducting "long-term, highly covert, and state-level cyberespionage tools" attacks against its National Time Centre. This facility, affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is crucial for generating and distributing China’s standard time, impacting critical sectors like communications, finance, power, transport, mapping, and defense. The US embassy in China has not yet responded to the allegations. This article highlights escalating cyber tensions between the two global powers, pointing to potential threats to national infrastructure and sovereignty. The accusations suggest a deepening of the digital conflict and distrust between the nations, with significant implications for global stability.</p>

          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has accused the US of "murder" after a US strike on what President Donald Trump called a "drug-carrying submarine" resulted in two deaths. Trump stated the vessel was loaded with fentanyl and other narcotics, and two survivors were returned to Ecuador and Colombia. Petro countered that the Colombian boat was adrift with a distress signal due to engine failure, demanding explanations from the US government. This article highlights a significant international incident, raising questions about the legality and ethics of US anti-drug operations in the Caribbean, especially given previous strikes that killed 27 people. UN experts have already labeled these US strikes as "extrajudicial executions."</p>

          <p>This article explores the common decline in sexual desire within long-term relationships, attributing it to hormonal shifts where bonding hormones like oxytocin dampen initial sex drive. Psychologists emphasize open communication about sexual needs and desires as crucial for couples to navigate these changes. Research highlights differences in male and female sexuality, noting that women can experience physical arousal without psychological desire, partly due to societal factors and past experiences including sexual assault. The article stresses the importance of sexual satisfaction for relationship well-being and suggests that consistent affection, not just sex, strengthens couple bonds.
