          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has reached an agreement with Boeing to avoid prosecution over the two deadly 737 Max crashes that killed 346 people. Under the agreement, Boeing will pay over $1.1 billion, including a criminal fine and funds for crash victims and compliance programs. The deal allows Boeing to avoid being labeled a felon, though it has faced criticism from victims' families who sought more accountability. The crashes led to a nearly two-year grounding of the 737 Max planes worldwide and significantly impacted Boeing's competitive position.</p>

          <p>The CDC has reported cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1 in the U.S., which is linked to a surge in China.

Preliminary data suggests that NB.1.8.1 may be more transmissible but not necessarily more severe than other strains. The FDA's vaccine advisors are considering updating COVID-19 vaccines for the coming seasons to target JN.1 variants, which could offer protection against NB.1.8.1.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For beginners interested in gold investing, it's crucial to understand the various asset types, market dynamics, and potential risks. Gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are often recommended as an efficient entry point, offering liquidity without the storage concerns of physical gold. While gold is considered a safe-haven asset, its price can be influenced by multiple factors, including interest rates and geopolitical tensions, making it important to consider it as a long-term hedge. Investors should also be wary of scams and high premiums, conducting thorough research and working with reputable dealers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New Jersey is holding its gubernatorial elections this year, with primaries set for next month. Experts say the high-stakes race could be a harbinger for the mood of the country ahead of 2026's midterm elections. The race is seen as a test of the potential Democratic backlash against the Trump administration and could indicate shifts in partisan allegiances in New Jersey. Issues such as immigration enforcement, affordable housing, and the cost of living are also at stake.</p>

          <p>A decision by the Trump administration could make Harvard ineligible for international student visas, potentially wiping out several of the school's sports teams. The administration claims the school has created an unsafe campus environment by allowing "anti-American, pro-terrorist agitators" to assault Jewish students on campus. Harvard has called the action unlawful and said it is working to provide guidance to students. The move could force as many as 6,800 foreign students at the school outside of Boston to transfer or leave the country.</p>
