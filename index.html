          <p>The Reform UK leader of Nottinghamshire County Council, Mick Barton, has banned reporters from the Nottingham Post and its online affiliate from speaking with him or his councillors. The ban, which also affects BBC-funded Local Democracy Reporting Service journalists, was reportedly triggered by a story on local government reorganization. While Barton cites misrepresentation and a need for honesty, the newspaper's editor calls it a direct attack on the free press and the ability to hold elected officials accountable. The move has drawn criticism from other political parties, who have likened it to tactics used by Donald Trump to suppress scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Sources indicate that Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy is planning a 2028 Senate run, positioning himself to challenge fellow Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, a frequent critic of former President Donald Trump. Dunleavy, a strong Trump ally, is expected to complete his gubernatorial term before launching his campaign, avoiding the political fallout that affected former governor Sarah Palin. The potential race is drawing significant attention, as it would pit two prominent Alaskan Republicans against each other, with Murkowski's moderate base clashing with Dunleavy's conservative and MAGA movement support. The contest would also highlight the complexities of Alaska's ranked-choice voting system and the pivotal role of the Native vote.</p>

          <p>Authorities investigating the mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis have revealed the suspect, 23-year-old Robin Westman, held deep-seated hatred for nearly every imaginable group. According to investigators, Westman, a former student at the school, also had a deranged fascination with previous mass shooters and sought personal notoriety through the attack. The shooting, which killed two children and injured 18 others, was carried out from outside the church, as the suspect fired through narrow windows. Law enforcement stated the shooter's primary goal was to kill defenseless children and watch them suffer, underscoring the indiscriminate and hateful nature of the tragic event.</p>

          <p>Gap Inc. reported second-quarter revenue that missed Wall Street expectations, causing its stock to fall in after-hours trading. The company's overall performance was dragged down by a significant 9% decline in comparable sales at its Athleta brand, which offset modest gains at Old Navy, Gap, and Banana Republic. CEO Richard Dickson acknowledged that Athleta had moved too far from its performance roots while trying to attract new customers, and stated the brand is in a "year of reset." Despite the sales miss, the company's earnings per share were slightly better than anticipated, and Gap reaffirmed its full-year sales growth outlook.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 16:29:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite previous denials from owner Jerry Jones, the Dallas Cowboys are now reportedly open to hearing trade offers for All-Pro pass rusher Micah Parsons. The move comes amid a contentious contract dispute that has seen Parsons hold out from practice as he seeks a new long-term deal. Parsons, who is currently on the fifth-year option of his rookie contract, has publicly expressed his desire to leave the team and has removed Cowboys references from his social media. The situation reflects a significant standoff between a top NFL player and team management, with any potential trade likely demanding a substantial return of draft picks.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is experiencing a significant leadership crisis following the firing of Director Susan Monarez and the coordinated resignation of four other top officials. The departing leaders cited the "weaponizing of public health" and an inability to serve in an environment that disregards scientific reality under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic. This upheaval follows a series of measures by Kennedy to overhaul federal health agencies, including gutting a key vaccine advisory panel and canceling mRNA shot research. Public health experts warn this turmoil could severely erode public trust and weaken the nation's ability to respond to disease outbreaks.</p>

          <p>Dell Technologies saw its shares fall over 5% despite reporting second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations. The decline was prompted by the company's soft earnings guidance for the upcoming third quarter, which fell short of Wall Street forecasts. While overall revenue grew 19%, driven by a 69% surge in its Servers and Networking division fueled by AI server sales, its storage revenue saw a 3% decline. Dell raised its full-year outlook and announced plans to double its AI server shipments in fiscal 2026, but the weaker near-term profit forecast overshadowed the otherwise strong performance in the AI sector.</p>

Options include purchasing Medicare supplemental insurance, also known as Medigap, which is specifically designed to cover these leftover costs. Other potential solutions involve leveraging home equity through a reverse mortgage, a product exclusive to homeowners 62 and older, or securing a guaranteed future income stream by purchasing an annuity.

          <h2>Resignations and Ouster of Director Leave CDC in State of Crisis</h2>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is facing an unprecedented crisis after the White House ousted its new director, Susan Monarez, and four top officials resigned in protest. The departing leaders stated they could no longer work in an environment where science is replaced by ideology under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. This mass exodus has left a significant leadership vacuum, demoralizing staff and raising grave concerns among public health experts about the agency's future. Current and former employees fear the CDC's ability to provide reliable, science-based guidance to the American public is now critically undermined, with one former official stating, "It feels like the CDC is over."</p>

          <p>A 36-year-old woman was seriously injured after being attacked by a bear during an early morning jog just outside her home in Kenai, Alaska. The bear reportedly attacked the woman near her driveway and dragged her approximately 100 yards to a neighbor's property, where she was later found. She was medically evacuated to a hospital for treatment of her injuries. State troopers and wildlife officials searched for the animal, believed to be a brown bear based on tracks, but were unable to locate it. Authorities have issued a high alert for the neighborhood, advising residents to remain vigilant and secure potential attractants like trash and pet food.</p>

          <p>A recent financial filing from Nvidia has revealed a significant concentration in its customer base, with two unidentified direct customers accounting for 39% of its revenue in the last quarter. "Customer A" and "Customer B" comprised 23% and 16% of total sales, respectively, a notable increase from the previous year. This disclosure is fueling debate about whether Nvidia's explosive growth is overly dependent on a few large cloud providers like Microsoft, Amazon, or Google. While Nvidia's data center business is booming, the high level of customer concentration raises concerns among analysts about the sustainability and potential risks associated with its current growth trajectory.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The trend of "job hopping" that characterized the post-pandemic labor market is slowing down, as more Americans are choosing to stay with their current employers. An analysis from the Bank of America Institute shows the rate of job changes has declined 26% from its 2022 peak and is now only slightly above 2019 levels. This shift indicates a cooling labor market where workers have less leverage and fewer opportunities to switch for better pay. Consequently, the median pay increase for those who do change jobs has also decreased significantly, falling to 7% in July from a high of 20% in 2022, reflecting the shifting power dynamic back toward employers.</p>

          <p>In her lawsuit challenging President Trump's attempt to fire her, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook addresses allegations of mortgage fraud by suggesting any discrepancy was a minor "clerical error." The legal complaint primarily argues that under the Federal Reserve Act, a governor can only be removed for "cause," a standard the fraud allegations do not meet. Cook's attorneys contend the accusations are a pretext for Trump's desire to install a more compliant board that will lower interest rates. The suit asserts that even if an unintentional error was made on a mortgage application from before her confirmation, it would not constitute sufficient grounds for her removal from office.</p>

The incident occurred at the scene of the nearly 9,000-acre Bear Gulch fire in Olympic National Forest, where agents from U.S. Border Patrol reportedly arrested two members of a contract firefighting crew. Senator Murray condemned the action as "immoral as it is dangerous," questioning the policy of detaining essential emergency responders on the job.

          <p>European leaders have expressed outrage after a massive Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv killed at least 21 people, including four children, and damaged the European Union's delegation office. The bombardment, which Ukrainian officials described as the largest this month, also destroyed a five-story residential building. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen condemned the attack, stating Russia would "stop at nothing to terrorise Ukraine," while other leaders accused Moscow of deliberately escalating the conflict and mocking peace efforts. The strikes followed a recent diplomatic push to end the war, prompting widespread condemnation and calls for new, tougher sanctions against Russia.</p>

The conflict has escalated to the point that German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron are stepping in to mediate.

          <p>The Trump administration is eliminating the "de minimis" rule, a change that will likely increase costs for U.S. consumers who purchase low-value goods directly from international online sellers. The rule had allowed imports valued under $800 to enter the country free of tariffs and duties, a provision that fueled the growth of e-commerce shipments, particularly from China. Economists and trade experts warn that ending this exemption will subject these cheap items to new fees and taxes, disproportionately affecting lower-income households who benefit most from the policy. While the administration argues the move will help combat counterfeit goods, it is expected to raise consumer prices and create logistical challenges.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has started transferring detainees from a controversial state-run immigration detention center in Florida known as "Alligator Alcatraz." The move follows a federal judge's ruling that ordered a halt to new construction and the dismantling of parts of the facility due to violations of environmental laws. The center, located on an abandoned airstrip in the Everglades, is part of the Trump administration's effort to expand detention capacity for its mass deportation operations. While DHS is complying with the order, it criticized the ruling as an attempt to obstruct the president's immigration agenda and is appealing the decision.</p>
