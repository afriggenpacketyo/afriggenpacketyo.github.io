          <h2>Widespread Sexual Harassment Allegations in the UK Bar</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent review by Baroness Harriet Harman KC revealed systemic sexual harassment and bullying within the UK Bar.  The review, prompted by research showing 44% of barristers experiencing or witnessing such behavior, highlighted a culture of fear of reporting misconduct.  Numerous barristers shared accounts of groping, propositioning, and verbal abuse, emphasizing the power dynamics within the legal profession. The review concludes that more action is needed to address this pervasive problem and protect the reputation of the Bar.</p>

          <p>Over 1,000 migrants arrived in the UK by boat on Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood's first day, bringing the yearly total to over 30,000.  Mahmood called the number "utterly unacceptable" and accused smuggling gangs of "wreaking havoc".  The Sun suggests quitting the European Court of Human Rights to address asylum claims, while the Daily Mail criticizes Labour's lack of a deterrent policy.  Other papers discuss internal Labour party issues and England's cricket victory.</p>

          <p>A former Army Sergeant Major, Michael Webber, pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a teenage female soldier, Gunner Jaysley Beck, who later died by suicide.  An inquest found the Army's handling of Beck's complaint contributed to her death. Webber's guilty plea brings some relief to Beck's family, who criticized the Army's failure to report the assault to the police. The Army has apologized and implemented new policies to address sexual assault within its ranks.</p>

The Peronist candidate, Axel Kicillof, won by a larger margin than pre-election polls predicted.  Milei acknowledged the defeat, attributing it to unspecified mistakes, but vowed to continue his libertarian reforms. The loss comes amid criticism over a bribery scandal involving Milei's sister and concerns about public spending cuts.</p>

The Refugee Council criticized the government's plan to expand the use of military sites to house asylum seekers, advocating for faster processing and community housing instead.</p>
