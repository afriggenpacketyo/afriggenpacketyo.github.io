          <p>A Harvard graduate student expressed concerns about the uncertainty surrounding international students due to the Trump administration's efforts to restrict their enrollment. A federal judge blocked the administration's attempts to prevent Harvard from enrolling international students, providing a temporary victory. The Secretary of State announced officials would begin to revoke visas of some Chinese students, sparking fresh concerns. International students comprise a significant portion of Harvard's student body, and their removal would impact the university's diversity and international influence.</p>
