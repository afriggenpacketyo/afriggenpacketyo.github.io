          <p>A federal judge in Boston issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration's ban on Harvard University enrolling international students, following a lawsuit by the university. The lawsuit was filed after the Department of Homeland Security revoked Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students under the F-1 visa program, citing alleged tolerance of "anti-American, pro-terrorist agitators." Judge Allison Burroughs stated that Harvard demonstrated it would suffer immediate and irreparable injury if the ban were not halted, affecting over 7,000 current visa holders, including Princess Elisabeth of Belgium. The lawsuit argues the ban is a violation of the First Amendment and Due Process Clause, retaliating against Harvard for rejecting government control over its governance and curriculum.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields retreated from recent highs as President Trump escalated trade tensions by proposing a 50% tariff on the European Union and a 25% tariff on iPhones manufactured outside the U.S. These announcements triggered a sell-off in the stock market, prompting investors to seek safety in bonds. Peter Boockvar of Bleakley Financial Group noted that capitalism functions best when left alone, free from top-down interventions. This week's bond market volatility was initially driven by concerns over Trump's budget bill and Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating due to the growing budget deficit.</p>

He praised Tom Cruise's dedication to performing his own stunts and noted that the film serves as the culmination of previous films in the series.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced his recommendation for a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union, effective June 1, citing stalled trade negotiations. This announcement followed a threat to impose a 25% tariff on Apple's iPhones if manufacturing is not moved to the United States, causing immediate market declines. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested this move aimed to prompt the EU to offer better trade proposals, while the White House downplayed the market's reaction. The announcement has intensified pressure on the EU ahead of trade discussions between U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and European Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has extended the block on the Trump administration's plans to sharply reduce jobs and reorganize major federal agencies under the so-called DOGE effort, an initiative backed by Elon Musk. The preliminary injunction halts further reductions in force and reorganization of the executive branch for the duration of the lawsuit. Judge Susan Illston emphasized that while presidents can set policy priorities, Congress is responsible for creating and funding federal agencies, and agencies cannot disregard Congressional mandates through large-scale reorganizations.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-23 11:46:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House Republican tax bill, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," does not include an extension of the enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) premium tax credits, which are set to expire at the end of the year. This omission is significant as the bill proposes other changes to the ACA marketplace. Without the extension, nearly all subsidized ACA enrollees can expect their monthly premiums to increase, potentially making health insurance less affordable. For example, a family of four making $85,000 could face an additional $313 in premiums for coverage in 2026 and a $900 increase in their out-of-pocket maximum.</p>

          <p>Two 16-year-old teenagers have pleaded guilty to the murder of 14-year-old Kelyan Bokassa, who was stabbed 27 times with machetes on a bus in Woolwich, south-east London. The attack occurred on January 7, and both defendants also admitted to carrying a bladed weapon. The court heard that the youths knew in advance that Kelyan was likely to be on the bus when they boarded. Judge Mark Lucraft KC has ordered reports ahead of sentencing, which is scheduled for July 25.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to impose a 25% tariff on Apple unless the company shifts iPhone manufacturing to the United States, disapproving of the company's move to expand production in India. Analysts, however, deem a U.S.-bound relocation of Apple's supply chain highly unlikely due to the time, expense, and higher labor costs involved. Despite Trump's efforts to incentivize domestic manufacturing, experts suggest that even final assembly in the U.S. would take years and significantly increase prices for consumers, potentially driving them to cheaper alternatives.</p>

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet found that contrast-enhanced mammography can detect three times as many invasive cancers in dense breast tissue compared to ultrasound. The study also indicated that contrast-enhanced mammography is nearly as effective as MRI, which is more expensive, in finding tumors. The scans were administered to women with dense breast tissue who had already undergone mammograms that showed no abnormalities. Despite its effectiveness, contrast-enhanced mammography is not yet widely used for screening in the United States, pending FDA approval.</p>
