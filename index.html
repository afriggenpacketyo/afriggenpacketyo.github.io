          <p>The FDA approved the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, Nuvaxovid, but restricted its use to older adults and those with medical conditions placing them at high risk. This decision requires Novavax to conduct further studies on potential heart-related risks, potentially costing the company millions. Experts express concern that these restrictions limit access for healthy individuals under 65 and reflect skepticism toward vaccines from certain health officials. The decision also marks the first time the FDA has included health criteria for COVID shots, typically determined by the CDC. </p>
