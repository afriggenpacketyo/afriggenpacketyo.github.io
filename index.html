            <p>President Trump has intensified his criticism of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, labeling him a "major loser" and warning of economic slowdown if interest rates aren't immediately lowered. Trump insists there's virtually no inflation and blames Powell for being too late to act. Experts warn that any attempt to fire Powell could trigger a severe market sell-off, raising concerns about the Fed's independence and potentially hindering its ability to cut rates. The situation highlights the ongoing tension between the executive branch and the central bank regarding monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Four House Democrats traveled to El Salvador to pressure the Trump administration to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an illegal immigrant and suspected MS-13 gang member deported due to an "administrative error."

Trump defends the deportation, calling Garcia a violent criminal and accusing Democrats of protecting criminals. The Justice Department released documents detailing domestic violence allegations against Garcia.

A weakening US dollar, influenced by new US policies, is creating an opportunity for the yuan's internationalization. Survey data shows a rising percentage of enterprises planning to increase yuan settlements. Some analysts suggest the US Treasury market's volatility is a watershed event, with global capital not flowing to the US as it has in the past due to global tariff plans.</p>
