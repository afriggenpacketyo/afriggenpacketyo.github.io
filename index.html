          <p>Paramount Global has agreed to a $16 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit filed by Donald Trump concerning a "60 Minutes" interview with Kamala Harris. The funds will be directed to Trump's future presidential library, with no direct payment to Trump or his co-plaintiff. As part of the agreement, "60 Minutes" will release transcripts of future interviews with presidential candidates, though the settlement includes no apology from the network. The lawsuit, widely seen by legal experts as an attack on the First Amendment, was settled despite Paramount's insistence that it was without merit.</p>

          <p>At least 180 current and former UK armed forces aircrew are taking legal action against the Ministry of Defence, claiming their cancer diagnoses resulted from exposure to toxic fumes in military helicopters. The claims involve aircraft like the Sea King and Chinook, with diagnoses including rare blood, lung, and throat cancers. Although the MoD has reached out-of-court settlements in at least six cases without admitting liability, it maintains that engine emissions pose no health risk.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent G7 deal, which exempts U.S. companies from the globally agreed-upon Pillar Two minimum tax framework, is facing sharp criticism for prioritizing corporate interests over global equity. This decision allows American multinationals to continue leveraging low-tax jurisdictions, creating an uneven playing field and undermining the international effort to curb harmful tax competition. Critics argue the move weakens the modest 15% global minimum tax, which was already seen as a compromise, and contradicts broader goals for progressive tax reform. The authors contend this action deepens inequity in global tax governance and calls for its rejection. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that Alabama prosecutors violated the constitutional rights of Michael Sockwell, a Black man sentenced to death in 1990, by systematically excluding Black individuals from his jury. The 2-1 decision noted a clear pattern of discriminatory intent, as prosecutors rejected 80% of eligible Black jurors. This ruling makes Sockwell, convicted of a 1988 murder, eligible for a retrial. The original trial was controversial, as the judge overrode the jury's 7-5 recommendation for a life sentence, a practice now banned in the state.</p>

          <p>Authoritarianism expert Ruth Ben-Ghiat has described President Donald Trump's recent rhetoric as "chilling," after he suggested deporting U.S.-born citizens who commit certain crimes. During a visit to a migrant detention facility, Trump stated that even those "born in our country" should be removed, echoing previous comments about "homegrowns" being next for deportation. This represents a significant escalation in his immigration stance, as it proposes stripping nationality from natural-born citizens. The comments follow reports of the Justice Department prioritizing efforts to revoke the status of naturalized citizens who commit crimes.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the office of Republican Rep. Young Kim to voice their opposition to President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which proposes over $1 trillion in cuts to federal programs like Medicaid. The demonstration, organized by groups including the California Nurses Assn., highlighted the potential harm to vulnerable populations, including children and the elderly. Protesters urged Kim, who could be a crucial vote, to oppose the legislation, which narrowly passed the Senate and now heads to the House. Kim's district has a significant number of constituents who rely on Medicaid services.</p>

Instead, the company may focus its resources on the next-generation "14A" process to better compete with rivals like TSMC for major clients such as Apple and Nvidia.
