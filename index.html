          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, has returned to Massachusetts after being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for six weeks. A federal judge ordered her release after determining that her due process and First Amendment rights were potentially violated, as the Trump administration appeared to base her detainment on an op-ed she co-authored criticizing Israel's war with Hamas. Ozturk, who experienced worsening asthma attacks during her detention, expressed gratitude for the support she received and urged people not to forget other women in immigration detention centers. Massachusetts lawmakers and Tufts University officials celebrated her release and looked forward to welcoming her back to campus.</p>

          <p>Starbucks and Luckin Coffee are experiencing renewed growth in China by expanding into lower-tier cities, where they are attracting new customers despite intense price competition. Starbucks' China operations saw flat same-store sales, but a 4% increase in transactions offset a decline in average spending. The company has added 665 stores in China over the past year, covering more than 1,000 county-level markets. This shift towards smaller cities reflects a broader trend of coffee shop growth in second and "new first-tier cities" across China, indicating a strategic adaptation to changing consumer preferences and market dynamics.</p>

          <p>As global trade tensions rise, Chinese consumers are increasingly choosing domestic brands as a way to express national pride and support local innovation. This shift is driven by a desire to strengthen China's internal economy and celebrate its cultural identity on the global stage. Younger generations, in particular, view domestic brands as markers of creative ambition and resilience. This trend underscores a broader transition towards a consumption-driven economy that is less reliant on exports and more focused on fostering domestic growth and cultural confidence.</p>

          <p>An atmospheric river event is forecast to bring widespread rainfall to the Southeastern United States, potentially resulting in 4 to 6 inches of rain and isolated spots seeing up to 12 inches. The National Weather Service has warned of possible flooding, particularly in Florida, Tennessee, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. While atmospheric rivers typically originate from the Gulf of Mexico or the Caribbean and land in the Western U.S., this event is being diverted eastward due to a "cutoff low," potentially alleviating drought conditions in certain areas while also posing a flooding risk.</p>

David Thornley claims 25 of his ewes lost their lambs after drinking from Diseworth Brook in 2022, which he believes was contaminated by airport chemicals. East Midlands International Airport Ltd pleaded guilty to exceeding environmental permit limits when releasing water containing chemicals in January and February 2022 but denies any link between the discharge and bacterial pollution in the brook.

          <p>Faced with the threat of new sanctions, President Vladimir V. Putin called for direct talks between Ukraine and Russia in the coming days. The leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Poland said that Russia would face "new and massive" sanctions if President Vladimir V. Putin refused to agree to a full, unconditional 30-day cease-fire. Mr. Putin proposed a meeting between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul on May 15, without specifying who would participate in the talks. He indicated Russia wouldn’t stop fighting before the negotiations on May 15, if they happen.</p>

The decision follows protests calling for the ban and an amendment to the country's International Crimes Tribunal Act, allowing authorities to prosecute political parties.</p>

          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials met in Switzerland for prolonged negotiations over tariffs, with President Trump claiming "great progress" and a "total reset." The talks, aimed at de-escalating trade tensions, involved Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng. Trump suggested lowering tariffs on China to 80%, while Chinese officials have called for the U.S. to drop its "unilateral" tariffs first. The outcome of these talks could significantly impact the global economy.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China concluded their first day of meetings in Geneva, setting up a second day of negotiations that could determine the fate of the global economy. The meetings are the first since President Trump ratcheted up tariffs on Chinese imports to 145 percent and China retaliated with its own levies of 125 percent on U.S. goods. While expectations for a breakthrough are low, the fact that Beijing and Washington are talking has raised hopes that the tension between them could be defused and that the tariffs could ultimately be lowered.</p>

          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka said his city would continue its fight in court against the company that runs an immigration detention facility in New Jersey, following his arrest on Tuesday. Baraka was arrested after joining three members of Congress at a protest outside the ICE facility, known as Delaney Hall. The Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told CNN that “there will be more arrests coming” after the protest at the facility. Newark sued Geo Group, saying that the company was renovating the facility without proper permits and that city inspectors had been barred from entering the center.</p>

The police in San Jose identified Mr. Sims’ thumbprint on the cigarette carton.

          <p>China's export restrictions on rare earth elements, essential for manufacturing military equipment, are causing anxiety in the US defense industry. These restrictions, effective since April, are a response to Trump's increased tariffs on Chinese goods. China, the world's largest producer of rare earths, dominates production capacity. Seven categories of medium and heavy rare earths were placed on an export control list, impacting the production of jet engines, radar, avionics, and other electronic systems.</p>
