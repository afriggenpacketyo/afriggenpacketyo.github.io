          <p>A rockslide in Banff National Park in the Canadian Rockies has resulted in the deaths of two hikers and serious injuries to three others. The incident occurred north of Lake Louise on the Icefields Parkway, prompting a response from approximately 100 personnel. One of the deceased has been identified as retired educator Jutta Hinrichs from the University of Alberta. Witnesses described seeing rocks tumbling before a large slab of the mountainside gave way, creating a cloud of dust and prompting a frantic evacuation. The hiking trail near Bow Glacier Falls remains closed as authorities assess the situation and emphasize the inherent risks of mountain areas.</p>

          <p>A hot air balloon accident in Praia Grande, Brazil, resulted in the deaths of at least eight people, with 13 survivors being hospitalized. According to the pilot, a fire erupted inside the balloon's basket, prompting him to attempt a controlled descent and instruct passengers to jump. However, the balloon unexpectedly ascended again due to the reduced weight before ultimately crashing. State Governor Jorginho Mello has ordered a task force to investigate the incident and provide support to the victims' families, while President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva expressed solidarity and offered federal assistance.</p>

          <p>French scientists have identified a new blood type, dubbed "Gwada negative," in a woman from Guadeloupe. The discovery, made by the French Blood Establishment (EFS), marks the 48th blood group system recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusion. The unusual antibody was initially detected in 2011, but the genetic mutation was only identified in 2019 through high-throughput DNA sequencing. The woman, now 54, is believed to be the only known carrier of this blood type, inherited from both her parents, and scientists hope to find others with the same rare blood group to improve care for patients with rare blood types.</p>

          <p>Lemon water is a popular beverage, but its health benefits are often exaggerated on social media. While it won't "detox" your body or cause weight loss, it can be a refreshing way to stay hydrated. Lemon water contains a small amount of vitamin C and antioxidants and can be part of a soothing morning routine. However, it's important to be mindful of its acidity, which can weaken tooth enamel, and it may irritate those prone to heartburn.</p>
