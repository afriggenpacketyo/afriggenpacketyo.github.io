        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has agreed to hear an appeal from Chevron, Exxon, and other oil and gas companies concerning lawsuits seeking compensation for coastal land loss and environmental degradation in Louisiana. The companies argue that because their oil production and refining activities began during World War II as federal contractors, the cases should be heard in federal court, which they perceive as more business-friendly. Plaintiffs, representing Plaquemines and Jefferson Parish governments, view the appeal as a delay tactic to avoid accountability for violating state environmental laws. Louisiana has lost over 2,000 square miles of land in the past century, partly due to oil and gas infrastructure, and could lose another 3,000 in the coming decades. </p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have unveiled their version of President Trump's tax bill, addressing contentious issues such as Medicaid funding and the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. The Senate proposes steeper cuts to Medicaid by lowering provider taxes and permanently extending the $10,000 SALT deduction. These proposals differ significantly from the House bill, leading to potential conflicts and threatening the bill's passage by the July 4th deadline. The Senate version also includes provisions to end taxes on tips, overtime, and auto loan interest, while making tax cuts enacted during Mr. Trump's first term permanent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's approach to the Israel-Iran conflict has been ambiguous, oscillating between supporting Israel and distancing himself. This uncertainty complicates the situation as the conflict escalates, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claiming attacks were "fully coordinated" with the U.S. Trump faces three main options: escalating military involvement under pressure from Netanyahu, maintaining the current course of limited involvement, or pulling back due to domestic concerns within his Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement. Each path carries significant risks and potential consequences for Trump's legacy and domestic support.</p>

The lawsuit targets orders that cut off security clearances, contracts, and federal building access for firms based on pro bono work or diversity practices. The ABA argues that these actions coerce lawyers to abandon clients and causes, violating the First Amendment. The White House maintains the President's discretion over contracts and security clearances, while the ABA claims the administration's actions have had a chilling effect on pro bono representation.</p>

          <p>Vance Boelter, charged in the shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses, also visited the homes of other elected officials, according to the FBI. After shooting Senator John Hoffman and his wife, Boelter went to a state representative's home, but she was on vacation. He then went to a state senator's home, where a police officer encountered his vehicle before he fled. Boelter then proceeded to the home of Representative Melissa Hortman, where he fatally shot her and her husband. The FBI alleges Boelter stalked his targets and carefully planned his attacks, researching the victims and their families.</p>

          <p>A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) official, Dr. Fiona Havers, has resigned in protest following Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

The court will also rule on a Texas law targeting children's access to pornography and a challenge to the Affordable Care Act's preventive care measures.</p>

The lawsuit claims State Farm misled homeowners and deliberately set replacement costs far lower than actual costs. This marks the second time L.A. fire victims have sued insurers over underinsurance, following a similar lawsuit against USAA and AAA affiliates. State Farm has received over 12,800 claims related to the fires and has paid over $4.03 billion to California customers.</p>

          <p>The recent feud between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk has solidified China's perception of Trump as an erratic and unreliable politician. This fallout may complicate negotiations between China and the U.S., adding a layer of caution as Beijing considers a summit between its leader and Trump. Observers suggest China may remain guarded and cautious when dealing with Trump, given his transactional approach and perceived tendency to backtrack on his word.

Key events include escalating immigration raids, a shakeup of the CDC's vaccine advisory panel, military deployments in Los Angeles, and ongoing tensions with Iran. The author notes that these events are reminiscent of Trump's first term, when such chaotic news cycles led to declining approval ratings and electoral losses. The author concludes that voters still disapprove of Trump's actions and policies.</p>

          <p>Colombian presidential candidate Miguel Uribe is in "extremely critical" condition after being shot in the head while campaigning in Bogota.

Doctors reported that his condition worsened after an emergency operation, with persistent cerebral edema and intercerebral bleeding. The shooting has raised fears of a return to political violence reminiscent of the 1980s and 1990s in Colombia.</p>

          <p>Shakira spoke about the experiences of immigrants in the United States, highlighting the "constant fear" they face amid ongoing Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids.

She also mentioned the need to remain united and ensure humane treatment for all people, regardless of immigration policies. Her remarks follow similar expressions of solidarity from other Latin American music artists.</p>
