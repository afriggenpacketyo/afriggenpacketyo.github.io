          <h2>Stuart Broad Assesses Australia's Ashes Squad as Weakest Since 2010</h2>

          <p>Former England bowler Stuart Broad has assessed Australia's Ashes team as their weakest since 2010, the last time England triumphed down under. This commentary directly challenges ex-Australia batter David Warner's prediction of a 4-0 series victory for Australia. Broad points to significant uncertainties within the Australian squad, notably the potential absence of captain Pat Cummins due to injury, and a less experienced bowling attack. He contrasts this with what he believes is England's strongest team in over a decade, suggesting a prime opportunity for Ben Stokes' side to reclaim the urn. The article emphasizes that while winning in Australia is inherently difficult, current circumstances align favorably for England, setting the stage for a compelling series.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The global shipping industry is bracing for significant disruption as China and the United States implement rival port fees, targeting each other's vessels and associated entities. China's new policy specifically affects US-built, flagged, owned, or operated ships, and those with substantial US financial ties, extending its reach to third-country vessels connected to US individuals or businesses. This is expected to heavily impact energy and grain tankers, along with dry bulk carriers, potentially raising costs for US agricultural exports. Meanwhile, US port fees are more likely to affect container cargo shipping. Analysts from HSBC Global note that these measures could increase volatility in shipping rates over the short term, prompting cargo owners and carriers to rethink deployments and impacting major iron ore traders with US investment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major real estate developers are rapidly transforming into power brokers, driven by the surging demand for data, which is creating new commercial real estate sectors like "quantum real estate" and "powered land." Powered land refers to sites prepared with permits, utility commitments, and infrastructure for data centers, with an estimated 40,000 acres needed globally in the next five years. Companies like Hines are pivoting to secure power and entitlements for hyperscale sites, recognizing power rights as a scarce and valuable investable asset class. This shift highlights that the challenge is no longer just building structures but securing megawatts, making AI infrastructure the "new oil" and reshaping the real estate business for decades to come.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has imposed sweeping restrictions on rare earth exports, specifically denying licenses for materials used by foreign militaries, directly threatening the US defense industry. This move provides significant leverage for Beijing in upcoming trade talks with President Donald Trump, as rare earth magnets are crucial components in advanced US weapons systems. China dominates the global supply chain, controlling 60% of mining and over 90% of refining, making the US highly dependent. The restrictions also impact the semiconductor and electric vehicle industries. The article notes that this has accelerated US efforts to develop a domestic supply chain and has led to a volatile market response, with Trump threatening 100% tariffs.</p>

The changes include updated styling, a forthcoming extended-range electric powertrain (EREV), and a simplified, less expensive model lineup under the single "Grand Wagoneer" name, eliminating the standalone "Wagoneer." This move addresses past issues like confusing dual nameplates and high initial pricing that hindered sales expectations. Jeep CEO Bob Broderdorf stated the new Grand Wagoneer will start under $65,000, aiming to gain market share and drive the brand's first year-over-year sales gain since 2018.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump declared the Israel-Hamas war over following the historic release of remaining Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, presenting his 20-point peace plan as a new era of harmony. However, Middle East experts caution that the most difficult work to achieve lasting peace is just beginning, despite the initial success of the hostage exchange. Agreements are still needed on critical issues like the total withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, Hamas ceding control, and establishing an international trusteeship for Gaza's governance. The article highlights that early violations of the ceasefire underscore the fragility of the agreement and the complex challenges ahead.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts the UK will be the second-fastest growing G7 economy this year, with modest growth rates of 1.3% for both this year and next, surpassing most other G7 nations except the US in 2025. This slight upgrade from previous forecasts is attributed to strong activity in early 2025 and an improved trade outlook, partly due to a new US-UK trade deal. However, the article also notes the IMF forecasts UK inflation to be the highest in the G7 in 2025 and 2026, driven by energy and utility bills, though it expects inflation to be temporary and fall to 2% by the end of next year. The global outlook is dominated by US tariffs, a weakened dollar, and potential risks from an AI tech boom, which could rival the dot-com crash in severity.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has declined to hear a case against Grindr, an online dating platform, regarding its liability for sexual assault by users matched on the app. The case involved a 15-year-old boy who was sexually assaulted by men he met through Grindr, alleging the app was defective and marketed to children. This decision means the high court passed on an opportunity to re-evaluate the broad immunity provided by Section 230, which protects online companies from liability for third-party content. Critics argue that courts have interpreted Section 230 too broadly, allowing platforms to avoid accountability for harm, despite warnings from some justices about its expansive application.</p>

While JPMorgan avoided losses from First Brands, it incurred $170 million in chargeoffs from Tricolor, prompting internal review and underscoring the hidden risks in financing private companies.

Only 2% of Gen Z align with their bosses' priorities, leading to frustration for both employers and young job seekers, especially with AI threatening entry-level jobs. Suzy Welch, an NYU Stern professor, advises Gen Z to be honest about their financial needs to make sustainable career choices. While not advocating for changing core values, she suggests that if landing a job is urgent and affluence is a long-range goal, Gen Z might consider embracing "Boomer values" like delayed gratification and work-centrism for a committed period, like a decade.</p>

          <p>As Disney approaches the announcement of Bob Iger's successor, a co-CEO structure is being considered, potentially featuring internal candidates Dana Walden and Josh D'Amaro. While rival Netflix has successfully implemented this model, company insiders and corporate governance experts warn it may be unwise for Disney due to its unique circumstances. Concerns include Iger's reputation for wanting to remain the top leader, the company's past struggles with blurred control during Bob Chapek's tenure, and Disney's famously political corporate culture. The article suggests that despite the appeal of retaining top talent, a dual leadership setup could foster instability and backbiting rather than a unified vision.</p>

          <p>Madagascar's National Assembly has voted to impeach President Andry Rajoelina, who fled the country amid escalating Gen Z-led protests and widespread military defections. The impeachment vote, passed hours after Rajoelina attempted to dissolve the assembly, deepens the nation's political crisis. Despite his flight on a French military jet, Rajoelina refuses to step down, claiming he moved to a safe place due to threats. The protests, initially sparked by water and power shortages, evolved into an uprising against corruption and bad governance, with the military's elite unit, CAPSAT, joining demonstrators and appointing a new army chief.</p>

Obama argues that Proposition 50 will level the electoral playing field and preserve independent redistricting.
