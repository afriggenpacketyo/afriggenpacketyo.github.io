          <p>A national service at St Paul's Cathedral marked the 20th anniversary of the 7/7 London bombings, solemnly honoring the 52 individuals who lost their lives. During the ceremony, family members and survivors read the names of the victims while thousands of white petals were released from the cathedral's dome. The event was attended by members of the Royal Family, the prime minister, and emergency services personnel who responded to the 2005 attacks on three underground trains and a bus. Additional memorials and moments of silence were observed at the four bombing sites, with leaders reaffirming a message of unity against hatred and division.</p>

          <p>In a trial at Liverpool Crown Court, jurors were shown CCTV footage of an alleged assault on three police officers at Manchester Airport by two brothers. The incident occurred in July of the previous year after police responded to a disturbance at a Starbucks. The prosecution claims the defendants, Mohammed Fahir Amaaz and Muhammad Amaad, used a high level of violence, throwing numerous punches and injuring the officers who were attempting an arrest in the terminal's car park. One officer testified that the blows were the hardest he had ever felt in his life, and noted that bystanders recorded the event on their phones instead of helping.</p>

          <h2>Study Reveals 65% Rise in Handgun Possession Among Florida Teenagers Over Two Decades</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 13:03:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the journal Pediatrics reveals a significant increase in handgun possession among Florida's teenagers over the last two decades. The research, which analyzed survey data from over 700,000 students, found that general handgun carrying among adolescents rose by 65% between 2002 and 2022. This increase was most substantial among female students, middle schoolers, and white adolescents. Despite the overall rise in possession, the study surprisingly found that the rate of carrying handguns within school premises actually decreased by 60% during the same period, a trend researchers suggest may be linked to enhanced school security measures.</p>

          <p>A man armed with a rifle and wearing tactical gear was shot and killed by law enforcement after he opened fire at a U.S. Border Patrol facility in McAllen, Texas. The suspect, identified as 27-year-old Ryan Lewis Mosqueda from Michigan, fired dozens of rounds at the building's entrance, injuring two police officers and a Border Patrol employee before agents returned fire. Officials stated that Mosqueda had been reported missing from a nearby town just hours before the attack. The FBI has taken over the investigation, and authorities have not yet determined a motive for the shooting, though additional weapons were found in the suspect's vehicle.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed microscopic robots capable of treating sinus infections by directly targeting and eliminating bacteria within the nasal cavity. These dust-sized micro-robots, made of magnetic particles and copper atoms, are guided by magnets to the infection site. Once in position, a fiber optic light heats the particles, enabling them to break through mucus and destroy the bacteria, offering a precise, drug-free alternative to traditional antibiotics. While animal trials in pigs and rabbits have been successful and shown no tissue damage, further research is needed to ensure the technology's safety and efficacy for human use, which could help combat antibiotic resistance.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will begin sending letters to foreign countries on Monday, notifying them of tariff increases if satisfactory trade deals are not reached. This action follows the expiration of a 90-day pause on country-specific levies that President Trump had previously announced. Trade experts suggest that these reciprocal tariffs function like a membership fee for access to the U.S. market, with rates determined by the administration based on negotiations. Countries that have not engaged in what the administration considers good-faith talks are expected to receive notices of higher tariff rates, which are anticipated to take effect on August 1.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the United States will implement a 25% blanket tariff on all goods imported from Japan and South Korea, effective August 1. The announcement was made via social media, where the President shared letters sent to the leaders of both nations, citing persistent U.S. trade deficits as the reason for the new duties. These tariffs are separate from any additional sector-specific duties and include measures to prevent transshipping, where goods are rerouted through other countries to evade higher rates. The news prompted a downturn in U.S. financial markets, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling by 1%.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly criticized Elon Musk for establishing a new political party, called the "American Party," labeling the tech billionaire as having gone "off the rails." The move by Musk follows a public falling out with Trump over economic policy, particularly the president's tax and spending plans. In a social media post, Trump expressed that he was saddened by Musk's actions and stated that third parties only create disruption and chaos. This conflict marks a significant turn in the relationship between the two, as Musk had previously been a major financial backer of Trump's campaign and was appointed to a government efficiency role.</p>

          <p>Planned Parenthood has filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration to challenge a provision in a new domestic policy bill that eliminates funding for its health centers. The organization argues that the measure is unconstitutional and is specifically designed to prevent its nearly 600 centers from receiving Medicaid reimbursements. In its complaint, Planned Parenthood stated that this defunding would have catastrophic consequences for the more than one million patients who rely on its services annually through Medicaid. The lawsuit asserts that the provision is a politically motivated attack aimed at punishing the organization for its role in the public debate surrounding abortion.</p>

          <p>A CNBC analysis, drawing on insights from top economists and former officials, explores the severe risks associated with the rising U.S. budget deficit, which now exceeds 6% of GDP. The report highlights three potential areas of fallout: market instability, economic strain, and weakened international standing. Prominent investors are on high alert for a potential crisis, while sustained deficits threaten to fuel inflation, raise interest rates, and crowd out private investment, ultimately burdening future generations. Experts warn that the U.S. has a limited window, possibly less than 20 years, to correct its fiscal course before facing the risk of default. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A mass shooting in Philadelphia's Grays Ferry neighborhood resulted in the deaths of three people and left nine others injured early Monday morning. Police Commissioner Kevin Bethel stated that the incident occurred just before 1 a.m. and that dozens of shell casings were recovered from the scene, suggesting a possible exchange of gunfire. The victims, including two injured juveniles who are expected to survive, were transported to several area hospitals. Police had been monitoring the block over the weekend due to prior disturbances and made one arrest in connection with the shooting, though the individual's role remains unclear.</p>

          <p>White House trade advisor Peter Navarro has criticized Apple CEO Tim Cook, stating the company is not moving its manufacturing operations out of China quickly enough. Navarro's comments reflect the Trump administration's ongoing pressure on Apple to relocate production, particularly of the iPhone, to the U.S. or other countries to avoid tariffs. President Trump has recently intensified these demands, warning of significant tariffs on iPhones made outside the U.S. and expressing a preference against production in India. Navarro argued that with modern manufacturing techniques, it is inconceivable for Apple not to shift its production away from China more rapidly.</p>

Mulder finished with 367 not out, opting to prioritize his team's strategic advantage over breaking the record of 400 set by West Indies legend Brian Lara in 2004. He stated that the decision was made both for the team and out of respect for Lara, believing that such a special record should remain with a player of his stature.

The Center for Asbestos Related Disease (CARD) was forced to close in May after BNSF Railway won a lawsuit against it and seized its assets to collect a $2.9 million judgment. Compounding the crisis, the clinic's primary federal grant, which covers 80% of its operating costs, is at risk of being cut by the Trump administration.

          <p>An exhaustive review by the Department of Justice and the FBI has officially confirmed that financier Jeffrey Epstein's 2019 death in federal custody was a suicide, contradicting widespread conspiracy theories. The review also concluded that there is no evidence of a secret "client list" for potential blackmail, and no further charges are expected against third parties. To enhance transparency, the DOJ released security footage showing no one entered Epstein's cell area around the time of his death. The memo stated the investigation found a large volume of child sexual abuse material but no evidence to predicate new investigations into uncharged individuals.</p>
