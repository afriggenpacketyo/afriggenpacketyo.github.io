        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>DeKalb County, Alabama, saw significant improvement in elementary school math scores, exceeding pre-pandemic levels.  This success is attributed to a combination of factors, including early return to in-person learning, a revised curriculum emphasizing hands-on learning with manipulatives, and strong teacher support through coaching and data-driven instruction.  The state's Alabama Numeracy Act further supports these efforts.</p>

          <p>Wholesale egg prices are declining due to a lack of major bird flu outbreaks, signaling potential relief for consumers.  However, the impact on grocery store prices may be delayed due to retailer inventory and concerns about future outbreaks.
