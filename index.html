        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Conservative party has announced a new immigration plan aimed at removing 750,000 migrants over five years. The proposal includes banning asylum claims from those who enter the country illegally and replacing judicial appeals with an internal Home Office process. The plan, which draws comparisons to Trump-era US policies, involves creating a strengthened "Removals Force" and potentially leaving the European Convention on Human Rights to expedite deportations. Party leader Kemi Badenoch defended the policy, stating that returnees would be sent to their country of origin or a safe third country.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett stated that federal employee layoffs could occur if President Trump determines that shutdown negotiations with Congress have stalled completely. The government shutdown, now in its fifth day, continues as Democrats insist on including an extension of healthcare tax credits in any funding bill, a demand Republicans want to postpone. Hassett expressed hope that Democrats would become more "reasonable" when they return, thereby avoiding the need for layoffs. The administration is reportedly preparing for this contingency while hoping for a resolution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an interview, Senator Tammy Duckworth condemned the Trump administration's plan to deploy National Guardsmen to Chicago against the governor's wishes, calling it a misuse of the force. She accused the administration of lying about the nature of protests and the actions of ICE agents, whom she described as using "Gestapo tactics" by aggressively targeting families and children. Duckworth urged protesters to remain peaceful and to videotape all interactions with federal agents for evidence, asserting there is no proof of the "left-wing terrorism" that the administration claims to be fighting. She also criticized the Secretary of War's new gender-neutral physical standards for the military.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Peacehaven, East Sussex, have released images of two suspects in a suspected arson attack on a local mosque. The incident, which occurred on a Saturday night, resulted in damage to the building's entrance and a vehicle, though no one was injured. Sussex Police are treating the attack as a hate crime and an act of arson with intent to endanger life, as two people were inside the mosque at the time but managed to escape. The event has prompted an increased police presence at places of worship across the county, coming shortly after a deadly attack outside a synagogue in Manchester.</p>

Speaking at her party's conference, she contrasted her deliberate policy-making with what she called rushed announcements from Labour and Reform UK. Badenoch also detailed her plan to remove 750,000 illegal migrants, dismissing questions about their destinations as "irrelevant" and emphasizing that they should not be in the UK.

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to give police forces new powers to impose conditions on repeated protests, allowing them to consider the "cumulative impact" on communities. This move, which could involve relocating demonstrations, follows the arrest of nearly 500 protesters supporting the banned group Palestine Action. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated the goal is to balance the right to protest with residents' freedom from fear and intimidation, particularly acknowledging recent anxieties within the Jewish community. Critics, including the Liberal Democrats and Amnesty International, argue the new powers undermine free speech without addressing the root causes of hate.</p>

          <p>Hungary's governing Fidesz party, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orban, has become a record-level spender on social media political advertising within the EU, far surpassing spending in larger nations like Poland and Czechia. This strategy is a cornerstone of Fidesz's communication, with the party and its affiliates accounting for 87% of all political ad spending in Hungary this year. As platforms like Facebook and Google implement bans on political ads, Fidesz is pivoting to a network of "digital freedom fighters" to spread its message online. This shift comes as Orban's party faces a growing challenge from opposition figure Peter Magyar, who has built a strong following through grassroots, in-person campaigning.</p>

The proposed 20-point plan includes an immediate halt to fighting and the exchange of 48 hostages for hundreds of detained Palestinians. Hamas has unexpectedly agreed to enter talks without preconditions, a move attributed to pressure from Qatari, Egyptian, and Turkish mediators. However, a map of proposed Israeli withdrawal lines, published by President Trump, would initially prevent nearly 900,000 Palestinians from returning to their homes, a point of contention in previous negotiations.</p>

          <p>Author and researcher Brené Brown suggests that people struggle with communication because it requires vulnerability and a "tolerance for discomfort." In a recent podcast interview, she explained that good communication involves being clear, using precise language, and taking accountability when conflicts arise, skills that are rarely taught. Brown emphasized that tone is often lost in text messages and that honest, direct conversations are crucial in both personal and professional settings. To navigate difficult conversations, experts recommend phrases that show you are listening, validate the other person's feelings, and express a desire to understand their perspective.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Priscilla formed off the western coast of Mexico and was forecast to strengthen into a hurricane as it moves parallel to the shore. The National Hurricane Center issued tropical storm watches for a large portion of the Mexican coast, from Jalisco to the Baja California peninsula. While the storm's center is expected to remain offshore, it is projected to bring dangerous surf, strong winds, and heavy rainfall to coastal areas through the early part of the week. Forecasters warned of potential flash flooding, with some regions expected to receive up to eight inches of rain.</p>

          <p>The Philadelphia Union secured Major League Soccer's Supporters' Shield, awarded for the best regular-season record, after a 1-0 victory against New York City FC. A 40th-minute goal from Danish striker Mikael Uhre was enough to seal the win and guarantee the Union the top seed heading into the postseason playoffs. The achievement marks a significant turnaround for the team under coach Bradley Carnell, who took charge in January after the team failed to make the playoffs last season. Elsewhere, Lionel Messi provided three assists as Inter Miami defeated the New England Revolution 4-1.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has identified the Wayne National Forest, Ohio's sole national forest, as a site for increased lumber production, raising concerns about its potential destruction. An executive order targeting 100 million acres of forest nationwide was followed by a memo establishing an "emergency declaration" for the Wayne forest, which could remove environmental protections. Local environmental groups warn that large-scale logging could release pollutants from old coal mines into waterways, threaten endangered species, and increase flood risks. While supporters cite economic benefits for the rural Appalachian region, conservationists question the need to log public lands.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a rare show of unity, Democrats have embraced the political risks of a government shutdown to counter the Trump administration, primarily by focusing on healthcare priorities. Activists and party leaders are framing the standoff as a necessary fight to protect the Affordable Care Act and prevent millions from losing insurance. Polling suggests the public is more inclined to blame Republicans for the shutdown, and progressive groups are praising congressional leadership for "holding the line." Strategists believe focusing on a popular issue like healthcare is good policy and politics, potentially rebuilding trust with a disillusioned base ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Air Force is testing AI-piloted drones, such as the XQ-58, to operate alongside human pilots in a program designed to revolutionize air combat. At Eglin Air Force Base, AI systems are learning basic flight and combat maneuvers, with the goal of handling large amounts of data and making real-time decisions faster than a human can. This shift is seen as a necessary response to the growing capabilities of China's air force, with plans to have up to 1,000 AI-piloted aircraft eventually. While a human will remain in control of lethal decisions for now, officials acknowledge pressure may grow to give the machines more autonomy.</p>

          <p>The massive electricity requirements of AI and data centers are driving a revival of nuclear energy, including the development of small modular reactors (SMRs). In Michigan, the decommissioned Palisades Nuclear Plant is being brought back online with federal support and will also host the nation's first SMRs. Tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and Bill Gates' TerraPower are investing heavily in nuclear energy to power their operations. While public perception of nuclear power is improving, experts note that challenges remain, including high costs, regulatory hurdles, and the unproven nature of SMRs at a commercial scale.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to psychologist Mark Travers, the most common source of conflict for couples is not money or sex, but rather their tone of voice. He explains that nonverbal cues carry more emotional weight than the actual words used, and a sharp, flat, or sarcastic tone can turn a simple question into an accusation. To prevent escalation, he advises individuals to catch and correct their own harsh tone by pausing and rephrasing. If on the receiving end, he suggests calmly asking your partner to say it differently, thereby interrupting the cycle of defensiveness without escalating the argument.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement tactics have created widespread fear in communities and led to violent confrontations and legal battles. In Los Angeles, a raid on a clothing wholesaler that led to the arrest of 13 church parishioners prompted the local pastor to temporarily close his church out of fear for his congregation's safety. An attorney who resigned from ICE's legal department stated that the agency is now lumping people with no criminal history in with the "worst of the worst" to meet goals. The most recent data shows that individuals with no criminal record now constitute the majority of those being arrested and detained by ICE.</p>

          <p>Under new leader Zack Polanski, the Green Party of England and Wales is shifting its strategy from that of "well-meaning eco-warriors" to a more insurgent and combative political force. Polanski has promised to "pick fights" to gain attention and cut through voter disillusionment, a style embraced by party leadership as necessary to combat rising right-wing populism. The party is targeting urban constituencies where traditional parties are losing support and is looking to emulate the simple messaging and emotional appeal of groups like Reform UK. This new, bolder approach aims to turn the party's recent momentum and record membership into electoral power.</p>
