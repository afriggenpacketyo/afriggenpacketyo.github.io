        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lapland, Finland, traditionally known for its cold climate, is experiencing an unprecedented heatwave with temperatures consistently around 30C, breaking records since 1961. This extreme weather is significantly impacting local wildlife, particularly reindeer, and puzzling tourists who expected cooler conditions. Scientists attribute the severity of the heatwave to the accelerating effects of climate change, which is warming the Arctic region at a rate four to five times faster than the rest of the Earth. The situation highlights urgent concerns about global warming's tangible and immediate consequences on vulnerable ecosystems and communities.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell publicly bickered over the cost of the Fed's $2.7 billion renovation project during Trump's first visit to the central bank in two decades. Trump claimed the cost was higher and questioned Powell's management, even suggesting he'd fire an over-budget project manager. This dispute unfolds amidst Trump's escalating pressure on Powell to lower interest rates, despite analysts warning against political interference in the Fed's independence. The exchange highlights ongoing tensions between the executive branch and the central bank's leadership.</p>

          <p>Tennessee state attorneys are appealing a judge's order to transport death row inmate Byron Black to a hospital to deactivate his heart-regulating implant on the morning of his execution. They argue the transfer would cause security chaos and that Black would not feel shocks even if triggered during lethal injection. Black's legal team insists deactivation is necessary immediately before the execution to prevent continuous shocks and allow for a potential reprieve. The case highlights complex ethical and logistical challenges surrounding capital punishment, especially concerning inmates with medical conditions.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer is under increasing pressure to immediately recognize Palestinian statehood, following France's commitment to do so and a call from a group of UK MPs. While Starmer reiterates that statehood is an 'inalienable right,' he maintains that recognition should occur at a moment of 'greatest impact' for a long-term resolution. This debate unfolds amidst warnings of mass starvation in Gaza, intensifying calls for a ceasefire and diplomatic action. The issue highlights a growing divergence in international approaches to the Israel-Palestinian conflict, with many European nations already formally recognizing Palestine.</p>

CEO Arthur Hoeld cited U.S. tariffs, muted brand momentum, and elevated inventory levels as key factors impacting performance.

          <p>President Trump's assertion that former President Barack Obama committed 'treason' by interfering in the 2016 election is drawing sharp criticism for undermining the presumption of innocence and the rule of law. This direct accusation, made without evidence, is seen as part of Trump's broader strategy of retribution against perceived enemies and a distraction from the unfolding Jeffrey Epstein scandal. Critics argue that such rhetoric, especially from a sitting president, normalizes the politicization of the justice system and erodes democratic norms, echoing historical precedents of show trials where guilt is declared before due process.</p>

Despite initial concerns, American arms transfers to Ukraine have largely continued, and a deal for NATO countries to purchase U.S. weaponry for Kyiv is underway. Trump's stated dislike for war and his desire to be a peacemaker, along with a perceived disillusionment with Putin, appear to be influencing his approach.

The experiment, involving a restaurant greeter robot, revealed that a neurotic bot, despite its tentative and anxious demeanor, was perceived as capable of understanding deep emotions. This challenges previous research, which primarily focused on extroversion for robot personalities in service roles. The findings suggest that incorporating more complex, even seemingly negative, personality traits could lead to more profound human-robot connections, though practical applications remain a question.</p>

          <p>Three miners have been successfully rescued after being trapped for two days underground in northern British Columbia's Red Chris mine following a collapse. The men, identified as Kevin Coumbs, Darien Maduke, and Jesse Chubaty, were found safe and in good spirits, having sheltered in an underground refuge chamber with access to food, water, and ventilation. Mine operator Newmont confirmed their rescue and stated that a full investigation into the incident will be carried out.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Climate change is increasing the frequency of sinkholes globally by intensifying extreme weather events, according to recent research. Sinkholes, depressions formed when water erodes soil, are particularly prevalent in 'karst terrain' regions with soluble bedrock. Droughts weaken subterranean support, and subsequent intense storms cause ground collapse, as seen in Turkey's Konya Plain. Experts like Hong Yang and Antonios E. Marsellos highlight that human activities like excessive groundwater pumping and air pollution exacerbate the risk. Prevention strategies include monitoring ground levels, regulating water use, and engineering solutions to stabilize vulnerable areas.</p>
