          <p>The Universal Postal Union, a UN agency, reports a significant disruption in global mail services to the United States. Following the Trump administration's decision to abolish a long-standing duty-free exemption for small packages, postal traffic has plummeted by over 80%. Many international postal operators, including those in major economies like Germany and Japan, have suspended shipments, citing insufficient time to implement new systems for collecting tariffs. The UPU is now working on a technical solution to resolve the operational chaos and resume the flow of mail.</p>

          <p>A 57-year-old surfer has died after being attacked by a large shark off a popular beach in Sydney, Australia. The man was surfing with friends when the incident occurred, resulting in significant injuries and substantial blood loss. Despite efforts by fellow surfers to bring him to shore and resuscitate him, he was pronounced dead at the scene. This marks Sydney's first fatal shark attack since 2022, a rare event that has prompted the temporary closure of nearby beaches for safety patrols.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of LGBTQ+ Catholics embarked on an official Holy Year pilgrimage in Rome, signaling a significant shift in their relationship with the Catholic Church. Participants celebrated a newfound sense of welcome, largely attributed to the inclusive tone set by the late Pope Francis. A high-ranking Italian bishop led a Mass for the pilgrims, emphasizing the Jubilee's historical purpose of restoring dignity to marginalized groups. This event stands in stark contrast to 25 years ago when a similar pilgrimage resulted in participants being detained, highlighting a major evolution in the church's approach.</p>

          <p>Buckingham Palace has announced that the funeral for Katharine, the Duchess of Kent, who died at age 92, will take place at Westminster Cathedral on September 16. As the Duchess was a Catholic, the service will be a Requiem Mass, marking the first royal Catholic funeral in the UK in modern times. The King and Queen are expected to attend the private family service, after which she will be buried at the royal burial ground in Windsor. The Duchess is remembered for her kindness, support for music and tennis, and her work as a primary school teacher.</p>

          <p>Police in London have made arrests during a protest in Parliament Square against the UK government's decision to ban the campaign group Palestine Action. Hundreds of demonstrators gathered to oppose the proscription, which makes supporting or being a member of the group a criminal offense under terrorism laws. The Metropolitan Police had warned that showing support for the organization would lead to arrest. This follows a previous large-scale demonstration last month where over 500 people were arrested for similar acts of support.</p>

Many are experiencing a sharp decline in agricultural exports as China increasingly turns to other suppliers, like Brazil, a direct consequence of the previous trade war. While some farmers remain hopeful that the current diplomatic approach will eventually lead to renewed orders, others are skeptical, fearing that lost market share will be difficult to regain.

          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has taken a significant stake in PepsiCo and is urging the company to implement major strategic changes to boost its underperforming stock. In a detailed presentation, Elliott argues that PepsiCo's North American beverage business has suffered from keeping its bottling operations in-house and a lack of focus on core brands like Pepsi and Mountain Dew. The proposed plan includes refranchising the bottling network, divesting weaker brands like Quaker, and reinvesting in its iconic products to reaccelerate growth and improve profitability.

          <p>Self-made millionaire and financial coach Bernadette Joy explains why she and her husband sold their properties and returned to renting, even though they could afford to buy a home with cash. She argues that homeownership comes with significant hidden costs, including renovations, maintenance, and property taxes, which are often underestimated. Furthermore, being a landlord proved to be a stressful and time-consuming venture that offered less return than investing in the stock market. For her, renting provides greater financial freedom, flexibility, and the ability to focus on growing her business and net worth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An article by a Harvard-trained strategist analyzes the success of Taylor Swift, identifying seven key traits she consistently demonstrates that contribute to her achievements. These characteristics include imagination, synthesis of ideas, intense focus on core priorities, doggedness in the face of difficulty, sustained passion, reverence for her craft, and unwavering commitment. The author suggests that Swift's success is not accidental but a result of cultivating these traits, such as her refusal to "dabble in things that aren't important" to her. These principles can serve as a model for others seeking to achieve their own goals.</p>

          <p>A new book highlights the largely unseen jazz photography of Lisette Model, a Viennese Jewish émigré who documented New York's jazz scene in the 1950s. Model, known for her street photography, aimed to capture the full American experience of joy and pain reflected in the music. Her project, which was to include an essay by Langston Hughes, was abandoned due to McCarthy-era political suspicion. Her images are noted for capturing the inward wariness of musicians like Duke Ellington and Miles Davis, who faced racism and persecution despite their fame, creating a poignant connection with the photographer's own experiences fleeing the Nazis.</p>

          <p>New research suggests that the climate crisis will lead to a significant increase in lightning-sparked wildfires across the western United States for decades to come. A study using machine learning found that conditions favoring both lightning and fire weather will become more common, heightening wildfire risk in 98% of the region. These types of fires often occur in remote areas, allowing them to grow larger and produce more smoke, which worsens public health crises. The trend could place immense strain on already limited firefighting resources and exacerbate air quality issues nationwide.</p>

Despite the grim prognosis, a specialized treatment plan involving complex chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation at Massachusetts General Hospital has put the toddler into remission.

          <p>Chinese researchers claim to have developed an AI-powered radar system that is nearly impossible to jam, marking a potential paradigm shift in military detection technology. According to a paper from the China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, a test flight demonstrated that the AI-enhanced system maintained a target lock over 99% of the time. This was a significant improvement over conventional radar, which lost the target in about a quarter of the engagement time under similar conditions. The breakthrough suggests that artificial intelligence could fundamentally change the design and effectiveness of future radar technologies.</p>
