        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NATO allies have agreed to more than double their defense spending target, moving from 2% to 5% of gross domestic product by 2035, marking a significant shift in the alliance's approach to security. This decision comes amid rising tensions in the Middle East and the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia, highlighting the need for increased investment in defense capabilities. The agreement includes a requirement for member states to allocate at least 3.5% of GDP to core defense spending, with the remainder directed toward security and defense-related critical infrastructure. This move reflects a unified stance against security threats and reinforces NATO's commitment to collective defense, as enshrined in Article 5. The United States has been pushing for increased burden sharing across the alliance for years, and this marks a critical point in the alliance's future stability and readiness.</p>

          <p>Two young bears named Mish and Lucy escaped their enclosure at Wildwood Devon in the U.K. and indulged in a week's worth of honey before falling asleep. The bears, both four years old, were continuously monitored by park staff who followed safety protocols to encourage them back into their enclosure without intervention. The park confirmed that the bears posed no threat to the public, though visitors were escorted to a secure building as a precaution. An investigation is underway to determine how the bears escaped, with the park citing an "operational error." The bears were rescued in 2021 after being abandoned as cubs and deemed unable to survive in the wild.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump, while en route to a NATO summit, declined to explicitly commit to Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which ensures collective defense among member nations. When questioned about his commitment to Article 5, Trump claimed there are "numerous definitions" of the agreement, causing uncertainty about the U.S.'s dedication to mutual defense. He emphasized his commitment to being a friend to NATO leaders and helping them, but he deferred providing a clear definition of his commitment to Article 5 until he arrived at the summit. These comments are likely to raise concerns among other nations regarding the reliability of the U.S.'s commitment to the central pillar of NATO.</p>

          <p>Tesla's new car sales in Europe have experienced a fifth consecutive month of decline in May, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA). The sales figures show a 27.9% year-on-year decrease, with Tesla's market share dropping from 1.8% to 1.2%. This downturn is attributed to increased competition from traditional automakers and the growing popularity of cheaper Chinese electric vehicles. Tesla faces challenges related to brand reputation and competition in the European market, despite efforts to boost sales with its revamped Model Y compact SUV. Shares of Tesla have decreased by more than 15% year-to-date.</p>

          <p>ChatGPT can inadvertently reinforce reassurance-seeking behaviors in individuals with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), potentially worsening their condition. People with OCD often compulsively seek reassurance to alleviate anxiety, but AI chatbots like ChatGPT can enable and prolong this behavior. Unlike human interactions where friends might recognize and discourage excessive reassurance-seeking, ChatGPT will continue to answer questions indefinitely, reinforcing the cycle of doubt and anxiety. Experts suggest that the "gold standard" treatment for OCD, exposure and response prevention (ERP), involves resisting compulsions, which is made more difficult by the availability of AI chatbots that readily provide reassurance.</p>

          <p>A fragile ceasefire between Israel and Iran is holding, bringing cautious optimism but also uncertainty as Iran threatens to accelerate its nuclear program. The 12-day conflict resulted in casualties on both sides, and the ceasefire was brokered by the Trump administration. Despite claims of significant damage to Iran's nuclear capabilities, initial intelligence assessments suggest the program was only set back by months. Iran's parliament voted to fast-track a proposal to halt cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), raising concerns about future monitoring of its nuclear activities. The ceasefire has allowed for the lifting of restrictions in Israel, but the situation remains tense.</p>

          <p>LGBTQ+ individuals in Sri Lanka continue to face discrimination and violence, with colonial-era laws criminalizing same-sex relations remaining in effect. Despite promises from the government to repeal these laws, no official action has been taken, leaving LGBTQ+ people vulnerable to harassment and abuse. The laws, though not widely enforced, are still used by police officers against LGBTQ+ individuals, and many face discrimination in various aspects of life. Advocates are calling for decriminalization to foster a more inclusive and accepting society, emphasizing that legal reform is crucial for changing attitudes and ensuring the safety and well-being of LGBTQ+ Sri Lankans.</p>

          <p>Drones are being used to address the trash crisis on Mount Everest, where an estimated 50 metric tons of waste remain. Airlift Technology, a Nepal-based company, is deploying drones to deliver supplies up the mountain and remove waste on the return trip. After successful trials in 2024, the company estimates it removed over one metric ton of trash between March and May 2025. The drones can quickly transport up to 33 lbs of supplies, such as oxygen bottles, to base camp, helping sherpas avoid carrying heavy equipment through dangerous areas.</p>

          <p>Proposed Medicaid cuts in a Republican budget bill could lead to 10.3 million fewer people enrolled in the program by 2034, reversing progress made in reducing the uninsured. A study estimates that these coverage losses could result in between 8,200 and 24,600 additional annual deaths. The proposed legislation includes new work requirements and limits on state financing tools. The Senate is debating amendments to the bill, but the potential consequences for low-income Americans' health are significant.</p>
