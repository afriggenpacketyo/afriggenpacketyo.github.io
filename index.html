          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 07:03:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Political dynasties remain a significant force in Southeast Asia, with offspring of former leaders holding power in many countries, including the Philippines, Cambodia, and Thailand. This trend raises concerns about shrinking democratic space and authoritarian continuity, as elite positions are increasingly passed down within families. While some argue that dynastic politics have led to increased female representation, critics caution that it does not necessarily broaden political participation for women outside of dynastic circles. Analysts attribute the entrenchment of dynasties to factors such as pre-colonial history, weak political parties, and inadequate anti-corruption efforts, making it difficult to steer the region toward broader participation.</p>

          <p>Alaska Airlines is canceling 14 flights a day through the end of July due to tariffs hindering its ability to accept delivery of new Embraer 175 regional jets. The airline is delaying the delivery of these jets to avoid incurring additional tariff-related costs, which stem from tariffs on Brazilian imports to the United States. The tariffs, part of a broader trade agenda, have disrupted supply chains and forced companies to raise prices. To minimize the impact on passengers, Alaska Airlines is cutting routes served by multiple flights and is working to re-accommodate affected guests.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study reveals that cannabis use among individuals over 65 has significantly increased, raising concerns about the potential health risks for this vulnerable population. Contrary to misconceptions, marijuana is not necessarily safer than alcohol or cigarettes, as THC can damage blood vessels and lead to cardiovascular problems. Additionally, cannabis can impair cognitive function, exacerbate anxiety, and even induce psychosis in those with underlying mental health issues. The increased potency of modern cannabis, combined with slower metabolism in older adults, amplifies these risks, and the notion that cannabis has proven medical uses is often overstated.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military announced the recovery of the bodies of two hostages, Judy Weinstein Haggai and her husband, Gad Haggai, in an operation near Khan Younis in southern Gaza. The couple, who held U.S., Israeli, and Canadian citizenship, were killed during the October 7, 2023, attack in southern Israel, and their bodies were subsequently taken to Gaza by the Mujahideen Brigades. The recovery operation was based on intelligence gathered by the Hostages and Missing Persons headquarters, and the bodies have been returned to Israel. Despite this recovery, the remains of two other U.S.-Israeli citizens are still held in Gaza, along with approximately 36 deceased and 20 living hostages, according to the Israeli government.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially raised tariffs on aluminum and steel to 50%, a move that experts predict could increase costs on various consumer goods, including cars, homes, and household appliances. While the U.S. has its own domestic metals manufacturing, it still relies on imports, making it susceptible to tariff-related price increases. Economists warn that businesses will likely pass these increased costs onto consumers, potentially impacting industries and household budgets. Some sectors, like automobile manufacturing, could see significant price hikes due to their heavy reliance on steel and aluminum.</p>

A satellite tracking device was attached to Dilly Dally's shell, allowing researchers and the public to monitor her journey and gather data on the migration and foraging patterns of three-flippered turtles.

          <p>Beijing has imposed sanctions on Sicuens International Co Ltd, a company owned by the father of Puma Shen, the founder of Kuma Academy in Taiwan, which runs civil defense education courses. The action is part of Beijing's efforts to crack down on entities it deems supportive of Taiwanese independence. Investigations revealed that the Taiwanese company had engaged in trade relations and business cooperation with mainland Chinese enterprises for economic gains, a practice Beijing will not permit for supporters of 'Taiwan independence'. This follows sanctions previously imposed on Shen Pao-yang, also known as Puma Shen, whom the office has called a “stubborn Taiwan independence figure”.</p>

          <p>A climber, Alex Chiu, died after falling approximately 3,000 feet on Mount McKinley (Denali) in Alaska's Denali National Park. Chiu was ascending the West Buttress climbing route with two companions when he fell at a spot known as Squirrel Point. High winds and snow initially prevented rescue teams from reaching the area, and Chiu's body was recovered two days after the incident. There are currently 500 climbers on Mount McKinley, with the climbing season running from early May to early July.</p>

          <p>The U.S. is facing a potential shortage of popular vape brands like Geek Bar due to tariffs on Chinese imports and a crackdown on unauthorized e-cigarettes. Shipments of vapes from China to the U.S. have significantly decreased, impacting the availability of Chinese-owned vape brands. The tariffs, now at 30%, and seizures of unauthorized vapes have constrained the supply, leading to purchase limits and expected price increases. Despite the potential for higher prices, the impact on sales may be limited due to the hefty margins enjoyed by unauthorized vape manufacturers.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review challenges the narrative that trade with China significantly damaged American manufacturing. The "China shock" theory, which suggests that Chinese imports caused substantial job losses, has been exaggerated, and populist narratives blaming this trade for U.S. economic decline are not supported by rigorous evidence. While some areas were negatively affected, the overall impact on manufacturing employment was modest, and job losses were often offset by gains in other sectors. The decline in U.S. manufacturing employment began decades before China's WTO entry, primarily due to technological advances and shifting consumer demand, and protectionist policies based on a misdiagnosed problem may do more harm than good.
