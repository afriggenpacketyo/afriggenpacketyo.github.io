          <p>AVZ Minerals has paused its arbitration case against the Democratic Republic of Congo, encouraged by the U.S. government to resolve a dispute over the Manono lithium project. This suspension aligns with U.S. support for KoBold Metals, backed by tech billionaires, to acquire AVZâ€™s stake in Manono, with a US$1 billion investment pledge. This move challenges Chinaâ€™s control over critical minerals in Congo, as Zijin Mining currently controls the northern section after Congo revoked AVZâ€™s rights in 2023. Washington's efforts aim to secure critical minerals for the green energy transition, directly countering China's influence in the region.</p>

Following monthslong strikes in 2023, the industry has struggled to recover, leading to a loss of approximately 40,000 jobs.
