          <p>Democratic members of the House are seeking a "birthday book" reportedly compiled for Jeffrey Epstein, which is alleged to contain a letter from Donald Trump. In a formal request to Epstein's estate, representatives Ro Khanna and Robert Garcia stated the book is relevant to their oversight of the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein investigation. The lawmakers hope to review the book's contents before a scheduled deposition with Ghislaine Maxwell, who is believed to have compiled the book. Trump has denied the letter's existence and filed a defamation lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal for its reporting on the matter.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has announced it will resume airdropping humanitarian aid into Gaza and establish corridors for United Nations convoys, though it emphasized that combat operations against Hamas will continue. This decision comes amid severe international pressure and warnings of widespread starvation in the territory, with organizations like the UN criticizing airdrops as insufficient. European leaders from the UK, France, and Germany have also discussed the appalling humanitarian situation, coordinating on plans to increase aid and work towards a lasting peace. However, recent violence near aid distribution points underscores the ongoing dangers for civilians.</p>

          <p>During the sentencing hearing for Idaho student murderer Bryan Kohberger, the sister of victim Kaylee Goncalves delivered a powerful and searing statement directly to him in court. Alivea Stevenson condemned Kohberger, calling him weak and clumsy, while he remained emotionless. Her testimony came as new police documents revealed gruesome details about the crime scene. Kohberger accepted a plea deal, avoiding the death penalty in exchange for four consecutive life sentences without parole for the murders of four university students, a deal that had divided the victims' families.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's private golfing trip to Scotland was met with significant protests in Edinburgh and outside his Turnberry resort. Demonstrators voiced their opposition to his politics and the use of taxpayer money for his security detail, holding signs that read "Scotland is already great." The article notes that Trump remains unpopular in his mother's home country, with a recent poll showing 71% of Scots hold an unfavorable view of him. During the visit, Trump also addressed questions regarding his ties to Jeffrey Epstein and his administration's trade policies.</p>

          <p>Joseph Czuba, the 73-year-old landlord sentenced for the fatal hate-crime stabbing of a six-year-old Palestinian-American boy, has died in prison. Czuba was found guilty of murder and attempted murder for the October 2023 attack, which also left the boy's mother, Hanan Shaheen, seriously injured. Prosecutors argued the attack was motivated by their Islamic faith in the wake of the Israel-Hamas conflict. The case drew global attention and highlighted rising anti-Muslim sentiment in the U.S., deeply affecting the large Palestinian community in the Chicago suburbs.</p>

          <p>President Trump's authority to impose widespread tariffs is facing a critical test in federal court, with multiple lawsuits challenging his use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). A federal appeals court is set to hear arguments in a case that could invalidate many of the administration's recent trade actions, including tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada. Analysts suggest that if the Supreme Court ultimately rules against the administration, it could unravel nearly all of the trade deals and tariff adjustments made in recent months. The White House maintains it is legally using its executive powers to protect national security. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's hopes for victory against India in the fourth Test at Old Trafford may be impacted by the uncertain fitness of captain Ben Stokes. After taking five wickets in the first innings, Stokes did not bowl on the fourth day due to being "a bit stiff and sore," according to assistant coach Marcus Trescothick. Stokes, who has a history of injuries and recently had hamstring surgery, appeared weary in the field. His availability to bowl on the final day remains in question, which could be a significant blow to England's attack as they push for a series-leveling win.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protesters, including anti-immigration demonstrators and counter-protesters, gathered outside a hotel housing asylum seekers in the Norwich area. The anti-immigration group, carrying St George's flags and banners reading "Stop the invasion," significantly outnumbered the counter-protesters. A strong police presence of about 60 officers monitored the event, which was described as largely peaceful but noisy. The demonstration concluded without any arrests and is the latest in a series of similar protests occurring at hotels used for asylum accommodation across England.</p>

          <p>Clothing brand American Eagle has experienced a notable rise in its stock price after launching a new advertising campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. The article suggests this success stems from a return to more traditional advertising that emphasizes visual appeal, a departure from recent trends focused on social messaging. This move is seen by some analysts as a strategic choice to prioritize product sales and profit over ideological conformity, potentially signaling a broader shift in marketing strategies.

          <p>In a closely watched recall election, Taiwanese voters have rejected a bid to remove 24 lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The result is a setback for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to flip the balance of power in the legislature. The KMT and its allies currently hold a majority, enabling them to block legislation from President Lai Ching-te's government. Those who supported the recall had criticized the opposition for passing controversial reforms and being too friendly with China, which claims Taiwan as its territory.</p>

          <p>The debate over how much coffee is healthy continues, with experts advising that the right amount depends on the individual. While some research links daily coffee consumption to health benefits and lower mortality rates, other studies suggest high intake can increase dementia risk. The FDA recommends no more than 400 milligrams of caffeine per day, but tolerance varies greatly. Dietitians suggest that if you experience negative effects like anxiety or poor sleep, you should cut back, regardless of official guidelines. For most healthy adults, moderation remains the key principle.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Venezuelan men who were expelled from the U.S. to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador claim their clients endured "state-sanctioned torture." The men, who were recently repatriated to Venezuela in a prisoner swap, have provided harrowing testimonies of their time in the Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo (Cecot). They describe repeated beatings, humiliation by guards, and inhumane living conditions, despite many never having been convicted of a crime in the United States. These accounts offer the first detailed look inside the controversial prison facility.</p>

          <p>The Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) is reportedly using an artificial intelligence tool to create a "delete list" of federal regulations, according to internal documents. The plan aims to analyze 200,000 regulations and eliminate half of them within the first year of a potential second Trump administration. The AI tool has allegedly been used by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to review over a thousand regulatory sections. A White House spokesperson stated that "all options are being explored" to fulfill the president's deregulation promises but that no single plan has been finalized.</p>

Protesters argue this is part of a broader trend of hijacking key state institutions to advance partisan interests.

          <p>Media trailblazer Tom Rogers, previously a self-proclaimed "raging bull" on Netflix, is now voicing concerns about the streaming giant's future. He points to declining viewership engagement per user and growing competition from free content on platforms like YouTube as significant headwinds. Rogers also suggests that while AI will help Netflix with targeted ads, it will also empower amateur creators on YouTube, blurring the line between professional and user-generated content. Despite a strong recent earnings report, he believes these engagement trends are a worrisome sign for the company's long-term trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>
