          <p>China's top envoy in Washington, Xie Feng, has refuted claims that Chinese ownership of US farmland poses a national security risk, labeling such assertions as "completely unfounded." Speaking at a soybean industry event, Xie stated that Chinese investors own less than 0.03% of total US farmland, arguing that restricting purchases is political manipulation. He emphasized that these claims are aimed at undermining agricultural cooperation between China and the United States. The ambassador's remarks highlight ongoing tensions and differing interpretations of economic activities between the two nations.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers fell 30-23 to the San Francisco 49ers in their preseason finale, with many starters sidelined. The game highlighted significant roster challenges for the Chargers, including 23 combined penalties and several 'cringeworthy moments' from backups. Linebacker Marlowe Wax delivered a standout performance, making three crucial plays including a strip sack, potentially securing his spot on the 53-man roster. However, rookie returner Luke Grimm struggled with two muffed punts before catching a late touchdown, complicating his roster prospects ahead of Tuesday's deadline.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has criticized President Donald Trump's proposal to deploy federal troops to Chicago, calling it an abuse of power and an attempt to "manufacture a crisis." Pritzker stated there is no emergency warranting National Guard presence in Illinois, echoing concerns from Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson who called the approach "uncoordinated, uncalled for, and unsound." This plan follows similar deployments in Washington D.C., where troops have now been ordered to carry weapons, intensifying a broader federal crackdown on crime in Democrat-led cities amid local opposition.</p>

          <p>A fire at Russia's Kursk nuclear power plant, attributed to a Ukrainian drone, has been extinguished with normal radiation levels reported, coinciding with Ukraine's Independence Day celebrations. The attack underscores ongoing tensions, with the UN's IAEA repeatedly urging restraint around nuclear facilities. The UK government announced extended military training for Ukrainian soldiers until at least 2026, reaffirming support for Ukraine's freedom. Meanwhile, diplomatic efforts between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have shown growing frustration over a lack of peace deal progress.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised the test-firing of two new types of antiair missiles, state media reported, showcasing expanding military capabilities. The tests occurred as South Korea and the US conducted joint military drills, and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung met with Japanese and US leaders to discuss regional security. Kim's government continues to reject calls for denuclearization talks, prioritizing ties with nations confronting the US, including Russia, to which North Korea has sent troops and weapons. Concerns are rising that Moscow could provide technology to enhance North Korea's aging air defense systems.</p>

With rising global temperatures expanding mosquito habitats, officials emphasize prevention through population control, as no specific treatments exist, though vaccines are available in the US.

          <p>Cracker Barrel's stock plummeted, losing almost $100 million in market value, following the release of its new, cleaner logo that removes the long-standing image of an overall-clad man. The redesign, part of CEO Julie Felss Masino's effort to refresh the brand, has drawn criticism from conservative commentators labeling it "woke" and from marketing experts concerned about alienating loyal customers. Despite the company's assurance that its values remain unchanged, the market's reaction underscores the risks of rebranding for established chains. The company's revenue growth has slowed in recent years, with net income declining in 2024.</p>

          <p>A bus carrying a junior high football team crashed near Pittsburgh, resulting in at least 21 students and the driver being hospitalized. The Aliquippa Junior High team was en route to a game when the bus veered off the road, struck a hillside, and hit a utility pole, knocking down live wires. While most child patients have been discharged, one remains in critical condition after surgery. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro offered state support, and the community has rallied with a vigil, as all football practices and games for the upcoming week are canceled.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has reportedly blocked Ukraine from using US-supplied long-range missiles, such as Atacms, to strike targets deep inside Russia since late spring. This move is part of a Trump administration effort to encourage peace talks with Vladimir Putin, reversing a previous Biden administration authorization. The restriction also applies to British Storm Shadow missiles, which rely on US targeting data. While the White House states no change in military posture, the policy sparks debate, with President Trump previously expressing disagreement with escalating the conflict by allowing strikes deep into Russian territory.</p>

          <p>As the UK Parliament's e-petitions system marks its 10th anniversary, an article examines its effectiveness, revealing a mix of serious campaigns and humorous requests. While some petitions, like 'Finn's Law' for police service animals, have directly led to legislative change, many others, including those with millions of signatures, have not resulted in immediate policy shifts. Critics argue the system creates an illusion of public engagement without real impact, while proponents emphasize its role in allowing citizens to set parliamentary agendas and engage directly with democracy. The system continues to serve as a platform for public expression, albeit with varying degrees of influence.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of young adults, some as young as 23, are opting for 'preventative botox' treatments, aiming to stop wrinkles before they form. While users like Sydney Brown, whose plastic surgeon mother administers her injections, report increased confidence, experts hold differing views on its long-term efficacy and necessity. Consultant plastic surgeon Nora Nugent advises against starting too early, calling it a waste of money, while others express concern over the industry profiting from insecurities and the potential for complications or developing tolerance.

The Republican-backed proposal aims to redraw congressional maps, creating five new GOP-leaning districts to secure a narrow House majority ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Democrats have vowed legal challenges, arguing the plan undermines fair representation and dilutes minority voting power.

          <p>The US immigrant population has decreased by over a million people since President Donald Trump took office in January, marking a reversal of more than 50 years of growth. A Pew Research Center study indicates the number dropped from a record 53.3 million in January to 51.9 million by June. This decline is attributed to various Trump administration policies, including restrictions on asylum and mass deportations, alongside Joe Biden's earlier asylum limitations. The analysis highlights a significant shift in US demographics and immigration enforcement, with Mexico remaining the largest origin country despite a declining Mexican-born population.</p>

Footage of the stimulation has sparked concern from animal rights groups, who call it unusual and a "perverse new low."
