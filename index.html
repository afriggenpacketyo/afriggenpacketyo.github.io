          <p>A power outage struck Cannes, France, disrupting the film festival's final day. French authorities suspect sabotage, citing arson at an electrical substation and damage to a transmission tower. Approximately 160,000 homes lost power, but service was restored by the afternoon. Festival organizers confirmed that the closing ceremony would proceed as planned due to a backup power supply. The incident is under investigation, with authorities working to identify and apprehend the perpetrators.</p>

The FBI and FTC have intervened previously due to the rise of these scams, with Americans losing over $12 billion to fraud in 2024.

          <p>Iranian director Jafar Panahi, despite facing state censorship and imprisonment, won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival for his film "It Was Just an Accident."

The film confronts state violence and repression, telling the story of ex-prisoners seeking revenge on their torturer.

          <p>The Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army Black Hawk helicopter on May 1, causing two commercial jets to abort their landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.
