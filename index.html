        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and a deadly shootout involving police officers, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro has called for a national rejection of political violence. He described the U.S. as being at an "inflection point," urging for unity over division and referencing his own experience with a firebombing at the governor's mansion. Shapiro emphasized the legal distinction between protected, though sometimes hateful, political speech and illicit incitement to violence, advocating for healing and finding common ground among Americans.</p>

          <p>Washington Nationals center fielder Jacob Young made a spectacular, game-altering catch against the New York Mets, contributing to a 3-2 victory. In the fifth inning, Young chased down a long fly ball, which popped out of his glove upon hitting the wall. In a moment of incredible improvisation, he kicked the ball back into the air with his foot, similar to a hacky-sack, and secured it for the out. He later made another leaping catch in the ninth inning to rob a potential game-tying home run, dealing a significant blow to the Mets' wild card hopes.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly preparing to announce a potential link between the use of acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, during pregnancy and the development of autism. Federal health officials are expected to warn against its use for pregnant women unless they have a fever. This move, spearheaded by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has been met with resistance from Tylenol's manufacturer, Kenvue, which insists there is no proven scientific link. The FDA and other major medical groups currently maintain that the painkiller is safe when taken as directed.</p>

          <p>Gabrielle has intensified into the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, reaching Category 1 hurricane status with sustained winds of 75 mph. The National Hurricane Center expects the storm's center to pass east of Bermuda on Monday, though no watches or warnings are currently in effect for the island. Swells generated by Gabrielle are predicted to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the U.S. East Coast from North Carolina northward into Atlantic Canada early next week, even as the storm itself remains offshore.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung stated he would accept a deal between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un that freezes North Korea's nuclear weapons production as a realistic interim measure. In an interview, Lee argued that halting the annual production of 15-20 new nuclear weapons would be a feasible alternative to the currently stalled goal of complete denuclearization. He expressed hope that the mutual trust between Trump and Kim could revive negotiations, which broke down in 2019, and help de-escalate tensions on the Korean peninsula that had flared under his predecessor.</p>

          <p>A wild Sunday of NFL action featured several games with dramatic finishes, most notably the Philadelphia Eagles' 33-26 comeback win over the Los Angeles Rams. The Eagles erased a 19-point deficit and won when Jordan Davis blocked a game-winning field goal attempt as time expired and returned it for a touchdown. Similarly, the Cleveland Browns stunned the Green Bay Packers 13-10 with a walk-off 55-yard field goal after blocking a Packers' attempt moments earlier. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers also secured a 29-27 victory over the New York Jets on a last-second field goal.</p>

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has approved a £2.2 billion plan to build a second runway at London's Gatwick Airport, a move the government sees as a key opportunity for economic growth. The project involves converting the airport's existing northern runway for routine use, which could increase annual flights from 280,000 to nearly 389,000. While the airport claims this will create jobs and boost the economy, the decision faces strong opposition from environmental groups and local campaigners concerned about increased noise, traffic, and carbon emissions from the expansion.</p>

This strategy, attributed to player fatigue after a demanding week, successfully stifled Arsenal's attack for most of the game.

The U.S. also voiced its disapproval, highlighting a growing rift among Western allies on the issue.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice under the Trump administration allegedly shut down a public corruption investigation into Tom Homan, the president's "border czar," according to multiple sources. The probe reportedly involved an FBI sting operation where Homan was recorded allegedly accepting $50,000 in cash from undercover agents posing as executives seeking government contracts. The investigation began during the Biden administration but was closed after Trump took office. Current and former officials have raised concerns that the decision to end the probe suggests a politicization of the Justice Department to protect a high-profile appointee.</p>

          <p>Gary Cohn, former National Economic Council director and current IBM vice chair, stated that the U.S. job market has shown clear signs of degradation, a view he says is shared by the Federal Reserve. He pointed to a significant slowdown in monthly job creation and noted that companies are aggressively managing labor costs by reducing their workforce through natural attrition. This trend is a response to rising input costs and the inability to pass those costs on to consumers, shifting from a post-COVID labor-hoarding environment to one of expense management.

          <p>President Donald Trump appeared to dismiss new Pentagon directives that severely restrict journalists' access and ability to report on U.S. military matters. When asked about the policy, which requires reporters to pledge not to gather any information not officially authorized for release, Trump stated, "Nothing stops reporters." The new rules, implemented by Department of War Secretary Pete Hegseth, have been heavily criticized by press freedom advocates. They argue the policy acts as a prior restraint on publication and prevents the public from receiving independent reporting on the military, allowing officials to control the narrative.</p>

Jordan Cox, a late addition to the squad, anchored the chase with a crucial half-century, scoring 55 runs to help England comfortably reach their target of 155 with 17 balls to spare. Earlier, England's bowlers, led by Adil Rashid's three wickets, had effectively restricted Ireland's batting lineup. The victory provides a positive result for England's stand-in captain, Jacob Bethell, in his first series leading the team.</p>

          <p>London's Mayor, Sadiq Khan, has initiated a one-day trial to make a section of Oxford Street, one of the world's busiest shopping districts, car-free. The plan aims to permanently ban vehicles between Oxford Circus and Marble Arch to increase footfall and create a more pleasant environment for shoppers and events. Khan hailed the trial as the beginning of a "fight back to rescue this street." However, the proposal has faced criticism from some local councillors and residents who are concerned about accessibility for people with mobility issues and the potential for traffic to be diverted onto smaller, congested side streets.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has sharply criticized Charles Kushner, the U.S. Ambassador to France, for publicly accusing his government of not doing enough to combat antisemitism. Macron deemed the ambassador's published letter an "unacceptable statement for somebody who is supposed to be a diplomat," stating that it was a misuse of taxpayer money. Kushner's letter had linked France's foreign policy, including gestures toward recognizing a Palestinian state, to a rise in violence against Jewish people in the country.

          <p>Podcaster Joe Rogan recently misinterpreted a scientific article, claiming it showed Earth is in a cooling period, but a meteorologist has clarified the data. While it's true that Earth was in a long-term natural cooling cycle within the Holocene epoch, that trend was dramatically reversed by human activity over the last 150 years. Meteorologist Chris Gloninger explained that the current rate of warming, driven by carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels, is unprecedented in human history. The incident highlights how complex climate data can be easily misrepresented and spread as misinformation to a wide audience.</p>

          <p>A cyberattack targeting Collins Aerospace, a major provider of airline check-in and baggage software, has caused significant disruptions at several major European airports, including London Heathrow and Brussels. The failure of the 'Muse' software system on Saturday forced airlines to resort to manual, paper-based check-ins, leading to long queues and hundreds of delays. Brussels Airport has asked airlines to cancel half of their Monday flights as the company has not yet delivered a secure version of the system. The incident underscores the vulnerability of the aviation industry to digital system failures.</p>

This result is a significant step back from the 10 medals won at the previous World Championships.
