          <h2>Trump's Tax Plan Could Include SALT Deduction Relief Benefiting High-Earners</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As discussions intensify regarding President Trump's tax policy agenda, potential changes to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction could significantly benefit higher-income individuals. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 imposed a $10,000 limit on the federal SALT deduction, which is set to expire after 2025 unless Congress acts. Trump has expressed support for reforming SALT, and lawmakers from high-tax states are pushing for changes, though a complete repeal is unlikely due to budgetary constraints. This article explores the potential impact of raising the SALT deduction limit on various taxpayers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order to block federal funding to the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and National Public Radio (NPR), alleging biased and partisan news coverage. The order instructs the Corporation of Public Broadcasting to cease direct funding to these organizations to the maximum extent allowed by law, arguing that taxpayer funding of news media is outdated and corrosive to journalistic independence. However, the CPB budget has already been approved by Congress through 2027, raising questions about the order's immediate impact. The BBC has contacted NPR and PBS for comment.</p>

          <p>Recent elections in the UK have seen Reform UK making significant gains, including winning its first Parliamentary by-election in Runcorn and Helsby by a narrow margin and securing its first mayoral contest in Greater Lincolnshire. While Labour held onto mayoralties in North Tyneside, Doncaster, and the West of England, Reform UK emerged as a close second in these races. The Conservatives experienced heavy losses in council seats, with Reform UK gaining control of several councils, primarily from the Conservatives. Results for remaining mayoral and council elections are expected soon, with the Liberal Democrats also targeting councils in the south.</p>

          <p>President Trump has once again threatened to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status, asserting that the institution deserves it.

Harvard's president has rejected these demands as illegal, arguing that they infringe upon the university's autonomy.

          <p>The Trump administration has officially eliminated a loophole that allowed American shoppers to buy cheap goods from China without paying tariffs, a move aimed at helping U.S. manufacturers compete. The de minimis rule, which exempted products up to $800 from tariffs, led to a surge in individually addressed packages from e-commerce platforms like Shein and Temu.

          <p>London's FTSE 100 is on track for record-breaking gains, fueled by the UK's perceived safe haven status amid global trade tensions. The index has risen 4.8% since the start of the year, driven by defensive stocks like healthcare and energy, as well as robust corporate results and a resilient UK economy. Analysts suggest that the FTSE 100 could reach 8,900 points by the end of next month, though risks remain, including geopolitical hotspots and a stronger pound. The FTSE 250 is also experiencing a winning streak, indicating broad strength in the London stock market. (not investment advice)</p>
