          <p>Some student loan borrowers enrolled in the SAVE Plan forbearance are reporting unexpected interest accrual on their accounts. One borrower, Ellie Bruecker, noticed an additional $3,000 in interest despite being promised an interest-free break. Higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz suggests borrowers check their loan history for balance changes since July 2024 and contact MOHELA if their debt has increased. The Education Department has not directly addressed the issue, but MOHELA has posted a notice stating that interest is currently set at 0% for borrowers on the SAVE administrative forbearance (not investment advice).</p>

Brooks broke into Perks's home in January 2021, armed with a crowbar, petrol, matches, and a knife, intending to set the house on fire. Perks sustained life-threatening injuries from the attack, surviving only due to swift medical intervention. The motive behind the attack was Brooks's belief that Perks was a witness against him in disciplinary proceedings, which Brooks feared would result in the loss of his job and home.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom announced plans to sue President Donald Trump over the deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles in response to protests related to federal immigration enforcement actions. Newsom argues that Trump's action is an illegal federalization of the National Guard that could extend to any state. The lawsuit follows Newsom's request for Trump to remove the National Guard from Los Angeles. Meanwhile, federal prosecutors have charged labor leader David Huerta with felony conspiracy to impede an officer following his arrest during a protest in L.A.</p>

          <p>The California FAIR Plan, the state's insurer of last resort for fire coverage, is under increased scrutiny for its lack of transparency and secretive practices. Unlike other insurers, the FAIR Plan does not publicly disclose basic financial data, and its board meetings, minutes, audits, and reports are kept secret. New rules now require all property insurance holders to cover the FAIR Plan's debts, raising concerns about accountability. Following investigations, the California FAIR Plan has agreed to disclose more information, including board composition and reinsurance structure, but questions remain about the extent of its transparency.</p>

          <p>A hospital trust and a staff member have been found guilty of health and safety failings in connection with the death of Alice Figueiredo, a 22-year-old woman who took her own life in a mental health unit. Alice, who had a history of suicide attempts, was being treated at Goodmayes Hospital when she died in July 2015. The North East London Foundation NHS Trust (NELFT) and ward manager Benjamin Aninakwa were convicted under the Health and Safety at Work Act for not doing enough to prevent Alice from killing herself; the family believes she would have been safer at the vets.</p>

          <p>Business leaders are revising their recessionary expectations for the U.S. following an initial spike after President Donald Trump's tariff announcement, according to a recent survey. Less than 30% of CEOs now forecast a recession in the next six months, a decrease from 62% in April. Conversely, over 40% of CEOs anticipate some level of growth in the U.S. economy, nearly double the figure from April. This shift reflects the evolving policy landscape around Trump's tariffs and ongoing negotiations with various countries (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Mark Gordon, on trial with Constance Marten over the death of their newborn baby, described the prosecution's case as resembling a 'movie script' during his closing speech. Gordon and Marten deny manslaughter by gross negligence and causing or allowing the death of their child, Victoria, who was found dead in a shopping bag in Brighton in March 2023. Gordon argued that the prosecution had 'just made things up' and that Victoria did not die of hypothermia as alleged. The couple was attempting to hide Victoria's birth because their other children had been taken into care.</p>

          <p>This article explores the concept of finding abundance through abstinence, highlighting six books that delve into various forms of renunciation and their unexpected rewards. Melissa Febos, author of 'The Dry Season,' discusses how her own period of celibacy led to a greater appreciation for other aspects of life. The selected books cover topics such as fasting, solitude, sobriety, and spiritual rigor, demonstrating how purposeful refusal can open individuals to unforeseen delights. The books challenge the notion that abstinence is solely about deprivation, revealing its potential for personal growth and enrichment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While it's technically possible to use a 401(k) to pay off credit card debt through either a loan or withdrawal, it's generally not advisable due to the long-term financial consequences. A 401(k) loan requires repayment with interest, and if you leave your job, the loan becomes due immediately, potentially triggering taxes and penalties. A 401(k) withdrawal incurs a 10% penalty if you're under 59Â½, plus income taxes, and both options sacrifice potential compound growth. Exploring alternatives like debt consolidation or credit counseling is recommended before considering tapping into retirement savings (not investment advice).</p>
