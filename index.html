          <p>In a joint visit to Kyiv, the leaders of Britain, France, Germany, and Poland, along with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, called on Russian President Putin to agree to a 30-day unconditional ceasefire, warning of further sanctions on Russia's banking and energy sectors if he refuses. British Prime Minister Starmer stated that the effort was closely coordinated with the White House, while Ukrainian Foreign Minister Sybiha indicated that Ukraine and its allies are ready for a full ceasefire. Kremlin spokesman Peskov dismissed the threat of new sanctions, stating Russia is accustomed to such pressure, while reiterating Russia's opposition to any ceasefire unless Western nations cease military aid to Ukraine. The article highlights the changing dynamics of the war and the geopolitical shifts occurring since Trump took office.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the importance of owning stocks at any age, even in retirement, and explains the concept of 'risk off' in the stock market. Jim Cramer advises against pulling out of the market entirely during volatile times, emphasizing the importance of staying the course and tailoring a strategy to individual risk tolerance and liquidity needs. The article clarifies that a 'risk off' environment is characterized by investor uncertainty and fear, leading to a shift from riskier assets like tech stocks to safer havens like cash, bonds, and defensive sectors. It also cautions against investing purely based on the risk-on or risk-off mindset, advocating for focusing on best-of-breed companies with solid long-term growth.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, re-entered Earth's atmosphere after a failed mission to Venus. The European Union Space Surveillance and Tracking confirmed the uncontrolled reentry, with the European Space Agency's space debris office also noting its demise. It was unclear where the spacecraft landed or how much of it survived, though some experts believed parts could withstand reentry. Scientists stated the chances of anyone being hit by debris were low, and the U.S. Space Command was still analyzing data to confirm the spacecraft's demise. The article highlights the uncontrolled nature of the reentry and the routine monitoring of such events.</p>

The department said a temporary committee will help remove similar books, using search terms like "affirmative action" and "critical race theory."

He expresses concern over the current generation of young investors being drawn to get-rich-quick schemes and the complexity of consumer finance created by corporate America. Edelman cautions young investors to seek information from credible sources and highlights the lack of mandatory personal finance courses in high schools. Despite these challenges, he notes that younger Americans are highly motivated to achieve financial success, driven by observing their parents' inadequate retirement planning.</p>

          <p>As negotiations intensify for President Trump's tax agenda, key issues are emerging that could impact millions of Americans. The House Ways and Means Committee has released a preliminary text of its portion of the bill, though it's subject to change. Republican lawmakers aim to pass the package without Democratic support through reconciliation, which requires navigating budget constraints and competing priorities. Experts highlight the challenges in securing enough votes in the House and the need for a fiscally responsible package, which could influence individual provisions.</p>
