          <p>Air traffic controllers at Newark Liberty International Airport experienced a brief communications failure with aircraft, leading to trauma leave and significant flight delays and cancellations. The FAA acknowledged the incident, attributing it to an antiquated air traffic control system and ongoing staff shortages. United Airlines previously announced flight reductions due to the airport's inability to handle scheduled traffic. Senator Chuck Schumer is calling for an investigation into the FAA's handling of the situation, citing nationwide air traffic controller shortages and outdated equipment as contributing factors.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump falsely claimed that gasoline prices had fallen below $2 per gallon, urging the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. According to AAA, the national average was $3.165 per gallon on Monday, which is higher than when Trump took office. While RBOB gasoline futures did briefly touch $1.98 per gallon, this figure does not reflect the actual price paid by consumers at the pump, as it excludes taxes, transportation costs, and other fees. Patrick De Haan of GasBuddy emphasized that the RBOB price is irrelevant to consumers.</p>

Saban reportedly seeks to "reform" NIL, not halt it, while the firm believes executive orders are unnecessary, as NIL empowers athletes to earn their own income.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' trial began with jury selection in New York, with charges including racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution. He faces life in prison if convicted, and dozens of civil lawsuits alleging sexual assault. Mr. Combs has pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges and rejected the individual lawsuits. The trial is expected to last around eight weeks and will be open to the public, but won't be streamed online. He has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn since his arrest.</p>

          <p>Washington attorney Mark Zaid is suing the Trump administration for revoking his security clearance, alleging it's an act of "improper political retribution." The lawsuit challenges a presidential memorandum that deemed Zaid and 14 others unsuitable to retain their clearances. Zaid, who has represented clients across the political spectrum, says the revocation jeopardizes his ability to represent clients in sensitive national security cases. The lawsuit claims the administration's actions attack the constitutional right to petition the court on behalf of clients.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration will soon offer digital Social Security cards, raising concerns among experts about access and identity theft protections. While some view this as a positive step if implemented securely, others worry about accessibility for older or less tech-savvy individuals. The Identity Theft Resource Center highlights that most adults' Social Security numbers have already been compromised, raising questions about protecting both the numbers and the devices used to access them. The agency needs to ensure the safety of the Social Security numbers and the devices that are used to access them.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the prevalence of synthetic chemicals in modern life and their potential impact on human health, particularly during fetal development. Many chemicals have never been tested for safety, and others are known to cause cancer or impede development.

The author also discusses the health effects of PFAS, or forever chemicals, and how they have spread throughout the environment. This article is adapted from a forthcoming book.</p>

          <p>Medicare does not cover dental care, routine vision exams, hearing aids, overseas medical care, or long-term custodial care, potentially leaving retirees exposed to significant out-of-pocket expenses. Supplemental insurance, such as Medigap, can help cover these gaps by paying for copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles. Purchasing Medigap coverage early is advisable, as healthcare costs are rising and eligibility can depend on health. Medicare recipients should consider supplemental coverage to protect their retirement finances.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order to incentivize prescription drug manufacturing in the U.S. by streamlining the approval process for domestic pharmaceutical plants. The order directs the FDA to reduce approval times, increase inspection fees for foreign plants, and improve enforcement of active-ingredient source reporting.
