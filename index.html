          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand has developed in the Atlantic Ocean, marking the sixth named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. Located approximately 405 miles south-southeast of Bermuda with sustained winds of 40 mph, forecasters are monitoring its trajectory. This follows Hurricane Erin, which peaked as a Category 5 storm earlier in August, causing strong winds and flooding along the East Coast. NOAA had predicted an above-normal hurricane season with 13 to 18 named storms, five to nine of which are expected to become hurricanes. The article highlights the ongoing activity of the season.</p>

          <p>Gaza City is now experiencing famine, according to a report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), intensifying international pressure for a ceasefire. Israeli strikes and shootings on Saturday killed at least 33 people, including those sheltering in tents and seeking aid. Israel has rejected the famine declaration as false, while aid groups continue to warn of widespread starvation caused by the ongoing conflict and restrictions on food supplies. The Israeli military is preparing for a major offensive in Gaza City, further complicating humanitarian efforts and ceasefire negotiations.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Phillies star pitcher Zack Wheeler has been diagnosed with venous thoracic outlet syndrome, requiring surgery that will keep him out of play for six to eight months. This development follows an initial surgery in August to remove a blood clot from his arm. The upcoming thoracic outlet decompression surgery could delay his start to the 2026 season. Wheeler, 35, had a 10-5 record with a 2.71 ERA and led the National League with 195 strikeouts this season, making him a strong contender for the NL Cy Young Award.</p>

          <p>Newly released transcripts from Ghislaine Maxwell's July interview with the US Justice Department reveal her denial of witnessing any inappropriate conduct by Donald Trump or Bill Clinton. Maxwell, a jailed associate of Jeffrey Epstein, also stated that a rumored 'client list' does not exist. The interview has sparked outrage from the family of Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre, who accused the government of allowing Maxwell to 'rewrite history.' Maxwell, currently serving a 20-year sentence for a sexual assault scheme, is seeking a pardon and has petitioned the Supreme Court to overturn her conviction.</p>

          <p>Rams second-round draft pick Terrance Ferguson made a strong impression in his preseason debut against the Browns, showcasing his potential as the heir apparent to veteran tight end Tyler Higbee.

Coach Sean McVay praised Ferguson's performance, noting his 'nice pace to his game.' This article suggests Ferguson will be a significant factor in the Rams' tight end group this season, alongside Colby Parkinson and Davis Allen.</p>

Despite not being deeply illuminating about the human condition, the movie is praised for its entertaining, if overcooked, depiction of isolated megalomaniacs.
