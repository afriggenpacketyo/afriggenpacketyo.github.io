          <p>The Philippines held midterm elections which are largely viewed as a proxy battle between President Ferdinand Marcos and Vice President Sara Duterte, former allies now feuding over political and economic agendas. The election results will determine over 18,000 positions, including seats in the House of Representatives and key senate seats crucial for a potential impeachment trial against Duterte. Security was tightened across the country due to the history of election-related violence, with police and military deployed to protect polling stations. Former President Rodrigo Duterte, detained by the ICC in The Hague, is still on the ballot for mayor in his hometown, highlighting the complex political landscape in the Philippines.</p>

          <p>BBC News reports that UK immigration has consistently exceeded emigration for the past 30 years, marking a significant demographic shift. Despite political promises to reduce net migration to the levels of the 1990s, numbers have remained historically high, becoming a key issue in the 2016 EU referendum. Brexit aimed to grant the government more control over immigration, but net migration figures surged, highlighting the challenges in managing immigration policies. Recent data suggests a potential fall in net migration for 2024 due to a decline in visas granted, but the overall trend remains a subject of intense political debate.</p>

          <p>Fox News reports that a measure in President Trump's upcoming bill, targeting federal payments to abortion providers, is facing opposition from moderate House Republicans. Concerns have been raised about the definition of "large groups who provide abortion services" and its potential impact, with some Republicans questioning the necessity of the provision given the existing Hyde Amendment. With a narrow majority in the House, Republican leaders are navigating potential dissent as they aim to pass the bill using the budget reconciliation process to circumvent Democratic opposition. The bill also seeks to cut spending through work requirements for Medicaid beneficiaries and by targeting taxpayer-funded healthcare for illegal immigrants.</p>

          <p>The BBC reports that the United States and China have indicated that they made substantial progress in trade talks held in Geneva, signaling a potential de-escalation in their trade war. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the discussions as productive, while China's Vice Premier He Lifeng noted the talks were in-depth and candid. These meetings were the first formal negotiations since President Trump imposed steep tariffs on Chinese goods, leading to retaliatory levies from Beijing. Experts suggest the announcement may include tariff cuts, though some remain cautious about the extent of the agreement, as the trade war has caused turmoil in financial markets and sparked fears of a global recession.</p>

          <p>Yahoo Finance reports that a U.S.-owned toy factory in China, Huntar Company Inc., faces closure due to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports. The tariffs have led to order cancellations, forcing the company to consider relocating to Vietnam or shutting down. Huntar's plight highlights the challenges faced by American businesses operating in China amid the trade war, with the company struggling to survive despite efforts to adapt.
