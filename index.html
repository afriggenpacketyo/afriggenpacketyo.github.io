          <p>Nvidia shares surged after the company reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, despite challenges from U.S. semiconductor export restrictions to China. This positive performance sparked a rally in global semiconductor stocks, with companies like Tokyo Electron and SK Hynix experiencing significant gains. Nvidia wrote off $4.5 billion of H20 chip inventory due to export curbs, the article notes, but the company's financial results still exceeded market expectations, alleviating concerns about dwindling demand for its graphics processing units, which are essential for training AI models. The semiconductor industry has faced headwinds from tariff policy uncertainty and chip export restrictions.</p>

          <p>Israeli ministers have announced the approval of 22 new Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, marking the largest expansion in decades, according to the anti-settlement watchdog Peace Now. The decision includes legalizing existing outposts and constructing entirely new settlements. Israeli ministers argue this move prevents the establishment of a Palestinian state and reinforces Israel's eastern border. However, Palestinian officials condemn the expansion as a dangerous escalation that undermines efforts towards a two-state solution, the internationally approved formula for peace that would see the creation of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel.</p>

He contrasted his own approach, emphasizing stable finances, with Farage's proposals, which include tax breaks for married couples and restoring winter fuel payments for all pensioners. Some economists have questioned how Reform would fund its policies, particularly a commitment to raise the income tax threshold, which could cost between Â£50bn and Â£80bn a year.</p>

          <p>Geologists from the University of Kentucky are working to understand and mitigate the impact of catastrophic flooding in southern Appalachia. Amid increasing rainfall due to the climate crisis, the team aims to create reliable warning systems and model future flood risks. The urgency of this mission is highlighted by the potential dismantling of key federal agencies under the Trump administration. The geologists are documenting landslides and measuring water levels to improve hazard prediction and create real-time warning systems, emphasizing the need for hyper-local data and accurate weather forecasts.</p>

          <p>This article explores the idea that it can be beneficial for adults to correct children's behavior, even if they are not the child's parent. The author recalls an experience in Prague where a woman gently corrected her daughter's behavior on the metro, highlighting the communal approach to child-rearing. While acknowledging the potential drawbacks, the author argues that such interventions can reinforce lessons and acquaint children with societal conventions. In an era of waning social trust, reviving collective child-rearing norms may seem far-fetched, but such involvement can be welcome.</p>
