        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major Republican bill championed by President Trump would significantly alter the lives of many Americans through extensive cuts to social programs and changes in various regulations. The legislation proposes reducing funding for Medicaid and SNAP, which would affect low-income individuals and those with disabilities who rely on these services for healthcare and food assistance. Additionally, the bill includes phasing out green energy tax credits, potentially harming the renewable energy sector, while also eliminating federal income tax on tips and overtime, which would benefit service workers and firefighters.</p>

          <p>Authorities have identified 20-year-old Wess Roley as the suspect who allegedly ambushed a group of firefighters in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, killing two and critically injuring a third. The sheriff stated that Roley is believed to have intentionally started a wildfire to lure the first responders to the remote mountain area before opening fire on them with a shotgun. The suspect, who was found deceased at the scene from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, had reportedly expressed a desire to become a firefighter, but his motive for the attack remains unknown.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military commander overseeing National Guard troops in Los Angeles has requested that 200 of them be returned to California state command. The troops were federalized by President Trump to respond to immigration-related unrest, but their deployment has left the state's specialized wildfire-fighting unit critically understaffed as fire season intensifies. California Governor Gavin Newsom, who has legally challenged the federalization, supports the request, emphasizing the urgent need for these troops to resume their essential firefighting duties to protect the state from active wildfires.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer argues that a new generation of younger investors is significantly influencing market dynamics by favoring companies with bold, innovative concepts over established corporations. He suggests these investors are less concerned with traditional metrics like stock buybacks, which they view as a sign of stagnation, and are instead drawn to "story-dominated" stocks like Robinhood and Reddit. This shift indicates a market that rewards perceived growth potential and disruptive ideas, moving focus away from macroeconomic factors like Federal Reserve policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A report from UK child health experts suggests that falling childhood vaccination rates are often due to practical obstacles rather than parental fear of vaccines. Difficulties in booking appointments, getting time off work, and a lack of clear reminders are preventing many families from keeping their children's immunizations up to date. This decline has led to a resurgence of preventable diseases like measles, prompting calls for the NHS to improve access through better app-based booking systems, expanded services, and clearer communication with parents.</p>

However, his history of vaccine skepticism, the dismantling of CDC programs, and his controversial views on topics like fluoride and autism have drawn intense criticism from the scientific community.</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has announced the formation of Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL), a new unit dedicated to advancing the company's efforts in artificial intelligence. The lab will be led by recent high-profile hires, including former Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, consolidating Meta's various AI teams under one umbrella. This move signals Meta's commitment to leading the race toward developing superintelligence, as it competes fiercely with rivals like OpenAI and Google for top talent and technological breakthroughs.</p>

          <p>During her first-round match at Wimbledon, tennis player Yulia Putintseva of Kazakhstan stopped play to complain to the umpire about a spectator she described as "dangerous" and "crazy." Putintseva expressed serious concern for her safety, refusing to continue until the person was removed from the stands on Court 15. A spokesperson for the All England Club confirmed that security was informed and the matter was "dealt with" before play resumed. Putintseva, who appeared emotional, ultimately lost the match to Amanda Anisimova in straight sets.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is hearing arguments over the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act, a law from 1798, to deport Venezuelan migrants suspected of being gang members. The administration argues that the Tren de Aragua gang constitutes a "predatory incursion," justifying the use of the wartime authority, which allows for deportation with minimal due process. The ACLU contends that the act was intended only for major military conflicts and that applying it to a criminal gang is an overreach of executive power, a critical constitutional question.</p>

          <p>The UK's Privy Council has affirmed the legality of same-sex civil partnerships in the Cayman Islands, rejecting a legal challenge against the law. The law was enacted by the territory's governor in 2020 after local lawmakers initially voted down the legislation, following a court ruling that same-sex couples were entitled to legal protections equivalent to marriage. LGBTQ+ rights campaigners have hailed the decision as a significant victory that provides legal certainty for same-sex couples and could set a precedent for other British overseas territories.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite widespread concern that new tariffs would fuel inflation, U.S. prices have remained relatively stable, with key inflation gauges showing only modest increases. Economists attribute this to several short-term mitigation strategies employed by businesses, including aggressively pre-ordering inventory to "front-load" imports before the duties took full effect. Additionally, some companies are absorbing initial cost increases to maintain market share, while others use logistical loopholes like foreign trade zones to delay tariff payments, though prices could still rise later.

Shortly after starting, the jury sent a note to the judge expressing concerns about one juror's ability to follow instructions, though they were told to resume their work. Over seven weeks, prosecutors presented evidence and testimony from ex-girlfriends alleging a pattern of violence and coerced sexual encounters, while the defense argued the acts were consensual.</p>

          <p>Stanford University is cutting $140 million from its upcoming budget, attributing the reduction to "federal policy changes" such as reduced research support and a potential increase in the endowment tax. The cuts will likely lead to staff layoffs, though the university plans to continue hiring faculty at a slower pace and will protect financial aid and doctoral student funding. With one of the nation's largest endowments, Stanford is particularly vulnerable to a proposed tax on university endowments included in President Trump's budget bill, which could cost the institution hundreds of millions.</p>

The piece argues this reflects a nihilistic worldview that dismisses America's heritage of liberty and its role as a global leader. This rhetoric, the author contends, is poisonous to democracy as it portrays the world as a purely transactional and "nasty" place.</p>

The legislation introduces new work requirements for many recipients and is projected to cut federal spending on the program by $1 trillion over the next decade, potentially causing 11.8 million people to become uninsured. Healthcare experts warn that these deep cuts could force the closure of rural hospitals and community health centers that are heavily dependent on Medicaid revenue, thereby reducing access to essential care for vulnerable populations.</p>
