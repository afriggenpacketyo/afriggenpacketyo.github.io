          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge hit his 358th career home run, placing him in a tie with the legendary Yogi Berra for fifth on the team's all-time list. The milestone occurred during a game against the Chicago White Sox, where Judge hit the home run in his first at-bat. He is now approaching Joe DiMaggio, who is fourth on the list with 361 home runs. Despite Judge's historic achievement, the Yankees lost the game 3-2, though they remain in a competitive position for a postseason wild card spot as the season enters its final month.</p>

          <p>Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, was hospitalized with several broken bones after the vehicle he was a passenger in was struck from behind at high speed in New Hampshire. His spokesperson confirmed he suffered fractured thoracic vertebrae and other injuries, which are considered non-life-threatening. The incident occurred after Giuliani had stopped to assist a woman who was an apparent victim of domestic violence. New Hampshire State Police are investigating the crash, which also resulted in injuries to Giuliani's associate and the 19-year-old driver of the other vehicle.</p>

          <p>China is undergoing an unprecedented naval expansion, now possessing the world's largest navy by number of warships and dominating global shipbuilding with over 60% of orders. This rapid growth, fueled by a 'military-civilian fusion' strategy, has enabled Beijing to project power more assertively, particularly in the South China Sea. While the U.S. Navy still holds advantages in tonnage and technology, such as more aircraft carriers, the capability gap is narrowing quickly. Analysts note that China's shipbuilding capacity is about 200 times that of the United States, posing a significant strategic challenge.</p>

Parubiy, who was a key figure in the 2014 Euromaidan protests, was shot and killed in Lviv by an assailant disguised as a courier. President Volodymyr Zelensky announced the apprehension, and the interior minister stated the killing appeared to have been meticulously planned. The suspect was detained in the Khmelnytskyi region following a large-scale manhunt. Further details are expected as the investigation continues into the carefully orchestrated assassination.</p>

          <p>Geoffrey Hinton, a Nobel laureate often called the 'godfather of AI,' expressed deep concerns about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence and the escalating tech race between the U.S. and China. After leaving his position at Google to speak more freely, Hinton highlighted the risks of AI systems becoming uncontrollable and potentially posing an existential threat. During a recent visit to Shanghai, he discussed the need for international cooperation to establish safety protocols and prevent a competitive dynamic from leading to the deployment of unsafe AI. His perspective underscores the urgency of addressing AI's long-term risks.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner has stated that the club must retain captain Marc Guehi to ensure a successful season, amid an improved £35 million transfer offer from Liverpool. Guehi, who has one year left on his contract and scored in a recent 3-0 victory over Aston Villa, has indicated he will not sign a new deal. Glasner emphasized that an agreement was in place to only sell Guehi if a suitable replacement was secured, which has not happened. The club is reluctant to lose the crucial defender for free next summer, especially after already selling key player Eberechi Eze to Arsenal.</p>

          <p>Formula 1 driver Lando Norris's championship hopes suffered a blow after an oil leak forced him to retire from the Dutch Grand Prix. The retirement caused him to fall 34 points behind his McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri, who won the race. Despite the setback, Norris remains determined, stating he will 'just go for it' in the remaining nine races of the season. The incident highlighted the intense competition between the two McLaren drivers, who have been the class of the field this year, as Piastri's victory demonstrated his consistency and control under pressure.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has temporarily closed its embassy in Cairo after Egyptian authorities removed security barriers from outside the building. This action is part of a diplomatic row following the arrest of a pro-Egyptian government activist during a protest in London last week. The Egyptian government had demanded an explanation for the arrest and suggested it had the 'right to respond.' The UK Foreign Office stated the closure is to review the security impact of the changes, but affirmed that the embassy remains operational and is engaging with Egyptian counterparts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump has declared his intention to issue an executive order that would require identification for all voters in U.S. elections, a move that is expected to face immediate legal challenges over its constitutionality. The U.S. Constitution primarily grants states the authority to regulate elections, with no explicit power for the president to mandate such rules. This push is part of Trump's ongoing efforts based on unsubstantiated claims of fraud in the 2020 election. Critics argue that strict voter ID laws disproportionately disenfranchise minority, low-income, and elderly voters who may lack required forms of identification.</p>

          <p>Southern California is experiencing a significant heatwave over the Labor Day weekend, with temperatures expected to reach up to 107 degrees in some valley areas. While many residents may head to the coast to escape the heat, the National Weather Service has issued a beach hazards statement, warning of dangerous rip currents and elevated surf. The highest risk is on south-facing shores in Los Angeles and Ventura counties. In addition to the coastal dangers, there is also a slight chance of thunderstorms, which could bring the risk of lightning-sparked fires in the dry, hot conditions.</p>

          <p>Following a 2-1 loss to Brighton, Manchester City is experiencing its worst start to a Premier League season since 2004, prompting questions about their ability to challenge for the title.

Historically, no team has recovered from such a position to win the league in a 38-game season. While manager Pep Guardiola remains calm, stating the season is long, the team's defensive frailties and inability to control games have become a recurring issue early in their campaign.</p>

          <p>Despite a recent flurry of diplomatic activity, a just and lasting peace for Ukraine appears remote as Russian President Vladimir Putin remains committed to his maximalist war aims. This article argues that President Trump's contradictory and improvisational approach to mediation has created confusion, benefiting Putin's strategy of grinding down adversaries through prolonged conflict. While European support allows Ukraine to continue defending itself, the lack of clear and credible U.S. leadership means the war will likely persist. The author suggests that Putin is patiently waiting for Western fatigue to set in, hoping to secure a favorable deal in the long run.</p>
