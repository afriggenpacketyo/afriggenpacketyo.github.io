          <p>A riot at the Trousdale Turner Correctional Center in Tennessee was contained after officers deployed chemical agents, leading to all prisoners returning to their cells. The incident began when several inmates refused to comply with directives to return to their cells. Three guards were briefly held hostage but were released safely with minor injuries. Local law enforcement agencies assisted in securing the facility, preventing any inmates from breaching the main fence and escaping. One correctional officer sustained minor injuries and was treated at a hospital before being released. </p>

          <p>Several Waymo autonomous vehicles were set ablaze in downtown Los Angeles during protests against President Trump's immigration crackdown. Five Waymo vehicles were vandalized and could not be retrieved, prompting the company to suspend service in the protest area. Photos show the vehicles engulfed in flames with anti-ICE graffiti, and some individuals were seen throwing Lime e-scooters into the burning cars. The Los Angeles Police Department warned of the toxic gases released by burning lithium-ion batteries, posing risks to responders and nearby individuals.</p>

          <p>Ohio State University will require all students to become fluent in artificial intelligence (AI), integrating AI education throughout the undergraduate curriculum. The initiative aims to prepare students for a future workforce significantly impacted by AI. Students will be "bilingual," proficient in their major field and the application of AI within that area. While students will not be allowed to pass off AI-generated content as their own, faculty will advise on maintaining academic integrity, encouraging students to discuss ethics and philosophy with AI chatbots.</p>

          <p>Robinhood shares experienced a decline after the online brokerage was not included in the latest S&P 500 rebalance, despite speculation that it would earn a spot. The stock had rallied in anticipation of potential inclusion, driven by a strong year with shares up nearly 90%. While inclusion in the S&P 500 typically leads to increased trading volume and passive fund investment, Robinhood was ultimately passed over. Despite the setback, Robinhood has shown significant recovery this year, rebounding from previous declines related to the GameStop trading frenzy and the collapse of FTX. (not investment advice)</p>
