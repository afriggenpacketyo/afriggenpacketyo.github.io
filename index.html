          <p>President Trump is reportedly preparing to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 jet from the Qatari royal family to use as Air Force One, raising legal and ethical concerns. The jet, valued around $400 million, would be transferred to Trump's presidential library foundation after his second term. While the White House insists the gift complies with all applicable laws, critics are questioning potential conflicts of interest and emoluments clause violations. This comes as Trump is scheduled to visit Qatar on his first foreign trip of his second term, and amidst delays and cost overruns in modernizing the existing Air Force One fleet.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent views the recent trade agreement with China as progress in the U.S. reducing its reliance on Chinese products, particularly for strategic necessities. While acknowledging that a complete decoupling is unlikely, Bessent emphasized the importance of resilient supply chains after the COVID-19 pandemic exposed vulnerabilities. The agreement involves a 90-day pause on reciprocal duties, though tariffs on steel, critical medicines, and semiconductors will remain, along with a 20% charge related to fentanyl. Bessent also expressed optimism about China's commitment to assisting the U.S. in stopping the flow of fentanyl precursor drugs.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China have reached an agreement to temporarily ease tariffs imposed in recent months, signaling progress in trade negotiations. The two countries will reduce their reciprocal tariffs by 115 percentage points for 90 days, effectively lowering U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to 30% and China's tariffs on American imports to 10%. This move aims to revive trade between the two nations, which had been significantly impacted by the high tariffs.

          <p>Global stock markets are reacting positively to the trade truce between the U.S. and China, which implements a 90-day cooling-off period and scales down tariffs. This agreement follows an initial trade deal with the United Kingdom, signaling a potential shift in Trump's trade policies. The article notes that Trump's approval ratings have been declining due to economic concerns and inflation, exacerbated by his earlier tariff announcements. Veteran Republican strategist Ryan Williams suggests the truce could be a positive first step for Trump in securing more deals and improving his poll numbers, but he will need to show tangible results.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is considering cutting flights at Newark Liberty International Airport following a series of equipment failures and air traffic controller shortages that caused significant flight disruptions. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated that the issues in Newark are indicative of broader problems with aging U.S. aviation infrastructure that need to be addressed. Recent incidents include air traffic controllers losing communication with planes and telecommunications issues that slowed traffic.

          <p>The pharmaceutical industry is criticizing President Trump's plan to change the pricing model for some medications, arguing that it could harm research and development. Trump's plan aims to tie the price of medications covered by Medicare to the lowest price paid by other countries, a move he claims will significantly lower drug costs. The industry lobby, PhRMA, argues that this "most favored nation" approach is a "bad deal" for American patients and could make the U.S. more reliant on China for innovative medicines. The executive order is expected to impact drugs covered by Medicare Part B, potentially saving the government billions but not necessarily impacting the prices of more common prescription drugs.</p>

          <h2>Crude Oil Prices Rise on Hopes for Economic Growth Amid US-China Trade Deal</h2>

          <p>Crude oil futures jumped 4% following the announcement of a temporary trade deal between the U.S. and China, easing trade tensions between the world's two largest petroleum consumers. The agreement involves a reduction in tariff rates, which had previously raised concerns about a potential recession and slowed demand. The rise in oil prices provides some relief to U.S. shale oil producers, who need crude prices at $65 per barrel to drill new wells profitably. The lowered tariff rate will remain in place for 90 days as the world's two largest economies continue to negotiate.</p>

          <p>Labour has unveiled its long-awaited plans to cut immigration levels into the UK, aiming for a system that is "controlled, selective, and fair." Key proposals include tightening work visa requirements, doubling the residency period for indefinite stay, scrapping care visas, and implementing stricter rules for student visas. At the same time, the government says it wants to expand eligibility for the existing "high potential individual" visa. The plans also involve higher English language requirements for work visas and an extension of the refugee pilot program. The prime minister has declined to specify exactly what levels of migration they want to see each year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When children face difficulties, parents often feel compelled to remove the activities they care about most as a form of motivation, however this is not the most effective approach. Research indicates that focusing on and cultivating a child's strengths, or "islands of competence," is more beneficial for their development. Strength-based parenting is associated with lower stress levels and higher engagement in school, while focusing on weaknesses can negatively affect a childâ€™s confidence. By identifying and nurturing their strengths, parents can help children develop a sense of purpose and resilience that carries over to other areas of their lives.</p>

The proposal includes $163 billion in cuts to education, housing, and health programs, with Housing and Urban Development facing the deepest reductions. It also seeks to change how aid is distributed, shifting from direct federal payments to block grants, giving states more flexibility but potentially reducing direct benefits for renters.
