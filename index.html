The author explores the scientific evidence behind baby-led weaning, finding that its benefits are not as conclusive as some claim and that it can pose risks.  The author concludes that both baby-led weaning and traditional spoon-feeding are acceptable methods, but that internet trends can oversimplify and exaggerate the benefits of one method over the other.</p>
