          <h2>No Charges Filed Against Officer in Cardiff E-Bike Deaths</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-07 10:15:04 EDT</div>

          <p>The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has decided not to press criminal charges against a police officer whose van followed two teenagers on an e-bike shortly before their fatal crash in Ely, Cardiff. The CPS cited insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction after investigating the officer for dangerous driving. The deaths of Kyrees Sullivan, 16, and Harvey Evans, 15, sparked a riot in Ely, fueled by rumors that police chased the boys before the accident. CCTV footage later confirmed that police were following the teenagers minutes before the crash, leading to an IOPC investigation and gross misconduct notices for the involved officers.</p>

          <p>A coalition of business groups and conservative lawyers are preparing a legal challenge to President Trump's recently imposed tariffs, arguing that he lacks the constitutional authority to enact them. The challenge centers on the argument that Congress, not the president, holds the power to impose taxes and regulate trade. The lawsuit will claim that citing the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977 does not grant the president the power to impose global tariffs, especially without a clear national emergency. Sources suggest that the Supreme Court could potentially rule against the administration if the challenge reaches that level.</p>

          <p>A recent CNBC survey of CEOs reveals widespread concern that President Trump's tariffs will trigger a recession, with a majority (69%) expecting an economic downturn, and over half predicting it will occur this year. Many CEOs anticipate increased prices and potential job losses as a result of the tariffs, with some already planning for inflation scenarios involving suppliers and consumers. Concerns extend beyond economics, with fears of boycotts against American brands and rising anti-American sentiment in international markets. The uncertainty surrounding trade policies is causing businesses to downsize building plans and delay investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that China's stronger-than-expected response to President Trump's recent tariff announcement reflects intensive planning and a reduced dependence on the American market since 2018. China's swift retaliation indicates preparedness and a potential unwillingness to be rushed into negotiations with Washington. Despite the trade tensions, China has maintained its economic growth target for the year, suggesting a readiness to offset the impact of the trade war by expanding domestic demand.

The government expedited the implementation of these changes in response to the US tariffs, which include a 25% levy on cars imported to the US.

          <p>White House trade advisor Peter Navarro stated that Vietnam's offer to eliminate tariffs on U.S. imports is not enough for the administration to lift its new levies. Navarro cited non-tariff cheating, such as Chinese products being routed through Vietnam and intellectual property theft, as key concerns. He indicated that the administration would apply a significant levy to imports from Vietnam. The comments come as Wall Street closely monitors potential negotiations that could lead to reduced tariffs.</p>

          <h2>Trump Health Agency Cuts Could Hamper Alzheimer's Research</h2>

          <p>Experts are concerned that the Trump administration's cuts to federal health agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, could halt Alzheimer's research. The Alzheimer's Association reports that related programs have had staff placed on administrative leave as part of the reductions. Reduced research funding could delay the development of treatments and negatively impact the lives of patients and their families. Some worry that cuts could threaten the entire pipeline of early-stage medical innovations.</p>

          <p>Nintendo of America's president, Doug Bowser, stated that President Trump's tariffs are complicating the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2. Pre-orders for the console will be delayed in the U.S. to assess the potential impact of the tariffs. Bowser indicated that the $449 price tag for the individual SKU was based on previous tariffs, and the company is actively assessing the impact of the new tariffs on pricing. Nintendo is working with retailers to prevent scalping and ensure availability for consumers.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan's head of global equity strategy, Mislav Matejka, stated that the hurdle to buying stocks amid the current market rout is very high. He outlined three conditions needed for a sustainable equity market rebound: a settlement in trade news flow, a reversal in fiscal consolidation, and Federal Reserve capitulation after payrolls falter. Matejka cautioned that US markets are "not a good place to hide" and advised caution on risk assets. The S&P 500 is approaching bear market territory, and market volatility remains high.

          <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Monday that tariffs announced by President Donald Trump last week will likely boost prices on both domestic and imported goods, weighing down a U.S. economy that had already been slowing. Dimon is the first CEO of a major Wall Street bank to publicly address Trump's sweeping tariff policy as global markets tumble. His remarks appear to backtrack earlier comments he made in January.</p>

          <p>A judge has ruled that the legal dispute between the UK government and Apple over data privacy cannot be held in secret. The Home Office seeks the right to access information secured by Apple's Advanced Data Protection (ADP) system, which Apple opposes due to concerns about creating a "backdoor" that could be exploited by hackers. The government argued that making the details public would damage national security, but the tribunal rejected this claim. Civil liberties groups have welcomed the ruling, emphasizing the importance of transparency in matters affecting data privacy.</p>
