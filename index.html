          <h2>Chevron Adjusts Share Buyback Strategy Amid Oil Price Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 10:06:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron plans to decrease its share buybacks in the second quarter due to declining crude oil prices influenced by President Trump's tariffs and OPEC+ production plans. The oil major will repurchase $2.5 billion to $3 billion of its stock, less than the $3.9 billion bought back in the first quarter, although overall repurchase guidance for the year remains between $10 billion and $20 billion. An RBC Capital Markets analyst noted this decision reflects a proactive approach to a deteriorating macroeconomic environment, as Chevron's net income decreased by more than 30% compared to the previous year.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced his administration's intention to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status, escalating his conflict with the Ivy League school over alleged antisemitism and discrimination. This action follows previous threats to withhold federal research grants unless the university makes significant changes, including increased administrative oversight. Harvard has already filed a lawsuit against the government in response to a freeze on $2.2 billion in grants, challenging the administration's authority and accusing it of improper overreach in its attempt to influence the university's policies.</p>

          <p>Former prosecutors and legal experts are raising concerns about the politicization of the Department of Justice (DoJ) under Attorney General Pam Bondi, alleging that it has become a tool for Donald Trump to target political opponents and reward allies. Critics point to the establishment of a "weaponization working group," the halting of major prosecutions, and the investigation of a Democratic fundraising vehicle as examples of this shift. They argue that the DoJ's focus on personal loyalty to Trump is undermining the rule of law and damaging its mission to protect justice.</p>

          <p>This article critiques Canada's long-held image as a progressive and tolerant nation, arguing that it is more of a carefully constructed myth than a reflection of reality. The author contends that Canada's leaders, including Justin Trudeau, have often prioritized maintaining this image over addressing internal issues such as broken promises to Indigenous communities and a foreign policy aligned with the United States. The article suggests that Canadians need to confront the truth about their country's history and current challenges rather than relying on myth-making to define their identity.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that he is "taking away" Harvard University's tax-exempt status, stating, "It's what they deserve." This decision is likely to face legal challenges, as Harvard's president has previously stated that such a move would be unlawful and endanger the university's educational mission. The announcement follows Trump's previous calls for Harvard to lose its tax-exempt status due to the university's stance on antisemitism and DEI policies, as well as the administration's freeze on over $2.2 billion in federal funding to the school.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is bracing for the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs on economic growth and inflation, which is influencing their decisions on interest rate cuts. A solid labor market has allowed the Fed to remain patient, but the uncertainty created by the tariffs is causing businesses to delay investments and slow hiring. The Fed is now assessing whether rising consumer prices are a temporary adjustment or a sign of persistent inflation, which will play a crucial role in determining future monetary policy.</p>

Temu and rival Shein previously relied on this exemption to sell and ship low-value items directly to the US without paying duties or import taxes, but the Trump administration has cracked down on the loophole, citing concerns about illegal goods and damage to American businesses.</p>
