          <p>The Keeneland September Yearling Sale, a major thoroughbred auction, achieved a record $531.7 million in gross sales, a significant increase from the previous year. Breeders and investors attribute the market's strength to renewed tax incentives, particularly the "bonus depreciation" benefit, which allows buyers to write off 100% of a racehorse purchase in the first year. This tax policy has fueled a speculative but highly active market, attracting both seasoned investors and new partnerships. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A landmark survey by the Office for Students in England has revealed that thousands of students are victims of sexual misconduct, with 14% of respondents reporting sexual violence, including sexual assault and unwanted touching.

          <p>A group of 46 House Democrats, led by Representative Ro Khanna, is sending a letter to the Trump administration urging the United States to formally recognize Palestinian statehood. The letter aligns with recent calls from several U.S. allies, including France and the U.K., and argues that acknowledging Palestinian rights is an urgent necessity for regional stability. The move highlights a growing sentiment within the Democratic party that is at odds with the current administration's stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

          <p>The Israel-Premier Tech cycling team is facing pressure from its title sponsors, Premier Tech and Factor Bikes, to change its name due to disruptions from pro-Palestinian protesters during the Vuelta a España. The sponsors argue that the "current situation is no longer sustainable," with Premier Tech threatening to end its association if the "Israel" branding is not dropped. The Israeli-registered team, owned by billionaire Sylvan Adams, has been a target of protests related to Israel's war in Gaza.</p>

          <p>A new generation of activists from French Polynesia is speaking out about the lasting health and environmental consequences of 193 French nuclear tests conducted in the region between 1966 and 1996. Parliamentarian Hinamoeura Morgant-Cross testified about disproportionately high cancer rates and birth defects that have affected her family and community for generations. Despite a 2021 acknowledgment from President Macron, victims face significant hurdles in receiving compensation, and activists are demanding better medical care and a formal apology from France.</p>

          <p>As American farmers begin their harvest, China's Ministry of Commerce has publicly called on the United States to cancel "unreasonable tariffs" to create conditions for resuming normal trade, particularly for soybeans. China, historically the largest buyer of U.S. soybeans, has not made any significant purchases this season, creating desperation in the American agricultural sector. The statement emphasizes that removing the tariffs is a necessary step to expand bilateral trade and stabilize the global economy.</p>

          <p>The UK government is exploring options to provide financial support to suppliers of Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) after a major cyber-attack forced the carmaker to halt production. With JLR's factories suspended until at least October, there are growing fears that smaller suppliers who rely on its business could face bankruptcy. Among the ideas being considered are government-backed loans or a scheme where the government would purchase and stockpile component parts, though suppliers have expressed skepticism about the logistics of such a plan.</p>

          <p>The article argues that the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has been weaponized by right-wing politicians and commentators to intensify a campaign against transgender people. Despite the shooter not being transgender, the narrative has been used to justify calls for institutionalization and to advance anti-LGBTQ+ legislative riders. The author asserts this has created a climate of fear, with the Trump administration now leveraging the event to push for policies targeting transgender rights, such as restrictions on passports and federal healthcare funding.</p>

          <p>Public health leaders are sounding the alarm over the Trump administration's budget proposal, which would slash funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) by 53%.

His agenda, which also includes promoting Turning Point USA chapters in high schools and curriculum changes questioning the 2020 election, has led to lawsuits and calls for his impeachment, even as Oklahoma schools rank near the bottom nationally.</p>
