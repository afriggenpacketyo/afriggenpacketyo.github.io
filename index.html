          <p>A confidential report by the United Nations nuclear watchdog reveals that Iran has increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, raising concerns internationally. As of May 17, Iran possesses 900.8 pounds of uranium enriched up to 60%, a nearly 50% increase since February, bringing it closer to weapons-grade levels. The IAEA has expressed serious concern, noting that Iran is the only non-nuclear-weapon state producing such material, which could potentially be used to create multiple atomic bombs if enriched further. Israel has called the report a clear warning sign that Iran is determined to complete its nuclear weapons program, urging international action to stop them.</p>

The incident occurred after Fulfer confronted the protesters, resulting in Ethan Kroll allegedly striking Fulfer with a flag pole. Fulfer sustained bruising and scrapes and responded by pepper-spraying Kroll, who then allegedly damaged Fulfer's car; police intervened and arrested Kroll on charges including assault with a deadly weapon.

          <p>The UK government plans to invest Â£1.5 billion in six new munitions and explosives factories to enhance its defense capabilities and deter adversaries. This investment aims to support the production of up to 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons and create approximately 1,800 new jobs across the country. The move comes as part of the Strategic Defence Review, prompted by lessons learned from the war in Ukraine, which highlighted deficiencies in Western weapons production. Ministers assert that this investment will strengthen the armed forces, boost the UK's economy, and ensure the country's security at home and abroad.</p>

          <p>Hamas has responded to a U.S.-led proposal for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza, seeking amendments to achieve a permanent end to hostilities, complete Israeli withdrawal, and unimpeded humanitarian aid. The group proposes releasing 10 living Israeli hostages and the remains of 18 others in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. However, a U.S. envoy deemed Hamas's response "totally unacceptable," while Hamas insists it is acting responsibly to meet the demands of its people. Meanwhile, the U.N. reports that aid trucks in Gaza are being stopped and offloaded by desperate civilians due to severe food shortages amid the ongoing conflict.</p>

The new vaccine allows for a lower dose due to its refined immune target and has demonstrated safety and effectiveness in studies.

          <p>Florida is bracing for a potentially dangerous hurricane season, which officially begins Sunday, with forecasters predicting an above-average number of storms. Factors such as hot Atlantic ocean temperatures and a lack of wind shear contribute to the increased risk, prompting officials to urge residents to prepare. The National Hurricane Center is introducing new forecast tools, including a more detailed cone graphic and a rip current risk map, to help the public stay informed and safe. Floridians are reminded to have emergency plans, supplies, and knowledge of evacuation routes in place to mitigate the potential impact of the storms.</p>

          <p>Hamas has responded to the US ceasefire proposal, indicating a willingness to release 10 living Israeli hostages and 18 dead hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, while requesting some amendments to the plan. The group insists on a permanent ceasefire, complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and guarantees for continuous humanitarian aid. However, the US has deemed the response "totally unacceptable," while Israel has accused Hamas of adhering to its refusal to compromise, this is a very difficult and complex situation. Caught between these two realities, Hamas, in effect, responded to the US proposal not with an answer - but with an entirely new counterproposal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Philippines' ambitious National Greening Program (NGP), aimed at reforesting the country, faces scrutiny due to allegations of greenwashing and ineffective implementation. Satellite data suggests that deforestation occurs on NGP sites, with native trees cleared to grow cash crops, undermining sustainable livelihoods. Communities often lack long-term access to the land and are forced to grow risky export crops, while protection areas designated for indigenous rainforests have little to no tree cover. Independent audits suggest deeper issues, including poor site selection and weak sustainability planning, remain unaddressed.</p>

Authorities issued warnings for the public to avoid the area, and beekeepers worked to recover as many bees as possible. The road was closed for about 24 hours to allow the bees to re-hive and find their queen bee, ensuring the safety of both the public and the bee population.

          <p>Germany is facing severe drought conditions following one of the driest springs on record, impacting agriculture, groundwater levels, and even retail prices. The lack of rain has led to exceptionally dry soil, increased wildfire risk, and low levels in major waterways like the Rhine, affecting transport costs. Experts warn that increasing global warming will exacerbate these issues, making it crucial to implement water conservation measures. Efforts to save water include retaining water on land, promoting drip irrigation in agriculture, and investing in drought-resistant plants, this will allow for better regulation of the use of the country's water supply.</p>

          <p>Delaying Medicare enrollment can lead to penalties that increase premiums for life, but there are exceptions for individuals covered by employer-provided health insurance. If you or a spouse is working for an employer with 20 or more employees, you can generally opt to keep the employer-provided health insurance and delay applying for Medicare without being penalized. Delaying Medicare enrollment also allows for continued contributions to a health savings account, which are no longer allowed once enrolled in Medicare. Consulting with the employer's benefits department is recommended to confirm appropriate coverage and eligibility for delaying application.</p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton has criticized the introduction of a new rule clamping down on front wing flexibility in Formula 1, calling it "a waste of money." The FIA imposed a stiffer load test to limit the aerodynamic advantage teams could gain from wing movement, but Hamilton argues it has changed nothing. He said teams have had to spend more money to make new wings that still bend, just less, and suggested the money could have been better used for charity. A new front wing in F1 costs approximately Â£100,000, in addition to research and development expenses.</p>
