          <h2>Congressional Republicans Shield Trump's Tariffs Amid Economic Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 08:00:06 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite mounting economic warning signs linked to Donald Trump's tariffs, Republican leaders in Congress are actively working to protect his signature trade policy. The White House issued a veto threat against a Senate resolution aimed at repealing the tariffs, and the House blocked consideration of the resolution. Critics, including Senator Ron Wyden, argue that the tariffs are destabilizing the economy and could lead to a recession, while Republicans like House Speaker Mike Johnson defend them as a strategic gamble that will ultimately benefit the U.S. by prompting trade renegotiations with numerous countries. The economic impact of the tariffs remains a contentious issue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study by Waymo analyzing 56.7 million miles driven by its autonomous vehicles in several cities reveals that self-driving cars could drastically reduce traffic fatalities. The study found significantly fewer airbag-deploying crashes, injury crashes, and pedestrian injuries compared to human drivers. Extrapolating the data across all vehicle miles driven in the U.S. suggests that autonomous vehicles could potentially save tens of thousands of lives annually. Despite caveats regarding weather conditions and geofenced areas, the article argues that slowing down the development and deployment of autonomous vehicles is costing lives due to the far greater carnage caused by human drivers.</p>

          <p>This article from The Atlantic argues that Donald Trump is undermining the rule of law through the Department of Justice by using it to target political opponents, reward allies, and eliminate internal dissent. Examples include investigations into former employees who became critics, interventions in state-level legal matters to align with Trump's agenda, and the pardoning of January 6 rioters. The author contends that Trump is replacing apolitical enforcement of the law with a system of personal loyalty, thereby threatening the foundations of American democracy. The article paints a bleak picture of the DOJ's future under Trump.</p>

          <p>Following significant losses in English local elections, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch cautioned against the idea that a change in leadership would solve the party's problems. Badenoch acknowledged that Reform UK had a successful night and emphasized the need for a slow and steady plan to regain government by the end of the decade. She stated that the party will focus on credible policies rather than rushing out untrue promises to win votes. While acknowledging that anything is feasible, Badenoch stated her job is to ensure that Reform UK leader Nigel Farage does not become prime minister.</p>

          <p>This article from The Guardian suggests that Donald Trump's chaotic policies are destabilizing the US economy, leading to uncertainty for businesses and consumers. While current economic data appears stable, forward-looking surveys reveal growing anxiety due to policy ambiguity regarding tariffs and federal budget cuts. The author argues that the uncertainty, rather than the specifics of Trump's policies, is driving much of the real economy impact. The article concludes that a more settled policy position is needed to avoid soaring prices and empty shelves.</p>

          <p>In this New York Times opinion piece, Ezra Klein argues that Donald Trump's choice of JD Vance as his vice president was a pivotal moment, indicating a significant change in the structure of Trump's administration. Unlike his first term, which involved uneasy alliances and internal checks, Trump's second term is characterized by a royal court of loyalists and enforcers. Klein suggests that this shift, evident in Vance's selection, demonstrates that Trump's presidency will be more reckless and uncompromising due to the absence of dissenting voices and the embrace of accelerationist policies.</p>

          <p>This article from The Guardian argues that Donald Trump's actions are undermining America's unique geographic security by threatening relationships with Canada and Mexico. Trump's rhetoric and policies, including potential military intervention in Mexico and territorial ambitions towards Canada, are alienating these key allies. The author suggests that these actions could lead to diminished security cooperation, economic disruption, and instability along the borders, ultimately jeopardizing American security and prosperity.</p>

          <h2>Native American Women Revitalize Traditional Facial Tattoos</h2>

          <p>Native American women are reclaiming and revitalizing traditional facial tattoos, known as inchunwa, as a symbol of cultural identity and commitment to their communities. The Inchunwa Project is supporting this revival, hosting retreats for artists and community members to research and practice the ancient art form. The tattoos, which carry deep cultural meanings and reflect personal promises, are seen as a way to honor ancestors and create a legacy for future generations. The practice underscores the belief that Indigenous culture is a living tradition, not a relic of the past.</p>

          <p>A historic $4bn settlement was unanimously approved by LA county officials to address nearly 7,000 claims of sexual assault at county-run facilities, but some victims express that the money cannot undo the decades of mistreatment. The claims, dating back to the 1950s through the 2000s, center around facilities like the MacLaren children's center, where victims report being drugged and abused by carers. Despite reforms and a hotline to report child sexual assault, some victims say closure will not come until those responsible are held accountable.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is in a difficult position as the Fed considers whether to hold interest rates steady. While officials are inclined to maintain current rates due to inflation concerns, President Donald Trump and others are pushing for a rate cut to stimulate the economy. Strong job growth data provides some support for the Fed's stance, but uncertainty surrounding trade policies and potential tariff increases complicate the economic outlook. The Fed's decision will have significant implications for the US economy and financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK party made significant gains in English local elections, signaling a potential disruption of the country's traditional two-party system. The Conservatives suffered losses, and Labour was punished by voters, creating an opening for smaller parties. Reform UK's success, fueled by Farage's campaigning, could challenge the dominance of Labour and the Conservatives, leading to a more fragmented political landscape. The article discusses the potential implications for both major parties and the changing dynamics of British politics.</p>
