        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Trump has proposed a plan to end the war in Ukraine, contingent on all NATO members ceasing their purchases of Russian oil. In a letter, he stated his readiness to impose "major sanctions" on Russia and suggested 50% to 100% tariffs on China for its procurement of Russian petroleum. This proposal comes amid heightened tensions following recent Russian drone incursions into the airspace of NATO members Poland and Romania, which have put the alliance on high alert. Trump's strategy aims to weaken Russia's negotiating position by cutting off its primary revenue sources.</p>

          <p>Customs officers in Hamburg, Germany, successfully seized over 400 kilograms of cocaine and arrested two men involved in the smuggling attempt. The operation was initiated after observant dock workers noticed two unauthorized individuals carrying more than 20 sports bags from a ship to a car and alerted the authorities. This significant seizure highlights the ongoing issue of Hamburg's port being a major entry point for illegal drugs into Europe. The incident underscores the effectiveness of local vigilance in combating large-scale international drug trafficking operations.</p>

          <p>The long throw-in is experiencing a tactical renaissance in the Premier League, with Brentford FC emerging as the masters of this disruptive strategy. The team has scored seven goals from long throws since the start of last season, significantly more than any other club in the league. A recent late goal against Chelsea, originating from a Kevin Schade throw, highlighted its effectiveness in creating chaos for defending teams. Coaches and pundits note that the unusual angle and trajectory of a long throw are difficult to prepare for, making it a surprisingly potent offensive tool.</p>

          <p>A large-scale protest organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson drew an estimated 110,000 to 150,000 people to central London, resulting in violent confrontations with law enforcement. Tensions flared when some protesters attempted to breach police lines, throwing bottles and other objects, which led to injuries for 26 police officers, four of them serious. The Metropolitan Police made 25 arrests for various offenses, condemning the "wholly unacceptable" violence. A smaller counter-protest organized by Stand Up To Racism also took place nearby, separated by a heavy police presence.</p>

This decision overturns a decades-long ban and is intended to promote self-sufficiency among the refugee population, especially after significant cuts in international food aid from donors like the United States. The move has been praised by the UN Refugee Agency as a "turning point" that could allow refugees to support their families, contribute to the local economy, and set a positive example for refugee management in the region.</p>

          <p>The forced relocation of thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia since the 2022 invasion remains a severe humanitarian crisis and a major obstacle in peace negotiations. Ukraine demands their return, labeling the act a war crime, a view supported by the International Criminal Court, which has issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin. Russia denies the allegations of abduction, claiming its forces "rescued" the children. Despite international pressure and the efforts of organizations like Save Ukraine, the process of repatriating these children is slow and fraught with bureaucratic hurdles.</p>

          <p>Russia and its ally Belarus have started their large-scale joint military exercises, known as "Zapad 2025," at a time of heightened tensions with neighboring NATO countries. The drills are being conducted near the borders of Poland, Latvia, and Lithuania, simulating defensive operations and rehearsing missile strikes, including with nuclear-capable systems. The exercises are causing significant concern in the West, particularly after a recent incident where Russian drones entered Polish airspace, prompting Poland to close its border with Belarus and launch its own parallel military drills in response.</p>

          <p>The FBI is offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information that leads to the arrest of a man suspected of firing a gun at federal law enforcement officers.

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has condemned the recent entry of Russian drones into Polish airspace as an "unacceptable and unfortunate and dangerous development." While Rubio confirmed the drones were launched intentionally, he clarified that it is not yet certain whether they were deliberately directed into Poland's territory, a distinction that would determine if the act was a major escalation. His statement comes after Poland shot down the drones and publicly contradicted President Trump's suggestion that the incursion might have been an accident, highlighting the seriousness of the event for the NATO alliance.</p>

          <p>Immigration attorneys and advocates are expressing urgent concern that the U.S. government is planning to deport approximately 1,000 unaccompanied migrant children from Central America without allowing them to complete their immigration court proceedings. These fears have intensified after a planned deportation of 76 Guatemalan children was narrowly halted by a federal judge's emergency order. Advocates believe the government is now preparing to remove children from Honduras and El Salvador, potentially returning them to the dangerous conditions they originally fled, in violation of their legal rights.</p>

          <p>New reports indicate that the office of UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer specifically questioned Lord Peter Mandelson about his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein before appointing him as ambassador to the United States. This inquiry was made after initial vetting flagged the connection. However, Mandelson was fired this week after newly surfaced emails revealed he sent supportive messages to Epstein after his 2008 conviction. The revelation raises serious questions about the thoroughness of the government's vetting process and the Prime Minister's judgment in making the high-profile appointment.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has proposed a $3.1 million fine against Boeing for a series of safety and quality-control failures. The penalty addresses hundreds of violations discovered between late 2023 and early 2024, including those connected to the January incident where a door plug panel blew off an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9 mid-flight. The FAA's findings point to significant lapses at both Boeing's production facility and at its subcontractor, Spirit AeroSystems. Boeing has stated it is reviewing the proposed penalty and is working to improve its safety culture.</p>
