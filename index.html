          <p>President Trump's imposition of a 10% tariff on imports from many countries has taken effect, marking a significant shift in global trade policy.

Higher tariffs are due to take effect next week, impacting the European Union and China significantly.&#x20; The administration has released a list of exempted product categories, including crude oil and pharmaceuticals, while investigating other sectors for further national security tariffs.&#x20; (*not investment advice*)</p>

Tossici-Bolt held a sign offering conversation outside a clinic in Bournemouth. Buffer zones prohibiting protest around abortion services were introduced nationally in October 2024.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's unofficial "department of government efficiency" (Doge) is targeting the Peace Corps, potentially eyeing cuts to the agency's budget and programs. A Doge representative visited Peace Corps headquarters seeking access to financial records. The Peace Corps has been notified to cooperate with Doge workers, raising concerns about potential budget cuts and program cancellations. The agency has long enjoyed bipartisan support since its inception in 1961.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration mistakenly sent notices to some Ukrainian refugees stating that their legal status was being revoked and ordering them to leave the U.S. immediately. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) attributed the message to an error and retracted the email. However, advocates remain concerned that officials may attempt to strip Ukrainians of their legal status in the future. The Trump administration has suspended admissions under the Uniting for Ukraine program and status renewals for those already in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The Dodgers suffered their first loss of the season against the Philadelphia Phillies, with a final score of 3-2. The Dodgers' perfect start to the season ended as they struggled to capitalize on opportunities and made costly base-running mistakes. Despite a two-run ninth-inning homer from Tommy Edman, the Dodgers couldn't complete the comeback. The Phillies handed the defending World Series champions their first defeat, dropping the Dodgers to 8-1.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors are seeking a more than seven-year prison sentence for former congressman George Santos after he pleaded guilty to federal fraud and identity theft charges. The US attorney for the eastern district of New York argued that Santos' "unparalleled crimes" had "made a mockery" of the country's election system. Prosecutors noted that Santos had been "unrepentant and defiant" for years, dismissing the prosecution as a “witch-hunt” and refusing to resign from Congress as his web of lies was debunked.</p>
