          <p>Israel launched a series of airstrikes against Iran, targeting locations it claims are related to Iran's nuclear program, resulting in the deaths of key Iranian military and scientific figures, including Mohammad Hossein Bagheri, chief of the Iranian Armed Forces, and two leading nuclear scientists. In response, Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, vowed retaliation, while Israel's Defense Minister Israel Katz declared a state of emergency, anticipating missile and drone attacks. The United States stated it did not participate in the military operation but was briefed beforehand, emphasizing its priority to protect American forces in the region. Oil prices surged, and U.S. stock futures fell amid fears of a broader regional war, while Iran launched approximately 100 drones toward Israeli territory in retaliation. The situation presents a grave escalation in Middle Eastern tensions. Optimism for de-escalation seems low given the high stakes and immediate retaliatory actions. </p>

          <p>This Kyodo News digest covers several key international and domestic issues for Japan, including Japan's condemnation of Israel's attack on Iran as an "escalating situation," with Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya pledging diplomatic efforts to prevent further deterioration. Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's top negotiator, expressed hope for special treatment from the United States regarding tariffs after clinching a deal, following hints from U.S. President Donald Trump about raising auto tariffs. Additionally, Defense Minister Gen Nakatani criticized China's blaming Japan for close air encounters and the digest notes Japan's instruction to airlines to check Boeing 787s after the Air India crash. The diverse news items show the range of international and domestic issues affecting Japan. The tone is largely neutral, reflecting the standard reporting of facts. </p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-13 02:00:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the United States' imposition of tariffs on imports from China, Beijing has been encouraging Chinese exporters to focus on the domestic market using letters of credit (L/Cs). Domestic L/Cs function similarly to international ones, ensuring payment security and enhancing credit for Chinese firms, with payment periods generally set at one year. Unlike international L/Cs, domestic L/Cs can also be used for trade in services, providing flexibility for businesses adapting to the trade war. This strategy reflects China's efforts to mitigate the impact of tariffs by boosting internal demand and supporting its export-oriented industries. The situation is a pragmatic response to economic pressures. </p>

          <p>The Mechanical Engineering Industry Association (VDMA) in Germany is urging the EU to implement trade barriers to protect German manufacturers from Chinese competition due to what they perceive as unfair state subsidies. Representing medium-sized manufacturers, the VDMA's call marks a shift from previously lauding the Sino-German economic relationship. The association claims that Chinese companies are heavily subsidized and disregard technical regulations, leading to unfair competition. The VDMA insists it is ready to compete on a level playing field but believes government intervention is necessary to address the current imbalances. The call to action suggests a deteriorating economic relationship. </p>

          <p>Japan is hoping to secure special treatment from the United States regarding tariffs, as stated by Tokyo's top negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, after U.S. President Donald Trump hinted at further increases in import levies on cars. Akazawa is visiting Washington for negotiations ahead of a potential meeting between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Trump at the G7 summit, aiming to make progress on tariff concessions. Trump's recent statements about raising auto tariffs to attract more investment in American manufacturing are a concern for Japan's automotive industry. Japan is seeking the removal of sector-based and reciprocal tariffs, while the U.S. aims to reduce its trade deficit with Japan. The negotiations suggest ongoing economic tensions. </p>

          <p>Asian markets opened lower and oil prices surged following Israel's attack on Iran, reflecting concerns over escalating tensions in the Middle East. U.S. benchmark crude oil and Brent crude both experienced significant increases, while Tokyo's Nikkei 225, Seoul's Kospi, Hong Kong's Hang Seng, and the Shanghai Composite Index all retreated. Despite the initial shock, some analysts predict Asian markets will recover quickly due to limited exposure to the conflict and growing ties with Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The previous day, U.S. stock indexes had ticked higher following encouraging inflation data, with Oracle's strong performance offsetting losses from Boeing after the Air India crash.

          <p>This article analyzes Israel's decision to launch a broad attack on Iran, suggesting it was a preventive war aimed at eliminating the Iranian nuclear program. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated Israel would continue attacking to remove the Iranian nuclear threat, claiming Iran was in a late-stage rush to assemble nuclear weapons. The article argues that Israel's actions stem from a shift in circumstances, including the weakening of Iran's regional influence and deterrent power. By attacking Iranian soldiers abroad and openly on Iranian territory, Israel diminished Iran's ability to bargain or threaten, leading Iran to potentially seek real nuclear statehood. The analysis suggests Israel's actions carry risks but were deemed necessary to counter the perceived existential threat. </p>

Indian officials are assessing how India Rare Earths, a government-owned company, can increase rare earth magnet production, with Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal calling China's export pause a "wake-up call." Experts suggest India could become an important alternative to China for partners like the U.S., but significant public and private investment is needed. China currently dominates rare earth production and processing, giving it leverage over minerals crucial for modern technologies. The initiative could reduce global reliance on China. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to John Reade, a market strategist with the World Gold Council, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and stablecoins do not pose a threat to gold's role as a safe-haven investment. He argues that cryptocurrencies tend to move in tandem with equities, unlike gold, which typically acts as a hedge during market volatility. Reade emphasizes that digital assets do not represent any risks or comparison to gold, dismissing the notion of them being "gold 2.0." His comments come amid growing market interest in stablecoins and other digital currencies, alongside a fresh rally in gold prices due to Middle East tensions. The analyst's comments highlight the stability of gold in uncertain times. </p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has granted a stay, temporarily halting a lower court order that would have returned control of the California National Guard to Governor Gavin Newsom from President Trump. The decision allows Trump to maintain control of the troops deployed in Los Angeles amid protests over immigration enforcement, pending a hearing on the matter set for June 17. Earlier, a federal judge had ruled that Trump's federalization of the National Guard was unlawful, prompting Newsom to celebrate what he called a victory for democracy. The appeals court's intervention prolongs the legal and political battle over federal authority in California. </p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily paused a court order that would have required President Trump to return control of the California National Guard troops in Los Angeles to Gov. Gavin Newsom. The 9th Circuit's emergency stay came after a U.S. District Judge ruled that Trump's mobilization of Guard members amid protests over immigration raids was unlawful. The appeals court scheduled a hearing for Tuesday, meaning the National Guard will remain federalized through the weekend. Newsom, who filed the lawsuit, called the initial ruling a win for democracy, while the Trump administration filed a notice of appeal. The legal battle underscores tensions between state and federal authority. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes Israel's recent attacks on Iran, characterizing them as a preventive war rather than a preemptive strike, which carries significant moral and practical risks. The author contrasts preemptive attacks, which thwart imminent threats, with preventive attacks, which remove the source of a threat on one's own terms. Israel's actions, aimed at eliminating the existential threat from Iran, are compared to historical examples of preventive wars, such as the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the American war on Iraq. The author concludes that while the Israeli campaign may be necessary, it bears immense danger and uncertainty. The analysis highlights the complex justifications. </p>
