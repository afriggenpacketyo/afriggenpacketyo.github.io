          <p>The United States and the European Union have successfully negotiated a new trade deal, establishing a 15% tariff on most EU goods exported to the US. This agreement, reached between President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen, averts a potential trade war and the threatened 30% tariff rate. The deal also includes a commitment from the EU to invest hundreds of billions in US energy and military equipment, aiming to rebalance the trade relationship. While both leaders hailed the agreement as a victory, the full details and long-term benefits for each side are still being analyzed.</p>

          <p>Human rights organizations in Argentina, many located at the former ESMA detention center, are facing extensive layoffs and budget cuts under President Javier Milei's austerity measures. These groups, including the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, have been crucial in documenting the crimes of the country's former military dictatorship and searching for children stolen at birth. The funding cuts threaten to dismantle decades of work in preserving memory, seeking justice, and educating the public about the "disappeared." Activists and survivors are protesting the measures, fearing the destruction of these vital institutions.</p>

          <p>A 60 Minutes report details the emotional story of Mariana Eva Pérez, who, after a lifelong search, found her brother who was stolen at birth during Argentina's military dictatorship. Her parents were "disappeared" in 1978, and her newborn brother, Guillermo, was given to a military-affiliated family. The story chronicles their meeting, the painful revelation of his true identity confirmed by a DNA test, and the complex aftermath of rebuilding a relationship fractured by trauma. The account highlights the enduring legacy of the dictatorship and the work of groups like the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo.</p>

          <p>This article recounts the extraordinary investigation that led to the discovery of a Skyvan PA-51 airplane used by Argentina's military dictatorship for "death flights." Journalist Miriam Lewin and photographer Giancarlo Ceraudo tracked down the plane, which was used to drop political prisoners alive into the Atlantic Ocean. By deciphering its flight logs, they provided crucial evidence for the prosecution of military officials, proving the fate of a group of abducted mothers and nuns. The plane has now been returned to Argentina and stands as a chilling, irrefutable monument to state-sponsored terror.</p>

The author suggests the market may be reacting to the complexity of the conglomerate's planned breakup into three separate companies, a process that can create investor impatience. Despite the stock's puzzling drop, the author maintains conviction in the company's long-term value, citing its strong position in aerospace, automation, and materials. The piece argues against selling based on frustration, drawing parallels to past missed opportunities with companies like Oracle. (not investment advice)</p>

The deal, which sets a 15% tariff on many EU goods, is seen as a personal achievement for President Trump, who has consistently sought to renegotiate US trade relationships. However, questions linger about the specifics of the EU's investment commitments and how much the deal truly addresses the US trade deficit.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Dustin May delivered a disappointing performance in a 4-3 loss to the Boston Red Sox, fueling speculation about his future with the team ahead of the trade deadline. May, who is in his final year before free agency, allowed four runs over five innings, undone by a three-run fifth inning. With the Dodgers needing to make room in their rotation for a returning starter, and with May's inconsistent season, his name has emerged in trade rumors. The start served as a final data point for the front office as it weighs its options.</p>

          <p>Jordan and the UAE have resumed aid airdrops into Gaza after Israel announced a daily "tactical pause" in military operations in some areas to allow humanitarian convoys to pass. The move comes as the World Health Organization warns of "alarming levels" of malnutrition in the Strip, with a quarter of the population facing famine-like conditions. However, the pause has been met with skepticism, as medics reported nine people were killed by Israeli fire near an aid route. Israel faces intense international pressure to allow more aid into the territory to address the escalating humanitarian crisis.</p>
