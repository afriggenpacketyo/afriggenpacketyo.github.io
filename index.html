          <p>The weakening U.S. dollar presents a mixed bag for global central banks, offering relief from dollar-denominated debt burdens and import inflation while complicating export competitiveness, especially amid renewed U.S. tariffs. Some central banks, like the ECB, have used this opportunity to cut rates, while others, particularly in emerging markets, must carefully balance devaluation risks with potential capital flight and inflation. Currency devaluation is being considered in emerging markets, but there are concerns about retaliation from the U.S. and potential instability. The preferred approach for now is avoiding a currency war to maintain economic stability. Optimism score: 60</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods, now at a cumulative 145%, are significantly impacting dropshipping businesses that rely on sourcing products from China. The elimination of the de minimis exemption, which previously allowed duty-free entry for shipments valued at $800 or less, further exacerbates the situation. Dropshippers are experiencing decreased revenue, inspection delays, and products stuck at borders, leading to customer refunds and a shift towards European markets.
