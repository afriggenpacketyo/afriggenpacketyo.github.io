          <h2>US and China Prepare for Tariff Talks Amid Trade War</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and China are set to engage in trade talks in Geneva, marking their first formal discussions since tariff increases brought bilateral goods shipments to a standstill. However, analysts suggest that significant obstacles remain, making a swift or substantial agreement unlikely. Key points of contention include differing perspectives on which side initiated the talks and disagreements over the terms of any potential deal. Despite these challenges, the meeting is seen as a preliminary step toward future negotiations between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, and Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng.</p>

          <h2>Bank of England Cuts Interest Rates Amid Global Economic Uncertainty</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 09:59:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England has reduced interest rates to 4.25%, marking the fourth cut in the past year, driven by a slowdown in inflation. Governor Andrew Bailey cited concerns about the unpredictable global economy, particularly US tariffs, while acknowledging the potential impact of a UK-US trade deal. The decision was not unanimous, with the rate-setting committee divided between a larger cut and no change, reflecting concerns about the global trade war's potential hit to economic growth being offset by lower energy bills and inflation. This move aims to balance controlling inflation with supporting economic growth, as the UK anticipates stronger growth in the first quarter, influenced by US firms stockpiling goods before tariffs take effect.</p>

          <p>This article explores the science behind mRNA vaccines, addressing concerns about their safety and potential. Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries information from DNA to create proteins within our cells, with mRNA vaccines using strands of mRNA to code for viral proteins, triggering an immune response without altering a person's DNA. The article emphasizes that mRNA vaccines have been studied for decades and are now being explored for various diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disorders. Despite some lawmakers pushing to ban them and the government cutting funding, scientists maintain that mRNA therapies hold great potential.</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated Dr. Casey Means, a proponent of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) agenda, as the next U.S. Surgeon General, replacing Dr. Janette Nesheiwat. Means, known for advocating for addressing the root causes of chronic diseases and co-founding the health app Levels, aligns with Kennedy's views on the impact of food and lifestyle choices on health. While Means supports vaccine safety, some anti-vaccine advocates express concern over her focus on nutrition over vaccine bans, indicating a potential shift in the administration's health priorities.</p>
