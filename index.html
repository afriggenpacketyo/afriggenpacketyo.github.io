        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ceasefire negotiations in Qatar between Israel and Hamas are reportedly on the verge of collapse, according to Palestinian officials. The primary points of contention include the mechanisms for humanitarian aid distribution and the extent of the Israeli military's withdrawal from Gaza. Palestinian sources accused the Israeli delegation of stalling the talks and presenting contradictory proposals, particularly regarding the size of a proposed buffer zone. The lack of progress has diminished hopes for an imminent 60-day truce and hostage release deal.</p>

          <p>Jane Ragsdale, the well-regarded owner and director of the Heart O' the Hills camp for girls, was among the victims of the catastrophic July Fourth flood in Kerrville, Texas. Ragsdale, who was in her late 60s, was known for her generosity, leadership, and deep involvement in the community. Friends and residents remember her as an institutional figure who taught generations of girls essential life skills and was a source of inspiration. Her death represents a significant loss for a community now facing a monumental rebuilding effort after the devastating floods.</p>

          <p>A Chinese academic journal article suggests that the growing "uneasy alliance" between American tech titans and the "Make America Great Again" movement could reshape U.S. politics and intensify the tech rivalry with China. The analysis points to increasing cooperation between the tech and defense industries, potentially creating "tech hawks" who advocate for a more assertive stance against Beijing. While most of Trump's tech supporters favor continued pressure on China's technological development, the article notes that internal tensions could undermine this effort to influence U.S. foreign policy.</p>

          <p>Narciso Barranco, an undocumented immigrant and father of three U.S. Marines, is set to be released on bond after being detained for 20 days. Barranco's case gained national attention after a video went viral showing masked federal agents violently tackling and beating him in Orange County. His family states he was pepper-sprayed and suffered injuries, including a possible concussion, and they plan to seek medical care for him upon his release. An immigration judge ordered his release on a $3,000 bond while his application for parole-in-place is pending.</p>

          <p>A mother in central Gaza is grieving after an Israeli airstrike killed two of her young sons and her niece as they waited for nutritional supplements outside a health clinic. Her youngest son was also critically injured in the blast, which killed 16 people in total, including 10 children. The Israeli military stated it targeted a "Hamas terrorist" and that the incident was under review, while the aid group running the clinic condemned it as a violation of international law. The tragedy highlights the daily dangers faced by civilians seeking basic necessities amid the ongoing conflict and aid crisis.</p>

          <p>A proposal by the Czech Republic's Railway Authority to dismantle and replace a 123-year-old railway bridge in Prague is facing strong opposition. Critics, including architects and heritage campaigners, argue the iconic Vysehrad bridge is a crucial part of the city's panorama and can be repaired, not replaced. The Railway Authority contends that the corroded bridge cannot handle projected increases in rail traffic and a new bridge with a third track is necessary. The debate pits the needs of modern transportation against the preservation of a historic landmark, a common dilemma in the architecturally rich city.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has laid off 1,353 civil and foreign service employees as part of a major reorganization under the Trump administration aimed at reducing its workforce. The cuts have significantly impacted bureaus focused on human rights, refugee assistance, and foreign aid, including nearly all civil service officers in the office that resettles refugees. Critics, including Democratic senators and employee associations, argue the indiscriminate cuts will undermine U.S. diplomacy and national security, while the administration claims they are necessary to streamline a bloated bureaucracy.</p>

The resort's construction, which occurred rapidly, has drawn criticism from human rights groups over the alleged use of "shock brigades" of forced laborers who faced brutal conditions. Defectors and experts have described a system where workers endured long hours and inadequate provisions, and local residents were displaced without compensation to make way for the development.</p>

          <p>Scientists are expressing alarm over an intense and prolonged marine heatwave in the western Mediterranean Sea, where surface temperatures have exceeded 30°C, several degrees above normal for the time of year.

Ecologists fear the conditions could lead to mass mortality events and impact fish stocks, highlighting the Mediterranean's vulnerability as a "climate change hotspot."</p>

          <p>A senior Trump administration official has accused Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell of mismanaging an "ostentatious" office renovation, adding a new line of attack in the ongoing conflict over interest rates. The Office of Management and Budget sent a letter questioning the project's costs and suggesting it may be violating federal law by deviating from approved plans. This criticism comes as President Trump continues to pressure Powell to lower interest rates, a move the independent central bank has so far resisted to prevent potential inflation.

The president praised the heroism of first responders but dismissed a question about the adequacy of early warnings as "evil."
