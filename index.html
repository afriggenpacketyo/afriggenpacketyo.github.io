          <p>The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is facing criticism for allegedly publishing misleading or inaccurate claims on its "Wall of Receipts," which touts purported savings for American taxpayers. CBS News identified errors involving a $38.7 million contract for wastewater monitoring for COVID, where DOGE claimed $38 million in savings from canceling it. However, the contract was merely modified, not canceled. Critics, like Nat Malkus from the American Enterprise Institute, suggest the actual savings are significantly lower than the claimed $170 billion, adding that DOGE also appears to have deleted 96 contracts posted before May 4 totaling $124.7 million in purported savings.</p>

          <p>A federal court held its first hearing on President Trump's tariffs, raising questions about their legality. The judges on the US Court of International Trade seemed troubled by the administration’s claim that the judiciary may not review the legality of the tariffs at all. The case, V.O.S. Selections v. Trump, centers on whether the tariffs meet the criteria of an "unusual and extraordinary threat" as required by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977. The court's decision could impact all of the tariffs Trump has imposed since retaking office.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are advancing their bill to fund President Trump's agenda, which includes Medicaid cuts, despite internal disagreements. The bill proposes work requirements for Medicaid recipients, more frequent eligibility checks, and restrictions on funding for organizations that offer abortion services. Some Republicans, like Rep. Chip Roy, have expressed opposition to the proposals, while Democrats are challenging the efforts to cut Medicaid. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would save $880 billion over the next decade but leave 8.6 million more Americans uninsured.</p>

Investors are also concerned about Hertz's plan to offer fewer cars for rent as it deals with lower bookings and President Donald Trump's auto tariffs that have impacted new and used vehicle prices for many models.</p>

Cricket is similar to baseball, with a bat and ball, but the bowler tries to hit the wicket behind the batsman. Runs are scored by hitting the ball across the boundary or running between the pitches. A super over is a tie-breaker where each team bowls six balls to score the most runs. India is favored over the United States in their upcoming match.</p>

While cooling inflation typically leads to a dip in gold prices, gold has remained strong due to geopolitical tensions, central bank demand, and concerns about a potential recession. Lower inflation may prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, which could make other investments more appealing compared to gold.
