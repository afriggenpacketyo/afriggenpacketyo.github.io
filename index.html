          <p>President Trump and his advisors are standing firm on imposing tariffs on imports despite significant market downturns and widespread concerns about a potential trade war. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent dismissed recession fears, calling the situation an "adjustment process," while Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed the 10% baseline tariff is in effect and steeper reciprocal tariffs are on track. Kevin Hassett claimed over 50 countries are seeking trade negotiations with the US, while China announced a 34% tariff on US imports. &#x3C;br&#x3E;UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer voiced concerns about the global economic outlook, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is scheduled to meet with Trump for trade talks. &#x3Cbr&#x3E;</p>

          <p>Newly qualified medical students in the UK are facing uncertainty as they are not being told their job locations until weeks before they start. This is due to a new system of allocating foundation jobs, which has resulted in some students not getting their preferred locations. The British Medical Association has accused the government of failing to plan for the increase in resident doctors after increasing the number of medical school places. &#x3Cbr&#x3E; The BMA fears that students will move abroad due to this uncertainty. &#x3Cbr&#x3E;</p>

          <p>President Trump urged Americans to "hang tough" as the 10% universal tariffs on imports took effect. He called the implementation of tariffs an "economic revolution," stating that it will bring back jobs and businesses. The tariffs are intended to revitalize American manufacturing, create jobs, and generate federal revenue. &#x3Cbr&#x3E; China has retaliated by imposing a 34% tariff on imports of all U.S. products starting April 10. &#x3Cbr&#x3E;</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs has lowered its 2025 growth forecast for Chinese stocks, citing the impact of President Trump's tariffs. The investment bank cut its 12-month growth estimate for the MSCI China Index to 10% from 16%, and for the CSI 300 Index to 17% from 19%. The revision reflects a "high degree of uncertainty as [a] new trade war and possible negotiations unfold." &#x3Cbr&#x3E; China quickly retaliated by applying 34 per cent tariffs on all US imports. &#x3Cbr&#x3E; (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has appealed a U.S. Department of Agriculture decision to end funding for California’s Local Food Purchase Assistance (LFPA) Program. Newsom called the move "irrational and malicious" and said it would hurt farmers and families who need food banks. The USDA's program began doling out grants to states and tribal governments in 2022, in an attempt to decentralize and diversify food supply chains after the strain of the pandemic. &#x3Cbr&#x3E; The move has left many farmers reeling. &#x3Cbr&#x3E;</p>
