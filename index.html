          <h2>Federal Reserve Holds Steady on Interest Rates Amid Trade Policy Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 20:00:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to keep interest rates unchanged, maintaining the federal funds rate range at 4.25% to 4.5%. This decision comes as the central bank assesses the potential economic impacts of President Trump's trade policies, particularly tariffs. Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted concerns about rising risks to higher inflation and unemployment due to these policies. The Fed aims to remain flexible, ready to cut rates if unemployment rises or hike them if inflation reignites, reflecting a cautious, wait-and-see approach amid economic uncertainty. Wall Street analysts interpreted Powell's comments as signaling an increased risk of stagflation.</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated Dr. Casey Means, a wellness influencer with ties to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as the new surgeon general, replacing his initial pick. Dr. Means, known for promoting natural foods and lifestyle changes, aims to eradicate chronic disease and improve American health. She has criticized the medical establishment and advocates for dietary supplements and alternative health products. Means' nomination signals a shift towards a "make America healthy again" agenda, focusing on nutrition and wellness over traditional medical approaches, though some experts find her views overly simplistic.</p>

          <p>President Trump criticized California Governor Gavin Newsom after Newsom proposed a federal film tax credit to revitalize the American film industry. This proposal follows Trump's announcement of 100% tariffs on films produced outside the U.S., aimed at reviving the struggling domestic film industry. Trump attributed the industry's decline to Newsom's "gross incompetence" and vowed to bring it back. Despite the criticism, Trump acknowledged a good relationship with Newsom and mentioned providing water to California during wildfires, highlighting a complex dynamic between the two leaders.</p>

          <p>New York State health authorities reported 25 pediatric deaths from influenza during the 2024-25 flu season, marking a significant increase compared to recent years. This surge in deaths is attributed to declining vaccination rates and the circulation of more intense flu strains. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates over 47 million people nationwide contracted the flu, with hospitalization rates reaching a 15-year high. The state health commissioner emphasized that only one of the deceased children was vaccinated, highlighting the critical importance of vaccinations, especially as misinformation continues to fuel vaccine hesitancy.</p>

The district's move follows a similar decision by MSAD No. 70, reflecting increasing local opposition to the state's inclusive policies.

          <p>Economists are turning to unconventional indicators to gauge the impact of President Trump's trade wars, as mainstream economic data has been slow to reflect the changes. Evidence such as declining spending at McDonald's, fewer container ships at the Port of Los Angeles, and companies shifting production out of China are being closely monitored. The Federal Reserve, which held interest rates steady, is also watching for signs that the economy is changing direction faster than traditional indicators can capture. This approach mirrors tactics used during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, as economists seek early warnings of potential economic shifts.</p>

          <p>Binyamin Appelbaum argues that the charitable tax deduction in the U.S. distorts philanthropy by disproportionately benefiting wealthier donors and the charities they support. He points out that those with higher incomes receive larger tax deductions for their donations, while most Americans receive no federal tax benefit at all. Appelbaum suggests reforms such as replacing the charitable deduction with a tax credit or government matching system, ensuring that every donated dollar receives the same federal subsidy, regardless of the donor's income. This would reduce the incentive for charities to cater primarily to wealthy donors.</p>

          <p>Top advisers, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, sent President Trump a plan to create a U.S. sovereign wealth fund, but the White House has rejected parts of the proposal. The fund, intended to generate public windfalls from investments, faces debates over its mechanics and spending priorities. While Trump has suggested the fund could own a stake in TikTok, the White House has expressed concerns about the Treasury's approach. Despite the pushback, the administration remains committed to exploring tools to safeguard America's national and economic security.</p>

A former Syrian military driver, Abu Ali, has come forward to describe transporting corpses to mass grave sites during the Assad regime. The new government prioritizes transitional justice, but many Syrians remain frustrated by the slow progress in identifying missing relatives after years of civil war.</p>

The proposed cuts target programs related to climate change, sustainability, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), and LGBTQ+ initiatives. The administration has already closed the National Park Service Academy and suspended air quality monitoring programs. Critics warn that these cuts could jeopardize the preservation of national parks, land management, and fire reduction efforts, as well as negatively impact rural economies dependent on park-related tourism.</p>

While the risk to people on the ground is low, the capsule could land anywhere between 51.7Â° north and south latitude, covering most of the inhabited world.

Economic uncertainty, including President Trump's tariff policy, may influence the MPC's decisions regarding future rate cuts.</p>
