        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the issue of young offenders being denied credit for "dead time" spent in juvenile detention, unlike the adult system where time awaiting trial counts towards the sentence. It highlights that in many states, the time kids spend in detention doesn't count toward any incarceration they may face, adding months to their confinement. The article presents arguments from policy experts and attorneys who believe this practice leads to a lopsided application of fundamental rights and disparities between how young people are treated in different states. It discusses the rehabilitative focus of the juvenile justice system and how it ironically contributes to the denial of time credit, as the system prioritizes rehabilitation over punishment. </p>
