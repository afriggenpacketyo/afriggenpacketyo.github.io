          <p>The White House has confirmed that a military parade will be held on June 14 to celebrate the US Army's 250th anniversary, which also happens to be President Donald Trump's 79th birthday. The event, featuring thousands of soldiers, vehicles, and aircraft, will take place on the National Mall in Washington DC. Trump had previously proposed a similar parade during his first term but scrapped it due to cost concerns. Additionally, Trump announced plans to rename Veterans Day as "Victory Day for World War I" and VE Day as "Victory Day for World War II", although it remains unclear if these will become federal holidays.</p>

          <p>Australians are participating in a national election where President Trump's policies are playing a significant role, mirroring trends observed in Canada's recent elections. Opposition leader Peter Dutton's campaign has echoed Trump's messaging, focusing on economic issues, which has proven unpopular among the Australian public. While Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has adopted a moderate stance towards Trump, the president's unpopularity in Australia is expected to impact the election results, potentially leading to a minority government. The close security relationship between Australia and the U.S., formalized through AUKUS, underscores the importance of Canberra demonstrating its commitment to defense spending to counter China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's family's net worth has reportedly increased by $2.9 billion due to investments in crypto products, coinciding with the Trump administration's loosening of federal regulations on the digital currency industry. The increase is attributed to the release of meme coins and a stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto exchange affiliated with the Trump family. A firm backed by Abu Dhabi is investing billions in World Liberty Financial, further boosting the family's wealth. Critics argue that Trump is profiting from his public office, while the White House dismisses these concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

Both parties have focused on addressing the rising cost of living, with annual inflation peaking after Labor's election in 2022.

          <p>President Trump's budget blueprint proposes closing the CDC center focused on prevention, despite warnings about a potential epidemic of chronic diseases.

One proposed approach involves special envoys appointed by Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, but the US prefers direct negotiations between Trump and Xi, which China views as too risky. A lack of bilateral trust is fueled by disputes over China's role in fentanyl production. Beijing hopes to use fentanyl cooperation as leverage in future trade negotiations, while Trump's team seeks a goodwill gesture before talks.</p>

          <p>Weekly measles cases in the U.S. have reached a new record, surpassing the peak of the 2019 outbreak, which was the worst since the 1990s. The majority of cases are linked to an ongoing outbreak in Texas and neighboring states. Officials caution that it is too soon to determine if the outbreak is ending, citing potential increases due to travel from the Easter holiday weekend. The total number of cases this year is likely an undercount, with some mild cases going undiagnosed.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's defense of his tariffs is facing scrutiny as he struggles to reconcile the costs with his campaign promises. While acknowledging that tariffs will exact a cost, he also claims that Americans won't have to go out of their way, a claim that has been widely mocked. Trump's anti-elitist rhetoric is unlikely to work effectively in this context, as he is perceived as someone who is unlikely to personally suffer from rising prices. The tariffs represent a significant tax increase, contradicting Trump's promises to end inflation and cut taxes.</p>

          <p>Following the Trump administration's dismissal of nearly 400 scientists working on the National Climate Assessment, two scientific groups have announced plans to publish a special collection focused on climate change. The American Geophysical Union and the American Meteorological Society will invite climate scientists and researchers to submit their work for the collection. This effort aims to ensure that the scientists' work can be accessed, given concerns that the next National Climate Assessment may be less extensive.

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will require new vaccines to undergo placebo testing, a move described as a "radical departure from past practices." The policy change would mandate studies in which half of participants receive a placebo to compare results against the vaccine.

It remains unclear what HHS considers a "new" vaccine and whether that includes updated flu and COVID vaccines.</p>
