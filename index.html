          <p>A Milwaukee County circuit judge, Hannah Dugan, was arrested by the FBI for allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant evade arrest by ICE officers. The complaint alleges that Dugan intentionally misdirected federal agents away from Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, who was appearing before her on domestic abuse charges, allowing him to escape through a non-public area of the courthouse. Dugan's attorney protests the arrest, arguing it was not in the interest of public safety, while the mayor of Milwaukee accused the federal agents of "showboating". If convicted, Dugan could face up to six years in prison.</p>

The exemptions could apply to items crucial to supply chains and vulnerable to China's trade barriers, including lifesaving drugs and other healthcare products.

          <p>George Santos, once a promising Republican candidate, has seen a rapid downfall due to fabricated credentials and fraudulent schemes. Despite initial success as a supporter of Donald Trump, his background was revealed to be largely fabricated before he was even sworn in. Santos pleaded guilty to a range of crimes and was ultimately expelled from the House of Representatives, becoming only the sixth member in history to face such a fate.</p>

          <p>The posthumous publication of Joan Didion's *Notes to John*, accounts of sessions with her psychiatrist, has ignited debate about the ethics of posthumous works. The history of posthumous works is a long and contentious one, from Virgil’s *Aeneid* to the publication of Gabriel García Márquez’s *Until August* last year. It seems unlikely that Didion, that most reticent of people and most exacting of writers, would have welcomed these intimate, unedited journals seeing the light of day. But it is implausible that she would have been unaware of the inevitability of their publication.</p>
