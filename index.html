          <p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has begun a two-day trip in Bengaluru, India, with the goal of deepening the strategic partnership between the two nations. The visit aims to enhance cooperation in security, technology, and the recruitment of skilled workers, reflecting Germany's view of India as a crucial global partner. A primary objective is to accelerate the finalization of a planned free trade agreement between India and the European Union, which is expected to significantly elevate their economic relationship. Wadephul is also scheduled to meet with students and visit the Indian Space Research Organisation headquarters.</p>

          <p>A new Netflix documentary, "America’s Team: the Gambler and his Cowboys," is being lauded for its raw and comprehensive depiction of the Dallas Cowboys' rise and fall in the 1990s. The article contrasts it favorably with more sanitized sports documentaries, noting its honest exploration of player misconduct, including drug use and legal troubles, alongside their on-field success. It particularly highlights the candid interviews with key figures like Michael Irvin, owner Jerry Jones, and coach Jimmy Johnson, whose feud is a central theme. The film is praised for revealing deeper truths about the celebrated yet troubled team.</p>

This surge in leveraged trading, driven primarily by quantitative hedge funds and retail investors, has surpassed a previous peak set just before a significant market downturn. While analysts see the activity as a sign of improving market sentiment and liquidity, it also brings back memories of a past boom-to-bust cycle, prompting some companies to issue warnings about investment risks.

          <p>A massive landslide has obliterated the village of Tarasin in Sudan's western Darfur region, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 1,000 residents with only a single known survivor. The disaster, triggered by days of heavy rainfall, occurred in the Marrah Mountains, an area controlled by the Sudan Liberation Movement-Army rebel group. Access for international aid organizations is severely restricted due to the ongoing civil war that has ravaged the country, compounding the tragedy. The rebel group and the regional governor have issued urgent appeals for international assistance to help recover bodies and support the region.</p>

          <p>An American man has died in the Bahamas after the jet ski he was riding collided with a boat in the waters off Paradise Island. The man was found unresponsive with visible injuries, and medical personnel pronounced him dead at the scene. This incident follows a series of jet ski accidents involving U.S. citizens in the country, prompting the U.S. Embassy to issue a security alert in April 2025. The embassy advised Americans to avoid renting jet skis altogether and has prohibited U.S. government employees from using them in the area, as the investigation into the fatal crash continues.</p>

Space weather forecasters noted that the geomagnetic storm reached a moderate level, and there is a possibility of it intensifying further. If the storm strengthens as predicted, the aurora could become even more widely visible across the entire UK, potentially with the naked eye.</p>

The article explains that the issue stems from decades of socio-economic decline, alienation, and historical cuts to addiction services. While 2024 figures may show a slight dip, experts warn this is temporary, as the arrival of deadly synthetic opioids known as nitazenes is creating "a crisis on top of a crisis."

The government is contrasting its careful asylum policies with what it calls opportunistic rhetoric from Reform leader Nigel Farage.

          <p>Utah is grappling with a severe housing affordability crisis, which prompted Governor Spencer Cox to launch an ambitious goal of building 35,000 starter homes within five years. However, a year and a half into the initiative, only about 5,100 homes have been built or are under construction, indicating slow progress. While the state has offered low-interest loans to incentivize developers, builders have been slow to participate. Housing experts argue that more substantial policy changes, such as overriding local zoning laws to allow for smaller, denser housing lots, are necessary to make a significant impact on the state's housing shortage.</p>

          <p>Legendary coach Bill Belichick's first game as head coach for the North Carolina Tar Heels resulted in a lopsided 48-14 home loss to the TCU Horned Frogs. Despite an enthusiastic crowd and an opening-drive touchdown, UNC was overwhelmed as TCU scored 41 unanswered points. The Horned Frogs' offense, led by quarterback Josh Hoover, consistently found success, while their defense stifled the Tar Heels for much of the game. The blowout defeat served as a stark welcome to college football for Belichick and highlighted the significant work needed to rebuild the UNC program.</p>

          <p>Defending US Open champion Jannik Sinner delivered a commanding performance, defeating Alexander Bublik 6-1, 6-1, 6-1 in just one hour and 21 minutes to advance to the quarter-finals. Sinner's play was so precise and relentless that Bublik humorously described him as an "AI" player after the match. The world number one was ruthless, breaking Bublik's serve eight times and extending his winning streak at hard-court Grand Slam tournaments to 25 matches. The victory sets up an all-Italian quarter-final clash against tenth seed Lorenzo Musetti.</p>

          <p>Representative Jerry Nadler, a Democrat and the longest-serving member of Congress from New York, has announced that he will not seek reelection in 2026.

          <p>A research team in Beijing has designed a compact, detergent-free washing machine for astronauts, addressing the long-standing challenge of doing laundry in space where water is a scarce resource. The device, which weighs 12kg, uses only 400ml of water per cycle, atomizing it into an ultra-fine mist to clean clothes. Instead of soap, it utilizes ultraviolet light to generate ozone, a powerful disinfectant that sterilizes the garments. This innovative solution could significantly improve hygiene and comfort for astronauts on long-duration missions by providing a practical way to clean clothing.</p>

          <p>New Jersey health officials have issued a public health alert after confirming that ticks capable of transmitting Lyme disease have been detected in all 21 counties across the state. This widespread presence signals an increased risk of exposure for residents, as the pests are spreading from wooded areas into suburban and urban environments. The expansion is attributed to a warming climate, which creates more favorable breeding conditions and longer active seasons for ticks. Officials are urging the public to take precautions, such as using repellents and checking for ticks after being outdoors, to mitigate the growing threat.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) are now taking effect, reducing food purchasing power for millions of low-income Americans in what is being called the largest reduction in the program's history. While independent grocers who rely heavily on SNAP customers anticipate a significant drop in sales, some analysts predict that large discount retailers like Walmart may benefit. As families face reduced benefits, they are expected to trade down to more value-focused stores to stretch their budgets. This shift is expected to have a profound impact on the grocery industry and the food security of vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>The UK government is introducing a new law that will give the justice secretary the authority to veto new sentencing guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council for England and Wales. This move centralizes policy control within Parliament and follows a public disagreement over proposed guidelines that would have required courts to consider the backgrounds of offenders from certain minority groups. Under the new rules, both the justice secretary and the lady chief justice must approve any future guidance before it can be issued. The government maintains that this reform will not interfere with the independence of judges in individual cases.</p>

Halsne gained national attention in an interview where he described how his friend shielded him during the attack, which killed two children and injured 21 people. He initially thought he was only hit by gunpowder, but the fragment was found in subsequent medical exams. An online fundraiser has been established to help his family with medical expenses as he prepares for the procedure.</p>
