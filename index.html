          <p>Dick's Sporting Goods announced its intent to acquire Foot Locker for $2.4 billion, aiming to broaden its consumer base, expand internationally, and gain a stronger foothold in the Nike sneaker market. The acquisition is expected to operate Foot Locker as a standalone business, preserving its brands, and will allow Dick's to tap into Foot Locker's urban, younger customer demographic. While the deal faces potential anti-competition concerns, both companies anticipate no regulatory hurdles with the Federal Trade Commission. Foot Locker's shares surged following the announcement, while Dick's shares experienced a decline as investors expressed concerns about the merger's potential impact on financial performance.

          <p>During a Supreme Court hearing, liberal justices challenged the Justice Department's argument that federal courts should not block President Trump's executive order limiting birthright citizenship. Justice Sotomayor argued that Trump's order contradicts established Supreme Court precedents, while Justices Kagan and Brown-Jackson expressed concerns about the order's legality and its potential impact on the rule of law. Justice Brown-Jackson voiced concerns that the argument presented could turn the justice system into a 'catch-me-if-you-can' regime. Trump defended his order on social media, asserting that birthright citizenship should not apply to those taking vacations in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Germany and Israel marked 60 years of diplomatic relations with visits by both presidents to each other's countries, though security concerns led to separate travel arrangements. The commemorations included reflections on the historical significance of reconciliation after World War II and the Nazi terror in Europe. German President Steinmeier visited the Be'eri kibbutz, heavily affected by the October 7, 2023, attacks, pledging Germany's support in rebuilding the site's cultural center.

          <p>Missouri lawmakers have passed a voter referendum that aims to repeal the abortion rights protections enshrined in the state constitution just six months prior. If approved by voters in 2026, the referendum would reinstate a near-total abortion ban, with exceptions for medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, and in cases of sexual assault or incest within the first 12 weeks of gestation. The bill would also allow state lawmakers to enact legislation regulating abortions and access to care.

          <p>Washington is facing a growing debate over 'debanking,' the practice of financial institutions closing accounts or denying services to individuals or businesses. While there's political agreement that debanking is a problem, there's no consensus on what to do about it or even what it is, as some view it as discrimination while others see it as risk management. The Trump administration has signaled a willingness to address the issue, and even Senator Elizabeth Warren has raised concerns. The situation is complicated by the lack of a legal right to a bank account and the difficulty in distinguishing between legitimate risk aversion and politically motivated discrimination.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor is recalling nearly 275,000 Lincoln Navigator and Ford Expedition SUVs due to a potentially bent brake line that may lead to reduced brake function. The issue stems from faulty assembly during engine installation at Ford's Kentucky Truck Plant, where a modification was made in November to prevent damage to the brake line. Drivers may experience increased pedal travel or a red brake warning light in the event of a brake fluid leak. Ford dealers will inspect and replace the brake line or air cleaner outlet pipe at no cost to owners.</p>

          <p>The UK economy grew by 0.7% at the start of the year, surpassing expectations and exhibiting the highest growth rate within the G7. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) attributed this growth to strong spending on services such as retail, hospitality, and finance. Despite this positive start, experts predict that the UK's exports to the US may decline due to tariffs implemented by the US, potentially slowing future growth. The UK did a deal with the US last week which cut some tariffs, but it is unclear when this will take effect as the details are ironed out.</p>

          <p>UnitedHealth Group shares experienced a significant drop of over 18% following a report of a Department of Justice criminal investigation into potential Medicare fraud. The DOJ is reportedly focusing on the company's Medicare Advantage business practices. UnitedHealth Group has refuted the report, calling it 'deeply irresponsible' and standing by the integrity of its Medicare Advantage program. This marks the second time this year that the insurer's Medicare Advantage business has come under federal scrutiny, and the company has also faced other challenges, such as a cyberattack and the murder of its CEO.</p>
