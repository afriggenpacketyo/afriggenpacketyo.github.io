          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport faced its second air traffic control outage in just two weeks, causing significant delays and cancellations. The outage, which lasted for approximately 90 seconds, impacted communications and radar display at the Philadelphia TRACON Area C. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has expressed concern over the outdated equipment, some of which he claims must be bought on eBay, and is seeking funding from Congress for upgrades. United Airlines has limited flights to and from Newark due to the ongoing issues, while officials insist the airspace remains safe despite the disruptions.</p>

Despite potential negotiations with the United States to ease the trade war, tariffs remain high, impacting bilateral trade and leaving Chinese manufacturers with unsold goods.

          <p>Hawaii has secured a $700 million settlement with pharmaceutical companies over the blood thinner Plavix, resolving a lawsuit regarding its efficacy and safety. The settlement comes after a court ruling that ordered Bristol Myers Squibb Company and Sanofi subsidiaries to pay $916 million. The companies said they are pleased to resolve the litigation and continue focusing on delivering innovative medicines to patients. While the companies did not admit wrongdoing, the lawsuit stemmed from concerns that a significant portion of patients might have a diminished response to Plavix.</p>

          <p>Japanese figure skating prodigy Taiga Nishino is gaining recognition for mastering two quadruple jumps at just 15 years old. Despite being too young to compete at the next Winter Olympics, Nishino has drawn comparisons to junior champion Rio Nakata. Nishino has landed a quad toe loop and a quad salchow, showcasing his improving jump level. Coach Misao Sato notes Nishino's rapid physical growth, requiring him to quickly adapt to bigger boots and blades.</p>
