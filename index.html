          <p>Israeli forces conducted airstrikes on southern Beirut on the eve of Eid Al Adha, targeting what they claim was a Hezbollah unit producing drones underground with Iranian funding. The strikes followed evacuation warnings for several buildings in the area, causing thousands to flee. Lebanese President Joseph Aoun condemned the strikes as a violation of international accords, while the Israeli military defended its actions as necessary to dismantle Hezbollah's drone capabilities, citing their use in attacks on Israel. The attacks come after months of escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, despite a ceasefire agreement.</p>

This could lead to central banks in Asia decoupling from the Federal Reserve and implementing further rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

The study suggests that AI is creating jobs and enriching automatable tasks, ultimately making people more valuable.

          <h2>Lost Police Evidence Causes Thousands of Criminal Cases to Collapse</h2>

          <p>Thousands of criminal cases in England and Wales are collapsing each year due to lost, damaged, or missing police evidence. Data from the Crown Prosecution Service reveals that over 30,000 prosecutions collapsed between October 2020 and September 2024, including serious violent and sexual offenses. The BBC's investigation suggests that the number of cases affected by unavailable evidence is increasing. Former police officers attribute the issue to resourcing problems and the overwhelming amount of evidence they handle.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new travel ban, which restricts foreign nationals from 19 countries, has been met with concerns amid a barrage of immigration restrictions. Since his second term began, Trump has taken steps to dismantle legal immigration, including ending temporary legal residency for thousands and restricting student visas. The ban has sparked fears of separating families and disproportionately affecting those seeking refuge. Experts suggest the ban is more likely to withstand legal challenges compared to his first ban.</p>
