          <p>Joe Root delivered a masterful performance, ending the first day of the third Test against India just shy of a century with an unbeaten 99. Under challenging, hot conditions on a slow pitch at Lord's, England adopted a cautious approach, reaching a score of 251-4. The English side had to overcome early setbacks, including losing both openers in a single over, but Root's determined innings provided crucial stability. India's bowlers remained disciplined, though a dropped catch of Ollie Pope could prove costly for the tourists.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's comments on Liberian President Joseph Boakai's "good English," the BBC has detailed the deep historical connections between the two nations. The article explains that Liberia was founded in 1822 by freed African-American slaves, which is why English is its official language and many Liberians speak with an American-influenced accent. It highlights six key facts, including that Liberia's capital, Monrovia, is named after a U.S. president and its flag closely resembles the American flag. The piece provides context on the shared heritage that shapes the West African nation's culture and politics.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has suggested a potential meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the sidelines of an upcoming ASEAN summit. If the meeting occurs, it would be the first in-person discussion between the two top diplomats since Rubio took office. Rubio also indicated that the U.S. might seek China's assistance in encouraging Russia to end the war in Ukraine, acknowledging China's support for Moscow's efforts. This potential diplomatic engagement comes despite Rubio, known for his hawkish views on China, having been sanctioned twice by Beijing.</p>

The bonfire, part of the annual Eleventh Night celebrations, raised concerns due to its proximity to a major electricity substation supplying local hospitals and the discovery of asbestos at the site.

          <p>An essay from The Atlantic delves into the historical "battle of the brows," focusing on Virginia Woolf's vehement disdain for the "middlebrow." In the 1930s, Woolf defined the highbrow as a person of thoroughbred intelligence pursuing ideas, and the lowbrow as one focused on life itself, seeing both as honest. However, she condemned the middlebrow as an intellectually dishonest consumer who chases fashion without genuine taste for either art or life. The article reflects on how this term, which Woolf considered a grave insult, has softened over time to describe anything perceived as harmlessly pedestrian.</p>

Key indicators include paying more in interest than principal, being eligible for a significant balance reduction, and facing a lengthy repayment timeline that would cost more than a settlement.

          <p>Bishop Alberto Rojas of the San Bernardino Diocese in California has formally excused parishioners from their weekly obligation to attend Mass due to widespread fear of immigration enforcement. This rare measure, typically reserved for events like pandemics, follows detentions by immigration officers on two Catholic parish properties. The Bishop stated that the fear of apprehension in public settings, including churches, has become intense, and he wants the immigrant community to know the Church stands with them. The diocese, which serves over 1.5 million Catholics, is located in a region with a large Latino population.</p>

          <p>Sweden's Migration Minister, Johan Forssell, has confirmed that his 16-year-old son has been linked to white supremacist extremist groups but stated he will not resign. Forssell said he was unaware of his son's online activities until being notified by the security service a few weeks ago and has since had "long and important conversations" with him. He added that his son is deeply remorseful and has cut off contact with the groups. Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson has expressed his continued confidence in the minister, though the opposition is calling for a parliamentary committee hearing.</p>

          <p>Following a solid June sales report from Costco, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to buy or hold the company's stock, calling it a good way to combat inflation.

Cramer expressed confidence in Costco's ability to keep prices low for its members, a key advantage amid tariff uncertainty. Despite a slight dip in the stock, he and other analysts see strength in the company's business model and international sales growth. (not investment advice)</p>

This strategy aims to overwhelm Ukraine's air defenses, forcing the use of precious resources.

Because of this narrow approval and a high price tag compared to generic opioids, many patients with chronic pain or even those with acute pain are being denied insurance coverage.

The author posits that Netanyahu is exploiting Trump's desire for recognition to distract from the conflict and maintain his own political power, thereby avoiding early elections and a corruption trial. The article critiques the nomination as absurd, given the ongoing violence and the U.S. role as Israel's primary weapons supplier.
