          <p>President Trump has pardoned two South Florida shark divers, Tanner Mansell and John Moore Jr., who were convicted of theft for freeing 19 sharks and a grouper from a fisherman's line in 2022. The divers, believing it was an illegal fishing line, freed the animals and reported the incident to state wildlife officials. Federal prosecutors later charged them with theft, claiming the line belonged to a licensed fisherman conducting research. The pardons erase the felony convictions, allowing them to vote, own firearms, and travel freely outside the U.S. The divers' attorneys expressed relief, stating that the case should never have been filed. </p>

          <p>Euro zone inflation dropped to 1.9% in May, according to Eurostat data, falling below the European Central Bank's 2% target.

The ECB is expected to consider these figures when making its next interest rate decision later this week, with markets anticipating a 25-basis-point rate cut.

          <p>Laila Soueif, the mother of jailed British-Egyptian activist Alaa Abdel Fattah, is continuing her hunger strike despite doctors' warnings about her deteriorating health. The 69-year-old is demanding the release of her son, who has been imprisoned in Egypt since 2014. Soueif has been on hunger strike for eight months and is now at risk of sudden death. She is calling on the UK government to pressure Egypt to release her son, who has been imprisoned almost continuously since 2014. </p>

          <p>Beijing has issued warnings about cutthroat price wars among carmakers in China, citing concerns about product quality and long-term industry development. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) and state media have expressed concerns over recent discounts offered by manufacturers. They collectively deem price wars a threat to product quality and the industry's sustained investment in research and development. The MIIT vowed to step up governance over such competition in the industry. </p>
