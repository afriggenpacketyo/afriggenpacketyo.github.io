          <p>This article argues that President Trump's economic strategy, characterized by high tariffs, reduced government subsidies, and attacks on scientific institutions, constitutes a form of "degrowth." While not an explicit goal, these policies are raising prices, suppressing consumption, and lowering productivity, effectively shrinking the economy. The author contends that this approach, driven by protectionism and cronyism, will ultimately harm most Americans, including the wealthy, by creating shortages and stifling innovation. This contrasts sharply with the administration's promises of economic supercharging. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Authorities have captured Michael Brown, the 45-year-old suspect accused of killing four people in a shooting at The Owl Bar in Anaconda, Montana. The arrest followed a weeklong manhunt involving approximately 130 law enforcement officers. Brown, an Army veteran with a history of mental health issues, allegedly opened fire in the bar where he was a regular, killing four patrons. Family and community members noted his struggles with PTSD and mental illness, describing the tragic event as a culmination of his deteriorating condition.</p>

          <p>A shooting in New York City's Times Square resulted in injuries to three individuals early Saturday morning. The incident, which police believe stemmed from a verbal dispute, involved a 17-year-old who opened fire, injuring an 18-year-old woman, a 19-year-old man, and a 65-year-old man. All victims are reported to be in stable condition, and a firearm was recovered at the scene. This event occurred despite a significant city-wide decrease in gun crime, with 2025 recording the lowest number of shooting incidents since records began.</p>

          <p>Armenia and Azerbaijan have signed a landmark peace agreement at the White House, officially ending nearly four decades of conflict over the Karabakh region. The U.S.-brokered deal includes the creation of a major transit corridor, named the "Trump Route," linking Azerbaijan to its Nakhchivan exclave, with the U.S. holding development rights. Both nations' leaders credited President Trump's administration for the breakthrough, which has been hailed by international figures but met with warnings from Iran. The agreement signifies a major geopolitical shift, diminishing Russia's historical influence in the South Caucasus region.</p>

          <p>The launch of OpenAI's GPT-5 has generated mixed reactions within China's competitive artificial intelligence landscape. While OpenAI CEO Sam Altman described the new model as a "PhD-level expert in anything," some Chinese tech commentators found it lacking in revolutionary breakthroughs. One expert noted that GPT-5 did not present memorable characteristics, suggesting it was more of an incremental improvement than a major leap forward. This reception comes as China's own tech firms are rapidly developing their own advanced AI models, heightening global competition.</p>

In Epping, Essex, a sexual assault charge against a hotel resident ignited demonstrations, drawing in local residents, including mothers and professionals, alongside far-right activists. While anti-racism groups warn of extremist exploitation, many protesters cite concerns for safety and frustration with the government's opaque system. The article highlights the complex social dynamics, the difficulty in verifying crime statistics, and the widespread dissatisfaction with the current asylum process.</p>

          <p>After twelve years, the Oregon Government Ethics Commission has closed its case against Liane Richardson, a former Lane County administrator fired in 2013 amid a pay scandal. The commission's executive director cited the case's extreme age and the difficulty of proceeding with the investigation as reasons for dismissal. Richardson was fired for allegedly violating county policy by cashing out paid time off while the county faced a budget crisis and layoffs. The case's closure ends a long-running local controversy that previously saw the state bar association reject Richardson's application over her conduct.</p>

          <p>China is advancing its plans to construct the Xinjiang-Tibet Railway, a strategic 2,000-kilometer (1,240-mile) artery connecting its northwestern and southwestern regions. The project, part of a larger plan to create a 5,000-kilometer plateau rail network centered on Lhasa by 2035, will link the existing Lhasa-Shigatse line with a new line from Hotan. A new company has been established to oversee the project, which also includes business scopes for real estate development and tourism. This railway is one of four major lines designed to integrate Tibet more closely with the rest of China.</p>

          <p>This article offers practical advice for travelers on how to avoid expensive international roaming fees, prompted by a reporter's personal experience of incurring nearly $50 in extra charges over five days in Paris. Experts suggest several strategies depending on usage needs, such as switching to a carrier like T-Mobile for basic international coverage or purchasing a cheaper, data-focused eSIM from providers like Airalo. For minimal data use, leveraging free Wi-Fi and pre-downloading maps and documents can eliminate extra costs entirely, though public Wi-Fi poses security risks for sensitive transactions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis explores the complex and often brutal trade-offs in modern agriculture, focusing on the critical issue of land use. The article reviews new books arguing that to sustainably feed a growing global population, we must embrace "sustainable intensification," which favors high-yield industrial farming to preserve natural ecosystems. This logic, however, leads to a defense of factory farming, which, despite its cruelty, is highly efficient in terms of land and resources. The author grapples with this "anti-anti-factory farming" ethos, questioning the moral cost of prioritizing land efficiency over animal welfare and advocating for continued efforts toward plant-based alternatives.</p>

          <p>Over 260 firefighters are battling a deadly wildfire near Athens, Greece, which broke out in the rural area of Keratea and has been stoked by powerful winds. The blaze has destroyed homes and farmland, and authorities have confirmed one fatality after an elderly man's remains were found in a burned structure. Strong winds also contributed to the deaths of two tourists on the island of Milos. This fire is one of several across Greece, with officials warning the risk will remain high due to a hot, dry summer exacerbated by climate change.</p>

          <h2>Health Experts Warn of 'Refeeding Syndrome' Risk for Starving Populations in Gaza and Sudan</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As humanitarian crises create catastrophic hunger in places like Gaza and Sudan, health experts are warning of a dangerous complication known as refeeding syndrome. This potentially fatal condition can occur when severely malnourished individuals resume normal eating too quickly, causing a rapid, disruptive shift in electrolytes that can lead to organ failure. Aid organizations use specially formulated, low-nutrient therapeutic foods (RUTFs) like Plumpy'Nut to safely stabilize patients. Experts stress that preventing these deaths requires not just food, but safe access for aid workers to administer care properly.</p>

          <p>Samuel Kangethe, a Kenyan immigrant who has lived in Michigan for over 16 years, is choosing to self-deport rather than face detention under the Trump administration's strict immigration policies. Despite having a master's degree, a stable job, and a U.S. citizen wife and children, his unresolved immigration case makes him deportable. Fearing a sudden and forceful removal, Kangethe has decided to leave on his own terms, a heart-wrenching choice that will separate him from his family indefinitely. His story illustrates the profound personal impact of current immigration enforcement on thousands of individuals.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece analyzes recent statements from Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has begun publicly criticizing her own party, Fox News, and fellow Republicans. Greene has decried the treatment of women in the GOP, denounced US foreign policy, and became the first Republican lawmaker to label the situation in Gaza a genocide. The author suggests that while Greene is no progressive ally and her motives may be questionable, her actions are sowing valuable discord within the Republican party. The column concludes that such infighting, rather than Democratic opposition, may ultimately lead to the collapse of the MAGA movement.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reportedly informed Pfizer that it may not renew the emergency use authorization for its COVID-19 vaccine for children aged six months to four years. This decision would remove the only vaccine currently available for all children in this age group, as Moderna's alternative is restricted to those with underlying health conditions. Public health experts have expressed concern over the potential supply gap and the timing of the decision, which could limit access and further complicate vaccination efforts for the nation's youngest children amid already low uptake rates.</p>

          <p>This lifestyle article offers etiquette advice for being a good houseguest, emphasizing that respecting the host's space is paramount, no matter the relationship. Expert Elaine Swann suggests that while a host's invitation to "make yourself at home" allows for self-sufficiency, guests should remain mindful, tidy, and proactive in offering help. Key tips include giving ample notice, keeping visits to a reasonable length (ideally four days), communicating plans, and not relying on the host for transportation. The goal is to ensure the visit is a gift, not a burden, and to secure a future invitation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides an overview of the expected consequences of the Trump administration's widespread tariffs, which have reached their highest average level since 1933. While consumers have not yet felt the full impact, higher prices are considered inevitable as companies will eventually pass on costs, with households potentially facing an average increase of $2,400 this year. The tariffs are also projected to fuel inflation, slow hiring in the labor market, and dampen overall economic growth. However, most economists currently do not forecast a full-blown recession.

This figure is notably higher than for other key markets like the U.S. and Japan.
