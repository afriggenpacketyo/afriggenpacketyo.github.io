        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Trump Coins, a venture launched by Donald Trump, attributed soaring gold prices to his return to the spotlight and economic policies. However, finance experts refute this claim, stating that the surge in gold value reflects financial uncertainty caused by Trump's policies, particularly widespread tariffs. They argue that rising gold prices typically indicate economic turmoil, citing the 2008 financial crisis and Russia's invasion of Ukraine as examples. Experts suggest investors are losing confidence in the U.S. dollar and Treasury bonds, turning to gold as a safe haven. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apollo Global Management forecasts a U.S. recession this summer, triggered by tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Economist Torsten Slok's timeline suggests that consumers will experience shortages in stores as early as next month due to slowed containership departures from China. This will lead to trucking layoffs, empty shelves, and decreased sales, with the recession hitting by summer. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged the tariff situation with Beijing is "unsustainable", but many analysts disagree with Slok's pessimistic outlook, suggesting a "detox period" rather than a recession.</p>

The ceasefire is set to begin on May 8 and last for three days. In response, Ukraine's foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, called for a monthlong ceasefire instead, questioning why it should wait until May 8 if a lasting truce is possible. The Trump administration has described negotiations to end the war as being at a "critical" phase, with President Trump growing increasingly frustrated with both countries' leaders.</p>
