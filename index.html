          <p>President Trump is weighing the possibility of ending federal conservatorship of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a move supported by investor Bill Ackman. The potential privatization has sparked debate, with supporters arguing it could improve the firms' operations and opponents warning of potential risks to the housing market. Senator Elizabeth Warren cautioned against prioritizing Wall Street interests over affordable housing for average Americans. The decision could significantly impact mortgage rates and the stability of the housing finance system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion piece on Fox News accuses broadcast networks of biased coverage, favoring negative "tell-all" books about President Trump while downplaying similar books offering scoops about President Biden. The article contrasts the extensive coverage given to books like Michael Wolff's "Fire and Fury" and Omarosa Manigault-Newman's "Unhinged" with the limited attention paid to Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson's book on Biden's presidency. The author suggests that networks avoided scrutinizing Biden's fitness for office and amplified the White House's messaging, reinforcing a double standard in media coverage.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have achieved a significant breakthrough in underwater communication, enabling error-free acoustic data transmission across 600km of ocean. This milestone could pave the way for real-world applications in long-range undersea messaging, with both civilian and military implications. The project team developed a self-tuning system capable of mapping signal clusters in noisy environments without prior knowledge of seabed topography. This advancement addresses challenges such as signal scattering, Doppler shifts, and ambient noise that typically hinder underwater communication over long distances.</p>

Open-heart surgery successfully removed the scarred pericardium, relieving the pressure and allowing Mauceri to regain his health.

          <h2>Trump Administration Accused of Minimizing White Supremacist Threat</h2>

          <p>Current and former State Department officials are raising concerns about the Trump administration's approach to the threat of white supremacists. The State Department has banned the term "racially or ethnically motivated violent extremism" and plans to cut offices working on countering violent extremism. Critics argue that these changes, along with shifting resources away from programs addressing the far-right, undermine the government's ability to combat white supremacist terrorism.</p>

          <p>Despite critics claiming the movement to defund the police failed, Austin and Seattle are seeing lasting impacts from redirecting funds to social services. Milwaukee diverted police funding to affordable housing and youth programs, while Seattle created a third public safety department for mental health crises. Austin has increased investment in homeless services, and the push for community-based solutions has sparked conversations about city priorities. While backlash followed the initial protests, organizers say they helped shift the focus towards reimagining public safety.</p>

          <p>NPR readers honored fallen military service members for Memorial Day by sharing personal stories of loved ones. Contributions came from all over the U.S., featuring parents, grandparents, and more. One story included Captain Hans George Faltin, who defused booby traps during World War II, and another involved Navy Lt. Theodore King Higgins, who died in Vietnam. These reflections underscore the personal sacrifices made by service members and their families.</p>

          <h2>Ancient Armored Fish May Be Responsible for Tooth Sensitivity</h2>

          <p>Research suggests that tooth sensitivity can be traced back to ancient armored fish, whose exoskeletons evolved into our teeth. Yara Haridy and her colleagues found that the structure of invertebrate armor resembled vertebrate teeth, indicating a shared function. By examining modern-day fish, they discovered nerves in tooth-like scales, suggesting the armor allowed ancient fish to sense their environment. This research explains why we experience toothaches and connects our anatomy to our evolutionary history.</p>
