          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is seeking a temporary restraining order from a federal judge to prevent President Donald Trump's deployment of National Guard members and Marines to Los Angeles. The lawsuit claims Trump's actions are unlawful, stoking fear and civil unrest, and violating state sovereignty. Trump administration officials argue the deployment is justified due to protests against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, citing the need to prevent Los Angeles from burning. Newsom insists the protests do not warrant such a response, comparing the situation to the 1992 riots and emphasizing that most protesters are engaged in nonviolent activity protected by the First Amendment.

          <p>In a world saturated with AI-generated content, the ability to discern what is meaningful and resonant is more valuable than ever. Taste, defined as judgment with style, allows leaders to make decisions that feel fitting and elevate utility with elegance. AI can generate infinite variations, but it lacks the human discretion, cultural intuition, and lived experience necessary for true taste. Cultivating taste requires exposure, curation, and reflection, making it a competitive advantage and an ethical necessity for leaders. The optimism score for this article is 75.</p>
