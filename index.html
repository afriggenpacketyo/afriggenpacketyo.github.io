            <p>Foreign students at US colleges are experiencing anxiety as some are detained and visas are revoked, allegedly due to involvement in pro-Palestinian protests. Over 1,000 international students have had their visas revoked or legal statuses changed, with universities often unaware until checking government databases. Students fear being targeted for expressing views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, leading some to prepare for potential arrest and universities offering support. The Trump administration asserts that visas are a 'privilege' that can be revoked for various reasons, and some universities are facing funding freezes due to disagreements over student visa policies.</p>

            <p>President Trump is reportedly exploring options to remove Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, despite the Fed's independent status. This comes after Trump criticized Powell's stance on interest rates and his warnings about the potential economic impact of the administration's trade war. Experts note that even if Trump could remove Powell, the Fed's monetary policy decisions are made by the Federal Open Market Committee. Potential replacements include Kevin Warsh, though some suggest Warsh is even more hawkish than Powell. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A federal judge has ordered the transfer of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish Tufts University student detained by immigration authorities, to Vermont for a hearing. Ozturk's lawyers claim her detention was retaliation for an op-ed she co-wrote in the student newspaper. She is among several people with ties to American universities whose visas were revoked or who have been stopped from entering the US after being accused of supporting Palestinians. Ozturk's lawyers are challenging the legal authority for her detention, arguing it violates her constitutional rights.</p>

            <p>The Australian government is facing criticism for shooting koalas from helicopters in Budj Bim National Park, with authorities claiming it is to end their suffering from burns and starvation after a bushfire. Advocates argue that habitat loss due to logging and development, as well as the presence of commercial plantations, are contributing to the problem. Experts are skeptical of the aerial culling method, suggesting rescue and humane euthanasia as alternatives. The incident highlights the challenges of wildlife management in the face of climate change and habitat destruction.</p>
