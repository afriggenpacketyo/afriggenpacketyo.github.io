          <p>The Department of Homeland Security's ‚Äúsanctuary jurisdiction list‚Äù contained numerous errors, including the inclusion of non-sanctuary cities and the exclusion of known sanctuary cities.  The flawed list, quickly removed from the website, is seen as emblematic of the Trump administration's aggressive, haphazard approach to immigration enforcement.  The article highlights the political reactions to the list's inaccuracies and discusses the broader context of the administration's immigration policies. The author uses humor to critique the administration's approach.</p>
