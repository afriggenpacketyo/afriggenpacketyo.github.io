          <p>A CBS News analysis reveals that lawyers are increasingly strategically filing lawsuits in specific federal jurisdictions, often with single judges appointed by presidents of opposing parties, to secure favorable rulings with nationwide impact. Conservatives frequently target small Texas courts for challenges against the Biden administration, while liberals favor courts in states like Massachusetts for cases against the Trump administration. This practice, known as venue shopping, raises concerns about impartiality and erodes public confidence in the judicial system, according to legal experts. The Supreme Court is now considering whether to limit the scope of nationwide injunctions, which could significantly impact the implementation of presidential policies. </p>

          <p>Walmart CEO Doug McMillon cautioned that even with reduced tariffs on Chinese imports, the company may need to raise prices on certain items. While the Trump administration lowered tariff rates from 145% to 30% for 90 days, McMillon stated that these tariffs still create cost pressures, particularly in categories like electronics and toys. Walmart will strive to control costs and maintain low food prices, but potential financial impacts could jeopardize earnings growth if tariff levels rise again.

While some work was underway at Treasury for incremental sanctions relief, the sudden announcement has prompted discussions to determine the scope and speed of the rollback. Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated relief may come through waivers, allowing foreign partners to provide aid without facing penalties. </p>

          <p>MPs will debate a bill to legalize assisted dying in England and Wales for the first time since significant changes were made to it. The bill passed the first stage of the Commons last November, and has since undergone intense scrutiny and amendments. Changes include removing the need for a High Court judge to sign off each request for an assisted death, and preventing doctors from discussing the option with under 18s unless the patient raises it first. The debate comes as the government quietly made changes to its impact assessment on assisted dying, admitting errors in calculating how many people could take up the service if it becomes law. </p>

          <p>NJ Transit rail engineers are poised to strike if a deal is not reached by the midnight deadline, potentially impacting over 300,000 commuters. Negotiations between NJ Transit and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) are ongoing, focusing on pay raises that the union claims have been stagnant for five years. NJ Transit CEO Kris Kolluri expressed a desire for a fair deal that is reasonable for fare payers and taxpayers. Governor Phil Murphy may declare a state of emergency if the strike occurs, and NJ Transit has a contingency plan to accommodate 20% of daily riders. </p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is considering limiting the ability of federal courts to issue nationwide injunctions, a check on presidential authority that has been used to block policies from both Democratic and Republican administrations. The cases before the court involve President Trump's order to eliminate birthright citizenship, which has been deemed unconstitutional by lower courts. Ending nationwide injunctions would require challenges to government policies to be brought separately in each federal district, potentially creating inconsistent laws across the country. Some justices express concern about the chaos of a patchwork of rules, while others argue that nationwide injunctions prevent the executive branch from carrying out its duties. </p>

The family is upset that they do not have a say in the medical decisions, and doctors have told them that the fetus has fluid on the brain.
