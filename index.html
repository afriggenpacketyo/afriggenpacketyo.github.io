          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 21:31:05 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump declared on social media that Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire, ending nearly two weeks of escalating air assaults. The agreement involves two 12-hour ceasefire periods, beginning with Iran, followed by Israel, after which the war would be officially declared over. However, Iran's foreign minister denied the existence of a ceasefire agreement but stated that if Israel halted strikes, Iran would cease its response. Trump's announcement came after the U.S. launched strikes on Iranian nuclear targets, joining Israel's war, which began due to concerns over Iran's nuclear program.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's dominance in rare earth production is increasingly reliant on supplies from Myanmar, a country experiencing war, according to a recent report. While China is the top producer, it imports raw materials containing these metals, with Myanmar accounting for 57% of China's total rare earth imports last year. Myanmar's deposits are high in heavy rare earth elements, making them valuable and scarce, strengthening China's monopoly over the global heavy rare earths supply chain. Environmental concerns arise as these deposits are exploited through chemical leaching methods, leading to environmental and human rights abuses, according to a nonprofit organization.</p>

          <p>Street vendors in Los Angeles, including undocumented immigrants, are facing increased fears of deportation due to ongoing immigration raids, forcing them to make difficult choices between safety and providing for their families. Many vendors, who are a crucial part of L.A.'s $504-million industry, are staying home, leading to economic hardship. Organizations are stepping in to assist vendors with expenses, and legislation is proposed to protect vendor data and prevent immigration enforcement agents from accessing it. The situation highlights the vulnerability of these workers and the community's efforts to support them.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from implementing its plan to bar foreign nationals from studying at Harvard University. The injunction prevents the administration from enforcing a proclamation that cited national security concerns to justify the ban.

The university has filed lawsuits seeking to unfreeze funding and prevent the administration from blocking international students.</p>

A federal judge had previously blocked the law, deeming it likely unconstitutional, and Uthmeier was found in civil contempt for disputing the judge's order.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to resume deporting migrants to countries other than their homeland. The court reversed a lower court order requiring the government to give migrants a chance to argue they could be tortured or killed if removed to third countries. The decision allows the administration to deport migrants to countries such as South Sudan, despite concerns about their safety. Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson dissented, criticizing the majority's decision.</p>

          <p>Iran launched a missile attack on the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, two days after the U.S. struck three nuclear sites in Iran. U.S. and Qatari authorities said the missiles were intercepted, and no one was injured. President Trump indicated that the U.S. was given prior warning of the Iranian strike. The attack led to a temporary closure of Qatar's airspace and shelter-in-place orders for Americans in Qatar, but the situation has since de-escalated.</p>

          <p>The dollar experienced a decline, while the Australian and New Zealand dollars saw an increase following U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, which boosted investor confidence and sparked a risk rally. The risk-sensitive Aussie and kiwi currencies benefited from the news, while the dollar, previously supported by safe-haven demand, fell broadly. Dovish comments from Federal Reserve policymaker Michelle Bowman, suggesting potential interest rate cuts, also contributed to the dollar's decline. (not investment advice)</p>
