          <p>Colorado Rockies relief pitcher Jimmy Herget appeared at a postgame press conference wearing a T-shirt that read, "My Arm Hurts." The gesture was a lighthearted commentary on his recent heavy workload, having been called to pitch four times in a single week. Herget assured reporters that it was just a joke and that he felt fine, but the shirt humorously highlighted the physical demands placed on relief pitchers. The veteran has been a key part of the Rockies' bullpen this season despite the team's struggles in the NL West.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, rapidly intensified into a Category 5 storm before slightly weakening to a powerful Category 4. The storm is currently undergoing an "eyewall replacement cycle," a process that can cause temporary fluctuations in intensity but may lead to re-strengthening. While its outer bands are impacting the northern Leeward Islands, current forecasts predict Erin's center will remain at sea, passing north of Puerto Rico and staying offshore from the U.S. East Coast. Tropical storm watches have been issued for several Caribbean islands due to risks of heavy rain and flooding.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers are developing a concept for a hypersonic drone carrier that revives a "scissor wing" design once explored by NASA. The aircraft features a single, centrally mounted wing that rotates to optimize performance across different speeds, from subsonic to hypersonic. At low speeds, the wing is perpendicular to the fuselage for maximum lift, pivots to a 45-degree angle at transonic speeds to reduce drag, and aligns parallel to the body at Mach 5, turning the entire craft into a "waverider." This innovative design aims to solve the long-standing aerodynamic challenge of balancing low-speed efficiency with high-speed stability.</p>

          <p>A Colorado dentist, James Craig, has been found guilty of first-degree murder for poisoning his wife, Angela Craig. Over several weeks, he allegedly laced her protein shakes with substances like arsenic and potassium cyanide, which he purchased online after researching undetectable poisons. The investigation began after a business partner grew suspicious of a cyanide package delivered to the dental office. Prosecutors argued that Craig's motives included starting a new life with another woman and collecting on a multi-million dollar life insurance policy, while the defense suggested he bought the poison for his own suicide.</p>

          <p>An executive counselor and couples' therapist outlines five common psychological drivers behind infidelity, suggesting that affairs are often not pursued by malicious individuals but by people at an emotional breaking point. These reasons include the pressure of always being "good" and following societal expectations, the burnout from perfectionism, having poor boundaries developed in childhood, being in an abusive marriage, and experiencing a recent significant loss. The article posits that an affair can represent a misguided attempt to reclaim a sense of self or escape from long-repressed emotional burdens, often with devastating personal and professional consequences.</p>

West Virginia will send 300-400 troops, South Carolina will deploy 200, and Ohio will contribute 150 military police. The move comes after President Trump declared an emergency in the city and temporarily placed its police department under federal control, a decision that has sparked protests and legal challenges.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Explain Hurricane Erin's Rapid Intensification to a Major Storm</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 21:04:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hurricane Erin's explosive growth from a tropical storm to a Category 5 hurricane is a prime example of "rapid intensification," a phenomenon where a storm's wind speeds increase dramatically in a short period. Experts attribute this to perfect conditions, including very warm sea surface temperatures exceeding 85 degrees Fahrenheit and low wind shear. Climate change is making such events more common by heating the oceans, which act as fuel for stronger storms. This rapid strengthening complicates forecasting and emergency preparedness, as seen with Erin's development in the Atlantic.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in Washington, D.C. to protest the Trump administration's deployment of the National Guard and its attempt to assume control over the city's police force. Protesters marched from DuPont Circle to the White House, chanting against the "crime emergency" declaration they view as an overreach of federal power and a threat to the city's home rule. The demonstration followed a successful legal challenge by D.C.'s attorney general that prevented the appointment of an "emergency police commissioner." Participants expressed concern over what they see as an unchecked expansion of presidential power in the capital.</p>

          <p>Despite a temporary truce in trade tensions, Chinese sellers on popular e-commerce platforms like Shein, Temu, and Amazon remain anxious about the potential for future U.S. tariffs.

However, the unpredictability of trade policy creates significant uncertainty for businesses. One electronics company, for example, had to suspend its U.S. operations for nearly two months earlier in the year when bilateral relations deteriorated, highlighting the risks involved for these sellers.</p>

          <p>A new wave of COVID-19 infections is sweeping across the United States, with the Southwest experiencing the nation's highest positivity rates at 12.5%. The surge is driven by the highly contagious "Stratus" variant, which now accounts for the majority of cases detected in wastewater. This spike coincides with students returning to school and follows a controversial change in CDC policy, no longer recommending updated COVID shots for all children. Public health experts have criticized this decision, arguing that boosters remain crucial for reducing the risk of hospitalization and death from emerging variants.</p>

          <p>With food prices rising, parents in the UK are employing meticulous planning and creative cooking to manage the increased cost of feeding children during the summer school holidays. Strategies include buying reduced "yellow-sticker" items, especially meat, to freeze for later use and making frozen snacks from fruit and yogurt. Other tactics involve pre-portioning food for each day to prevent overconsumption and utilizing local food pantries that provide surplus groceries at a low cost. These efforts highlight the financial pressures many families face when subsidized school meals are unavailable, forcing them to be more resourceful with their budgets.</p>

This "false autumn" can disrupt ecosystems, affecting wildlife that relies on the normal timing of fruiting and foraging.

          <p>A new box set titled "Sunset Boulevard" captures the music Elvis Presley recorded in Los Angeles between 1972 and 1975, a period considered his last major burst of creativity before his death in 1977. The collection includes hits like "Burning Love" and soulful ballads such as "Separate Ways," reflecting his personal turmoil at the time. The article also recounts how a missed opportunity to co-star with Barbra Streisand in "A Star Is Born" in 1975 may have marked a turning point, leading to a decline in artistic focus. The set offers a poignant look at a legendary artist grappling with his place in a changing musical landscape.</p>

          <p>During his summit with President Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly proposed a peace deal that would require Ukraine to cede control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. In exchange, Russia would freeze the current front lines and potentially withdraw from other occupied territories. Reports suggest President Trump is supportive of the plan and is scheduled to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday to discuss it. This development marks a significant shift, moving from ceasefire talks to a potential permanent settlement based on territorial concessions, a condition Zelenskyy has previously rejected.</p>

          <p>Israel's military has announced plans to move Palestinians to the southern part of the Gaza Strip in preparation for a renewed military offensive targeting Gaza City, which it describes as the last major stronghold for Hamas. The Israeli agency for civilian affairs, COGAT, stated that the supply of tents and shelter equipment for the displaced population would resume to facilitate the relocation. This move comes as Israeli forces have already intensified operations on the outskirts of the city. The plan involves establishing what Israeli officials have termed "safe zones" for the relocated civilians.</p>

          <p>Samsung is gaining ground on Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share surging from 23% to 31% in the second quarter while Apple's declined. This renewed competition is largely driven by Samsung's innovation in screen technology, particularly with its popular Z Fold and Z Flip foldable phones. While Apple remains the market leader, Samsung's wider range of price points and novel form factors are attracting consumers. Analysts expect Apple to respond with potential plans for a slimmer iPhone and its own foldable device in the coming years to counter Samsung's momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, a landmark environmental law, is under threat from efforts to weaken it. While the act has been successful in helping some species like elephant seals recover, many marine mammals face new and growing dangers from climate change, ship strikes, and pollution. The author points to the declining gray whale population and threats to North Atlantic right whales as evidence that protections need to be strengthened, not rolled back. The piece contends that weakening the law for energy development or fishing operations ignores the critical role these animals play as indicators of ocean health.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has suspended all of its mainline and Rouge flights after more than 10,000 of its flight attendants went on strike, causing widespread travel disruption. The strike began after contract negotiations with the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) stalled over key issues, including wages and unpaid work hours. In response to the shutdown, the Canadian federal government has stepped in, forcing both the airline and the union into binding arbitration to resolve the dispute and restore service. The union has criticized the intervention, arguing it undermines their right to free and fair negotiations.</p>
