          <p>Tesla's stock has rebounded significantly, rising 85% from its April low to turn positive for the year 2025. The recovery is attributed to factors including a recent $1 billion share purchase by CEO Elon Musk, analyst support for his proposed pay plan, and the introduction of new MegaBlocks battery storage systems. Despite this rally, the company still faces challenges from an aging electric vehicle lineup, increased competition from Chinese manufacturers like BYD, and some consumer backlash linked to Musk's political activities.</p>

However, concerns remain about potential inflation from tariffs and a slowing job market, which could influence the Fed's future decisions and temper market optimism.</p>

This action follows a similar strike two weeks prior and occurs amid escalating tensions between the United States and Venezuela's Maduro government. The Trump administration has accused the Venezuelan regime of collaborating with drug cartels, a claim Venezuela denies, while deploying naval assets to the region.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel is facing scrutiny for his unconventional and frequent use of social media during the high-profile investigation into Charlie Kirk's killing. Critics, including former FBI agents, argue his real-time updates—one of which was prematurely announced and later retracted—compromise investigative integrity and break from the agency's traditionally cautious communication style. Despite the criticism, Patel and his deputy have defended their approach as a new era of transparency, while the director is expected to face tough questions from the Senate Judiciary Committee.</p>

          <p>While guest-hosting Charlie Kirk's podcast, Vice President JD Vance, alongside Trump adviser Stephen Miller, declared that the administration would use federal power to "dismantle" what they described as far-left networks promoting political violence. They attributed Kirk's assassination to this movement, despite the shooter's motives not being officially established, and called for supporters to report individuals celebrating the killing to their employers. Vance also suggested that the tax-exempt status of foundations funding certain left-leaning publications could be targeted by the government.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military destroyed a second alleged Venezuelan drug vessel, killing three individuals, an action President Trump framed as targeting "violent drug trafficking cartels." This follows an earlier strike that killed 11 people, which legal experts suggest may have violated international maritime and human rights law. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro condemned the U.S. actions as "aggression" and stated relations are now "completely broken," vowing to defend his country against what his government calls threats from Washington.</p>

          <p>President Trump has suggested that U.S. companies should move from quarterly to semi-annual earnings reports, a change he argues would save money and encourage a focus on long-term strategy over short-term profits. The proposal, which would require SEC approval, revives a debate previously raised by figures like Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon. While supporters believe it fosters long-term growth, critics argue that less frequent reporting reduces transparency for investors and could make U.S. markets less reliable.</p>

          <p>Two separate sailboat crews required rescue near Lisbon, Portugal, after their vessels were damaged in interactions with orcas. One incident involved a tourist vessel that reportedly sank, though all five passengers were safely transferred to another boat. These events are the latest in a series of increasingly frequent encounters between orcas and boats in the waters off Portugal and Spain, where the animals have been observed ramming and damaging vessels, prompting concern among mariners and researchers.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that Washington and Beijing have reached a "framework" agreement concerning the ownership of TikTok's American operations, with a final deal to be completed by the respective presidents. The announcement comes ahead of a looming deadline for the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell its U.S. division or face a nationwide ban. While details are sparse, some experts remain skeptical about whether the deal will fully address national security concerns, such as control over TikTok's algorithm and user data storage.</p>

          <p>Several individuals have been fired or disciplined by their employers for making public comments about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Among those affected are a sports reporter, a university employee, and an MSNBC analyst, whose employers deemed their remarks inappropriate or harmful to the company's reputation. Legal experts note that private companies generally have the right to terminate employees for public speech that violates workplace policies, highlighting the professional risks of commenting on politically charged events in the current climate.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, savers are encouraged to move funds from traditional low-yield savings accounts to more profitable options. For a sum like $10,000, alternatives include certificates of deposit (CDs), which can lock in current high fixed rates, and high-yield savings or money market accounts. While the latter two have variable rates that will likely fall, they still offer significantly better returns than standard accounts and provide greater liquidity than CDs.

          <p>The deadline for third-quarter estimated tax payments is September 15, and experts warn that calculations may be more complex for some filers this year due to recent tax changes enacted by the Trump administration. These payments are typically required for income not subject to withholding, such as from self-employment or investments. Tax professionals advise filers to review their obligations carefully to avoid potential underpayment penalties, especially since new tax breaks could affect the total amount owed for the year.</p>

Comey, who was involved in the cases against Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, is seeking reinstatement to her position, arguing her firing sets a dangerous precedent for career prosecutors.</p>

          <p>Israel's deepening international isolation over the war in Gaza has sparked debate over whether the country is approaching a "South Africa moment" of widespread boycotts and sanctions. Several European nations, including Spain and Belgium, have imposed measures such as arms embargoes and import bans from West Bank settlements, while cultural and sporting boycotts are also emerging. While Prime Minister Netanyahu's government remains defiant, former diplomats express deep anxiety, though some analysts believe continued U.S. support will prevent a complete diplomatic collapse for now.</p>
