          <p>Scientists at the Field Museum of Chicago have uncovered new details about the Archaeopteryx fossil, revealing previously unknown features of early bird evolution. Using UV light and CT scans, researchers identified soft tissues indicating the presence of tertials, specialized feathers crucial for flight, and mobile fingers for climbing. The fossil suggests Archaeopteryx spent considerable time on the ground and had limited flight capability. These findings contribute to understanding the transition from dinosaurs to birds and the evolution of flight.</p>

          <p>The UK will now allow foreign states to own up to 15% of British newspapers and news magazines under new laws. This change follows concerns over a takeover bid of the Telegraph and the Spectator by RedBird IMI, which was backed by the Abu Dhabi ruling family. The BBC reports that Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said the changes would protect "media plurality" while helping publishers "raise vital funding". The government has set the threshold for State Owned Investors at 15% of shares or voting rights in a newspaper or news magazine.</p>
