          <h2>Trump's UK Trade Deal Maintains 10% Baseline Tariffs, Signals Limited Exceptions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.K. and U.S. have reached a trade agreement where the U.K. can export 100,000 vehicles annually at a 10% tariff, with additional vehicles facing higher duties, while British steelmakers and the aluminum industry can export tariff-free. Despite the deal, a 10% baseline tariff remains on all other goods imported to the U.S. from the U.K., suggesting this could be a minimum standard for future trade deals, though analysts note potential flexibility for narrower, bespoke deals with other nations. While the deal may support the broader UK-US relationship, it could also negatively impact U.S. economic growth due to the average U.S. tariff remaining in double digits, potentially slowing growth in the second half of the year. The limitation on car exports could hinder Jaguar Land Rover's market share, benefiting automakers like BMW that assemble vehicles in the U.S.</p>

          <p>In Worcester, Massachusetts, two individuals were arrested after a large crowd attempted to prevent ICE agents from taking a woman into custody. The incident occurred on Eureka Street, where approximately 25 people surrounded the agents' vehicle, leading to a confrontation with both federal agents and Worcester police officers. A girl holding a baby allegedly kicked the car and was arrested on four charges, including endangerment of a child, while another woman was arrested for allegedly pushing officers and throwing an unknown liquid at them. City officials expressed concern over the incident, emphasizing the growing tension due to the national political climate and the separation of families.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York Times reports that Chinese government data indicates a significant shift in trade patterns due to President Trump's tariffs. Shipments of goods to the United States declined by 21 percent in April, while exports to Southeast Asian countries surged by 21 percent. This redirection suggests that Chinese factories are front-loading the supply chain and taking advantage of tariff pauses in Southeast Asia to complete orders destined for the United States. Domestically, China's imports have fallen, reflecting weakening demand, but overall shipments jumped by 8.1 percent, likely providing temporary relief to policymakers amid concerns about the trade war's broader economic impact.</p>

          <h2>Climate Change Impacts Bird Migration Patterns and Ecosystem Health</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 04:28:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Climate change is significantly altering bird migration patterns, with rising global temperatures and extreme weather events impacting their journeys and behaviors. Migratory birds, crucial for maintaining ecosystem health through pollination and pest control, are facing challenges such as altered coastal stopover sites and reduced food sources due to ocean acidification. Warmer temperatures can cause birds to shorten their routes or abandon traditional habitats, leading to conflicts with resident species, while extreme weather events can result in fatalities. Experts recommend expanding protected areas and creating bird-friendly habitats to mitigate these risks and preserve migratory bird populations, as their disappearance could have cascading effects on agriculture and the food chain.</p>

          <p>International Airlines Group (IAG), the parent company of British Airways, has finalized a $13 billion deal to purchase 32 new Boeing 787-10 aircraft, along with an option for 10 more, and a near $8 billion deal for 21 Airbus A330-900neo aircraft. This announcement followed the U.S. agreement to eliminate tariffs on Rolls-Royce jet engines, although the Boeing planes will use General Electric engines. IAG reported a 9.6% increase in first-quarter revenue to â‚¬7 billion and an operating profit increase of â‚¬130 million to â‚¬198 million, indicating strong demand for air travel despite macroeconomic uncertainty, particularly in premium cabins, while noting some softness in economy ticket sales by US holidaymakers.</p>

          <p>President Vladimir Putin led Russia's Victory Day commemorations in Moscow with a military parade attended by China's Xi Jinping, signaling continued close ties between the two nations. Putin used his speech to link the war to today's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and said all of Russia was behind what he called the "special military operation". Other international leaders also attended, despite calls from EU officials for leaders of member states and countries aspiring to join the union to abstain. The presence of Xi Jinping is seen as a significant achievement for Putin, as the two leaders held talks on the war in Ukraine before the parade.</p>

          <p>China's exports experienced an 8.1% surge in April, driven by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, which compensated for a significant drop in exports to the U.S. due to prohibitive tariffs. While shipments to the U.S. plunged by over 21%, exports to ASEAN countries surged by 20.8%, with Vietnam and Malaysia as primary destinations, and notable growth in Indonesia and Thailand. This shift could be attributed to transshipment through third countries and pre-tariff contracts, with analysts expecting trade data to gradually weaken in the coming months, as the number of container vessels from China to the U.S. has dropped dramatically.</p>

          <p>The 19th Venice Architecture Biennale is addressing the urgent need for cities to adapt to extreme heat caused by climate change, with the theme "Intelligens. Natural. Artificial.

The biennale emphasizes the importance of pooling knowledge from various actors, including architects, urban planners, and the construction industry, to rethink the built environment and mitigate the effects of rising temperatures. Architects and urban planners are exploring solutions to combat the overheating of urban areas, such as increasing green spaces and implementing water-permeable surfaces, while some cities are already taking action to reduce traffic and create climate-adapted designs.</p>
