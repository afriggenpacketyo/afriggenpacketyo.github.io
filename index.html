          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to prevent Harvard from enrolling international students by revoking its access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), a crucial database for managing international student enrollment.

The administration is exploiting the requirement for schools to be government-certified to use SEVIS, escalating pressure on Harvard to align with the president's agenda.

          <p>Japan's core inflation accelerated to 3.5% in April, driven by rising rice prices, as the Bank of Japan considers pausing its rate hike policy due to U.S. tariffs. The core inflation figure, which excludes fresh food prices, exceeded expectations and marked the highest level since January 2023. Headline inflation remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for over three years. Economists expect core inflation to ease in the coming months due to lower crude oil prices and the yen's appreciation. (optimism not applicable).</p>
