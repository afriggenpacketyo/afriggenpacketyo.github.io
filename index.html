          <h2>UK Retail Sales Rebound in June Driven by Warm Weather and Increased Fuel Purchases</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 03:11:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail sales volumes in the United Kingdom saw a 0.9% increase in June, largely attributed to a period of warm weather. The Office for National Statistics reported that supermarkets experienced higher sales of drinks, while fuel sales also rose as more people traveled. This rebound follows a revised 2.8% decline in May, indicating volatility in consumer spending. Overall, the data suggests a loss of momentum in retail growth, with sales only up 0.2% in the second quarter compared to the first, aligning with forecasts of lackluster economic performance.

          <p>The United Kingdom and India have signed a free trade agreement projected to increase their annual bilateral trade by over $34 billion by 2040. The deal will eliminate or reduce tariffs on 92% of UK goods exported to India and 99% of Indian goods shipped to the UK, affecting products like textiles, automobiles, and Scotch whisky. After three years of negotiations, the agreement is seen as a strategic victory for both nations, aiming to boost wages, lower consumer prices, and enhance market access. The pact now awaits ratification by the parliaments of both countries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 03:03:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Georges Abdallah, a 74-year-old Lebanese militant, has been released from a French prison after 41 years, making him one of the longest-serving prisoners for acts related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Convicted in 1987 for complicity in the murders of a US and an Israeli diplomat, his release had been a long-standing demand of left-wing activists. Despite being eligible for parole since 1999, his freedom was repeatedly denied, with supporters citing pressure from the US and Israel. An appeals court ultimately ruled his extended detention "disproportionate," mandating his immediate expulsion to Lebanon upon release.</p>

          <p>German automaker Volkswagen announced a 29% decrease in its second-quarter operating profit, which fell to 3.83 billion euros, citing the negative impact of U.S. import tariffs. The company has consequently lowered its full-year guidance, now expecting its operating return on sales to be between 4% and 5%, down from a previous forecast of 5.5% to 6.5%. In addition to tariffs, Volkswagen attributed the decline to increased sales of lower-margin electric vehicles and restructuring costs. The results highlight the significant challenges European carmakers face from global trade disputes and competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of 360 current and former NASA employees has publicly criticized the space agency for "rapid and wasteful changes" in staffing, missions, and budgets over the past six months. In a letter titled the "Voyager Declaration," they express concern that downsizing and funding cuts are undermining NASA's mission and workforce. This internal dissent comes as the agency contends with leadership vacancies, high-level departures, and a proposed 2026 budget that could be its smallest since before the Apollo 11 moon landing. NASA has stated it will not compromise on safety while evaluating its mission priorities.</p>

Bullingham argued that the current model already causes enough interruptions to the game's flow.

          <p>The new film 'The Fantastic Four: First Steps' deliberately adopts a 1960s retro aesthetic, drawing praise for its visual style reminiscent of the director's work on "WandaVision." The movie focuses on the core relationships, particularly between Reed Richards (Pedro Pascal) and Susan Storm (Vanessa Kirby), as they navigate complex moral decisions. According to this article's review, the film succeeds by not relying on the broader Marvel Cinematic Universe, offering a self-contained story with well-filmed action and convincing special effects. This approach marks a refreshing return to basics for the superhero genre, similar to the strategy of the recent "Superman" film.</p>

The mission, guided from a new command center in Arizona, utilizes armored vehicles, helicopters, and drones to stop "got-aways." This expansion of military involvement on U.S. soil sidesteps traditional prohibitions and represents a significant, and controversial, shift in border enforcement strategy.</p>

          <p>The United Nations Security Council is set to convene an emergency meeting to address the escalating border conflict between Thailand and Cambodia. The fighting, which continued for a second day, involves heavy weapons, including artillery and rockets, and has resulted in at least 14 deaths on the Thai side and over 100,000 civilians evacuated. The long-running dispute centers on contested territory near ancient temples, with both nations blaming each other for initiating the latest round of violence. The international community, including the U.S. and EU, has called for an immediate end to the conflict.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at reshaping college athletics by imposing new federal oversight on scholarships and athlete compensation. The order directs federal agencies to enforce requirements for athletic departments to maintain scholarship levels for women's and Olympic sports. It also seeks to regulate name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals, labeling pay-for-play arrangements as "improper." The move comes after a major legal settlement opened the door for direct payments to athletes, raising concerns about the future of non-revenue sports and prompting calls for a national solution.</p>

          <p>Author and journalist Roberto Saviano reflects on a recent Italian court verdict that convicted a powerful Camorra mafia boss for making threats against him. The ruling affirms that the boss's public proclamation during a 2008 trial, which blamed Saviano for his potential conviction, was a direct, mafia-related threat. Saviano, who has lived under police protection for 17 years since publishing his exposé "Gomorrah," describes the immense personal cost of his work, including the loss of freedom and relationships. He views the verdict as a momentous acknowledgment that criminal organizations fear the written word most of all.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has approved the $8.4 billion merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media in a 2-1 vote. The deal places iconic assets like the CBS network and Paramount Pictures under Skydance's control. The approval followed a controversial $16 million settlement paid by Paramount to resolve a lawsuit from President Donald Trump over a CBS News interview. Critics, including the dissenting FCC commissioner, have condemned the timing, suggesting the deal's approval was linked to the settlement and the recent cancellation of Stephen Colbert's show, calling it a "cowardly capitulation" to political pressure.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against New York City, challenging its sanctuary laws that limit cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration agents. The suit claims these policies obstruct federal immigration enforcement and endanger public safety by preventing the transfer of non-citizen criminals to federal custody. The legal action follows a recent shooting of an off-duty border patrol officer, allegedly by undocumented immigrants. City officials defended the policies as essential for ensuring all residents, regardless of status, feel safe reporting crimes, but will review the lawsuit.</p>

Trump claimed the project's cost had risen to $3.1 billion, a figure Powell disputed, stating it included a separate building completed years ago. The president has previously criticized the project's cost overruns and Powell's handling of interest rates. Despite the tension, Trump stated he does not think firing Powell is necessary, but reiterated his demand that the Fed must lower interest rates to spur economic activity. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the committee's Conservative members dissented, aligning with the government's position that recognition should be part of a long-term, two-state solution.

          <p>A research team in China has become the first to directly observe and measure quantum friction between two solid surfaces. Using folded graphene, scientists at the Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics discovered that, contrary to classical physics, friction did not always increase with thickness; some thicker folds actually slid more easily. This counterintuitive effect was traced to how the material's folded structure altered electron movement, restricting the conversion of motion into heat. The breakthrough, published in Nature Communications, could pave the way for developing ultra-efficient, low-wear nanoscale devices and machines.</p>
