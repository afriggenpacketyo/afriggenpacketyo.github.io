          <p>Chicago Police Officer Krystal Rivera was fatally shot by a fellow officer during a chase in Chatham after attempting an investigatory stop. Officers confronted a second person with a rifle, leading to the accidental discharge of a weapon. Rivera was rushed to the hospital, but the vehicle caught fire due to a mechanical issue, causing further delays in her transport. The investigation is ongoing, with authorities examining body camera footage to determine the circumstances of the shooting and the events leading up to the investigative stop, while the department grieves the loss of a dedicated officer, who was also a mother. The officer's death is a significant blow to the 6th District, which has experienced multiple recent tragedies, raising concerns about the mental well-being of fellow officers. Optimism for the department is low.</p>

          <p>A federal judge approved a $2.8 billion settlement, which will allow US colleges to pay athletes millions of dollars, marking a significant shift in college sports. The agreement allows schools to share up to $20.5 million with athletes annually and provides $2.7 billion over the next decade to former players previously barred from revenue. This settlement addresses the long-standing debate over compensating college athletes, who generate substantial revenue for their institutions, primarily through football and basketball. The changes are expected to professionalize college athletics, affecting recruitment, program offerings, and the overall landscape of the NCAA, as the agreement may lead to some athletes losing their spots on teams.

          <p>A federal judge approved the House v. NCAA settlement, paving the way for college athletes to be directly paid for the first time, marking a new era for college sports. NCAA's top division schools will be allowed to directly pay athletes, capped at $20.5 million per school, and over $2 billion will be paid to former college athletes who were not allowed to earn money while in school. The settlement arose from three lawsuits challenging the NCAA's amateurism tradition, which banned schools from compensating players beyond scholarships. The settlement establishes a third-party clearinghouse to review licensing agreements for fair market value, which is expected to face legal challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Osceola County Sheriff Marcos Lopez was arrested on felony charges for allegedly running an illegal gambling operation that generated millions of dollars.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis suspended Lopez and appointed an interim sheriff, while Lopez pleaded not guilty and was given a $1 million bond.

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant who was wrongly deported to El Salvador, has been brought back to the U.S. to face federal charges of conspiracy to transport aliens and unlawful transportation of undocumented aliens. Abrego Garcia was initially deported in March and held in a Salvadoran prison, but the Salvadoran government agreed to return him after the U.S. presented an arrest warrant. Attorney General Pam Bondi claimed Abrego Garcia played a significant role in an alien smuggling ring, while his attorney argued that the charges are an abuse of power. Abrego Garcia made an initial court appearance and remains in custody, with a hearing scheduled for June 13.</p>

With rice prices doubling, Ishiba seeks to boost rice production, countering opposition parties pitching a consumption tax cut. Despite the official end of the "acreage reduction policy" in 2018, production adjustments continue with subsidies for feed rice, but Ishiba now pursues a consumer-focused approach to lower prices. The Prime Minister's efforts come as opposition parties urge a consumption tax cut to stimulate household spending amid prolonged inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mykale Baker, an 18-year-old Burger King employee in Dacula, Georgia, was rewarded with substantial donations after helping his coworkers on his graduation night. Baker, known for his strong work ethic, showed up at Burger King after his graduation ceremony and noticed his colleagues were overwhelmed, so he immediately started helping. A customer, Maria Mendoza, captured the act on video, posted it online, and started a crowdfunding campaign, which raised over $200,000. The Burger King Foundation also surprised Baker with $10,000, and gave Mendoza $10,000 for her daughter, who also just graduated high school.</p>

          <p>A unique monster character called "Labubu," a rabbit-like plush toy created by Chinese maker Pop Mart, has become a global hit, attracting long lines and fervent fans. The character, designed by Hong Kong-born artist Kasing Lung, is inspired by a Nordic elf and features pointed ears and serrated teeth. Much of Labubu's popularity stems from celebrity endorsements and a clever marketing strategy, including selling collectibles in "blind boxes." The global success of Labubu reflects China's transformation from a toy subcontractor to a creator of original products, with Pop Mart shares valued significantly higher than Sanrio Co., the company behind Hello Kitty.</p>

          <p>Three residents filed a lawsuit against Sonoma County, alleging that code enforcement is using drones to take aerial images of their homes without warrants, which the ACLU calls a "runaway spying operation." The county began using drones in 2019 to track illegal cannabis cultivation, but has since used them to find other code violations, according to the suit. The ACLU argues that this violates the California Constitution's right to privacy and protection against unreasonable searches. The lawsuit alleges that the county's drone policy has loosened over the years, allowing officials to launch discretionary proactive investigations without complaints.</p>

          <p>Tesla faces significant challenges after a disastrous first quarter, compounded by CEO Elon Musk's feud with President Trump, as the spat began with a policy disagreement and escalated into an online brawl, impacting Tesla's stock value. Musk's criticism of Trump's spending bill led to Trump threatening to end government contracts and cut off subsidies for Musk's companies. The rift has damaged the relationship between business, politics, and power, and the Trump administration's influence could affect Tesla's regulation, investigations, and government support, as the company faces increased competition from lower-cost EV makers in China. One of Musk's most divisive actions in leading the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was the dismantling of USAID, which previously delivered billions of dollars of food and medicine to more than 100 countries.</p>

Prosecutors have charged Mr Combs with racketeering conspiracy, sexual assault, and transportation to engage in prostitution, to which he has pleaded not guilty. The testimony aims to provide evidence that the music mogul's activities were criminal, with the defense arguing the government has overstepped by portraying consensual sex as evidence of crimes.</p>

          <p>The government is struggling to cut the amount of foreign aid it spends on hotel bills for asylum seekers in the UK, with the Home Office planning to spend £2.2bn of overseas development assistance (ODA) this financial year. This figure is only marginally less than the £2.3bn spent in 2024/25, with the money largely used to cover accommodation costs. The Home Office said it was committed to ending asylum hotels and speeding up asylum decisions to save taxpayers' money, but Whitehall officials and international charities have said the Home Office has no incentive to reduce ODA spending because the money does not come out of its budgets. The scale of aid spending on asylum hotels has meant huge cuts in UK support for humanitarian and development priorities across the world.</p>
