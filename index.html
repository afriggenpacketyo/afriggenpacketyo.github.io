          <h2>Awoniyi Injury Blamed on Delayed Offside Flag by Teammate</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 04:01:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nottingham Forest striker Taiwo Awoniyi's teammate, Ola Aina, believes that Awoniyi's recent injury could have been avoided if the assistant referee had raised the offside flag earlier during a Premier League match against Leicester City. Awoniyi collided with a post while trying to reach a cross from Anthony Elanga, who was in an offside position, and underwent surgery for a serious abdominal injury. Aina expressed his frustration, stating that Elanga was clearly offside, but the flag was delayed due to a protocol introduced in 2020, which allows play to continue until the sequence is complete. This protocol is designed to prevent the premature halting of potentially advantageous plays, but in this case, it led to an unfortunate injury.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Taiwan are investigating multiple cases involving local artists who are accused of evading the island's compulsory military service. Eleven celebrities were detained in coordinated police raids as part of a broader investigation into allegations that a criminal syndicate has been orchestrating schemes to help male residents avoid conscription. Those involved include singers Nine Chen and Daniel Chen, drummer Jushe Lee, William Liao from Lollipop, and comedian Daikon Huang Liang Jun. The investigation has intensified as Taiwan increases its defense efforts amid growing military pressure from Beijing in the Taiwan Strait, reflecting the island's heightened security concerns.</p>

          <p>The UK economy grew by 0.7% in the first three months of the year, surpassing analyst forecasts, largely driven by the services sector and significant growth in production. Chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed the figures as evidence of the UK economy's strength, noting it outpaced the US, Canada, France, Italy, and Germany. However, some analysts caution that this growth rate is unlikely to continue due to factors like upcoming US tariffs and increased employer taxes. Despite the positive data, concerns remain about the sustainability of this rebound, with potential headwinds from global trade tensions.</p>

Reactions were mixed, with some seeing the remarks as echoing anti-imperialist sentiments, while others remained skeptical, particularly concerning human rights issues. Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia also included discussions on business deals and diplomatic ambitions, including urging Saudi Arabia to recognize Israel.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is contemplating doubling the release of its stockpiled rice to approximately 600,000 tons in an effort to curb soaring rice prices. This move comes as rice prices remain near record highs due to a shortfall, and the government aims to stabilize the market by increasing supply. However, reducing the stockpile to around 300,000 tons, which is below the appropriate reserve level, raises concerns about the government's ability to respond to future harvest failures. The government is also considering relaxing buyback requirements to encourage more participation in auctions.</p>

          <p>The UK economy expanded by 0.7% in the first quarter of 2025, exceeding market expectations and marking a significant improvement from the previous quarter. The growth was primarily driven by the services and production sectors, with construction remaining flat. Chancellor Rachel Reeves highlighted that the UK economy grew faster than other major economies, including the US and Germany. However, some analysts caution that certain factors, such as changes in stamp duty land tax, may have contributed to the strong performance, and challenges remain.</p>

          <p>Two British academics have discovered that a manuscript held in Harvard Law School's library for 80 years, previously believed to be a copy, is an original 1300 version of Magna Carta. This makes it one of only seven such documents from that date still in existence. The document, which was purchased for just $27.50 after World War II, has been authenticated through spectral imaging and comparison with other known originals. The discovery is considered significant given Magna Carta's role in establishing fundamental freedoms and limiting the power of the monarch.</p>

          <p>A group of 21 economies, including the U.S. and China, has cautioned that their collective growth is at risk of a sharp slowdown due to trade tensions and policy uncertainty. The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forecasts growth to drop to 2.6% in 2025, down from 3.6% in the prior year. Concerns were raised about the negative impact of tariff hikes, retaliatory measures, and non-tariff barriers on trade and investment. Restoring confidence in trade requires easing tensions, strengthening supply chain resilience, and improving transparency of trade rules.</p>

          <p>Alabama lawmakers have approved a bill providing enhanced legal protections for police officers, setting legal standards for the use of force and providing for an immunity hearing. Republicans argue the bill provides a clear legal framework and support for law enforcement, while Democrats express concerns that it could embolden misconduct and disproportionately affect Black individuals. The bill allows an immunity hearing to determine if a case can proceed based on whether the officer acted recklessly outside the scope of law enforcement duties, and requires law enforcement departments to track use of force complaints.</p>

          <p>Denmark's economic growth, largely attributed to a surge in pharmaceutical exports, is expected to moderate, but potential U.S. tariffs on the pharma industry are not expected to be a significant factor. The IMF reports that Denmark's drugmakers rely on a merchanting and processing system where most of the value is in the intellectual property, with manufacturing contracted to other countries. As a result, only 3% of Denmark's total exports are produced in the country and pass through customs, limiting the direct impact of U.S. tariffs.</p>

          <p>Singapore's Changi Airport has begun construction on its fifth terminal, which is expected to be operational in the mid-2030s. The new terminal will nearly double the airport's existing area, increasing its capacity to handle 140 million passengers per year. This expansion is part of a larger trend in Asia, where airports are undergoing extensive development to cope with projected growth in air travel. The decision to build Terminal 5 reflects the expectation that air travel will continue to rise, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
