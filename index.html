          <p>Economist Dean Baker refutes President Trump's claim that low tariffs caused the Great Depression.  Baker points out that tariffs were not significantly lowered before the Depression and that the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which raised tariffs, actually worsened the economic crisis.  This highlights the inaccurate historical claims made by Trump to support his current tariff policies.  The analysis emphasizes the consensus among economists that protectionist trade policies can have detrimental effects. </p>

          <h2>Analysis: Trump's Actions Reveal an Unconstrained Presidency</h2>

          <p>The recent actions of the Trump administration, including sweeping tariffs, firings of national security officials, and drastic cuts to the Department of Health and Human Services, are analyzed as evidence of an unconstrained presidency.  The author argues that these actions, while somewhat predictable given Trump's past statements, are shocking in their scale and apparent incompetence.  The analysis suggests that Trump's decisions are driven by reasons disconnected from reality, and that traditional checks and balances have failed to constrain his actions. The author concludes that the situation amounts to “government by mad king.”</p>
