            <p>Wells Fargo's $1.95 trillion asset cap, imposed by the Federal Reserve, may be unintentionally shielding the bank from the worst effects of the recent stock market downturn amid escalating recession fears and trade tensions. Analysts at Piper Sandler upgraded Wells Fargo's rating, noting that the asset cap has led the bank to adopt a less aggressive risk profile compared to its peers. While the asset cap has historically hindered growth, it now positions Wells Fargo to potentially outperform on credit during economic uncertainty. Despite this, the CNBC Investing Club remains cautious, citing a large existing position and preferring to wait for a more opportune entry point. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Economist Michael R. Strain predicts that President Trump's sweeping tariffs will significantly increase the unemployment rate, potentially pushing it to recessionary levels. A CNBC survey revealed that 37% of CEOs expect to cut jobs this year, with some companies already announcing layoffs due to the tariffs. Industries like retail, wholesale trade, and manufacturing are expected to be most immediately affected, while companies with entirely U.S.-made products could see short-term gains. However, experts agree that job losses will likely outweigh gains, with the Budget Lab at Yale estimating a one-percentage-point reduction in U.S. GDP growth for 2025.</p>

            <p>Measles cases are rising across the United States, accompanied by dangerous misinformation that puts people at risk. Cases have surpassed 600 nationwide, with the majority reported in Texas, where two children have died.

Experts emphasize that measles is highly contagious and can cause severe complications, while the MMR vaccine is safe and effective, with decades of research showing no link to autism.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration's use of tattoos to identify migrants as members of the Tren de Aragua gang is being questioned by experts and law enforcement officials. ICE has used tattoos to allege that Venezuelan men deported to El Salvador are gang members, even acknowledging that many have no criminal records. However, experts argue that tattoos are not reliable markers of affiliation, as Tren de Aragua does not have a history of using tattoos to indicate membership. Police in Aurora, Colorado, where the gang has been active, focus on criminal activity rather than relying on tattoos for identification.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Trump administration, rejecting challenges to the mass firing of new federal workers. The justices overturned a ruling by a U.S. District Judge in San Francisco who had ordered the administration to rehire 16,000 probationary employees. The Supreme Court stated that the judge improperly based his ruling on complaints from nonprofit groups who said they would be affected by the cutbacks. Justices Sotomayor and Jackson dissented, while Trump's lawyers argued that judges do not have the authority to second-guess the management of federal agencies.</p>

            <p>The Keystone Pipeline was temporarily shut down after an employee at a pump station reported hearing what was described as a "mechanical bang." The employee immediately shut down the pipeline and notified emergency personnel, confining the release of product to an agricultural field south of the pump station. The cause of the rupture and the volume of crude oil spilled were not immediately available. No people or structures were affected, and a nearby stream was isolated as a precaution. The pipeline has had at least three significant spills since 2017.</p>

The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage jumped significantly, erasing the decline from the previous week.

He believes his plans, which include making it harder to claim disability payments, will lead to savings and increased employment. However, concerns have been raised by his own MPs regarding the potential impact of the cuts on poverty levels.</p>
