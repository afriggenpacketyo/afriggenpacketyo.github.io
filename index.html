          <p>Boxing legend Manny Pacquiao, aged 46, returned to the ring after a four-year retirement, fighting WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios to a majority draw in Las Vegas. While one judge scored the bout for Barrios, the other two declared it a draw, allowing Barrios to retain his title. Despite showing flashes of his former speed, Pacquiao's stamina waned in the later rounds, and he has since expressed a desire for a rematch, citing his short two-month training camp as a factor.</p>

          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, have significantly revised the number of people missing following devastating floods, reducing the count from nearly 100 to just three. This reduction is attributed to extensive follow-up work by state and local agencies who verified the safety of many individuals initially reported as unaccounted for. The total number of missing people was over 160 at its peak. The statewide death toll from the flooding stands at 134, with 107 of those fatalities occurring in Kerr County.</p>

          <p>Actor Freddie Prinze Jr. recently shared his perspective on his enduring 23-year marriage to actress Sarah Michelle Gellar, emphasizing that their relationship requires continuous effort. He credits their strong foundation as friends before becoming romantically involved as a potential secret to their success, though he acknowledges different paths work for other couples. Gellar has also commented on the topic, suggesting that a disposable societal attitude has negatively impacted modern relationships, and humorously added that separate bathrooms might also be a key factor.</p>

          <p>Linda Duffey Gwozdz was convicted of second-degree murder for the 2007 shooting death of her husband, Patrick Duffey, despite her unusual defense. She claimed the shooting was an accident, stating they were mimicking a cartoon in which her husband, using an Elmer Fudd voice, said "No more buwwets," leading her to believe the gun was unloaded. After an initial mistrial, prosecutors in the second trial streamlined their case, omitting Linda's police interviews, which resulted in a swift guilty verdict. The case highlights how different trial strategies can lead to starkly different outcomes.</p>

          <p>Kabul is on the verge of becoming the first modern capital city to run out of water, facing a crisis driven by climate change, population growth, and over-extraction of groundwater. A recent report warns this could trigger economic collapse, as nearly half the city's boreholes are already dry and up to 80% of the remaining groundwater is contaminated. Residents are forced to spend a significant portion of their income on water, while women and children often spend hours fetching it. The situation is exacerbated by a halt in foreign aid, crippling efforts to address the emergency.</p>

          <p>More than three years after 13-year-old Iran Moreno was killed by a stray bullet while playing video games in his Pasadena home, two suspects have been charged with his murder. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office has charged Muhammad Abdul-Malik as the suspected shooter and Teraeja Laquanna Flemmings as the alleged getaway driver. A breakthrough in the cold case came after recently enhanced surveillance video provided new leads, resulting in the suspects' arrests this month. Authorities stated that Moreno was not the intended target of the shooting.</p>
