          <p>In her first major speech since leaving office, former Vice President Kamala Harris strongly criticized President Trump's initial 100 days, characterizing them as "absolute chaos" and accusing him of undermining American ideals. Harris asserted that the Trump administration is advancing a narrow, self-serving agenda that threatens American democracy, pointing to his tariff policies as the cause of the "greatest manmade economic crisis in modern presidential history." She also alluded to the administration's immigration policies, stating it is unacceptable to detain or disappear American citizens without due process. Harris praised Democratic lawmakers who have been speaking out against the Trump administration, and emphasized the need for courage to combat fear. Optimism score: 35</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has revised its economic and inflation projections downward for the current fiscal year, citing concerns over the impact of U.S. trade tariffs on the Japanese economy. The central bank expects the economy to grow by only 0.5 percent, down from a previous forecast of 1.1 percent, and projects core consumer prices to rise by 2.2 percent, compared to an earlier estimate of 2.4 percent. Despite these revisions, the BOJ has maintained its benchmark interest rate, remaining cautious about the uncertain evolution of trade policies and their potential effects on overseas economic activity.

          <p>Several European auto giants, including Stellantis and Mercedes, have withdrawn or reduced their financial guidance for the year, citing uncertainties related to President Trump's trade tariffs. The tariffs, including a 25% levy on automotive imports into the U.S., have led to a sharp drop in first-quarter profits for many automakers. While some analysts note that recent moves to ease car tariffs provide partial relief, the volatile nature of Trump's trade policies is hindering long-term corporate investment decisions. Volvo Cars and Porsche have also adjusted their forecasts due to tariff pressures. Optimism score: 45</p>

          <p>Eleven students accused of participating in a hazing incident targeting younger members of the Westhill High School boys lacrosse team have turned themselves in after facing potential kidnapping charges. The incident involved older players allegedly tying up a younger teammate, placing a pillowcase over his head, and throwing him into the trunk of a car. The district attorney condemned the incident as criminal activity and hazing on steroids. The attorney representing the students stated that the young men regret their involvement in what began as a misguided attempt at a prank. Optimism score: 50</p>

          <p>This New York Times article reports that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) has lowered its economic growth forecast due to concerns about U.S. tariffs.

The central bank cited "trade and other policies" leading to a slowdown in overseas economies and a decline in domestic corporate profits. The article highlights the impact of Trump's tariffs on Japan's economy and the challenges they pose to the BOJ's efforts to normalize monetary policy. Optimism score: 50</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated there is a "very good chance" of reaching a trade deal with China, despite his trade envoy, Jamieson Greer, indicating that no official negotiations are currently underway. Trump reiterated his view that the United States was previously "ripped off" by China. Greer acknowledged the absence of formal talks but emphasized Washington's desire for a fair trade relationship with China, seeking to address harmful foreign trade practices.

          <p>A recent poll by the Asian American Foundation reveals that one in four non-Asian Americans perceive Chinese-Americans as a potential threat, particularly concerning national security. Additionally, four in ten respondents fear that Asian-Americans may have greater allegiance to their countries of origin than to the United States. These findings highlight concerns about the ability of Asian-Americans to assimilate amid rising social tension and strained US-China relations. The poll underscores a troubling disconnect between perceptions of Asian-Americans and their lived experiences, which has consequences for their safety and sense of belonging. Optimism score: 55</p>

          <p>A California Assembly committee has scaled back a controversial provision in a proposed bill that sought to end solar credits for owners of rooftop solar systems. The committee amended Assembly Bill 942, initially aimed at limiting the benefits of long-standing programs providing energy credits, to apply only to those who sell their homes. Despite the amendment, rooftop solar owners expressed concerns that the measure could still reduce their home value. The bill is supported by major utilities and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, who argue that the credits raise electric bills for those without solar panels.
