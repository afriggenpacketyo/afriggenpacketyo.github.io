        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump and Elon Musk engaged in a heated exchange after Musk criticized Trump's budget bill, calling it a "disgusting abomination" due to its projected impact on the national debt. Trump responded by suggesting the government could terminate Musk's companies' subsidies and contracts, leading to a sharp decline in Tesla's stock price. Musk, in turn, claimed that Trump would have lost the election without his support and accused Trump of "ingratitude." The dispute escalated quickly, with both figures trading barbs on social media, marking a significant rupture in their once-close relationship. This public feud highlights the tensions between political agendas and business interests, potentially impacting both the legislative process and market confidence. Optimism surrounding the relationship between the political class and the technology class is now lower.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock experienced a significant drop following a public dispute between CEO Elon Musk and former President Donald Trump, with shares tumbling as much as 18% in intraday trading. The feud erupted after Musk criticized Trump's proposed tax and spending bill, leading Trump to suggest the government could withdraw contracts from Musk's companies, including SpaceX. Analysts noted the dispute sent "shivers down the backs of Tesla investors," as some of Musk's companies are reliant on federal contracts. This event underscores the potential impact of political tensions on the stock market and investor confidence, particularly for companies with close ties to government contracts.
