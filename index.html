          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced a potential "massive increase" on tariffs for Chinese goods, directly linking the threat to new export controls on rare-earth minerals imposed by Beijing. In a social media post, he accused China of attempting to hold the world 'captive' and suggested he might cancel an upcoming meeting with President Xi Jinping. The remarks prompted an immediate negative reaction in financial markets, with the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all experiencing significant declines due to renewed fears of a trade war. This development challenges the fragile trade truce currently in place between the two economic superpowers.</p>

          <p>Following the start of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, humanitarian organizations are mobilizing for a large-scale aid operation into Gaza. UN officials report that enough food is staged to feed the entire population of 2.1 million for three months, with plans to increase deliveries to hundreds of trucks daily. The International Committee of the Red Cross and the European Union have also confirmed their readiness to deliver assistance and support reconstruction efforts. The effort aims to address the severe humanitarian crisis, including warnings of famine, that has developed during the prolonged conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new ceasefire agreement has been reached between Israel and Hamas, involving a phased release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and a halt to fighting. This article analyzes the deal's stability, noting that significant pressure from the Trump administration was a key factor in bringing both sides to the table after a previous truce failed. The agreement is popular among the Israeli public but places Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a precarious political position, caught between pressure from the U.S. and his far-right coalition partners who oppose ending the war. The successful implementation of the first phase and negotiations for the second will determine its long-term success.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has initiated layoffs, known as "Reductions in Force" (RIFs), for federal workers as the government shutdown continues. White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought confirmed the firings have begun and are substantial, affecting agencies like the Department of Health and Human Services. The move follows warnings that sharp measures would be taken if the funding impasse was not resolved. Federal employee unions have responded by filing lawsuits, while the administration and congressional Republicans place blame on Democrats for the shutdown.</p>

          <p>Shares for data center company Applied Digital climbed 16% after it reported first-quarter revenue of $64.2 million, an 84% increase from the previous year and well above analyst expectations. This growth is largely fueled by strong demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure, highlighted by an expanded lease agreement with CoreWeave that brings the anticipated contracted revenue to $11 billion. The company is actively expanding its data center campuses in North Dakota to meet the rising demand from hyperscalers investing heavily in AI deployment. The positive results have pushed the stock's year-to-date gains to over 350%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The ongoing federal government shutdown is largely fueled by a dispute over the Affordable Care Act (ACA), as Senate Democrats are refusing to approve funding without a rollback of Medicaid cuts and the preservation of insurance subsidies. These subsidies are critical for 20 million Americans and prevent significant increases in health coverage costs. This article argues that despite its political unpopularity, the ACA has successfully expanded insurance coverage and helped control the growth of national health spending. The current political standoff threatens these gains and highlights the deep, persistent partisan divide over U.S. healthcare policy.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the recent federal indictments of former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, arguing they represent Donald Trump's effort to weaponize the Justice Department against his political adversaries. The piece contends that these prosecutions shatter long-standing norms of law enforcement independence and are based on weak legal grounds, noting that career prosecutors reportedly recommended against bringing the charges. This strategy is framed as a form of retribution for the investigations and impeachments Trump himself faced, raising serious concerns about the rule of law.</p>

          <p>A top Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) official testified in federal court regarding the Trump administration's plans to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was mistakenly deported earlier this year and later returned to the U.S. The official stated that the government has been in discussions with numerous countries, including Eswatini and Ghana, about accepting Abrego Garcia. This testimony comes as his lawyers challenge the legality of his prolonged detention, arguing it violates a Supreme Court precedent against indefinite confinement while the government seeks a country for removal.</p>

          <p>Investment analyst Jim Cramer suggested that investors should look at overlooked stocks like Cisco Systems and Starbucks as buying opportunities, even as the broader market reacts negatively to geopolitical news. He argued that Cisco's stock has room to grow despite its flat performance, given its reasonable valuation in the AI-driven data center sector. Cramer also expressed strong confidence in Starbucks under CEO Brian Niccol's leadership, predicting that his strategic plan will successfully drive the stock price higher. The commentary encourages looking past short-term market jitters for long-term value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The British government is launching a consultation to determine whether its planned national digital ID system should be extended to include children between the ages of 13 and 16. The scheme, set to be mandatory for employment by 2029, has already faced significant public opposition. A government spokesperson justified the potential inclusion of minors by noting that many teenagers work part-time and would need to prove their right to work. However, civil liberties groups like Big Brother Watch have criticized the proposal as "sinister" and an unnecessary step toward state overreach and surveillance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the recent Gaza ceasefire was achieved primarily because Donald Trump finally decided to leverage the full power of the U.S. presidency to pressure Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The author suggests that after Netanyahu acted without consulting him on an attack in Doha, Trump moved decisively to end the conflict, leaving the isolated Israeli leader with no alternative but to agree. While giving Trump credit for stopping the violence, the analysis is also critical, questioning why this decisive pressure was not applied months earlier, which could have saved countless lives.</p>

          <p>Chinese regulators have opened an antitrust probe into U.S. semiconductor giant Qualcomm regarding its acquisition of Israeli chip firm Autotalks, causing the company's stock to drop 4%. China's State Administration of Market Regulation announced the investigation on suspicion of violating the country's anti-monopoly law. This move represents another escalation in the ongoing tech and trade tensions between the United States and China. It follows similar actions against other American tech companies and comes just ahead of a planned meeting between the leaders of both nations.</p>
