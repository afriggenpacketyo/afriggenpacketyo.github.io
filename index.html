          <p>President Trump and the first lady traveled to Central Texas to assess the damage from catastrophic flash floods that occurred on July 4. The disaster has resulted in at least 121 fatalities, with over 170 people still missing as search and recovery efforts continue. A significant number of deaths occurred at a girls' summer camp in Kerr County, where the presidential visit was focused. Mr. Trump, who has signed a disaster declaration for the region, met with local officials, first responders, and some affected families to review the ongoing recovery operations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A provision in President Trump's new tax bill could create a significant tax surprise for high-income earners. The legislation temporarily increases the state and local tax (SALT) deduction to $40,000 but includes a phase-out for those with a modified adjusted gross income between $500,000 and $600,000. Tax professionals warn this structure creates a "SALT torpedo," an artificially high marginal tax rate that could reach 45.5% on income within that specific range. Experts advise individuals near this income threshold to consult with tax advisors about strategies to manage their potential tax liability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing its most severe measles outbreak in over three decades, with more than 1,290 cases confirmed in 2025. Health officials are concerned that the summer travel season will further accelerate the spread of the highly contagious disease, which has already resulted in three deaths. Experts attribute the resurgence to declining vaccination rates following the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupted routine immunizations and amplified anti-vaccine sentiment. They strongly urge the public to ensure their MMR vaccinations are up-to-date as the most effective form of protection.</p>

          <p>Following a televised interview, the widow of Corey Comperatore, who was killed at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, received phone calls from both President Trump and Secret Service Director Sean Curran. Comperatore had publicly demanded accountability from the Secret Service for security failures that allowed the shooting to occur one year ago. Director Curran expressed his regret, apologized for the lack of communication, and agreed to meet with her to review the case. President Trump offered his condolences and support, stating that a comprehensive report on the assassination attempt will be released.</p>

Other states in the top tier include Hawaii, Florida, and Colorado, which are grappling with severe homeowner's insurance crises, and northeastern states like New York and Massachusetts, burdened by high housing and daily living expenses.

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that COVID-19 cases are likely on the rise in 25 states, signaling the start of a potential summer wave. While nationwide activity is still classified as "low," data from wastewater samples and emergency room visits show notable increases, particularly in the Southeast and Pacific Northwest. A recent CDC analysis suggests the virus has settled into a pattern of biannual surges, driven by ongoing genetic evolution of its spike protein. This uptick coincides with reports of another rising respiratory virus, parvovirus B19, prompting continued public health vigilance.</p>

The article outlines four main strategies, including credit counseling, which can help create a manageable debt plan with reduced interest rates. Another option is credit card debt forgiveness, where a company negotiates a lower lump-sum settlement with creditors. For short-term issues, many lenders offer hardship programs with temporary relief, while for overwhelming debt, Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy can offer legal protection and a chance to reset finances.</p>

          <p>Lord Ian Blair, who served as the commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police from 2005 to 2008, has passed away at the age of 72. His tenure was marked by significant events, most notably the 7/7 London bombings in 2005. His leadership also faced intense scrutiny following the mistaken shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes by police two weeks after the bombings. Lord Blair, who joined the police in 1974, stepped down in 2008 after losing the confidence of then-London Mayor Boris Johnson, and was later appointed a crossbench peer in the House of Lords.</p>

          <p>Missouri's governor has signed a bill repealing a voter-approved law that guaranteed paid sick leave for workers and tied minimum wage to inflation. The move, a victory for business groups, reverses a ballot measure passed just eight months prior and is set to take effect on August 28. Proponents of the repeal, including Governor Mike Kehoe, described the original law as a burdensome mandate on businesses. In contrast, workers' rights advocates called the decision a betrayal of families who need to choose between a paycheck and caring for a sick child.</p>

Reviews pointed to lyrics focused on his new fatherhood, his marriage, and his frustrations with media intrusion, with one critic calling it an "uncomfortable and unfiltered cry for help." While some praised its nostalgic R&B sound, others found it artistically lethargic and a confirmation of his recent creative slump.</p>

          <p>With interest rates potentially poised to fall, now is a critical time to evaluate high-yield savings accounts. A major advantage is that rates remain high, currently offering over 4.30%, providing a strong return on savings. These accounts also maintain liquidity, which is crucial amid economic uncertainty, unlike CDs that lock up funds. However, a key disadvantage is that these variable rates could fall preemptively, even before the Federal Reserve officially makes a cut. Additionally, the best rates are typically offered by online-only banks, which may be a drawback for those who prefer traditional branch banking. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's newly signed budget act significantly changes the federal student loan system, reducing the number of repayment plans and capping borrowing amounts. The law phases out existing plans like SAVE and introduces two new options: a standard 10-to-25-year plan and a new income-driven plan with payments lasting up to 30 years. The legislation also tightens eligibility for Pell Grants and eliminates Grad PLUS loans for new students starting in 2026.

          <p>The price of Bitcoin reached a new all-time high, surpassing $118,000, driven by a massive influx of institutional investment into Bitcoin ETFs. On Thursday, these funds recorded their largest single day of inflows for 2025, totaling $1.18 billion. The rally was also fueled by expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve and the potential inflationary impact of new government spending, which can make alternative assets like Bitcoin more attractive. The sharp price increase triggered over $650 million in short liquidations, further accelerating the upward momentum as traders were forced to buy back the cryptocurrency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought has intensified his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, vowing an investigation into a $2.5 billion renovation of the Fed's headquarters. Vought accused Powell of mismanagement and misleading Congress about the project's costs, which he labeled a "palace." This move opens another front in President Trump's campaign against Powell, whom he has repeatedly attacked for not lowering interest rates. While the Fed is a quasi-governmental agency with control over its own buildings, the accusations could be used to build a case for dismissing Powell for cause. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pub landlords across the United Kingdom are facing severe financial pressure as rising operational costs squeeze already thin profit margins. Many publicans report that essentials like electricity have doubled in price, while beer suppliers are implementing multiple price increases per year.

The industry has seen a steady decline, with 15,000 pubs closing since 2000, and many landlords fear their establishments may be next without more significant government support.</p>

          <p>UEFA has ruled that Crystal Palace will be demoted from the Europa League to the less prestigious Conference League for the upcoming season. The decision is due to a breach of multi-club ownership rules, as American businessman John Textor has a stake in Palace while also being the majority owner of French club Lyon, who also qualified for the Europa League. Under UEFA regulations, two clubs with the same influential owner cannot compete in the same competition. Lyon takes precedence due to their higher domestic league finish, though Crystal Palace has stated it will appeal the ruling.</p>

Despite a previous 90-day "pause" ending, the administration has issued new tariff letters with a deadline of August 1, including rates of 35% on Canada and 50% on Brazil. While stock markets have remained largely resilient, some economists believe the full negative impact of the trade disputes has been delayed by businesses front-loading orders. This prolonged uncertainty complicates investment decisions and risks a mild stagflationary shock, pushing inflation up while slowing economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>
