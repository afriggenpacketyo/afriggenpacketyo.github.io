          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to maintain custody of migrants being flown to South Sudan, expressing concern that their deportation violated a previous court order. Judge Murphy emphasized that these migrants must remain in government custody while the situation is reviewed, even suggesting the possibility of turning the plane around. The order comes amidst ongoing clashes between the judiciary and the Trump administration over immigration policies, with accusations of violating due process. Lawyers for the migrants raised concerns about the dangers they could face in South Sudan, citing the country's political instability and violence, with a number of migrants being from other countries such as Myanmar and Vietnam.

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio faced sharp criticism from Senate Democrats during a hearing on the State Department budget, with some expressing regret over their votes to confirm him. Democrats accused Rubio of betraying his principles by supporting President Trump's cuts to foreign aid programs, which they argued benefited rivals like China. Rubio defended the administration's policies, asserting that the US would continue to provide vital foreign aid efficiently and that the cuts did not create an opening for Beijing. The contentious hearing highlighted the deep divisions over the Trump administration's approach to foreign policy.</p>

          <p>A new test has been developed that significantly reduces the time it takes to diagnose brain tumors, from weeks to just hours, according to researchers. The "ultra-rapid" method of genetic testing is being hailed as a "game changer" by surgeons, potentially improving care and treatment for thousands of patients. The method, developed by scientists at the University of Nottingham in partnership with Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, has already been used in 50 operations with a 100% success rate. Faster diagnosis allows for more timely and effective treatment, reducing patient anxiety and potentially eliminating the need for multiple surgeries.</p>

This decision is driven by customer demand and the increasing popularity of hybrid vehicles, despite the slower-than-expected adoption of all-electric vehicles. Toyota expects to continue growing its hybrid offerings, with seven of its current vehicles being exclusively hybrid models.</p>

Retail electricity costs are also expected to rise, potentially doubling by 2050. Electric grid operators are sounding the alarm about elevated summer temperatures and high peak demand, emphasizing the need for adequate resources to maintain grid reliability.</p>
