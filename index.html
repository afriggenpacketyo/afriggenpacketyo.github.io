          <p>Experts at the Singapore Defence Technology Summit argue that open-source AI models may be safer for military use than closed-source alternatives.  They believe open-source models allow for greater inspection and community-based improvements in safety and robustness. This contrasts with the common belief that closed-source models are inherently more secure.</p>
