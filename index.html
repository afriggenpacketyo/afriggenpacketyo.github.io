          <p>A new tax and spending bill signed by President Trump does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits, despite claims suggesting it does. Instead, the legislation introduces a new, temporary "bonus" deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors aged 65 and older with incomes below certain thresholds. Policy experts clarify that this deduction applies to a senior's total income, not just their benefits, and primarily advantages higher-income seniors. Critics also warn that while offering some relief, the measure could increase financial pressure on the Social Security trust fund. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Authorities have found human remains at the scene of a major explosion and fire at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, California. The incident, which occurred at Devastating Pyrotechnics, left seven people unaccounted for, and officials have not yet identified the remains. The explosion also sparked grass fires that burned approximately 80 acres and prompted mandatory evacuations. Investigations have revealed the facility, located on property owned by a Yolo County Sheriff's Lieutenant, lacked local licenses to store fireworks, adding a layer of regulatory scrutiny to the tragic event.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to deport a group of migrants with criminal records from a naval base in Djibouti to South Sudan. The ruling clarified an earlier order, stating a lower court could not enforce an injunction that the high court had already paused. This decision is a significant development in the administration's policy of deporting migrants to third-party countries, even those with no connection to the deportees. Justices Sotomayor and Jackson dissented, expressing grave concerns that the men could face torture or death upon arrival in the politically unstable nation.</p>

It also raises the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap and repeals numerous green energy tax credits.

          <p>Italian luxury brand Prada is facing backlash from artisans in Kolhapur, India, for releasing a line of sandals that strongly resemble traditional, handcrafted Kolhapuri footwear without acknowledging their origin. Local artisans, who earn very little for their craft, expressed frustration over the potential high price of the Prada version. The controversy has reignited a broader debate on cultural appropriation in the fashion industry and the lack of international legal protection for traditional designs. While some hope the attention could benefit the craft, industry groups are now seeking compensation and better recognition for the artisans' cultural legacy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research reveals that tiny marine creatures called zooplankton are "unsung heroes" in the fight against global warming due to their epic annual migration in the Southern Ocean. These animals feast on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the surface, grow fat, and then sink deep into the ocean to burn this fat, locking away vast amounts of carbon. Scientists calculate this process sequesters as much carbon as the annual emissions of 55 million cars, a far greater amount than previously understood. This discovery highlights the crucial but often overlooked role of these small organisms in regulating the planet's climate.</p>

          <p>A BBC News investigation has uncovered evidence of a criminal gang in southern England systematically using fraudulent wills to steal millions of pounds from the estates of deceased individuals. The fraudsters exploit weaknesses in the UK's probate system by monitoring a government list of unclaimed estates and quickly producing fake documents naming themselves as heirs. The report details several cases where rightful inheritors were denied their legacy by these schemes, which also appear to involve significant tax fraud. Critics argue that the digitized, trust-based probate application process has made it easier for criminals to abuse the system.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protestors gathered in downtown Los Angeles on the Fourth of July to rally against the Trump administration's immigration raids and the newly passed budget bill that allocates billions for increased enforcement. Many attendees said they were skipping traditional holiday celebrations to voice their opposition, with some carrying signs calling the day a "funeral for freedom." The protest, which included a march to the federal building, highlighted the fear and disruption the raids have caused in local communities. Speakers, including a state assemblymember, condemned the new spending as a misallocation of taxpayer dollars.</p>

          <p>Germany started its Women's Euro 2025 campaign with a 2-0 victory over Poland, thanks to goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller. While the eight-time champions secured the win, the performance was overshadowed by a potentially serious injury to captain Giulia Gwinn. The Bayern Munich fullback, who has a history of two prior ACL injuries, left the pitch in tears in the first half after injuring her knee. The team's coach called the injury a "bitter price" for the victory, casting a shadow over their tournament prospects as they await MRI results.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has issued an executive order that will change policies at U.S. national parks, including charging foreign tourists higher entry fees. The order aims to improve affordability for U.S. residents and directs that any new revenue be used for park infrastructure improvements. The same order also revokes a 2017 presidential memorandum that promoted diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts in the management and protection of public lands. This move aligns with the administration's broader policy of ending government DEI programs established under previous administrations, shifting the focus of park management.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over 20 years of experience treating heart attacks has shared a list of five common foods he considers "toxic" and does not feed his own children. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon and deli slices because of sodium and nitrates. He also advises against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which can contribute to inflammation and poor metabolic health. Instead, he recommends healthier alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain Greek yogurt with fruit, and lean, unprocessed proteins.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team kept their T20 series against India alive with a dramatic five-run, last-ball victory at The Oval. Chasing 172, India needed six runs off the final ball, but Lauren Bell secured the win by having captain Harmanpreet Kaur caught. The game's momentum shifted thanks to a fiery spell from England's Lauren Filer and a chaotic ending that saw England drop multiple catches. Earlier, England posted 171-9, powered by half-centuries from Sophia Dunkley and Danni Wyatt-Hodge before a stunning collapse saw them lose nine wickets for just 31 runs.</p>

Burns advocates for embracing the founders' complexities, including their flaws like slave ownership, to make history more accessible and powerful. He believes understanding this gritty, complicated past is essential for navigating present-day divisions and reaffirming the American experiment.</p>
