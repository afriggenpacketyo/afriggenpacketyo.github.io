          <h2>Director Confirms "Bend It Like Beckham" Sequel is in Development</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 15:25:45 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More than two decades after its original release, a sequel to the hit film "Bend It Like Beckham" is in the works, director Gurinder Chadha has confirmed. Chadha stated that the success of women's football, particularly the England Lionesses, makes it an opportune time to revisit the characters. She is aiming for a 2027 release to coincide with the film's 25th anniversary and the FIFA Women's World Cup. The project may take the form of another movie or a television series, with hopes of reuniting the original cast and including cameos from current football stars.</p>

          <p>Mobile provider EE has acknowledged and worked to fix a technical issue that left many customers across the UK unable to make or receive calls for several days. Despite the company, owned by BT, stating that the network is "running as normal" after overnight maintenance, numerous users continued to report service disruptions. The outage impacted both mobile and landline services, with some customers expressing frustration over the lack of communication from the provider.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 15:00:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Electricity bills are expected to increase significantly this summer, with the surging energy demands of artificial intelligence data centers being a primary driver. PJM Interconnection, the largest U.S. power grid operator, reports that these data centers can use up to 30 times more power than traditional ones, straining the grid and raising costs for all consumers. This spike in demand is occurring as many fossil fuel plants are shutting down and the development of clean energy alternatives faces delays. The article suggests that without major infrastructure upgrades, these rising costs will likely continue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a viral scandal involving its CEO, tech company Astronomer has hired actress Gwyneth Paltrow as a "very temporary" spokesperson. The company's former CEO and a human resources executive resigned after they were caught in an intimate embrace on a KissCam at a Coldplay concert. In a short video, Paltrow, the ex-wife of Coldplay's frontman Chris Martin, humorously addressed the company's recent publicity without directly mentioning the incident. She focused on the newfound interest in data workflow automation, aiming to shift the narrative back to the company's core business.</p>

          <p>An internal analysis by USAID officials reportedly found no evidence of systematic or widespread diversion of humanitarian aid by Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The review, which examined over 150 reported incidents between October 2023 and May 2025, could not definitively identify the perpetrator in most cases of aid loss. This finding appears to challenge claims by the Trump administration and Israel, which have cited Hamas's alleged interference to justify altering aid distribution methods. The State Department has forcefully pushed back against the report's conclusions, asserting that significant aid diversion has occurred.</p>

While the FDA recommends a limit of 400 milligrams of caffeine per day, tolerance varies greatly. Recent studies have linked moderate coffee consumption to health benefits, but heavy intake can be associated with negative outcomes, especially for those with hypertension. Health professionals advise people to be mindful of their body's reaction, such as anxiety or poor sleep, and to adjust their intake accordingly, emphasizing that moderation is key.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan men who were expelled by the Trump administration to an El Salvadoran mega-prison were subjected to "state-sanctioned torture," according to their lawyers. The men, recently repatriated to Venezuela in a prisoner swap, have provided detailed testimonies of their ordeal inside the Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo (Cecot). They describe being shot with rubber bullets, enduring severe beatings by guards, and being held in inhumane conditions with dirty water and limited food. These accounts provide the first in-depth look at the conditions inside the notorious prison.</p>

          <p>Media executive Tom Rogers, a former self-described "raging bull" on Netflix, is now expressing concerns about the streaming giant's long-term growth. He points to increasing competition from free content on platforms like YouTube and a decline in viewing time per subscriber as potential headwinds. Rogers notes that while Netflix still dominates in hit shows, the rise of AI could empower amateur creators on YouTube, further challenging Netflix's engagement. Despite a strong recent earnings report, he suggests that this lag in viewer engagement is a worrisome sign for the company's future. (not investment advice)</p>

This dynamic resonates with his base, making it difficult for him to shake the association, as it positions him as a defender of the very elites he claims to oppose.
