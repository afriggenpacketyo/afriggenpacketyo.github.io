          <p>Bitcoin experienced a significant drop, falling below $78,000, as investors reacted to increased financial market volatility spurred by President Trump's global tariffs, which led to the worst decline in U.S. equities since 2020. Despite previously defying market trends, Bitcoin joined the broader market rout, triggering substantial long liquidations as traders sold assets to cover losses. Other cryptocurrencies, including Ether and Solana's token, also suffered considerable losses, highlighting the widespread impact of market sentiment shifts. The increased volatility and liquidations reflect a broader concern among investors regarding the stability of the cryptocurrency market in the face of economic uncertainty.

          <p>President Trump declared that the U.S. will not finalize any trade deal with China until the existing trade deficit, exceeding $1 trillion, is resolved. He emphasized that the U.S. has been losing hundreds of billions of dollars annually to China, a situation he aims to rectify. Trump highlighted that the tariffs have spurred approximately $7 trillion in committed investments in the U.S., particularly in automotive manufacturing and chip companies. Despite interest from European and Asian leaders in making deals, Trump remains firm on addressing trade deficits as a condition for any agreements, underscoring his commitment to reshaping international trade relations. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is challenging a federal judge's order to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador, arguing that the court lacks the authority to compel such action. Government attorneys claim that ordering the Executive branch to engage with a foreign power is constitutionally unacceptable. Abrego Garcia's lawyers counter that courts routinely protect individual rights in immigration cases without impeding executive foreign affairs prerogatives. The case has sparked outrage, particularly given that Abrego Garcia had a permit to legally work in the U.S. and had been granted protection from deportation in 2019.</p>

          <p>The new tax year brings increased state pensions and benefits, offering a boost to carers and pensioners, although benefits are rising at a slower rate than current inflation. Carers can now earn more without losing their carer's allowance, which itself has increased, providing additional support for working carers. The state pension has risen by 4.1%, providing pensioners with a larger weekly income, reflecting the government's commitment to the triple-lock system. While these changes offer some financial relief, income tax thresholds remain frozen, potentially drawing more people into higher tax brackets as their incomes rise.</p>

          <p>Newly qualified doctors in the UK are facing uncertainty as they are informed of their job locations just weeks before starting, leading to difficulties in planning their moves. The NHS has shifted to a random job allocation system, resulting in many students not receiving their preferred placements and a rise in "placeholder jobs." The British Medical Association has criticized the government for failing to adequately plan for the increased number of medical school graduates, potentially leading to doctors seeking employment abroad. This lack of clarity and support has overshadowed the achievement of qualifying, leaving many new doctors feeling angry and disrespected.</p>

          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson and Representative Anna Paulina Luna have reached a deal to resolve the dispute over proxy voting for new parents in the House of Representatives, ending a period of legislative gridlock. The agreement formalizes "vote pairing," allowing an absent member to coordinate with a present member voting on the opposite side to offset the absence. This procedure, while not equivalent to remote voting, ensures that absences due to childbirth or other emergencies do not disrupt the legislative process. Luna expressed gratitude to President Trump for his support of new mothers, emphasizing the importance of pro-family changes in Congress.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick asserted that the Trump administration will maintain its reciprocal tariffs on major U.S. trading partners despite the global stock market sell-off. He stated that the tariffs are intended to reset global trade imbalances, where most countries have a trade surplus with the U.S. Lutnick dismissed the possibility of postponing the start deadline for the tariffs, emphasizing the President's commitment to reshaping global trade relations. His comments echo those of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, signaling a unified stance within the administration to hold the course on imposing tariffs. (not investment advice) <br/><i></p>

          <p>The UK government has relaxed rules for car manufacturers ahead of the 2030 ban on petrol vehicles, aiming to protect and create jobs amid concerns over new US tariffs. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander announced that while the government is committed to the 2030 deadline, regulations dictating the transition will be relaxed. The changes include allowing smaller firms to continue making petrol cars beyond 2030 and permitting some hybrid vehicles until 2035. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the measures would "boost growth" and ensure UK-made cars can be exported worldwide, while opposition parties criticized the changes as insufficient.</p>
