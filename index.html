          <p>The United States has sanctioned Brazilian Supreme Court Judge Alexandre de Moraes, who is overseeing a politically sensitive case against former President Jair Bolsonaro, accusing him of suppressing free expression. Concurrently, President Trump signed an executive order to raise tariffs on Brazilian goods to 50%, explicitly linking the economic pressure to what he described as the "politically motivated persecution" of his ally. This significant escalation threatens to destabilize US-Brazil relations, as Brazil has vowed to impose retaliatory tariffs. Such a trade dispute could severely harm the South American nation's economy, given that the United States is its second-largest trading partner.</p>

          <p>Airlines are demanding answers from NATS, the UK's air traffic control provider, following a system failure that caused widespread flight cancellations and delays across the country. The radar-related issue, which NATS says it resolved in 20 minutes, resulted in over 150 cancelled flights and significant disruption for thousands of travelers during a peak travel period. While NATS has apologized and ruled out a cyberattack, carriers like Ryanair and EasyJet expressed deep frustration over the recurring failures. The incident has intensified calls for greater resilience and accountability in the UK's critical aviation infrastructure.</p>

The attack, which also damaged schools and hospitals, was condemned by Ukrainian leaders as a "horrible" and sinister act, described as further proof of Russia deliberately waging war against the civilian population.</p>

Shell's performance and commitment to its strategic plan, focusing on cost savings and prioritizing its liquified natural gas (LNG) business, appear to have resonated well with investors, as its share price has outperformed many of its U.S. and European competitors this year.

The announcements are designed to increase pressure for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and translate the concept from theory into practice. Canada's recognition is conditioned on the Palestinian Authority holding elections in 2026 without Hamas's involvement, while Malta emphasized the decision as a concrete step toward achieving a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Australia's pioneering national ban on social media for young people, pitched as a solution to a youth mental health crisis, is facing scrutiny from some academic experts. While the policy, which fines platforms for non-compliance, enjoys broad public support, critics argue there is insufficient causal evidence directly linking social media to poor mental health. Experts like Professor Marilyn Campbell suggest the ban is an oversimplified solution to a complex issue, potentially ignoring other factors like social inequity and climate anxiety. They also note that social media can provide vital support for marginalized youth, arguing for education over prohibition.</p>

The regulator has summoned the company to explain vulnerabilities, including alleged "backdoors" and "tracking and positioning" technologies that could allow for remote shutdowns of the hardware. This inquiry follows calls from some U.S. lawmakers to mandate location-tracking features on advanced chips to prevent smuggling. The move by the CAC adds a new layer of complexity to Nvidia's efforts to supply the Chinese market while navigating U.S. export restrictions. (not investment advice)</p>

Furthermore, India is pursuing a "multi-alignment" strategy, advancing trade talks with other partners like the UK and the EU to diversify its economic relationships. This approach provides India with leverage and softens the impact of U.S. tariffs, reflecting its goal of acting as a rising, independent power. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Meta's stock price jumped significantly after the company reported second-quarter financial results that far exceeded analyst expectations, easing concerns about its position in the AI race. The company posted revenue of $47.5 billion, driven by the success of its AI-powered advertising tools, which improved ad conversions on both Instagram and Facebook. CEO Mark Zuckerberg reaffirmed his commitment to massive spending on AI infrastructure, with plans to invest up to $72 billion this year. The strong performance is seen as a validation of this costly strategy, demonstrating tangible benefits for advertisers and users alike. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. and South Korea have struck a new trade deal setting a 15% tariff on South Korean exports, a reduction from the 25% previously threatened by President Trump. The agreement also includes a $350 billion investment from South Korea into U.S. industries. However, the two nations appear to have different interpretations of the deal's terms, particularly regarding how profits from the investment will be shared and whether concessions were made on agricultural products like rice and beef. While President Trump hailed it as an "historic" deal, South Korean officials expressed regret over the departure from free trade principles.</p>

          <p>Leading Democrats in Texas are condemning a new congressional map proposed by state Republicans, arguing it is a "grossly unfair" and "deeply undemocratic" gerrymander. The draft plan, encouraged by President Trump, would redraw districts to make five currently Democratic-held seats lean Republican, which critics say is achieved by fracturing minority communities. Opponents warn the move is a likely violation of the Voting Rights Act and could set a dangerous precedent, potentially triggering retaliatory redistricting in blue states. The plan aims to solidify the GOP's narrow majority in the U.S. House ahead of the midterm elections.</p>

          <p>A Colorado jury has convicted dentist James Craig of first-degree murder for poisoning his wife, Angela Craig, with a lethal combination of arsenic, cyanide, and tetrahydrozoline. Prosecutors successfully argued that Craig administered the poison in his wife's protein shakes, driven by greed for $4 million in life insurance and a desire to pursue extramarital affairs. The conviction carries an automatic sentence of life in prison without parole. During the trial, evidence of Craig's incriminating internet searches and his attempts to solicit false testimony were presented, painting a picture of a premeditated and callous crime.</p>

          <p>China's official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 49.3 in July, indicating a fourth straight month of contraction and missing analyst expectations. The decline is attributed to several factors, including a traditional off-season, extreme weather like heatwaves and torrential rains, and ongoing trade tensions with the United States. Sub-indexes for new orders and employment also remained in contraction territory. The continued weakness in both the manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors points to a potential growth slowdown in the second half of the year as the impact of global trade uncertainty becomes more apparent.

He questioned the logic of reducing reliance on China to mitigate risk while simultaneously reinforcing an even stronger dependence on the U.S. This perspective frames the transatlantic agreement as a potential challenge to the EU's long-term goal of achieving strategic autonomy on the global stage.

This announcement is the latest indication of how President Trump's trade policies are affecting major American corporations, even those with substantial domestic manufacturing.
