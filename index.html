        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford Motor reported a 16.3% year-over-year U.S. sales increase for May, driven by an employee pricing program amidst rising tariff costs and vehicle price increases. The sales increase was led by a 17.2% increase in vehicles with traditional internal combustion engines and a 29% jump in hybrid models, offsetting a 25% drop in sales of all-electric vehicles. This marks the third consecutive year-over-year, double-digit sales increase for the automaker, supported by the 'From America, For America' employee pricing program that continues through the Fourth of July weekend. The pricing promotion was announced as President Donald Trump's 25% auto tariffs on imported vehicles took effect in early April.</p>

          <p>Meta has entered into a 20-year agreement with Constellation Energy to purchase nuclear power, joining other tech companies in supporting the industry to meet the growing energy demands of data centers. Starting in June 2027, Meta will procure approximately 1.1 gigawatts of energy from Constellation's Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois, representing the entire output of the site's nuclear reactor. This agreement will support the plant's continued operation and relicensing, which was at risk due to the expiration of zero-emissions credits. The deal will also expand Clinton's output by 30 megawatts, contributing to Meta's goal of 100% clean electricity, though the plant will continue to provide power to the regional grid.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest that home equity line of credit (HELOC) rates may shift later in 2025, influenced by the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions. HELOC interest rates, which have seen recent fluctuations, currently average around 8.14% and are closely tied to the fed funds rate. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is scheduled to meet in June to discuss monetary policy, and while a rate cut is unlikely in June, potential cuts later in the year could impact HELOC rates. Homeowners should compare offers from various lenders and be aware of the risks associated with HELOCs, including the potential for foreclosure if payments are not met. (not investment advice)</p>

A senior police official stated that 216 inmates fled, with 78 having been recaptured and one prisoner killed in a shootout. The provincial law minister explained that the inmates were allowed into the courtyard due to panic caused by the tremors, after which a group attacked guards, seized weapons, and fled.

          <p>The Dutch government has collapsed after Geert Wilders, leader of the far-right PVV party, withdrew from the governing coalition due to disagreements over migration policy. Wilders sought stricter asylum measures, including freezing applications and limiting family reunification, which other coalition members opposed due to legal concerns. Prime Minister Dick Schoof confirmed he would step down, with the cabinet expected to remain in a caretaker capacity until new elections are held. Wilders' decision has been criticized by former coalition partners, while opposition parties view it as a liberation from a quarrelsome government.</p>

Etiquette expert Daniel Post Senning advises new hires to understand their role in the meeting, be punctual and prepared, and engage respectfully. Knowing whether you are a leader or a participant helps determine how to contribute, and taking notes signals active listening.

Homa, currently ranked 90th in the world, said he preferred to focus on his golf game rather than discuss the split. He ended up in a five-man playoff for the final spot to get to the US Open, but ultimately lost, suggesting that he may need to walk by himself more often, as it seemed to improve his game.

She emphasizes that some regret is inevitable and that moving faster can minimize regret, as people often regret taking too long to make a decision more than making a decision too quickly. Wulfhart also recommends testing things out and limiting the number of people consulted for advice to three to five trusted individuals.</p>

          <p>The National Weather Service (NWS) is facing severe staffing shortages as the Atlantic hurricane season begins, raising concerns among meteorologists about the agency's ability to provide accurate forecasts and warnings. Staff cuts, stemming from President Trump's initiative to reduce government spending, have resulted in the loss of at least 10% of the workforce. Understaffed local forecast offices are of particular concern, potentially limiting the ability to provide urgent messages about incoming storms to affected regions. Despite the challenges, NOAA plans to fill 126 critical vacancies, and the NWS spokesperson said the agency continues to meet its core mission of providing life-saving forecasts.</p>

          <p>At least 27 Palestinians were fatally shot and 161 others wounded while attempting to reach a food distribution center in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health. The center is operated by the U.S.- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which has faced accusations of weaponizing aid. The Israeli military stated that its troops fired warning shots near the aid hub after identifying suspects moving toward them, deviating from designated access routes. Volker Türk, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, called the situation in Gaza "unconscionable" and demanded a prompt and impartial investigation.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's transfer strategy involves reinforcing their attack with younger, hungry players who can improve, although some issues require immediate solutions. The club has already acquired 20-year-old Patrick Dorgu and 18-year-old Ayden Heaven to address specific needs, and manager Ruben Amorim prioritizes strengthening the team's attacking capabilities. Amorim lamented the side's ability to make the most of the chances they were creating towards the end of the Premier League season.

          <p>After Joe Biden revealed his cancer diagnosis, Donald Trump initially offered a sympathetic response before reverting to attacks and promoting conspiracy theories about Biden's health. Trump questioned the timing of the diagnosis and compared Biden to a corpse, while his allies mocked Jill Biden and promoted theories about the use of an "autopen" to sign legislation during Biden's presidency. Despite the initial message of goodwill, Trump's behavior underscored his ongoing attacks against Biden and his family. The shift in tone reveals a pattern of political antagonism even in the face of serious health issues.</p>

Since January, the US's standing has diminished in 38 of 41 markets tracked, while China's standing improved in 34 of them, with only Russia showing a significant improvement in views of the US.

This is causing jitters in the Treasury market, despite inflation being under control. The downgrade of U.S. Treasuries by Moody’s reflects market anxiety rather than being a cause of it.

The OECD attributes the slowdown to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs and uncertainty around its economic policies. The report notes that new tariffs have increased the effective tariff rate to 15.4%, the highest since 1938, leading to higher costs for consumers and prompting a forecast that inflation will spike in mid-2025, reaching 3.9% by the end of the year.
