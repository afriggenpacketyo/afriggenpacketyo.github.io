          <p>Joseph Czuba, the 73-year-old Illinois landlord sentenced to 53 years in prison for a hate-motivated attack, has died in custody. In October 2023, motivated by the Israel-Hamas war, Czuba fatally stabbed 6-year-old Wadee Alfayoumi 26 times and severely wounded his mother, Hanan Shaheen. He was convicted of murder, attempted murder, and hate-crime charges earlier this year. The attack, which occurred in the family's rented rooms in his home, deeply affected the large Palestinian community in the Plainfield area. The Council on American-Islamic Relations noted that while the killer has died, the hate that motivated him persists.</p>

          <p>Arkansas State Police are investigating the deaths of Clinton and Cristen Brink, a married couple found killed on a trail in Devil's Den State Park, as a double homicide. The couple, aged 43 and 41, were hiking with their two young daughters, ages 7 and 9, who were unharmed and are now with relatives. Investigators are searching for a suspect described as a white male who was seen leaving the park in a black, four-door sedan with a covered license plate. Authorities are urging park visitors from that day to review any photos or videos for images of the suspect and have asked the public for any information.</p>

          <p>Samsung Electronics has secured a $16.5 billion contract to supply semiconductors to Tesla, a deal confirmed by CEO Elon Musk. The contract, effective until the end of 2033, was initially filed without naming the counterparty, citing trade secrets. Musk later posted on X that Samsung's new Texas facility will be dedicated to producing Tesla's next-generation AI6 chip, underscoring the strategic importance of the partnership. This agreement is a significant development for Samsung's foundry business as it competes with industry leader TSMC and aims to bolster its position in the AI chip market. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent U.S. trade deal lowering tariffs on Japanese-made vehicles to 15% offers little comfort to Japan's auto industry, which faces a larger threat from China's expanding global market share. Analysts note that while the deal provides some predictability, the 15% rate is still a significant burden and higher than expected. The primary challenge is the fierce competition from lower-cost Chinese vehicles, particularly in the EV sector and in markets historically dominated by Japanese brands like Southeast Asia and Australia. This external pressure is compounded by domestic economic issues and specific challenges for companies like Nissan, making the outlook for Japan's auto sector very challenging.

          <p>The recently announced trade framework between the United States and the European Union is being framed as a significant win for the Trump administration. While the EU avoided the threatened 30% tariffs, the agreed-upon 15% rate is a major climbdown for Brussels and higher than the UK's 10% rate. In return, the EU is opening its markets to certain American exports at zero tariff and will purchase hundreds of billions in US energy and arms. The deal removes significant economic uncertainty for a sluggish European economy, a concession Brussels deemed worth the price, especially given its reliance on the US for security.</p>

The model suggests countries will rewire trade relationships away from the U.S., with China's exports to the U.S. forecasted to fall by $485 billion.

          <p>The LAPD's Pacoima station was temporarily evacuated Saturday after a couple brought in a box of military explosive devices they had found. The individuals discovered the ordnance while cleaning out the home of a recently deceased family member and attempted to dispose of them at the police station. The department's bomb squad was called in and used a robot to assess the devices before deeming them safe to transport. The explosives were then moved to a secure facility for collection by the U.S. military. The incident prompted the evacuation of the station and some nearby homes as a precaution.</p>

          <p>The new trade deal between the European Union and the United States has elicited varied responses from European leaders. While many expressed relief that a worse-case scenario was avoided, the agreed-upon 15% tariff rate was met with criticism. The Federation of German Industries (BDI) called the agreement an 'inadequate compromise,' while leaders from Italy and Ireland acknowledged it provides stability despite not being ideal. Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof noted that while 'no tariffs would have been better,' the deal brings clarity and market stability. The reactions highlight a consensus that while a trade war was averted, the terms are still challenging for European exporters.</p>

          <p>Five Eastern Caribbean nations—Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, St Kitts and Nevis, and St Lucia—are experiencing a surge of interest in their 'citizenship by investment' (CBI) programs. These programs offer a passport, and its associated visa-free travel benefits, in exchange for a property purchase or donation starting as low as $200,000. Real estate agents and investment migration experts report that a significant portion of the demand is coming from U.S. citizens seeking a 'plan B' amid domestic political and social volatility. While the programs are a vital source of revenue for the islands, they face scrutiny from the EU and US over security and financial crime concerns.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a trade agreement, imposing a 15% baseline tariff on most EU goods and heading off a wider conflict. The deal was announced by President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen after a meeting in Scotland. As part of the agreement, the EU will significantly increase its investment in the US and its purchases of American energy products and military equipment. While the 15% tariff is a significant increase from pre-Trump levels, it is half of the 30% rate that had been threatened, bringing a measure of stability to the €1.4tn transatlantic trade relationship.</p>

          <p>The RSPCA is calling for mandatory licensing of all dog rescue organizations in the UK amid growing concerns about imported pets. An investigation found that thousands of dogs are being brought into the country from places like Romania and Ukraine with minimal vetting, creating a 'Deliveroo for dogs' system. This has led to issues with owners receiving dogs with aggressive behavior and infectious diseases, such as Brucella canis, which can pass to humans and has seen a rise in cases. The charity warns these dogs can be 'ticking time bombs,' posing risks to other animals and public health, and putting a strain on UK-based shelters.</p>

The pause, effective in Gaza City, Deir al-Balah, and Muwasi, is intended to create secure land routes for the UN and other agencies to address the territory's severe hunger crisis. The move comes amid mounting international pressure and warnings of famine, with recent images of emaciated children sparking global criticism.

The system could have sent its highest-level 'Take Action' alert to 10 million people near the epicenter, but instead sent only 469 such warnings for the first 7.8 magnitude quake. The system significantly underestimated the quake's strength, sending half a million users a lower-level 'Be Aware' notification not designed to wake people.

Despite his success, he largely retired from public performance in the 1970s to focus on his other career as a mathematics teacher.

          <p>An archaeological site in the village of Keeladi in southern India's Tamil Nadu state has ignited a fierce political and historical debate. Excavations have unearthed artifacts from a sophisticated urban settlement dating back to 580 BCE, which some experts say challenges the long-held narrative of Indian civilization originating primarily in the north. The findings, particularly Tamil Brahmi script that may predate the northern Ashokan script, have become a symbol of Tamil pride and identity. This has created a flashpoint between the state and federal governments over historical interpretations, funding, and control of the narrative surrounding India's ancient past.</p>

This threatens the work of groups like the Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo, who use DNA to identify children stolen at birth by the regime.

          <p>A profile of John Oliver explores his path from the Edinburgh Fringe festival to becoming one of America's most influential comedians with his HBO show, 'Last Week Tonight.' Oliver explains that his comedy evolved from simply wanting laughs to making people laugh about substantive, often obscure political and social issues he cares about. The show's success is rooted in a meticulous research process, with a large staff of writers and former journalists ensuring every segment is factually sound before the comedy is layered on. Despite his critical lens, Oliver, now a US citizen married to an Army veteran, insists his critiques of America come from a place of love.</p>
