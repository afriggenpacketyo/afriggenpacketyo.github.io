          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defended President Trump's trade negotiation tactics, describing them as "strategic uncertainty" to leverage favorable deals with China and other countries. Bessent mentioned that while a comprehensive deal with China could take months, an agreement in principle coupled with good behavior from trading partners could prevent tariffs from escalating further. He dismissed concerns about investors losing confidence in the U.S. economy, attributing recent market fluctuations to short-term noise rather than a fundamental shift. Bessent emphasized the administration's commitment to establishing a strong foundation for the dollar, economy, and stock market.</p>

          <p>Former National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan voiced cautious optimism following a meeting between President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, marking a potential shift in the administration's approach to the Russia-Ukraine war. Sullivan noted Zelenskyy's positive assessment of the meeting and Trump's critical stance toward Putin as signs that Trump might recognize Putin's insincerity. He contrasted this with previous instances where Trump seemed to favor Putin's positions, urging the administration to maintain pressure on Russia. Sullivan also criticized the damage to America's credibility and the benefits reaped by China under Trump's policies.</p>

          <p>An Army Black Hawk helicopter crash near Ronald Reagan National Airport was influenced by the crew's decision to use "visual separation," a common practice allowing pilots to navigate around other aircraft independently of air traffic control. The air traffic controller approved the request, but when mishandled, visual separation can create significant risks. Aviation experts have cautioned about the dangers of mishandling this procedure for years. The incident occurred on a gusty night along the Potomac River, highlighting the potential for deadly outcomes when visual separation is not executed properly.</p>

          <p>The Green Party is urging the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) to withdraw its interim guidance on single-sex spaces, deeming it "ill-considered and impractical." The guidance, prompted by a UK Supreme Court ruling, addresses the use of facilities by transgender individuals. Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer argues the guidance puts trans people at risk of discrimination, particularly in workplaces. The guidance suggests that in some circumstances trans women may not be permitted to use men's facilities, and trans men may not be permitted to use women's facilities, and it is calling for a more thoughtful approach that considers the needs of all affected individuals.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent meeting with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has offered a small glimmer of hope to Ukrainians, particularly after Trump questioned why Putin would continue to attack Ukraine while the U.S. is trying to broker peace talks. Trump suggested that Putin may be stringing him along, potentially requiring a different approach with more sanctions. This development is seen as a possible shift away from a peace plan that many Ukrainians view as heavily favoring Moscow, and the post-meeting statement has been met with cautious optimism.</p>

          <p>Leaving a corporate job to join a family business can be a complex decision, requiring careful consideration of both the advantages and disadvantages. While it offers the potential to build value for your family and gain more control over your life, it also involves learning a new business, establishing trust, and facing potential conflicts. The returning child may bring valuable expertise and vision but must also be prepared to give up financial security and corporate prestige. Ultimately, success depends on understanding the real reasons for the move and what you are willing to give up.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's actions are fueling uncertainty in Taiwan regarding the reliability of American support, particularly after unexpected tariffs were imposed. The Lai administration was surprised by a 32% levy on Taiwanese exports to the US, impacting key sectors like hi-tech manufacturing. This move has raised questions about whether Taiwan's strategic value is primarily judged by its economic and military contributions. Frustration has been compounded by Taiwan's exclusion from initial trade negotiations, leading to doubts about the strength of the US-Taiwan relationship.</p>

These include expecting partners to read minds, keeping score of each other's actions, engaging in passive-aggressive behavior, constantly giving unsolicited advice, and listening only to respond rather than to understand. These behaviors often lead to resentment, competition, and a lack of genuine connection. The therapist advises open communication, giving without expecting reciprocation, and actively listening with the goal of understanding to foster a healthy and loving partnership.</p>
