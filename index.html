          <p>Coventry City Football Club has announced the purchase of its home stadium, the Coventry Building Society Arena, from Frasers Group. Club owner Doug King described the acquisition as a "pivotal moment" that ensures long-term stability and safeguards the club's future. The move ends years of uncertainty for the club and its supporters, who have endured multiple stadium owners and temporary grounds since leaving Highfield Road in 2005. This ownership allows the club to invest in facilities and enhance the fan experience.</p>

          <p>Public schools across El Salvador are now enforcing new disciplinary mandates ordered by the government of President Nayib Bukele. These rules require students to have military-style haircuts, maintain pristine uniforms, and participate in weekly patriotic ceremonies. The appointment of a high-ranking military officer as the new Education Minister has prompted criticism from some teachers' unions, who decry the move as a "militarization" of education. The government defends the measures as necessary for restoring classroom order and discipline.</p>

          <p>Idaho State Police have released hundreds of new photographs related to the investigation into the murders of four University of Idaho students. The images include detailed views of Bryan Kohberger's seized Hyundai Elantra, showing a white substance inside the vehicle, and various scenes from the off-campus house where the crimes occurred. The photos provide a glimpse into the crime scene, though images from the specific rooms where the victims were found have been withheld pending a court hearing. Kohberger is currently serving four life sentences for the murders.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent attacks on the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture, criticizing its focus on slavery, reflect a long-standing historical myth known as the "lost cause." This narrative, popularized after the Civil War, sought to downplay the brutality of slavery and its central role in American history. The article argues that Trump's rhetoric is part of a broader effort to politicize cultural institutions and control historical narratives, echoing past campaigns to vindicate white supremacy and undermine Black history.</p>

While traditional sunscreens primarily block UV radiation to prevent skin cancer, they don't address visible light damage. Experts explain that iron oxide, the pigment in tinted products, is the crucial ingredient for this added protection.

          <p>The iconic lawn of the White House Rose Garden has been replaced with stone paving in a major overhaul directed by President Trump. The renovation, which Trump said was necessary to prevent wet grass from ruining women's high-heeled shoes, creates a patio space with design elements reminiscent of his Mar-a-Lago resort. While the flower beds and trees from the historic Kennedy-era design remain, the $1.9 million project, funded by private donations, marks a significant and potentially controversial alteration to the famous outdoor space.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has unveiled a plan for the mass deportation of asylum seekers who arrive in the UK via small boats. The proposal includes detaining arrivals on disused military bases and returning them to their home countries, and would require the UK to leave the European Convention on Human Rights. Farage argues these drastic measures are necessary to address a "massive crisis" threatening national security. The Labour government has dismissed the plan as "pie in the sky," while the Conservatives claim it recycles their own ideas.</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez, who were convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, have both been denied parole by California officials. The decision comes after a judge resentenced them earlier this year, making them eligible for release under a youthful offender law. However, parole boards determined that both brothers, now in their 50s, still pose a risk to public safety. The case, which has regained public attention following a popular Netflix series, will see the brothers eligible to seek parole again in three years.</p>

The reporter details seeing masked agents in an unmarked car detain a man named Samuel, sparking a personal investigation to find him. The article reflects on the fear and uncertainty within immigrant communities under the Trump administration's crackdown and the power of simply bearing witness to such events.

          <p>The market for high-end Puer tea, long considered a tangible investment asset in China, is experiencing a significant downturn.

The slump reflects broader economic pressures, including reduced corporate profits and a government anti-corruption campaign that has dampened lavish gift-giving.

          <p>Germany's economy shrank by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, a steeper decline than initially estimated, signaling a loss of momentum for Europe's largest economy. The Federal Statistical Office revised the figure down due to weaker-than-expected industrial production, construction output, and private consumption. This downturn follows two years of stagnation and raises the prospect of a third consecutive year of contraction, a first in the country's postwar history, increasing pressure on the government to implement economic reforms.
