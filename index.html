          <p>Apple's iPhone exports from India to the U.S. experienced a significant surge of 76% in April, contrasting with a 76% drop in shipments from China, according to Omdia estimates. This shift reflects Apple's strategic adaptation to U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, initiated during the COVID-19 pandemic, by investing heavily in Indian supply chains. While India surpassed China in iPhone shipments to the U.S. in March, experts anticipate a slowdown in this growth due to India's limited manufacturing capacity. Analysts also note that this shift primarily involves final assembly, with most sub-assemblies still originating from China, and President Trump has threatened tariffs if iPhones are not manufactured domestically.

          <p>Famed Sherpa guide Kami Rita reached the summit of Mount Everest for a record-breaking 31st time, further solidifying his reputation as "Everest Man." The 55-year-old guide led a group of climbers to the summit early Tuesday morning and descended safely to base camp, according to Seven Summits Treks in Kathmandu. Kami Rita, whose father was also a Sherpa guide, has been climbing Everest since 1994 and has also summited other high-altitude peaks, including K2, Cho Oyu, Manaslu, and Lhotse. Despite the inherent risks, Sherpa guides like Kami Rita are vital to the success and safety of foreign climbers attempting to summit Everest, where two climbers died earlier in May.</p>

Earps stated that this was the right time for her to step aside and give younger players the opportunity to thrive, while also expressing her support for the team's success in the upcoming Euro 2025. Having recently lost her starting place to Hannah Hampton, Earps was recognized with the Best Fifa Goalkeeper award in both 2022 and 2023.</p>

          <p>KFC plans to invest almost Â£1.5 billion in the UK and Ireland over the next five years, aiming to create thousands of jobs as it expands its presence in the region. The fast-food chain intends to open 500 new restaurants and upgrade over 200 existing locations, with a focus on building sites and drive-through outlets, especially in the north-west of England. This expansion is expected to generate more than 7,000 new jobs across its UK and Ireland business and supply chain, including restaurant managers, kitchen staff, and guest experience leads. KFC's general manager Rob Swain cited strong demand for fried chicken as the driving force behind this significant investment, estimating the UK fried chicken market to be worth Â£3.1 billion annually.

          <p>The UK government is considering scrapping the two-child benefit cap, a policy that prevents most families from claiming means-tested benefits for any third or additional children born after April 2017. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson acknowledged that the policy has pushed people into poverty but cautioned that unwinding it would be costly. The decision is expected to be announced in the autumn when the government publishes its child poverty strategy, which is being led by Phillipson and Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall. Labour's manifesto at the 2024 election stated they would get rid of the cap "when fiscal conditions allow," with Phillipson emphasizing that "nothing is off the table" during the task force's review.</p>

While some German companies like Volkswagen and Deutsche Telekom are scaling back DEI efforts in the U.S., many others, including BMW and Siemens, remain committed to diversity. A survey by Charta der Vielfalt indicates that most German companies intend to continue their DEI programs, despite concerns about potential impacts on their U.S. business.</p>

          <p>President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urged the U.S. to increase pressure on Vladimir Putin to engage in meaningful peace talks to end the war in Ukraine, as drone strikes continue in both countries. Zelenskyy condemned the increasing scale and brazenness of Russian strikes, stating that they lack military logic and represent Putin's choice to continue the war. He called for new and stronger sanctions against Russia from the U.S., Europe, and other nations seeking peace, to compel Russia to cease fire and show respect. Despite months of U.S.-brokered peace talks, a lasting ceasefire remains elusive, with Kyiv pushing for a 30-day ceasefire to facilitate negotiations, a proposal that Russia has so far rejected.</p>

          <p>Following a car ramming incident in Liverpool that injured dozens, police quickly released details about the suspect, a 53-year-old white British man, to prevent the spread of misinformation. This decision was influenced by previous incidents, such as the Southport dance studio stabbing, where false reports about the assailant's identity fueled riots. The Merseyside Police, also involved in the Southport case, aimed to avoid similar speculation and unrest by promptly disclosing the suspect's race and nationality. While the police have not disclosed a motive, they have confirmed the incident is not being treated as terrorism.</p>

          <p>Russian forces have captured four border villages in Ukraine's northeastern Sumy region, following President Vladimir Putin's order to establish a buffer zone along the border. Meanwhile, a recent escalation in Russian bombing campaigns has slowed, with fewer drones targeting Ukrainian towns and cities. Despite ongoing efforts to secure a ceasefire and facilitate peace talks, the invasion shows no signs of stopping, with a prisoner exchange being the only tangible outcome of recent discussions. Ukrainian officials stated that Russian forces are trying to advance deeper after capturing the villages, while Ukrainian forces are endeavoring to hold the line.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sherron Watkins and Cynthia Cooper, former vice presidents of Enron and WorldCom, are raising concerns about a proposal to eliminate the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (P.C.A.O.B.). They argue that eliminating the board, created after the Enron and WorldCom scandals to protect against accounting fraud, would increase risk in the economy. Watkins and Cooper emphasize the P.C.A.O.B.'s independence from the S.E.C. and its critical role in ensuring high-quality audits, especially for overseas companies listed on U.S. exchanges, citing the potential for increased fraud if the board's oversight is lost. The authors point out that the board is funded by fees from public companies, not taxes, and transferring its duties to the S.E.C. would only shift the costs to the public.

          <p>An opinion piece discusses President Trump's redecoration of the Oval Office in a gilded Rococo style, arguing that it reflects a deep-seated American fascination with wealth and royalty. The author notes that while the style is inspired by European Baroque and Rococo, its embrace by the bourgeoisie makes it distinctly American. This aesthetic, characterized by ornate displays and conspicuous consumption, aligns with periods of economic prosperity and technological uncertainty in American history. The author concludes that Trump's choice reflects a desire to appear both kingly and revolutionary, tapping into a long-standing American ambivalence about wealth and power.</p>

He believes many in Hollywood secretly voted for Trump but are afraid to express their views publicly due to potential backlash.

          <p>Corporate America's retreat from diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives has resulted in the elimination of over 2,600 jobs since early 2023. This shift is attributed to a growing anti-DEI "political climate," with many companies ending DEI policies or scrubbing related terms from public documents. The decline in DEI roles has left many specialists, like Candace Byrdsong Williams, struggling to find employment. Despite many employers claiming to remain committed to diversity, the decrease in hiring for dedicated DEI roles indicates a significant change in corporate priorities and has a disproportionate impact on women and people of color.</p>

          <p>ITV soap *Emmerdale* is highlighting the importance of early detection of cervical cancer through a new storyline in which character Sarah Sugden receives an early-stage diagnosis. The storyline aims to raise awareness about the importance of regular medical check-ups, especially given that cervical cancer often has no warning signs. While the disease is most common in women aged 30-35, the NHS offers routine screening to anyone with a cervix aged 25 to 64, and the storyline aims to encourage greater uptake of these screenings. Other risk factors for cervical cancer include HIV, other sexually transmitted infections, and smoking, with regular screening and HPV vaccination being key to prevention.</p>
