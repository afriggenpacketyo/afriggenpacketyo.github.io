            <p>Data reveals that serious water pollution incidents in England have reached a 10-year high, with environmental campaigners expressing alarm. Surfers Against Sewage reported that the number of incidents has more than doubled the Environment Agency's target, potentially harming wildlife and public health. Water UK, representing water companies, plans to invest Â£12 billion to reduce spills by 2030, largely funded by increased water bills. The government has established an independent review to explore different regulatory approaches for the industry in response to public outcry over water company performance.</p>

            <p>Japan's Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) has issued a cease and desist order against Google for unfair trade practices related to search services on Android devices. The JFTC found that Google violated Japan's anti-monopoly law by requiring Android device manufacturers to prioritize its own search apps and services through licensing agreements. These agreements allegedly forced manufacturers to preinstall and prominently feature Google Search and Chrome, excluding rival search services as a condition of advertising revenue sharing. This action aligns with similar crackdowns on Google in the UK and the US.</p>

            <p>European companies are increasingly concerned about the impact of China's "Made in China 2025" initiative on their market share and technological edge. As China pursues technological independence, foreign companies are seen as a bridge to advanced technology. Once Chinese companies develop comparable technology, foreign firms may face market access restrictions and reduced competitiveness. The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China recommends that China focus on opening up and attracting foreign investment.</p>

Meanwhile, immigration authorities reportedly apprehended and deported a 19-year-old Venezuelan, Merwil GutiÃ©rrez, despite realizing he was not the intended target.</p>

            <p>Wildlife rehabilitation centers in Southern California are overwhelmed with brown pelicans, both sick from domoic acid poisoning and starving due to a toxic algae bloom. The neurotoxin, produced by the bloom, affects seabirds and marine mammals, leading to disorientation and death. The influx of malnourished baby pelicans is linked to the illness and death of adult pelicans, leaving the young birds to fend for themselves prematurely. Rescue centers are struggling to keep up with the high volume of birds needing intensive care.</p>

            <p>Nvidia, a major chip manufacturer, expects a $5.5 billion hit due to tightened US export rules to China. The new regulations require licenses for exporting Nvidia's H20 AI chip, a popular product in China. These restrictions come amid an escalating trade war between the US and China. The US government stated the license requirement addresses the risk of covered products being used in supercomputers in China. The company's value took a hit earlier this year due to a Chinese AI breakthrough.</p>
