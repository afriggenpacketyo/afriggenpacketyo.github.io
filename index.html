          <p>Former Binance CEO Changpeng "CZ" Zhao has been pardoned by President Trump after serving a four-month prison sentence for violating U.S. money laundering laws. Zhao had pleaded guilty, and his company paid a $4.3 billion fine for helping users bypass sanctions. The pardon follows a year-long effort by Binance to secure his release and aligns with the Trump administration's increasingly favorable stance toward the cryptocurrency industry, which the president has vowed to champion.</p>

          <p>An internal Department of Justice memo reportedly indicates that evidence weakens the mortgage fraud case against New York Attorney General Letitia James. According to sources, prosecutors found her personal financial benefit from the alleged fraud was minimal, around $800, and expressed concerns that vague federal mortgage guidelines would make proving intentional fraud difficult. The memo was presented to the previous U.S. attorney, who was later ousted by President Trump for refusing to pursue charges against James, a perceived political rival.</p>

          <p>A Commerce Department official has denied reports that the U.S. government is negotiating to take equity stakes in quantum computing companies like IonQ and Rigetti in exchange for federal funding. This clarification comes after The Wall Street Journal reported on such talks, causing a brief surge in the stocks of several quantum firms. The Trump administration has recently taken equity in companies in other sectors deemed vital to national security, such as semiconductors and rare earth minerals, arguing the government should benefit from federally funded corporate success.

          <p>The U.S. Senate has unanimously passed the IRS MATH Act, which aims to make agency notices about simple tax return mistakes clearer for taxpayers. Currently, the IRS sends "math error" notices for clerical mistakes, giving filers 60 days to respond before the proposed changes become final. Lawmakers and advocates argued the existing notices are confusing and do not adequately explain the error or the consequences of not responding. The bill, which now heads to the president, is intended to help taxpayers understand and correct their mistakes more easily.</p>

          <h2>Kering Shares Surge as Gucci's Performance Shows Marked Improvement</h2>

          <p>Shares of luxury group Kering rose sharply after the company reported a smaller-than-expected sales decline for the third quarter, signaling a potential turnaround. The improvement was largely driven by its flagship brand, Gucci, where the sales drop narrowed significantly compared to the previous quarter. This positive development has bolstered investor optimism that new leadership and strategic decisions, including the sale of its beauty unit, are beginning to stabilize the company's performance in a competitive luxury market.

          <p>A new study suggests that a significant number of urinary tract infections (UTIs) may be caused by E. coli from contaminated meat rather than just poor personal hygiene. Researchers compared E. coli from UTI patients in Southern California with samples from retail meat and found that approximately 20% of the infections could be linked to food-borne sources. The study highlights UTIs as a potential food safety issue, noting that contamination was highest in chicken and turkey products and disproportionately affected women and residents of lower-income areas.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that while Republicans often accuse opponents of hating capitalism, the Trump administration has implemented policies that undermine free-market principles. The author points to the government taking equity stakes in companies like Intel, setting price floors for commodities, and exercising veto power over a private company's operations as examples of state control. These actions, described as mimicking Chinese state-owned enterprises, betray the legacy of American prosperity built on entrepreneurial freedom and limited government intervention in industry.</p>

          <p>Two London Metropolitan Police officers have been dismissed for gross misconduct after being secretly filmed for a BBC Panorama investigation. An independent panel upheld allegations against PC Philip Neilson for making "highly racist and discriminatory remarks" and against PC Martin Borg for conduct described as a "disgrace," including glorifying the use of force on detainees. Both officers were fired immediately as part of accelerated misconduct hearings for ten officers implicated by the undercover report, which exposed a toxic culture at Charing Cross police station.</p>

          <p>Ruth Chepngetich, the Kenyan runner who holds the women's marathon world record, has received a three-year doping ban after testing positive for a banned diuretic. The Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) rejected her explanation that she had inadvertently taken her housemaid's medication. Because the failed test occurred after her record-setting run in Chicago, she will be allowed to keep her world record, a decision likely to be controversial. The AIU is continuing to investigate other suspicious material found on her phone related to performance-enhancing drugs.</p>

          <p>The interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Lindsey Halligan, is facing scrutiny from watchdog groups for using the encrypted app Signal with an auto-delete feature for official communications.

Groups like American Oversight argue this practice could violate the Federal Records Act, which requires the preservation of official government records, and have called for an investigation.</p>

The bill, which passed narrowly, was also condemned by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office as a political provocation by the opposition, and it is considered unlikely to become law without the ruling party's support.</p>

          <p>Shares of server manufacturer Super Micro Computer fell after the company released preliminary first-quarter revenue figures that were significantly below its prior guidance.
