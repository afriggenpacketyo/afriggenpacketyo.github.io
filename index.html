          <p>A significant overnight Russian aerial assault struck Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, resulting in at least two deaths and multiple injuries. The attack, involving numerous missiles and hundreds of drones, caused widespread damage, including to a residential building and a primary healthcare center. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the escalating terror tactics and called on international partners to expedite military aid and sanctions against Russia. The incident highlights the dimming prospects for a diplomatic resolution to the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>The Secret Service has suspended six agents without pay for their roles in the security failure during a July 2024 assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump in Pennsylvania. A deputy director for the agency acknowledged the event as an "operational failure" and stated they are focused on addressing the root causes. The incident, which resulted in the death of a rally attendee and injuries to Trump and others, has led to significant criticism and internal changes, including the use of new drone technology and improved communication protocols.</p>

          <p>The British and French governments are reportedly close to a new agreement aimed at managing migrant crossings of the English Channel. The proposed deal would involve France accepting the return of a set number of migrants who cross, while the UK would accept a corresponding number of asylum seekers from France with legitimate claims. A pilot scheme is expected to begin with a limited number of returns per week. The ultimate success of the policy will be judged by whether it serves as an effective deterrent and leads to a significant reduction in the number of crossings.</p>

          <p>China's recent restrictions on the export of rare earth minerals have raised significant concerns within the European Union ahead of a major summit in Beijing. European officials view the move as a strategic form of economic coercion, intentionally targeting Europe's high-tech and green energy sectors, which are heavily dependent on these materials. While the EU is pursuing long-term strategies like recycling and diversifying import sources, analysts believe the bloc will remain reliant on Chinese rare earths for at least the next decade, highlighting a critical supply chain vulnerability.</p>

Royal Mail welcomed the change as necessary for financial sustainability, but the decision has drawn criticism from consumer groups and some politicians who worry about the impact on service reliability for those who depend on postal services.</p>

          <p>A court in Seoul has approved a new arrest warrant for former South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, four months after he was initially released from custody. The decision is based on a special prosecutor's argument that Yoon poses a risk of destroying evidence related to his brief and controversial imposition of martial law in December. The re-arrest marks a significant development in the ongoing investigation into Yoon's actions, which led to his impeachment and removal from office. He faces multiple charges, including rebellion, which could result in a lengthy prison sentence.</p>

          <p>German automaker Volkswagen has reportedly stopped delivering its ID.Buzz electric van to the United States, citing multiple challenges. The decision is influenced by the significant 27.5% tariff imposed by the Trump administration on European-built cars, which makes the vehicle less competitive. Additionally, the model is subject to a recall order from US safety regulators because its third-row seats do not meet federal standards.

          <p>Vienna is often cited as a prime example of successful housing policy, frequently described as a "renters' utopia" due to its extensive and stable social housing sector. Nearly half of the city's housing units are social housing, available to a wide range of income levels, which significantly lowers overall rent prices and maintains high-quality living standards. This system, originating in the 1920s and funded in part by a levy on employee salaries, has resisted the privatization trends seen in other European cities. While challenges in accessibility remain, Vienna's long-term political commitment to housing as a basic need offers valuable lessons.</p>

          <p>An investigation by Global Witness has found that some of the world's least-developed countries, including Somalia, Haiti, and Yemen, are paying millions to lobbying firms with close ties to Donald Trump. These countries, facing cuts in US foreign aid, are reportedly hiring the lobbyists to secure continued humanitarian or military support, sometimes by bartering access to their natural resources. The report raises concerns that the dismantling of traditional aid structures is creating a desperate situation where vulnerable nations are forced into exploitative deals to gain influence in Washington.</p>

          <p>The UK's Reform party continues to gain momentum with the defection of Sir Jake Berry, a former Conservative Party chairman and close ally of Boris Johnson. This follows several other former Tory MPs joining Nigel Farage's party, highlighting a significant trend of conservatives moving to the right. The article notes that this shift is forcing the ruling Labour party to adjust its strategy, now viewing Reform as a more serious long-term challenger than the Conservatives. The series of high-profile defections indicates that Reform is successfully shaping the UK's political discourse.</p>

The proposal seeks to limit payments like the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to British citizens, with some exceptions.
