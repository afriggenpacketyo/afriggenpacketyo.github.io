          <p>Devastating flash floods in Texas's Hill Country have resulted in at least 24 fatalities, prompting officials to declare a "mass casualty event." The Guadalupe River rose approximately 26 feet in just 45 minutes, catching communities by surprise. Search and rescue operations are extensive, involving hundreds of personnel, helicopters, and drones to locate between 23 and 25 people who remain missing, many from a local summer camp. Governor Greg Abbott has signed a disaster declaration, promising unlimited state resources to aid the affected counties in their recovery and rescue efforts.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is expected to miss about six weeks with a bone bruise in his left knee, a less severe diagnosis than initially feared. Despite Muncy being a key offensive player, the team's management has indicated this injury will not alter their trade deadline plans. The Dodgers intend to rely on internal options like Tommy Edman to cover third base in the interim. The front office remains confident that Muncy will have sufficient time to return to form before the playoffs begin.</p>

          <p>Several beaches in the Far Rockaway area of Queens, New York City, were temporarily closed on the Fourth of July after multiple shark sightings occurred dangerously close to swimmers. Officials utilized drone technology to monitor the sharks' movements and ensure public safety, reopening the beaches after about an hour. New York Governor Kathy Hochul had previously announced enhanced shark surveillance measures for the holiday weekend across the state's beaches. The incidents highlight the increased use of technology to manage wildlife encounters and protect beachgoers during peak seasons.</p>

          <p>South Korea's new presidential administration is planning to revitalize its shipbuilding industry, which it describes as being in a "major crisis," as the US targets China's dominance in the sector. The government has outlined a policy guide focused on developing advanced, eco-friendly, and autonomous vessels through improved technology and better working conditions. This strategic push by South Korea, along with similar efforts in Japan, represents a move to reclaim market share and position themselves as leaders in next-generation ship manufacturing.

          <p>A U.S. judge in Massachusetts has denied a final request to halt the deportation of eight migrants to South Sudan, aligning with a prior Supreme Court order. The men, who have all been convicted of serious crimes in the U.S., were scheduled for removal on Friday evening. Their lawyers had argued they could face perilous conditions in war-torn South Sudan, a country only one of the men is from. The ruling marks the latest development in a contentious legal battle over the Trump administration's policy of deporting migrants to third-party countries where they may face danger.</p>

          <p>A Connecticut state law that permits towing companies to sell towed vehicles after only 15 days is facing criticism for being predatory, particularly towards working-class residents. Critics and affected individuals argue that the short timeframe makes it difficult for owners to reclaim their cars, alleging that some companies target specific neighborhoods. One such company, MyHoopty.com LLC, defends its actions as enforcing the rules of private properties like apartment complexes. The controversy highlights a legal framework that consumer advocates believe disproportionately harms lower-income individuals over minor infractions.</p>

          <p>On U.S. Independence Day, President Donald Trump signed into law a major tax and spending package, which he referred to as the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." The legislation makes the 2017 tax cuts permanent, increases defense and border security funding, and enacts significant cuts to federal safety-net programs like Medicaid. While the administration touts the bill as beneficial for the economy and various civilian groups, it has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats.

          <p>Contrary to some claims, the newly passed tax and spending bill does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for most recipients. Instead, the legislation introduces a new, temporary "bonus" tax deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors over 65, which applies to their total income, not just their benefits. Policy experts clarify that this deduction will primarily benefit higher-income seniors and will not affect low-income recipients who already pay no federal income tax. The measure is set to expire in 2028 and does not fundamentally change how Social Security benefits are taxed. (not investment advice)</p>

The controversy has ignited a debate on cultural appropriation and the need for better legal protections, like global Geographical Indication (GI) tags, for traditional crafts.

          <p>New research highlights the crucial role of tiny marine animals called zooplankton in mitigating global warming through a process of seasonal migration. These creatures feast on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the ocean's surface in Antarctica, grow fat, and then sink deep into the ocean to burn this fat, effectively locking away vast amounts of carbon. Scientists estimate this process sequesters as much carbon as the annual emissions of 55 million cars, a far greater amount than previously understood. The findings underscore the importance of these overlooked organisms in regulating the planet's climate, even as they face growing threats.</p>

This allows them to steal property and assets, often undervaluing the estates to commit inheritance tax fraud as well.

This benefit is even more pronounced in states with no personal income tax, such as Wyoming, South Dakota, and Texas, where the top 1% could see their annual tax bills fall by over $100,000. The structure of the bill, particularly its tax rate reductions and business owner breaks, provides significant advantages to high-income individuals in these states. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article details the surprising story of Bishara Bahbah, a US-based economics professor who has become a key backchannel negotiator between Hamas and the Trump administration. After receiving an unsolicited call from a senior Hamas official in April, Dr. Bahbah has been working from Qatar to facilitate talks for a permanent ceasefire and hostage release. Leveraging connections made as president of "Arab-Americans for Trump," he helped build trust that contributed to the release of Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander. His involvement showcases an unconventional diplomatic effort operating outside of official government channels to resolve the conflict.</p>

          <p>A pair of male Humboldt penguins, named Scampi and Flounder, are raising a chick at the Chester Zoo in the U.K. during a particularly successful breeding season. Zoo experts entrusted the pair with one of two eggs laid by another penguin couple to increase the chances of both chicks surviving. Same-sex pairings are not uncommon among penguins, and the new fathers are sharing parenting duties, including feeding the chick regurgitated fish. The event highlights the zoo's successful conservation program for the vulnerable Humboldt penguin species, with the colony now numbering 63.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in downtown Los Angeles on the Fourth of July to protest the Trump administration's immigration policies and the recently passed budget bill. The rally, which marched from City Hall to the Federal Building, was a response to weeks of aggressive ICE raids across Southern California and the new law that allocates billions more for immigration enforcement. Protesters, including local residents and community leaders, expressed fear and anger, stating the actions have terrorized communities. The event highlights the deep social and political tensions surrounding the administration's crackdown on immigration in the region.</p>

          <p>Germany started their Women's Euro 2025 campaign with a 2-0 victory against Poland, thanks to goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller. While the win was deserved, the team's performance was marred by an injury to captain Giulia Gwinn, who left the pitch in tears after a knee injury in the first half. Given her history of two previous ACL injuries, her availability for the rest of the tournament is in serious doubt. The victory provides a solid start for the eight-time champions, but the potential loss of their captain casts a significant shadow over their prospects.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued an executive order that will change access and fee structures for America's national parks. The order directs federal agencies to implement higher entry fees for foreign tourists, with the additional revenue intended for infrastructure improvements. It also calls for giving U.S. residents preferential treatment in any park access rules, such as lotteries or permit systems. Furthermore, the order revokes a 2017 memorandum from the Obama administration that promoted diversity and inclusion efforts in the management and storytelling within the national park system, aligning with the current administration's broader policy changes.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over two decades of experience treating heart disease has shared a list of five "toxic" food types he avoids giving his own children. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemicals in the lining, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like hot dogs because of preservatives. He also advises against sugary cereals and drinks, as well as deep-fried foods, which can promote inflammation and poor metabolic health. The doctor advocates for alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain yogurt with fruit, and unprocessed proteins to establish healthy eating habits from childhood.</p>
