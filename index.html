          <p>This New York Times article reports that clinicians at the Department of Veterans Affairs are facing challenges in ensuring patient privacy due to the president's return-to-office order. The mandate forces many clinicians to work from makeshift spaces, making it difficult to guarantee confidential mental health services. This situation raises concerns about the quality of care and the potential impact on veterans seeking mental health support, as the makeshift spaces may not meet the necessary standards for privacy and therapeutic effectiveness.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article reveals that the Trump administration has canceled over $800 million in NIH grants related to LGBTQ+ health, impacting studies on cancers, viruses, and sexually transmitted infections disproportionately affecting this community. The cuts are justified by officials as aligning with agency priorities and addressing concerns about 'unscientific' results based on gender identity. Scientists express concern that the terminations create a hierarchy of patients, undermining efforts to prevent suicide and sexual violence and potentially exacerbating the HIV epidemic. The article highlights the broader dismantling of medical research infrastructure and the chilling effect on researchers in the field.</p>

          <p>The Guardian reports that despite warning signs of economic instability linked to Donald Trump's tariffs, Republicans in Congress are actively protecting his trade policy. They blocked a Senate resolution aimed at repealing the tariffs, and Trump threatened to veto any attempts to undermine them. Economists warn that the tariffs could lead to recession and job losses, while Republicans argue they are a necessary gamble to renegotiate trade policies. The article notes the political maneuvering surrounding the issue, with Democrats highlighting Republican support for the tariffs.</p>

          <p>The Atlantic explores the rising anxieties in Canada regarding the possibility of war with the United States, fueled by Donald Trump's rhetoric and trade policies. Canadians are re-evaluating their long-standing trust in the U.S., considering potential military threats, and recognizing their unpreparedness for such a conflict. Experts suggest that a continental war would likely involve insurgent tactics across North America, with Canada's educated population and vast landscape posing challenges to any occupying force. The article concludes that such a conflict would be a devastating act of folly, but not beyond the capacity of the current U.S. leadership.</p>

          <p>Vox reports on a Waymo study suggesting that autonomous vehicles could drastically reduce traffic fatalities. The study, analyzing 56.7 million miles driven without human safety drivers, found significantly fewer crashes and injuries compared to human drivers. Extrapolating the data suggests that widespread adoption of self-driving cars could save approximately 34,000 lives a year in the US. The article acknowledges caveats, such as the limited testing environments and public skepticism, but argues that slowing down autonomous vehicle development is costing lives.</p>

The article highlights concerns about tariffs, budget cuts, and immigration policies, which are raising anxieties and potentially leading to worker shortages and inflation. While economic data is currently holding up, forward-looking surveys indicate a decline in consumer sentiment. The columnist argues that the uncertainty surrounding Trump's policies is more damaging than the specifics, and that a more settled policy position is needed to stabilize the economy.</p>

          <p>This New York Times opinion piece argues that Donald Trump's choice of JD Vance as his vice president signaled a fundamental shift in his administration's structure. Klein contends that Trump's second term is characterized by a 'royal court' of loyalists and enforcers, rather than the uneasy coalition that defined his first term. This shift, exemplified by the selection of Vance, suggests that Trump is now surrounded by yes-men and accelerationists, with no checks on his most extreme impulses.

          <p>Reuters reports that Russian President Vladimir Putin, the longest-serving Kremlin chief since Josef Stalin, stated that he is always thinking about the succession and suggested a contest between multiple candidates. Putin, who has been in power since 1999, noted that the choice ultimately belongs to the Russian people and that there should be several individuals from whom to choose. While there is no clear successor, the Russian constitution stipulates that the prime minister would assume presidential powers if the president is unable to fulfill his duties.</p>

          <p>This New York Times analysis suggests that the global turmoil caused by President Trump's policies played a role in the re-election of Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. While Albanese did not campaign as an explicitly anti-Trump figure, voters were wary of the economic uncertainty and erratic behavior associated with the U.S. president. The article highlights how the conservative opposition leader's alignment with some of Trump's ideas contributed to his defeat, with voters opting for a more sensible and centrist approach.</p>

          <p>The Guardian highlights the revitalization of traditional facial tattoos among Native American women, particularly within the south-eastern Indigenous nations. The Inchunwa Project is working to reclaim this millennia-old practice, offering opportunities for community members to receive and learn about the tattoos. The tattoos, often done by hand poke, represent a commitment to community, ancestral connection, and personal growth. This revival is part of a broader effort to reclaim traditions after centuries of forced assimilation, affirming that Native American culture is a living, evolving entity.</p>

Despite mounting fears of an economic slowdown, the Fed can justify its position with strong employment data. Higher tariffs on imports, however, create uncertainty for the Fed's inflation targets.

He suggests this as a way to reduce economic inequality and address the program's insolvency issues. Galloway claims that seniors are the wealthiest generation and that transferring wealth from younger generations to them is unfair. Without reform, Social Security trust funds will be depleted by 2035, leading to benefit cuts. This is not investment advice.</p>
