          <p>Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) dropped over 6% after the chipmaker reported earnings below expectations and expressed uncertainty regarding the resumption of AI chip shipments to China. CEO Lisa Su attributed a year-over-year decline in AI business revenue to U.S. export restrictions, which effectively halted MI308 sales to China. While AMD expects an "inflection point" in its datacenter business, analysts raised concerns about the vague timing of China shipments and increasing operating expenses. Despite these setbacks, the company's overall revenue still grew 32% year-over-year, surpassing estimates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Twenty people were killed and over 30 injured in central Gaza when four aid trucks overturned on a desperate crowd south-east of Deir al-Balah. Local journalists reported that crowds swarmed and climbed the vehicles, causing drivers to lose control on rugged roads under Israeli military control. This incident highlights the dire humanitarian situation, with civilians waiting weeks for basic supplies, leading to chaotic scenes. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization also reported a drastic reduction in accessible farmland, warning Gaza is on the brink of famine, while international aid organizations accuse Israel of impeding crucial aid distribution.</p>

          <p>Five soldiers were wounded in a shooting at Fort Stewart in Georgia by an active-duty sergeant, identified as 28-year-old Quornelius Radford, who used his personal weapon. All wounded soldiers are in stable condition and expected to recover, receiving treatment at an Army hospital and in Savannah. The fort was locked down following the incident, but the suspect was quickly apprehended by the Army's Criminal Investigative Division, leading to an "all clear" status within hours. President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth were briefed on the situation, which remains under investigation, bringing a swift end to the immediate threat.</p>

          <p>E.l.f. Beauty experienced a 30% decline in net income for its fiscal first quarter, largely attributed to new tariffs on Chinese imports, from which it sources about 75% of its products. The company refrained from providing full-year revenue guidance due to tariff uncertainties, instead issuing guidance only for the first half. CEO Tarang Amin noted the volatile macro environment and the impact of 55% tariffs, though he expressed relief they weren't higher. Despite the profit dip, E.l.f. surpassed revenue and earnings per share expectations, continuing to gain market share despite a cooling beauty category and consumer spending challenges.

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones expressed uncertainty regarding star pass rusher Micah Parsons' availability for Week 1, following Parsons' public trade request. Jones stated he has not spoken to Parsons since the request, which cited "radio silence" on contract extension talks and concerns over "narratives created" about him. Despite the contract dispute, Parsons has continued to attend practices and meetings. His potential absence would be a significant blow to the Cowboys' defense, as he has been a premier pass rusher and Pro Bowler in all four seasons of his career.</p>

          <p>Super Micro Computer shares plummeted 18% after the company reported weaker-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter results and provided a disappointing outlook, partly due to President Donald Trump's tariffs.

CEO Charles Liang confirmed measures are being taken to mitigate tariff impacts, but analysts remain concerned about growth. The company's full-year revenue forecast was also lowered from previous projections, indicating a significant slowdown in its previously rapid growth trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Evghenia Gutul, the pro-Russian governor of Moldova's autonomous Gagauzia region, has been sentenced to seven years in jail for illegal party financing. She was found guilty of channeling money to the "Shor" party, which authorities claim is a front for Russian election meddling. The verdict comes ahead of parliamentary elections and amidst Moldova's warnings of Russian interference in its domestic politics. The Kremlin condemned the ruling as politically motivated, accusing Moldova's pro-European government of suppressing pro-Russian views. Gutul, who met with Vladimir Putin in 2024, denounced the verdict as "political reprisal."</p>

          <p>New research highlights the extensive human health consequences of recent U.S. wildfires, extending beyond immediate casualties. Studies on the Maui and Los Angeles fires found significant long-term effects, including increased rates of depression, suicide, and overdose deaths, alongside lung damage and fatalities from healthcare disruptions. For instance, the Maui fire left many with impaired lung function and depressive symptoms, while the Los Angeles fires were linked to hundreds of additional deaths. These findings underscore the urgent need for comprehensive public health interventions and improved surveillance in the aftermath of climate-driven disasters.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed an additional 25% tariff on India, bringing the total levy to 50%, due to India's ongoing imports of Russian oil. This move, outlined in an executive order, makes India's tariff among the highest for any U.S. trading partner and reflects President Trump's commitment to penalizing countries supporting Russia's war efforts. India has criticized the action as "unfair, unjustified, and unreasonable," emphasizing its oil imports are based on national energy security needs. The decision comes as a U.S. envoy meets with Russian President Putin, with further secondary sanctions still anticipated.</p>

          <p>Borrowers pursuing Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) are encountering new challenges, including potential eligibility changes under a Trump executive order that aims to exclude employees of organizations involved in certain "illegal" activities. While the order's exact impact is unclear and may face legal challenges, experts advise borrowers to continue their current employment. Additionally, a significant backlog of over 1.5 million pending applications for new repayment plans, including the defunct SAVE plan, is stalling borrowers' progress toward forgiveness.

          <p>Apple has committed to investing an additional $100 billion in U.S. manufacturing over the next four years, increasing its total domestic investment pledge to $600 billion.

The White House announced a new American Manufacturing Program to support this effort, seeking to reshore critical component production for economic and national security. While this commitment is significant, experts note that fully shifting manufacturing to the U.S. would be a lengthy process and could lead to higher product prices.</p>
