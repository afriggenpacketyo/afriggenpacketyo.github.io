          <p>President Trump has ordered an immediate ban on new international students at Harvard University, citing national security threats and alleged links to foreign countries, particularly China. The proclamation, effective immediately for at least six months, also directs the State Department to review current foreign enrollments for potential visa revocations. The administration accuses Harvard of connections that could advance China's military modernization and of being a top "party school" for Chinese Communist Party bureaucrats. Harvard has responded by calling the move an illegal retaliatory action violating its First Amendment rights and has vowed to protect its international students. The order marks an escalation in the ongoing conflict between the White House and Harvard, impacting thousands of students. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration has signed a proclamation suspending travel to the U.S. for citizens from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, citing national security interests. The proclamation states that these countries lack sufficient vetting processes needed to detect potential safety or terrorism threats. The policy also partially restricts entrance for nationals of Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela, with exceptions for U.S. permanent residents, athletes attending major sporting events, and immediate family members with clear evidence of identity. This mirrors a similar travel ban from 2017, which was later ended by President Biden in 2021. </p>

          <p>Chile and Google have signed an agreement to install the first-ever submarine fiber optic cable connecting South America, Asia, and Oceania by 2027. The "Humboldt Project," a 14,800-kilometer cable from Valparaiso, Chile, to Sydney, Australia, via French Polynesia, aims to improve connectivity and provide a faster alternative to existing cables connecting Chile to the US. The project is expected to benefit Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil, with Google investing between $300 million and $550 million and the Chilean government contributing $25 million. The new cable will also reduce the lapse between sending and receiving a signal, which will cause a big difference in the field of telemedicine. </p>

          <p>A lawyer representing families of victims from the 2018 Lion Air crash has criticized a deal between Boeing and the US Justice Department (DOJ) as "morally repugnant." The deal allows Boeing to avoid prosecution by paying $1.1 billion to settle charges related to two fatal 737 Max crashes that killed 346 people. The agreement includes $444.5 million for families of the crash victims and $455 million for improving compliance and safety programs, but the lawyer argues the payout is insufficient and allows Boeing to sidestep criminal accountability. The DOJ agreed not to further criminally prosecute the company if the deal is approved by a federal judge. </p>

GOP lawmakers have requested testimony from Biden’s top aides regarding his mental and physical faculties, while a separate inquiry has been launched into clemencies Biden issued in his final days in office. Trump's memo also targeted Biden's use of an autopen, alleging a conspiracy to shield the public from discovering who wielded executive power during Biden's presidency. </p>

The ban fully restricts travel from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, while partially restricting travel from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. The White House stated the restrictions are to protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors, while critics have condemned the move as discriminatory. Some countries, like Somalia, have pledged to work with the US to address security concerns, while others, like Venezuela, have warned about the dangers of traveling to the US. </p>

          <p>Negotiations between the US and Iran over Iran's nuclear program are facing uncertainty due to public disagreements over the terms of an interim agreement. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, rejected the US proposal, stating that Iran would not agree to stop enriching uranium on its own soil. President Trump insisted that the agreement would not allow any enrichment of uranium, contradicting earlier reports that the interim proposal would permit low-level enrichment. The conflicting stances have cast doubt on whether a sixth round of negotiations will occur, despite potential Russian involvement. </p>

The study, analyzing 99-million-year-old feathers from the Cretaceous period, provides insight into feather evolution during this era. Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) highlighted the development of feathers that helped generate thrust and lift as essential to bird evolution. While modern birds are direct descendants of dinosaurs, most feathered dinosaurs lacked the same flight capabilities. </p>

The research shows that beneficial bacteria, particularly Bifidobacterium longum, can halve the risk of young children being admitted to hospital with lung infections. Researchers at University College London and the Sanger Institute collected stool samples from newborns and tracked their health for two years. The protective bacteria were found more often in babies born via vaginal delivery, suggesting early microbial exposure is crucial for immune system development. </p>
