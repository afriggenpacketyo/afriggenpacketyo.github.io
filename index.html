        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu at the White House to discuss Israel's ongoing military operations in Gaza, particularly focusing on pressuring Hamas to release hostages and potentially expel the group. The leaders will also address new U.S. tariffs affecting Israel and other countries, with Netanyahu expressing appreciation for Trump's invitation amidst these economic measures. Israel has announced the deployment of troops to a new security corridor across Southern Gaza, aiming to cut off Rafah from the rest of Gaza, while Hamas warns of a 'highly dangerous' situation for hostages due to the Israeli offensive and evacuation orders. The meeting underscores the complex dynamics between the U.S., Israel, and the ongoing conflict in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and an advisor to President Trump, expressed his hope for a 'zero-tariff situation' between the United States and Europe. Speaking at a conference in Florence, Italy, Musk suggested the establishment of a free trade zone between Europe and North America. This statement comes in the wake of Trump's announcement of new tariffs, including a 20% general tariff on countries with a large trade surplus with the United States, including Italy. Musk, who has been involved in efforts to reduce U.S. public spending, believes closer economic ties between the US and Europe are beneficial.</p>

          <p>Following the implementation of tariffs by Donald Trump on approximately 180 countries, a conservative organization, the New Civil Liberties Alliance (NCLA), has initiated a lawsuit challenging the initial round of tariffs on Chinese imports.

          <p>The article examines the trend of optimized morning routines promoted by fitness influencers, particularly Ashton Hall's viral routine, and its potential impact on men. It questions whether such content promotes a benign picture of health or a more palatable form of toxic masculinity. The piece argues that while Hall's content may seem less overtly misogynistic than that of figures like Andrew Tate, it still reinforces regressive ideas about masculinity and can contribute to a new wave of conservatism among Gen-Z men. It cautions against dismissing such content as merely silly, as it can subtly normalize harmful ideas.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists are raising concerns about the formula used by President Trump to calculate tariff rates, arguing that it is based on flawed assumptions. They claim that the elasticity rate used in the formula is lower than it should be in practice, leading to inflated tariff rates. If the elasticity assumptions are adjusted, the economists say that no country's tariff would exceed 14%, with most remaining at the 10% baseline. Another report also found that the trade-weighted average tariff rates used by the Trump administration are higher than they are in reality.</p>

          <p>With President Trump's sweeping tariffs expected to increase prices for everyday items, some U.S. consumers are engaging in a shopping spree to buy goods before the tariffs take full effect. While stocking up on certain items may seem logical, experts caution against going into debt or making large purchases out of panic. They advise consumers to take a measured approach, consider their long-term financial situation, and avoid making impulsive decisions. Experts also say they don't anticipate any shortages.</p>

          <p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has dismissed one of his deputies for taking a 'lavish' trip to Antarctica with his wife during Nowruz, the Persian new year. The president's office deemed Shahram Dabiri's trip 'unjustifiable and unacceptable' given Iran's economic challenges. A picture of Dabiri and his wife in front of a ship bound for Antarctica circulated widely, causing outrage in Iran. Pezeshkian emphasized the importance of simplicity for those in positions of authority, particularly amid economic pressures on the Iranian people.</p>
