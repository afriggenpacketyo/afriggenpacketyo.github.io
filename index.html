          <p>Amazon has officially launched its Project Kuiper satellites, marking its entry into the satellite internet market, aiming to compete with Elon Musk's Starlink. A United Launch Alliance rocket successfully carried 27 Kuiper satellites into orbit after an initial weather delay, and the company will now verify the satellites' maneuverability and communication capabilities. Amazon plans to launch over 80 missions to meet the FCC's requirement of having half of its 1,618 satellites in orbit by July 2026, investing $10 billion in the project with hopes of offering commercial service later this year. CEO Andy Jassy expects Kuiper to generate significant operating income and return on invested capital in the long term.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated investigations into Harvard University and the Harvard Law Review following allegations that the journal's article selection process favors authors based on race rather than merit. This action comes amid ongoing tensions between the administration and Harvard over DEI programs and ideological screening of international students, and follows a freeze of $2.2 billion in grants to Harvard due to antisemitism concerns. The Department of Education and the Department of Health & Human Services will investigate potential violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits race-based discrimination by recipients of federal funding.</p>

          <p>President Trump is escalating his administration's efforts to crack down on immigration, announcing executive orders focused on law enforcement and targeting "sanctuary cities" that don't cooperate with federal immigration agents. The orders direct the Attorney General and Homeland Security Secretary to publish a list of jurisdictions obstructing immigration enforcement, aiming to protect American communities from criminal aliens. This move is part of Trump's broader immigration agenda, highlighted by the display of mugshots of individuals taken into custody by ICE, but it faces legal challenges, including a federal judge's ruling against denying funds to sanctuary cities. The administration is also suing the city of Rochester, N.Y., over its sanctuary city policies.</p>

Bustamente Leiva, an undocumented Chilean national, was arrested in a D.C. motel, where authorities found Noem's purse and wallet, along with other evidence linking him to the crimes. He admitted to stealing Noem's bag but claimed no prior knowledge of her identity, and is also accused of using her credit cards for fraudulent purchases.</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking satellite, named Biomass, is set to launch to assess the planet's forests by penetrating clouds and leafy canopies to measure carbon storage. Developed by the European Space Agency and led by Airbus, this satellite will "weigh" Earth's forests, providing crucial data on the amount of carbon stored in trees, which has been previously impossible to calculate accurately. Equipped with a 12-meter diameter antenna using a long radar wavelength, Biomass will analyze slices through the trees, similar to a CT scan, to determine the woody material present, aiding in climate change modeling and deforestation tracking. The satellite's ability to penetrate clouds offers a consistent view of forests, overcoming limitations of previous satellite observations.</p>

          <p>A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine suggests that the immunotherapy drug dostarlimab has shown potential in eliminating tumors in some early-stage cancer patients, potentially allowing them to avoid surgery. In the study, 82 out of 103 participants responded so well to the drug that they no longer required an operation, especially patients with a "mismatch repair defect." All 49 patients with early-stage rectal cancer were able to avoid surgery after six months of immunotherapy, and two years later, 92% remained cancer-free, suggesting the drug could transform cancer treatment. The study, conducted at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, is ongoing to expand the trial and offer this therapy as a standard of care.</p>

The report cites growing inaction on climate change, violent crackdowns on dissent, and a backlash against the rights of migrants, refugees, women, and LGBTQ+ people as consequences of the "Trump effect." Amnesty warns of further deterioration as Trump dismantles international institutions and cuts foreign aid, exacerbating conditions in conflict zones and undermining efforts to protect vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>CBS News is facing accusations that its parent company, Paramount, is censoring its coverage to appease the Trump administration, raising concerns about freedom of the press. 60 Minutes journalist Scott Pelley suggested Paramount has increased scrutiny of the program's content, particularly stories about the Trump administration, due to the company's desire to gain FCC approval for its merger with Skydance Media. President Trump has previously called for the FCC to punish CBS for unfavorable coverage, and the FCC is currently engaged in an inquiry into CBS' campaign coverage, adding to the concerns about potential political influence on journalistic integrity.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing to charge migrants $1,000 to claim asylum, marking the first time the U.S. would specifically charge asylum seekers, and impose additional fees on immigrants seeking legal entry into the country. This proposal is part of a broader legislative effort to curb immigration and finance the Trump administration's border security measures. The bill would also require a $1,000 fee for most immigrants who are paroled into the U.S. and a $3,500 fee for those sponsoring children, potentially hindering the reunification of unaccompanied minors with family members in the U.S.</p>
