            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) addressed concerns regarding his recent trip to El Salvador, clarifying that his involvement was not an endorsement of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident who was deported despite a court order. Van Hollen emphasized that his focus is on upholding the Constitution and ensuring due process rights for all individuals, regardless of their background. He noted that the Trump administration has acknowledged the wrongful detention and deportation of Garcia, underscoring the importance of maintaining the rule of law to protect everyone's rights. Van Hollen's actions are aimed at preventing the erosion of constitutional protections.</p>

Financial planners suggest shifting assets to a 60/40 investment portfolio or a more conservative allocation depending on individual risk appetite. Building cash reserves to cover two years of income is also advised to avoid selling investments during market downturns, protecting against sequence of returns risk. Another strategy involves considering a bond ladder to provide a steady stream of income. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>An opinion piece suggests that China could strategically counter US tariffs by requiring bilateral trade to be settled in renminbi. This would strengthen the renminbi's exchange rate and challenge the dominance of the US dollar. The author argues that China's manufacturing capabilities support a considerable trade volume with the US, and mandatory use of the renminbi would force the US to buy Chinese currency on a large scale. This could also encourage global investors to increase their holdings of renminbi assets, leading to capital inflows to China and outflows from the US.</p>

            <p>The conflict between Donald Trump and Harvard University represents a continuation of a decades-long conservative campaign against American academia. Experts suggest this is part of a broader effort to undermine higher education and exert control over independent institutions. The Trump administration's actions, including freezing grants and demanding viewpoint diversity audits, are seen as a threat to academic freedom and a move towards authoritarianism. This echoes historical efforts to suppress dissenting voices and control the narrative within educational institutions.</p>

            <p>This article discusses Adolf Hitler's use of tariffs as an economic tool shortly after taking office as chancellor of Germany. Hitler's economic minister, Alfred Hugenberg, declared that agriculture's demands for higher tariffs "must be met." Hitler's main economic task as chancellor was not to mess things up. The German stock market had rallied on news of his coming to power. The article explores the potential consequences of these policies, including trade wars and economic instability.</p>
