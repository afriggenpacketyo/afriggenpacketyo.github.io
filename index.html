          <p>Virginia Giuffre, a prominent survivor of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse and sex-trafficking ring, has died at the age of 41. Her family confirmed that she took her own life at her farm in Western Australia, where she had lived for several years. Giuffre alleged that she was sexually trafficked to Prince Andrew, who has strongly denied the accusations, and reached a settlement with him in 2022. Giuffre was described as a fierce warrior against sexual abuse and sex trafficking, leaving behind three children.</p>

          <p>F.B.I. agents arrested Milwaukee Judge Hannah Dugan for allegedly obstructing immigration agents. She is accused of guiding an undocumented immigrant through a side door in her courtroom while agents waited to arrest him in a public hallway. This arrest marks a significant escalation in the Trump administration's conflict with local authorities over deportations, signaling a harder line against those who impede federal immigration efforts.

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked an executive order from President Trump that would cancel collective bargaining rights for most federal workers. U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman issued the injunction following a lawsuit from the National Treasury Employees Union, which argued the order would violate federal workers’ labor rights and is unconstitutional. The order exempted numerous agencies from bargaining with unions, affecting approximately 75% of federal workers represented by unions. The temporary injunction remains in place pending the outcome of the NTEU lawsuit.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's leadership has drafted a counterproposal to a Trump administration peace plan, which has faced criticism for conceding too much to Russia. The Ukrainian plan suggests potential concessions on long-disputed issues, while still digging in on some earlier demands. Key provisions include no restrictions on the size of the Ukrainian military, a European security contingent backed by the U.S., and the use of frozen Russian assets to repair war damage. The plan omits demands for Ukraine fully regaining all territory seized by Russia or insisting on NATO membership.</p>

          <p>A Japanese research team has discovered that a one-minute exposure to a specific sound frequency may prevent motion sickness. The study found that a 100 hertz sound stimulates the inner ear, improving balance and reducing motion sickness symptoms. This finding could provide an alternative to medication, especially with the increasing risk of motion sickness in self-driving vehicles. The research team from Nagoya University hopes to implement this method soon after confirming its safety, offering a new option for those prone to motion sickness.</p>

          <p>California is preparing to launch a new license plate sequence for newly registered vehicles starting next year, as the state is running out of its current combination of numbers and letters. The new sequence will consist of three numerals, followed by three letters, and then one numeral (e.g., 000AAA0). The state is exhausting its current sequence earlier than expected, due to an increase in new car registrations. The increase is partly attributed to fears that President Trump’s tariffs will significantly raise car prices.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has accused UC Berkeley of failing to disclose millions of dollars in foreign funding, initiating a new investigation. The Department of Education will examine UC Berkeley’s alleged failure to fully and accurately disclose significant funding received from foreign sources. This investigation follows a similar one into Harvard and aligns with President Trump's executive order directing increased enforcement of foreign funding disclosure rules. The inquiry revives a past investigation into the Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute partnership.</p>

          <p>Amid Kashmir's deadliest attack in decades, a look at the major militant groups in the conflict, exploring their local impact and global jihadi connections. Key groups include The Resistance Front (TRF), Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Hizbul Mujahideen (HM), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), Al Badr, and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind (AGH). These groups aim to challenge control over Indian-administered regions of Kashmir and, in many cases, merge the region with Pakistan. Several groups have fought alongside the Taliban and al-Qaeda.</p>
