        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk's tenure as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) saw significant budget cuts, saving an estimated $175 billion, but fell short of the initial $2 trillion goal due to legal challenges and the need for congressional approval. Richard Stern from the Heritage Foundation noted that DOGE overestimated its legal flexibility. While direct spending cuts were limited, DOGE's efforts in information gathering and whistleblower aspects could have a lasting impact by identifying potential spending cuts for Congress to consider. The White House is sending a $9.4B DOGE cuts package to Congress next week. </p>

          <p>Recent violence in Tripoli, Libya, has highlighted the country's fragile state and the potential for renewed civil war, with eight civilians killed and dozens of bodies found in a hospital. The conflict stems from a power struggle between the UN-backed Government of National Unity in the west and the rival House of Representatives in the east, with militias vying for control. Despite the turmoil, there is hope that the UN can capitalize on the situation to push for national elections and a new constitution, as thousands of Libyans protest for political change and stability. The United Nations Support Mission in Libya has published a new report that outlines four options which could serve as a roadmap towards ending the country's difficult transitional phase.</p>

Some analysts suggest Dimon's caution serves to keep his management team focused on future risks and prevent complacency. JPMorgan's strong performance is attributed to its ability to navigate higher interest rates and its investments in technology, including artificial intelligence (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has formally left his role in the Trump administration, with President Trump confirming the departure and thanking Musk for his service with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk stated that it was "not the end of DOGE, but the beginning" and that the DOGE team would "only grow stronger." Despite promising to save taxpayers as much as $2trn (£1.5trn), DOGE currently estimates its efforts have saved $175bn (£130bn). The 53-year-old has expressed frustration about resistance to his ideas, and clashed with other senior members of the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>A $200,000 annuity can provide reliable monthly income, often between about $1,100 and $2,100, depending on your age, gender and contract terms. This type of annuity may be worth it if you want peace of mind and are worried about longevity risk, but not if you need liquidity or have legacy goals. It is designed to complement existing benefits like Social Security, a pension or retirement account withdrawals (not investment advice). Before committing, consider your other income sources, your need for liquidity and whether you're comfortable locking up a large chunk of cash.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in the New York Times asserts that Elon Musk's legacy is one of disease, starvation, and death, citing his role in slashing the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). The author claims that these cuts have already resulted in approximately 300,000 deaths, mostly of children, and will likely lead to significantly more by the end of the year. The piece contrasts Musk's supposed goal of saving the government a trillion dollars with the alleged devastating consequences of his actions. White House officials deny that their decimation of U.S.A.I.D. has had fatal consequences.</p>

          <p>The CDC has updated its travel warning regarding measles due to the spread of the virus on airplanes. The agency has received reports of numerous cases of travelers who were contagious while flying, with at least one instance of transmission occurring during air travel. The CDC now recommends travelers consider postponing their trips if they cannot get vaccinated before departing. The agency has also dropped its list of countries facing "high incidence" of measles, warning instead that the virus is an ongoing risk around the world.</p>

          <h2>Millennials' Hesitation Towards Parenthood</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 13:15:56 EDT</div>

          <p>An opinion piece explores why millennials dread having babies, attributing it to factors like the high cost of raising children, career priorities, climate change concerns, and the fear of not meeting impossibly high parenting standards. The author suggests that millennials have redefined "harm" and "trauma," leading to a new standard for parenting that is difficult to meet. This cultural shift has contributed to a sense of dread and a reluctance to take on the responsibilities of parenthood, as well as a fear of not being able to reach the expectations that people have for parents in the current age.</p>
