          <p>Naomi Osaka secured a significant victory at the US Open by defeating American third seed Coco Gauff 6-3, 6-2 in the fourth round. This win marks Osaka's most impressive performance since her return to tennis after giving birth, advancing her to a Grand Slam quarter-final for the first time since 2021. Gauff, the 2023 champion, struggled with her form, particularly her forehand, leading to a subdued performance. Osaka's measured and powerful baseline game effectively capitalized on her opponent's uncertainty, signaling a strong return to form for the two-time champion.</p>

Maduro characterized the U.S. naval buildup, which Washington states is for counter-narcotics operations, as the "greatest threat" in a century and an act of "maximum military pressure." In response, Venezuela has mobilized its own troops and a civilian militia along its coast. The U.S. has accused Maduro of leading a drug cartel but has not signaled any intent to invade.</p>

          <p>Legendary actress Kim Novak, now 92, candidly discusses her feelings about aging and mortality in an upcoming documentary, stating, "it's close to the end." The film explores her decision to leave Hollywood in 1966 at the peak of her fame, a choice she made to avoid being "swallowed whole" by the industry, citing the fate of Marilyn Monroe. Novak retreated to a home in Big Sur, where she focused on painting and found liberation in pursuing her own artistic passions. The documentary aims to tell her personal story, highlighting her as a pioneering woman who fought for her own identity.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald has selected his six wildcard picks, finalizing a team that includes 11 of the 12 players who secured victory in Rome two years ago. Donald emphasized the need for experience to face the hostile "bear pit" atmosphere expected at Bethpage in New York. The continuity in the team, with only Rasmus Højgaard replacing his twin brother Nicolai, is unprecedented in Ryder Cup history. Donald is preparing his team for a different challenge than Rome, focusing on strategies to achieve Europe's first away win since 2012.</p>

Despite U.S. pressure, India defends its oil imports as essential for its energy security, and its trade with Russia has grown to a record $68.7 billion.</p>

Johnson's performance is praised as a perfect casting choice, capturing the vulnerability beneath the fighter's colossal physique. While the film effectively portrays Kerr's struggles with addiction and relationships, the review notes it doesn't fully explore the emotional depths of the sport or elevate the drama to the level of other great fighting films.</p>

Economists note that immigrants are crucial for filling labor gaps and that the reduction could complicate the Federal Reserve's understanding of the labor market's tightness.

          <p>A powerful 6.0 magnitude earthquake has struck eastern Afghanistan, killing at least 800 people and devastating remote villages in Kunar and Nangarhar provinces. Survivors describe waking up to intense shaking, with many homes completely destroyed. Rescue efforts are being hampered by the mountainous terrain and blocked roads, forcing the Taliban government to rely on helicopters to reach the worst-hit areas. Witnesses report a scene of despair, with residents too shocked to speak and many people still trapped under rubble, highlighting the immense challenges facing the emergency response in the isolated region.</p>

          <p>Following Congress's decision to eliminate $1.1 billion in federal funding, hundreds of PBS and NPR stations across the United States are grappling with severe budget shortfalls. While emergency fundraising drives have seen a strong public response in some areas, many stations, especially those in rural and less affluent communities, face an uncertain future. Stations are already implementing job and programming cuts to cope with the financial gap. The crisis is forcing the public media system to seek new models for collaboration and funding to ensure its survival and continued service to local communities.</p>

          <p>An American man has died in the Bahamas after his jet ski collided with another vessel in the waters off Paradise Island. Police found the man unresponsive and he was pronounced dead at the scene. This fatal accident adds to ongoing safety concerns for tourists, as the U.S. Embassy recently issued a security alert warning of risks associated with jet ski rentals. The alert cited multiple instances where U.S. women reported being sexually assaulted by jet ski operators in the Nassau and Paradise Island areas.</p>

          <p>German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has criticized comments from EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen about drafting "precise plans" for a multinational troop deployment to Ukraine as part of post-conflict security guarantees. Pistorius deemed the public discussion of such plans "completely wrong" and premature, stating that the EU lacks the jurisdiction for such military action. His remarks reveal a division among European leaders on how to approach long-term security for Ukraine. Meanwhile, a summit to discuss these security guarantees, co-chaired by Britain and France, is scheduled for later this week in Paris.</p>

          <p>Renowned Canadian author Margaret Atwood has responded to a new book ban in the province of Alberta with a satirical short story. The protest comes after her classic novel, "The Handmaid's Tale," was removed from some school library shelves under a new government directive to eliminate materials with "explicit sexual content." Atwood's new story sarcastically depicts perfectly chaste characters to critique the ban and Premier Danielle Smith. The incident reflects a growing trend of book challenges, similar to those seen in the U.S., spreading to Canada and affecting classic works of literature.</p>

          <p>A new study analyzing 8,000 years of animal bones has found that human activity, particularly since the Middle Ages, has caused a significant divergence in the body size of wild and domesticated species. Researchers from the University of Montpellier discovered that as human settlements expanded and hunting intensified, wild animals like deer and foxes became smaller. In contrast, domesticated species such as cattle and chickens grew larger due to systematic selective breeding and controlled management. This research highlights the profound and lasting impact humans have had on the evolutionary trajectory of the animal kingdom.</p>

          <p>The intense fan debate over the romantic interests in the show "The Summer I Turned Pretty" has escalated into online hostility, prompting the streaming service to launch a campaign for kindness. A psychiatrist explains that this toxic behavior, which has targeted the show's actors, is a sign of parasocial relationships, where fans form one-sided bonds with media figures. The anonymity of social media emboldens this behavior, blurring the line between fiction and reality. The expert suggests this phenomenon may indicate a broader societal void where people are longing for genuine human connection.</p>
