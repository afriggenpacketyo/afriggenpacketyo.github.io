          <p>A manhunt is underway for a 45-year-old U.S. Army veteran suspected of killing four people in a shooting at a bar in Anaconda, Montana. The victims, who included a barmaid and three customers, have been named by authorities. The suspect was reportedly a regular at the pub, and his niece stated he has struggled with mental illness for years. The search has expanded into national forest land, with officials warning the public that the individual is considered armed and dangerous.</p>

          <p>In a court filing, the Trump administration has denied the existence of a daily quota for immigration arrests, contradicting previous public statements from White House advisor Stephen Miller. Miller had previously stated a goal of at least 3,000 arrests per day. The denial was made as part of an ongoing lawsuit in California, where advocacy groups accuse the administration of conducting unconstitutional immigration sweeps. The government's lawyers claim that while the figure may have been discussed as a goal, no such policy or directive was ever issued.</p>

          <p>A small, 3.0 magnitude earthquake with an epicenter near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, was felt across parts of the New York City area. Residents reported brief shaking and a loud boom, with some initially thinking a car had hit their house. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the quake was minor and not expected to cause significant damage. The event comes after a larger, rare 4.8 magnitude earthquake rattled the region in April 2024, but officials reassured the public that there was little cause for alarm.</p>

          <p>Over 3,200 unionized workers at Boeing's St. Louis area defense facilities have voted to reject the company's latest contract offer and will go on strike.

          <p>Florida has quietly overtaken California in adding new utility-scale solar capacity, driven largely by major utilities like Florida Power & Light rather than rooftop installations. A state rule that fast-tracks approval for projects under 75 megawatts has significantly accelerated construction and reduced costs. Despite the state removing climate change from official policy, the economic advantages of solar over natural gas are fueling the boom. However, new federal legislation rolling back tax credits is expected to slow future growth, particularly in the residential sector.</p>

          <p>A self-imposed deadline for a new trade deal between the U.S. and Canada has passed without an agreement, creating continued uncertainty for businesses on both sides of the border. While the U.S. has imposed high tariff rates, the existing Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) allows nearly 90% of Canadian exports to enter the U.S. duty-free, providing a significant buffer. Analysts believe this gives Canada some negotiating room to pursue a quality deal rather than accepting a rushed agreement. (not investment advice)</p>
