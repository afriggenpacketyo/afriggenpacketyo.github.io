          <p>Collaborative design software company Figma has officially filed for an Initial Public Offering (IPO), planning to trade under the ticker symbol "FIG."

The company's prospectus reveals strong growth, with a 46% revenue increase in the first quarter and a net income of $44.9 million. The filing is part of a recent uptick in tech IPOs, signaling renewed confidence in public markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stocks in the clean energy sector, including NextEra Energy and AES, saw a significant increase after a proposed tax on solar and wind projects was removed from the Senate's version of a major legislative bill. The tax, which targeted projects using components from foreign entities like China, would have imposed a multi-billion dollar burden on the industry. While industry groups expressed relief, they also cautioned that the overall bill still contains provisions that are harmful to the future of renewable energy in the U.S., such as the phasing out of key tax credits. The removal of the tax provided a short-term boost to the market, though long-term concerns for the sector remain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that New York City's presumptive Democratic mayoral nominee, Zohran Mamdani, could face arrest if he obstructs federal immigration enforcement. Speaking at a new migrant detention facility, Trump responded to Mamdani's pledge to prevent ICE agents from deporting residents. The President also repeated unsubstantiated claims that the 33-year-old Democratic socialist is a "communist" and in the country illegally, despite Mamdani being a naturalized U.S. citizen since 2018. Mamdani has dismissed the labels, stating he would work with the administration when beneficial to New Yorkers but would resist deportation plans.</p>

The incident occurred when three officers arrived at the home of Officer Kelsey Fitzsimmons, 28, to serve her with a restraining order. According to the Essex County District Attorney, an "armed confrontation" took place during the service of the order, leading one officer to discharge their weapon, striking Fitzsimmons. She was transported to a hospital and is in stable condition, while the details surrounding the restraining order and the shooting remain under investigation.</p>

          <p>Patricia Riggen, the director of the 2007 film "Under the Same Moon," states that the current immigration situation in the U.S. is far worse than when she made her movie. Riggen believes her film, which tells a heartwarming story of a Mexican boy crossing the border to find his mother, would be "dark as hell" if made today. She draws parallels between current enforcement tactics, such as unidentified agents and detentions without due process, and the fascist regimes of Latin America's past.

Apple claims Liu did not disclose his new role at Snap, which prevented the immediate termination of his access to sensitive files.

Senator Tillis, who also opposed the Medicaid provisions, announced he would not seek reelection after facing pressure from the president. Senator Rand Paul, a fiscal conservative, voted no due to the bill's failure to include what he considered meaningful fiscal reforms to address the national debt.</p>

          <p>Internet infrastructure company Cloudflare announced it will begin blocking artificial intelligence crawlers from scraping website data by default, a significant move to protect content creators. New websites using Cloudflare's services will now have to opt-in to allow AI bots to access their data, and the company is introducing a "pay per crawl" model for publishers who wish to charge for access. This change addresses concerns that AI companies are training their models on vast amounts of web content without permission or compensation, which deprives original publishers of traffic and ad revenue. The move could significantly impact how AI models are trained in the future.</p>

In response, Trump suggested he could investigate deporting the South Africa-born billionaire and threatened to cut government subsidies to Musk's companies, including SpaceX and Tesla.

Historically, third parties have acted as "spoilers," influencing the platforms of Democrats or Republicans rather than winning elections themselves.

          <p>This opinion article from The Atlantic argues that the Republican-led passage of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" is an incomprehensibly reckless move that will harm millions of Americans. The author posits that the bill, which pairs massive tax cuts for the wealthy with deep cuts to social programs like Medicaid and food assistance, is deeply unpopular and seems designed to create a political backlash. The piece questions the sanity of the plan, suggesting Republicans are ignoring the severe consequencesâ€”from millions losing health insurance to a potential debt crisisâ€”in a heedless rush to fulfill a partisan agenda.</p>

          <p>Jimmy Swaggart, a prominent televangelist whose career was marked by both massive popularity and major sex scandals, has died at the age of 90. His ministry, which he founded in the 1960s, grew to include a global broadcasting network based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Swaggart's fame peaked in the 1980s before he made a tearful, televised apology in 1988 after being caught with a sex worker, a scandal that led to his defrocking. Despite this and other controversies, including anti-gay and anti-Catholic remarks, he continued to preach and record gospel music for decades.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Halts HHS Mass Layoffs, Calling Reorganization Plan Unlawful</h2>

          <p>A federal judge in Rhode Island has ordered the Trump administration to halt its planned mass layoffs and reorganization of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). U.S. District Judge Melissa DuBose granted a preliminary injunction, stating the states who brought the lawsuit had shown "irreparable harm" and that the administration's plan was likely "arbitrary and capricious as well as contrary to law." The ruling blocks HHS from finalizing the layoffs of over 10,000 employees and restructuring critical agencies like the CDC and FDA, which the judge noted was outside the executive branch's authority.</p>
