          <p>Top trade officials from the United States and China are scheduled to meet in London to discuss and potentially resolve the ongoing trade dispute between the two countries. The U.S. delegation includes Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. China's Vice Premier He Lifeng will lead the Chinese delegation, with the aim of advancing the Geneva agreement, which temporarily slashed duties for 90 days. Both sides have accused each other of violating the Geneva agreement, making the talks crucial for averting a full-blown trade war. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has not yet reached an agreement with the Treasury regarding her department's budget through to 2029, despite an offer of above-inflation increases to police funding. This impasse raises the possibility that the Treasury may impose a settlement on the Home Office before Wednesday's Spending Review. Police chiefs have been publicly lobbying for more money, while police representatives warn that the police service is "broken" due to budget cuts. The Spending Review is expected to include extra money for the NHS and funding to boost artificial intelligence lessons in schools, with broader commitments to increase defense spending.</p>

          <p>Almost 350,000 nursing staff in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland will vote on a proposed 3.6% pay increase, with the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) already dismissing the award as "grotesque." This vote is considered the biggest single vote by the profession ever launched in the UK, with the possibility of another round of industrial action looming. The government claims the pay rise will result in nurses earning over Â£30,000 as a new starter for the first time, while the RCN argues that nursing has been placed at the back of the queue regarding pay. The Department of Health and Social Care asserts that the proposed increase is the second above-inflation rise for NHS staff in the last 10 months.</p>

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is initiating a nationwide strategy to arrest illegal immigrants after asylum hearings as they leave courtrooms, targeting those who have been in the United States for less than two years. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) aims to have illegal immigration cases dropped, placing migrants in expedited removal proceedings for quick deportation. This initiative is expected to generate controversy, potentially discouraging migrants from attending asylum hearings, and involving arrests of migrants with no criminal history beyond illegal entry. Some legal experts believe that immigration judges could restrict such arrests by refusing to dismiss cases.</p>

The organization is particularly emphasizing the need for more donors with O negative blood, which can be given to the majority of patients, and more black donors, who are more likely to have specific blood types beneficial for treating sickle cell disease. Concerns over blood stocks have previously prompted the health service to issue an "amber alert", indicating that supplies were running low enough to impact patient treatment.

A bruising price war in the automotive industry and falling property prices contributed to the downward pressure. Chinese policymakers have urged the automotive industry to halt the brutal price wars, and analysts emphasize the need for more forceful and targeted stimulus measures to boost consumption.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Reserve Bank of Indiaâ€™s (RBI) surprise rate cut is expected to pressure foreign exchange forward premiums, potentially leaving the rupee vulnerable to further depreciation. The rupee has underperformed its Asian peers amid weak capital flows, and a narrowing interest rate differential with the U.S. Federal Reserve may exacerbate this trend. A drop in dollar/rupee forward premiums could make the rupee less attractive for carry trades and diminish incentives for exporters to hedge future receivables. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's exports to the U.S. experienced a sharp decline, falling over 34% in May, marking the steepest drop in more than five years. This decline contributed to overall exports growth missing expectations, though shipments to Southeast Asia, the European Union, and Africa rose. The drop in exports to the U.S. is attributed to the impact of prohibitive tariffs, even though they were partially lifted later in the month. China's exports of rare earths also decreased, reflecting tightened export controls amid trade negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

The proposal would extend the prohibition from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 of the UK's offshore protected areas. The announcement comes amid warnings about the destructive impact of bottom trawling on the seabed and marine life. The plan is subject to a 12-week industry consultation, seeking the views of the marine and fishing industry.</p>
