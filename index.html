          <p>A driver crashed into a crowd celebrating Liverpoolâ€™s Premier League victory, injuring nearly 50 people, including children, with some sustaining serious injuries. The incident occurred at the end of a festive day where hundreds of thousands of fans gathered for a parade in Liverpool city center. Authorities have arrested a 53-year-old man but do not believe the incident was terror-related, considering it an isolated event and not searching for additional suspects. Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed his shock at the appalling scenes and thanked the emergency services for their quick response, while Liverpool F.C. conveyed their support for those affected.</p>

          <p>Authorities in northern Arkansas are searching for Grant Hardin, a former police chief imprisoned for murder and sexual assault, after he escaped from a high-security prison dressed in a makeshift law enforcement uniform. Hardin, 56, slipped out during a routine inmate count, prompting officials to consider him extremely dangerous and to warn residents not to approach him. The escape occurred during heavy rain, hindering tracking efforts, and officials are unsure how he obtained the uniform or how far he traveled within the prison. Hardin was serving a lengthy sentence for the 2017 shooting of James Appleton and a previously unsolved sexual assault case from 1997.</p>

          <p>China's industrial profits rose 3% in April, marking a second consecutive month of growth despite tariffs imposed by the U.S. Cumulative profits at major industrial firms increased 1.4% year-on-year in the first four months of the year, reversing previous declines. While manufacturing activity slowed, industrial output expanded, with exports to the U.S. declining but overall exports surging due to increased shipments to Southeast Asian nations. Both sides agreed to lower most of those levies earlier this month, following a trade truce struck during a meeting between the Trump administration and Chinese leadership in Geneva, Switzerland.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A House bill proposes cutting in half a tax write-off for professional sports team owners, potentially impacting the market for team acquisitions. The legislation would limit the deduction of intangible assets, like player contracts and media rights, to half their value over 15 years, only affecting future owners. While team owners argue the change would significantly hurt their investments, the White House claims it aims to eliminate advantages for owners while ticket prices rise. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the change could raise nearly $1 billion over 10 years.</p>

A storage facility called "The Reserve" has seen an 88% increase in orders to store gold and silver from the start of the year to April, compared to the same period in 2024. Singapore is viewed as a safe jurisdiction with political and economic stability, leading the wealthy to opt for physical gold bars over paper to limit price exposure.

          <p>Japan is experiencing a boom in craft gin production, with small-scale distillers utilizing homegrown ingredients to create unique and locally-inspired spirits. Distillers are using ingredients such as bitter melon, camellia flowers, and burnt lacquer wood to infuse unique flavors into their gins. Domestic shipments of gin have surged, prompting both small and major manufacturers to enter the market, with new gin-focused bars and e-commerce sites also emerging. This surge in popularity is driven by the spirit's versatility and the ability to quickly monetize production.</p>

The government aims to create 120,000 more training opportunities for young adults by increasing a charge paid by employers recruiting from outside the UK.

          <p>President Trump delivered a Memorial Day speech at Arlington National Cemetery, honoring fallen soldiers and their families while also highlighting his own achievements. Trump thanked those who had fought in some of the nationâ€™s defining battles, and cited specific stories of sacrifice by soldiers and their families. Trump also criticized his predecessor's border policies and praised his own return to office and indirectly criticized his predecessor, former President Joseph R. Biden Jr., for his border policies while valorizing his own return to office. Trump's remarks followed social media posts where he attacked his political opponents.</p>

          <h2>FBI Reopens Investigation into Several High-Profile Cases</h2>

          <p>The FBI is reinvestigating three high-profile cases that occurred just before and during the Biden administration, including the leak of the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, the placement of pipe bombs near the DNC and RNC headquarters, and the discovery of cocaine at the White House. Deputy Director Dan Bongino announced the renewed focus on these cases, citing potential public corruption. The original investigation into the Dobbs leak failed to identify the responsible party, while the Secret Service halted its search for the cocaine's owner due to a lack of physical evidence.</p>
