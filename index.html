          <p>Facing a new 30% U.S. tariff, South Africa is actively working to increase its exports to China to mitigate the economic impact and address a significant trade deficit. A high-level delegation visited Beijing to promote investment and diversify exports beyond raw commodities to higher-value goods like pharmaceuticals and green energy technology. While China presents a major alternative market, experts caution that it is not a simple replacement for the U.S. due to trade complexities and the risk of over-dependence.</p>

          <p>Torrential rains across South Korea have led to at least 14 deaths and 12 people missing, primarily in the country's southern regions. The relentless downpours caused landslides and flash floods, destroying homes and forcing thousands to evacuate. In the town of Sancheong, eight fatalities were reported due to landslides, while other deaths occurred from collapsed houses and swollen streams. Scientists attribute the increasing frequency and intensity of such extreme weather events to climate change.</p>

The event underscores the deep-rooted division and ongoing geopolitical tensions between NATO allies Greece and Turkey. Efforts to reunify the island have so far been unsuccessful.</p>

          <p>Australian boxer Tim Tszyu lost his world title rematch against Sebastian Fundora via a seventh-round corner stoppage in Las Vegas. This marks Tszyu's third defeat in his last four fights, placing his career at a significant crossroads after an initially undefeated record. Despite showing courage, Tszyu struggled against the much taller Fundora, who dropped him in the first round and inflicted a cut that pressured the Australian throughout the bout.</p>

          <h2>U.S. to Implement New $250 'Visa Integrity Fee' for Most Visitors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 23:07:05 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States is introducing a new, mandatory "visa integrity fee" of at least $250 for all visitors requiring a nonimmigrant visa, including tourists and students. This fee is in addition to existing visa application costs and is set to be implemented during the 2025 fiscal year. While the provision includes a mechanism for reimbursement if travelers comply with their visa terms, details on implementation are scarce, and experts advise treating the fee as nonrefundable due to expected complexities.</p>
