          <p>Coco Gauff triumphed over Aryna Sabalenka in a thrilling French Open final, securing her first Roland Garros title with a score of 6-7 (5-7), 6-2, 6-4. The American second seed overcame a shaky start, where she trailed by a double break, to find her rhythm and capitalize on Sabalenka's errors. This victory marks Gauff's second Grand Slam singles title, adding to her US Open win in 2023, also against Sabalenka. Gauff expressed that this win was harder than her first, as she didn't want to be satisfied with just one, and Sabalenka conceded that Gauff was the better player. Her victory marks a significant milestone in her burgeoning career.</p>

          <p>Veteran quarterback Aaron Rodgers has officially signed a one-year contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers, worth up to $19.5 million with incentives, including a $10 million guarantee. The announcement, made by the Steelers' senior director of communications, ends months of speculation about Rodgers' future after an unsuccessful stint with the New York Jets. Rodgers, 41, will address the media on Tuesday, following the team's first minicamp practice, and is expected to compete with Mason Rudolph for the starting position, addressing the Steelers' quarterback concerns. Rodgers' arrival in Pittsburgh marks his 21st season in the NFL. The Steelers' quarterback problems are solved, at least for now.</p>

          <p>Under the leadership of new head coach Charlotte Edwards and captain Nat Sciver-Brunt, the England women's cricket team achieved a clean sweep in both the T20 and one-day international series against the West Indies. While this victory provides a positive start to Edwards' tenure, it comes with a cautionary note, as England has historically struggled to perform on the big stage despite dominating home series. The team faces tougher challenges ahead, including India's arrival and the 50-over World Cup in India and Sri Lanka. The series win offers a glimpse of potential, but the real test will be whether this "new" England can perform under pressure in critical tournaments.</p>

          <p>Cardiologists are raising concerns about the potential harm to heart health caused by excessive phone scrolling, a habit often mistaken as relaxing. Doomscrolling, especially in the morning or before bed, can increase anxiety, blood pressure, and sedentary behavior, leading to cardiometabolic conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. The habit can also lead to neglecting heart-healthy activities such as exercise, sleep hygiene, and stress regulation. Experts recommend setting time limits, avoiding social media before bed, and replacing scrolling with healthier alternatives to mitigate these risks.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's proposal to withdraw $4 billion in federal funding for California's high-speed rail project is likely to cause significant delays in the project's timeline, according to analysts. The funding cutback poses a serious setback to the state's ambitious plans to build a bullet train connecting major cities. The move underscores the administration's opposition to the project and raises questions about the future of high-speed rail development in California. The announcement means significant delays in serving the first passengers.</p>

          <p>Pentagon investigators are examining whether Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth personally wrote text messages detailing military plans to strike Houthi targets in Yemen, or if other staffers were involved. The investigation aims to determine how classified strike details ended up on the commercial messaging app Signal, shared in chat groups including Vice President JD Vance and Hegseth's wife. Investigators are also probing whether staff members were asked to delete messages, as the government is required to retain federal communications as official records. Hegseth is scheduled to testify on Tuesday, where he is expected to face questions about his handling of classified information.</p>

Conflicting accounts have emerged regarding a planned prisoner swap, with each side accusing the other of sabotage.

The move aims to address concerns about public safety and invest in emergency response while balancing budget constraints.

          <p>Amid ongoing parliamentary deadlock in France, politicians are increasingly turning to the politics of remembrance, with three new initiatives aimed at recognizing and addressing historical injustices. These initiatives include posthumously promoting Alfred Dreyfus, recognizing returnees from Indochina, and addressing Haiti's "double debt" dating back to 1825. While some see this focus on historical responsibility as a sign of social maturity, others argue that it is easier to pass symbolic initiatives than to enact structural reforms in areas such as pensions, education, or the budget. The French parliament voted unanimously to posthumously appoint Alfred Dreyfus to the rank of brigadier general.</p>
