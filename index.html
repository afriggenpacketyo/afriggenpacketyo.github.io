          <p>California's Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara has initiated a formal Market Conduct Examination of State Farm following a series of investigations into California's insurance crisis. The investigation will focus on how State Farm has been handling smoke damage claims related to the Los Angeles fires. Concerns include frequent adjuster reassignments, inconsistent claim management, and inadequate record-keeping, with State Farm cooperating with the investigation. The California Department of Insurance has already recovered around $40 million for fire survivors, and State Farm has paid out billions in claims, with the investigation expected to take several months to complete. The probe comes after a recent 17% premium increase for State Farm customers. </p>

          <p>Vance Boelter faces charges for the murder of Minnesota Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the attempted murder of Sen. John Hoffman and his wife.

Investigators allege that Boelter stalked his victims and carefully planned his attacks, researching their families and conducting surveillance. Boelter, who faces both state and federal charges, including stalking and murder, is being held without bail and will be appointed a federal defender.</p>

          <p>A CDC official, Dr. Fiona Havers, who oversaw COVID-19 hospitalization data, has resigned in protest over Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s changes to vaccine recommendations. Havers expressed a loss of confidence in the objective use of data for evidence-based vaccine policy decisions, viewing the recent changes as dismantling the agency's expertise. Kennedy bypassed the ACIP process, narrowed vaccine guidance, and replaced ACIP members with allies, raising concerns about the integrity of vaccine policy. The former ACIP members criticized Kennedy's actions, warning of potential risks to public health.</p>

          <p>Victims of the Los Angeles County fires are suing State Farm, alleging that the insurance company deliberately underinsured their homes, leaving them unable to rebuild. The lawsuit claims State Farm engaged in an illegal scheme to mislead homeowners about rebuilding costs, setting projected replacement costs far lower than actual costs. This marks the second time L.A. fire victims have sued insurers over underinsurance, following a similar lawsuit against USAA and AAA insurers. The lawsuit comes as the California Department of Insurance launches an inquiry into State Farm's handling of fire claims after receiving complaints.</p>

          <p>A recent feud between Donald Trump and Elon Musk over a tax and spending bill has solidified China's perception of Trump as an erratic politician. The dispute, involving threats and accusations, may cause China to be more cautious in negotiations with Trump. Observers believe this could complicate a potential summit between the Chinese leader and Trump, as China may remain guarded due to Trump's unpredictable behavior.

          <p>California lawmakers have introduced a bill that would make it a misdemeanor for law enforcement officers to cover their faces while on duty, aiming to increase transparency and public trust. The bill requires officers to be identifiable by their uniform and name or identifier, with exceptions for the National Guard, SWAT teams, and officers responding to natural disasters. The proposal follows concerns about federal officers conducting raids with covered faces and unmarked vehicles, leading to allegations of disappearing people. Supporters argue that accountability is essential for public servants.</p>

The strikes occurred amidst escalating conflict, with Iran launching missiles in retaliation for Israeli attacks on its military and nuclear infrastructure. The U.S. is sending refueling aircraft to the Middle East, but President Trump does not intend to sign a G7 statement on the conflict. The Israeli defense minister warned Tehran's residents would "pay the price" for Iranian strikes.</p>

          <p>Flash flooding in northern West Virginia, caused by torrential rains, has resulted in multiple fatalities and widespread damage to infrastructure. The severe weather led to numerous water rescues and the partial collapse of an apartment building in Fairmont. The governor has declared a state of emergency and is working with FEMA to assess the damage and provide assistance. Rescue crews are continuing to search for missing people, and residents are urged to stay off the roads due to hazardous conditions.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have proposed changes to President Trump's tax-cut bill, including a $10,000 cap on federal deductions for state and local income taxes, which differs from the House version. The Senate version also makes certain business tax breaks permanent and raises the federal debt ceiling by $5 trillion. These changes could complicate efforts to pass the bill before the July 4 deadline. The Senate will debate the bill before sending it back to the House for another vote. (not investment advice)</p>
