          <p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported that Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels. As of May 17, Iran possessed 900.8 pounds of uranium enriched up to 60%, a short technical step from weapons-grade levels. The IAEA warned that Iran is the only non-nuclear-weapon state producing such material, raising serious concerns. Israeli officials responded by stating that the report is a clear warning that Iran is determined to complete its nuclear weapons program.</p>
