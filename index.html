          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 13:22:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has condemned the previous Conservative government for a significant data breach that exposed the details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had applied for UK relocation. The breach, which occurred in 2022, was concealed by a super-injunction, preventing public disclosure until recently. An emergency resettlement scheme was secretly established, costing hundreds of millions of pounds, to relocate those affected, though many are believed to still be in Afghanistan. The incident has raised serious constitutional questions about government transparency and its duty to protect vulnerable allies.</p>

          <p>Morgan Stanley reported second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street expectations, with earnings per share at $2.13 against a predicted $1.96. The bank's revenue increased by 12% to $16.79 billion, largely propelled by a surge in trading activity within its institutional securities division. The wealth management segment also demonstrated robust growth, contributing significantly to the strong quarterly performance. Despite the positive results, the company's stock experienced a slight dip following the announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence startup Scale AI is laying off 200 full-time employees, constituting 14% of its staff, just weeks after a major investment from Meta. In a memo, interim CEO Jason Droege stated the company had expanded its generative AI capacity too rapidly, leading to excessive bureaucracy. The move comes after founder Alexandr Wang was hired by Meta to lead its new Superintelligence Labs. The company, known for preparing data for major AI models, plans to streamline its data business while increasing hiring in its enterprise and government divisions later this year.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated it is "highly unlikely" he will fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, despite his continued public criticism of the central bank's policies. After reports that he had discussed the possibility with Republican lawmakers, which caused minor market fluctuations, Trump clarified his position. He has repeatedly attacked Powell for not lowering interest rates, calling him a "knucklehead" who is doing a "lousy job." While the White House maintains a Fed chair can be removed for cause, Trump's comment suggests he is not currently planning such a move. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Central Command announced that its Yemeni partners have successfully intercepted the largest-ever shipment of advanced Iranian conventional weapons intended for Houthi rebels. The seizure included over 750 tons of munitions, such as hundreds of advanced cruise, anti-ship, and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as drone engines and radar systems. CENTCOM Commander Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla stated the interdiction highlights Iran's role as a destabilizing force in the region. This operation is critical for maintaining regional security, stability, and freedom of navigation amid ongoing Houthi attacks on shipping lanes.</p>

          <p>A major review has concluded that the UK's Prevent counter-terrorism program missed opportunities to intervene with Axel Rudakubana, who later murdered three children in Southport. Lord David Anderson KC reported that teachers had referred Rudakubana to Prevent three times due to his obsession with violence, but his case was closed each time because he lacked a specific terrorist ideology. The review calls for the program to focus on individuals fascinated with extreme violence, regardless of ideological motive, and to better utilize online activity to identify threats. This systemic failure is now a key focus for the public inquiry into the killings.</p>

          <p>An off-duty police officer, John J Hawk, has been sentenced to five years of probation after pleading guilty to involuntary manslaughter in the 2022 death of a bystander. The victim, Kenneth Vinyard, was attempting to provide police with information about a shooting outside a Walmart when Hawk confronted him. Hawk struck Vinyard in the chest and performed a leg-sweep, causing him to fall and suffer a fatal head injury. The victim's family described him as the family glue, and the Pennsylvania attorney general stated the officer's actions contributed to the death of a man who was not a threat.</p>

          <p>An analysis piece argues that the open revolt from Donald Trump's base over the Jeffrey Epstein case reveals a significant shift in his control over the MAGA movement. By dismissing the controversy as a "hoax," Trump has positioned himself against a conspiracy theory that his supporters view as a sacred key to exposing the "deep state." This has caused a schism, as his base feels betrayed by his alignment with the establishment position. The author suggests that after years of stoking conspiratorial flames, Trump is discovering that the powerful, identity-forming movement he created now has a life of its own.</p>

Cramer expressed concerns about the company's operational capabilities and warned that oil prices could soon fall below $60 a barrel, which would create a new, lower inflation narrative. The club recently sold 500 shares of Coterra and downgraded its rating, citing the company's decision to maintain its rig count instead of making previously signaled cuts. This move reflects a bearish outlook on the stock's performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article provides a detailed breakdown of the major data breach at the UK's Ministry of Defence that exposed the personal information of nearly 19,000 Afghans. A government official accidentally leaked a spreadsheet in 2022, which was only discovered in 2023, prompting a court-ordered super-injunction to suppress the news. In response, the government covertly established the Afghanistan Response Route, a secret scheme costing an estimated £850 million to relocate those at risk. The report addresses key questions about the timeline, the number of people affected, and the significant financial and political fallout from the incident.</p>

While this sentence is unlikely to result in immediate incarceration, Imamoglu is already in pre-trial detention on separate corruption charges.
