          <p>An attack occurred at Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Colorado, leaving at least five people injured, some with severe burns. Witnesses reported the suspect threw Molotov cocktails at a march for Israeli hostages, with some alleging the suspect shouted anti-Zionist remarks. The FBI is investigating the incident as a targeted terrorist attack, while local police are still determining the motive. The injured were outside the Boulder County Courthouse, and the area has been evacuated as authorities investigate a vehicle of interest. The Boulder Jewish community expressed sadness and concern, while Governor Polis condemned the act as a heinous act of terror, emphasizing that hate has no place in Colorado. The Run For Their Lives organization has canceled all upcoming events due to the attack.</p>

          <p>AB Hernandez, a transgender student athlete, competed in the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) track-and-field finals, winning first-place medals in high jump and triple jump and placing second in the long jump. The CIF implemented a policy change allowing an additional athlete to compete and earn a medal in events where a transgender athlete also qualified. The U.S. Department of Justice launched a Title IX investigation into transgender athlete participation in California high school sports. Protests occurred outside the stadium, with some holding signs that read "Save Girls Sports", and one person was arrested after an altercation. Despite the controversy, Hernandez's mother expressed pride and support, while some high school coaches offered encouragement.</p>

          <p>Crystal McKinney, who previously sued Sean "Diddy" Combs for sexual assault, has filed an amended lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein, accusing him of sexually assaulting her and a friend in 2003. Weinstein's lawyer denies the claims, suggesting they are opportunistic and timed suspiciously after her complaint against Combs. McKinney alleges that Weinstein plied her and her roommate with alcohol before sexually assaulting them in a hotel room. She claims Weinstein forced the women to engage in same-sex sexual conduct while he watched and then sexually assaulted them. In her lawsuit against Diddy, McKinney alleges that he drugged and sexually assaulted her at his New York studio, leading to a tailspin of anxiety, depression, and a suicide attempt.</p>

          <p>Pamela Hemphill, a former Trump supporter convicted for her role in the January 6th Capitol riot, is refusing the pardon she received from President Trump, citing that accepting it would contribute to a false narrative. Hemphill pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge for unlawful parading and was sentenced to probation. She believes the pardons are inappropriate and damage Americans' views of the federal government. Unlike other January 6 defendants who sought copies of their pardons, Hemphill sought assistance from Senator James Risch to formally refuse the pardon, with the Department of Justice acknowledging her non-acceptance.</p>

The drones hit airfields including the Belaya air base in Russia's Irkutsk region, over 2,500 miles from Ukraine, and the Security Service of Ukraine said the operation had destroyed 34% of Russia's fleet of air missile carriers with damages estimated at $7 billion.</p>

He says he was not given a say in when he left the armed forces, and the extra money would have made a vast difference to his and his wife's lives. Despite numerous appeals and support from MPs, the Ministry of Defence maintains his pension reflects his "full and correct entitlement" based on the rules at the time.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer discusses how the unpredictability of the White House under President Trump is negatively affecting the stock market, creating a "Trump discount" for various sectors. He argues that uncertainty surrounding trade policies, regulatory actions, and presidential interventions is driving investors away from U.S. stocks, even for companies with strong performance. Cramer highlights specific examples, including Nvidia, retail stocks, drug companies, Apple, and energy stocks, where presidential actions or policy stances have created headwinds. He suggests that the lack of stability and the potential for sudden policy changes are making it difficult for companies to plan and for investors to predict cash flow. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A woman on Reddit is seeking advice after offering a coworker rides to work, which led to unforeseen consequences due to the coworker's chronic tardiness. The woman and her coworker were written up twice, jeopardizing her job. When the poster told her coworker she could no longer drive her if she wasn't on time, the coworker accused her of being cold and ditching her. The poster feels taken advantage of and sought advice on how to handle the situation, with commenters suggesting she set a firm departure time or stop offering rides altogether.</p>

          <p>Ukraine launched a large-scale drone attack deep into Russian territory, reportedly destroying 40 military bombers, as talks are set to resume in Istanbul to explore a ceasefire. Ukrainian security sources claim the operation took over a year and a half to execute and was personally supervised by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The drones hit airfields including the Belaya air base in Russia's Irkutsk region, over 2,500 miles from Ukraine. Meanwhile, explosions caused two bridges to collapse and derailed two trains in western Russia, with officials reporting casualties.</p>
