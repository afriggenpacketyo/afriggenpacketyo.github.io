          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, has restrengthened into a dangerous Category 4 storm after temporarily weakening due to an "eyewall replacement cycle." While not expected to make a direct impact on the U.S. East Coast, tropical storm warnings are in effect for the Turks and Caicos and parts of the Bahamas. The storm's increased size poses a significant risk of life-threatening surf and rip currents along the Southeast coast. Forecasters are urging residents in potentially affected areas to monitor the hurricane's progress closely as it moves northwest.</p>

          <p>New York City police are searching for up to four gunmen following a mass shooting at a lounge in Brooklyn's Crown Heights neighborhood that left three men dead and nine others wounded. Investigators believe the violence was gang-related and have recovered at least 42 shell casings from the scene. Mayor Eric Adams has urged witnesses to come forward with any information to help solve the crime. Despite this incident, police officials noted that overall gun violence in the city has decreased this year compared to previous records.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ahead of a critical meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders, U.S. President Donald Trump posted on social media that Zelenskyy could end the war with Russia "almost immediately, if he wants to." Trump reiterated his position that Ukraine should not be permitted to join the NATO alliance and that Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea was a settled issue. These comments have set a contentious tone for the upcoming high-stakes talks in Washington, which follow Trump's recent meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed during his summit with President Trump to allow the U.S. and its allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee similar to NATO's Article 5. Witkoff described the concession as "game-changing," as it could provide a workaround to Russia's long-standing objection to Ukraine's formal NATO membership. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy acknowledged the development but stated that the details of how such a guarantee would work in practice remain unclear.</p>

          <p>Bolivia is set to elect its first non-leftist president in nearly two decades, as preliminary results show two center-right candidates, Rodrigo Paz Pereira and Jorge Quiroga, advancing to a runoff election. This potential political shift comes amid the country's worst economic crisis in years, with many voters expressing a desire for change and punishing the incumbent socialist party. The outcome will likely lead to significant changes in Bolivia's domestic policies and foreign relations, potentially fostering closer ties with the United States.</p>

          <p>The fertility rate in the United States has fallen to a historic low, dropping below the 2.1 children per woman required for natural population replacement. This trend, particularly pronounced among women under 30, mirrors demographic declines seen in countries like Japan and raises concerns about future economic challenges, including a potential "demographic cliff" for universities and strains on social security. Experts cited in the article suggest that the high cost of childcare and economic instability are key factors influencing decisions to delay or forgo having children.</p>

          <p>A massive concert by ultra-nationalist singer Thompson has exposed deep divisions within Croatian society over its history and national identity. The event, attended by hundreds of thousands, featured the controversial chant "Za dom, spremni," which is associated with the country's World War Two-era Nazi-allied Ustasha regime. While supporters, including some politicians, defend it as a patriotic, anti-establishment slogan from the 1990s war of independence, critics and human rights groups condemn it as a dangerous normalization of fascism.</p>

          <p>Japan is facing a severe demographic crisis as its population continues to shrink at an alarming rate, a trend driven by historically low birth and marriage rates. This article explores the societal factors contributing to the decline, including a punishing work culture and economic stagnation, which make it difficult for people to start families. Despite government interventions like launching a dating app and promoting shorter workweeks, the country has struggled to reverse the trend, which poses a significant threat to its economy and social structure.</p>
