          <p>Thousands in Scotland remain without power and face travel disruptions following Storm Floris, described as the most damaging summer storm in recent memory. Utility company SSEN is working to restore electricity to over 43,000 homes, primarily in the Highlands, Moray, and Aberdeenshire. Network Rail is clearing numerous incidents from train lines caused by gusts up to 90mph, while flights and major events were also cancelled. The Scottish government is coordinating the response, urging caution as recovery efforts continue.</p>

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has directed prosecutors to present evidence to a grand jury regarding the origins of the 2016 Trump-Russia collusion allegations. This legal step will determine if formal charges should be filed against individuals who may have conspired to falsely accuse Donald Trump. The move follows renewed debate spurred by declassified documents from the Durham inquiry, which cited an intelligence memo suggesting a plan to link Trump to Russia. The original Mueller report found no proof of a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.</p>

          <p>A former assistant to Maximilian Krah, a politician from Germany's far-right AfD party, is now on trial in Dresden accused of spying for China. The defendant, Jian G., is alleged to have provided sensitive information from the European Parliament to a Chinese secret service since 2002. This case adds to the scrutiny on Krah, who is under a separate investigation for potential bribery and money laundering. The trial could reveal embarrassing details about the internal workings of the AfD party, which is the largest opposition group in the German parliament.</p>

          <p>India's foreign ministry has responded to U.S. President Donald Trump's threats of steeper tariffs by stating it feels unfairly targeted for its Russian oil imports. New Delhi argues it only began significant purchases after traditional supplies were diverted to Europe post-2022, a move it claims the U.S. initially encouraged to stabilize global energy markets. The ministry highlighted that both the U.S. and EU continue their own substantial trade with Russia, making the focus on India seem unjustified. India maintains its oil imports are a vital national necessity to ensure affordable energy. (not investment advice)</p>

Concurrently, Israel's military liaison agency stated it will partially reopen the entry of goods into Gaza for a limited number of security-screened local merchants. This measure aims to increase the volume of supplies entering the territory and reduce dependence on UN and international aid organizations. The move comes as Netanyahu faces mounting internal and external pressure regarding the war and the fate of hostages.</p>

          <p>Saudi Aramco announced a drop in second-quarter revenue, posting an adjusted net income of $24.5 billion, which still surpassed analyst expectations. The state-owned oil giant attributed the decline to lower prices for crude oil and refined chemical products, though this was partly offset by higher sales volumes. Despite the dip, CEO Amin Nasser expressed optimism, anticipating that oil demand in the second half of 2025 will be significantly higher than the first. The company is also set to increase output as OPEC+ members unwind voluntary production cuts through September. (not investment advice)</p>

Stokes' challenge is immense: he must recover from injury, perform at an elite level, and provide crucial leadership to a squad largely inexperienced in Australian conditions.

          <p>A recent report from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas indicates that the adoption of artificial intelligence was a factor in over 10,000 job cuts in the U.S. during the first seven months of 2025. The technology sector has seen the most significant impact, with over 89,000 total layoffs this year. The report also highlights that job listings for entry-level corporate roles have decreased, while the mention of 'AI' in job descriptions has surged. Other major factors contributing to layoffs include federal budget cuts and the impact of tariffs on the retail sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dozens of Democratic lawmakers from Texas have fled the state to prevent a vote on a Republican-led redistricting plan that could create five new GOP-leaning congressional seats. By leaving, they deny the state legislature the quorum needed to conduct business. In response, California Governor Gavin Newsom has threatened to pursue similar partisan redistricting in his state, vowing to fight 'fire with fire' to neutralize the Texas GOP's efforts. The standoff has escalated into a national political battle, with Texas Governor Greg Abbott threatening to have the absent lawmakers arrested and expelled from office.</p>

          <p>More than 40 people were arrested during a protest outside the Trump International hotel in New York City, organized by the Jewish-American group IfNotNow. Hundreds of demonstrators had gathered to demand an end to the war in Gaza and to call on the U.S. government to pressure Israel to allow more humanitarian aid into the territory. Protesters, including NYC Comptroller Brad Lander and a former Biden administration official, held signs reading 'stop starving Gaza' and 'not in our name.' The arrests occurred after a group of protesters sat in the street, blocking traffic.</p>

          <p>U.S. border agents have reportedly been instructed to stop deportations under President Trump's asylum ban, according to CBS News. This directive follows a federal appeals court ruling that partially limited the ban, stating it could not be used to completely suspend humanitarian protections for asylum seekers. The court order is a significant development in the legal challenges against the administration's broad immigration restrictions. Customs and Border Protection officials were reportedly told over the weekend to revert to processing migrants under existing U.S. immigration law, rather than the stricter measures imposed by the ban.</p>

          <p>A large wildfire, named the Gifford fire, is burning through Los Padres National Forest in central California, having scorched over 72,000 acres. The blaze, which is only 5% contained, threatens more than 450 structures and has forced evacuations in parts of Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. Over 1,000 firefighters are battling the flames in extremely challenging terrain, with hot and dry weather expected to fuel further growth.

          <p>The political standoff in Texas has escalated as Governor Greg Abbott ordered the civil arrest of Democratic lawmakers who fled the state to block a vote on a Republican-drawn congressional map. The lawmakers' absence broke the legislative quorum, halting all business. In response, the Republican-controlled House voted to compel their return, authorizing the Sergeant-at-Arms to issue arrest warrants. While the state's authority to arrest lawmakers outside of Texas is questionable, the move marks a significant escalation in the fight over redistricting, which has drawn national attention and threats of retaliation from other states.</p>

          <p>A growing shortage of volunteer firefighters across the U.S. is straining emergency services and could force more towns to switch to paid departments, a costly move for taxpayers. Volunteer crews, which make up nearly 70% of the nation's firefighters, have seen their numbers decline by over 20% since 1985, while emergency call volumes have tripled. This trend is leading to burnout and, in some cases, slower response times. Lawmakers are considering incentives like student loan forgiveness to boost recruitment and prevent the financial burden of transitioning to fully professional firehouses.</p>
