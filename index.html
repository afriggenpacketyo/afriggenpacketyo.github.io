          <p>Economists are questioning the methodology behind President Trump's newly announced tariffs.  The White House claims the tariffs reflect reciprocal measures against countries' trade barriers, but the calculations lack transparency and raise concerns about their economic impact.  The formula links tariff rates to trade deficits, suggesting higher tariffs for larger deficits, but critics point to the lack of nuance and potential for unintended consequences.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's formula for calculating tariffs aims to reduce the trade deficit by raising prices of imported goods.  The formula estimates that a 10% tariff increase leads to a 2.5% price hike for consumers, and this price increase, in turn, decreases demand. While the approach acknowledges the basic economic principles of tariffs, critics highlight its oversimplification and questionable assumptions about price elasticity and potential retaliatory measures.</p>
