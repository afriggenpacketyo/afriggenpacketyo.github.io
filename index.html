          <p>Residents in Warrington and Wigan are expressing significant frustration over the UK government's asylum seeker accommodation policies, specifically the reliance on hotels and the potential increase in Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs). Locals report feeling unheard and unsafe, citing concerns about fairness, local housing shortages, and alleged anti-social behavior from some asylum seekers. The government, facing pressure to close asylum hotels, is exploring alternative sites, but critics warn that increasing HMO use could intensify community tensions and strain local resources in already deprived areas. Conversely, asylum seekers living in HMOs express gratitude for their new homes and a desire to contribute positively, emphasizing they fled dangerous situations. The debate highlights a complex challenge between national policy and local community impact.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar urged BRICS members to address significant trade deficits with New Delhi, particularly with China and Russia, during a virtual summit. This call comes as the bloc meets amidst global trade tensions exacerbated by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, which have hit India hard with levies as steep as 50%. China's President Xi Jinping, in turn, criticized "Hegemonism, unilateralism, and protectionism," advocating for BRICS unity against higher tariffs and noting that trade wars disrupt the global economy. The article highlights differing views within BRICS, with India prioritizing economic concerns due to its rising deficits, while China and Russia view it more as a geopolitical grouping. Bilateral trade between India and China reached a record deficit of $99.21 billion for India in the last fiscal year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>US lawmakers have released a letter from a 2003 "birthday book" for Jeffrey Epstein, in which Lord Mandelson, currently the UK ambassador to the US, referred to the convicted paedophile as his "best pal." The message, written three years before Epstein's sex abuse allegations became public, describes Epstein as an "intelligent, sharp-witted man" who "parachuted" into his life and left him with "interesting" friends. Lord Mandelson's spokesperson stated he "very much regrets ever having been introduced to Epstein," a connection that has been public for some time, and referred to previous comments where he expressed regret. This revelation adds to the ongoing scrutiny of Epstein's extensive high-profile connections and their past associations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thailand's Supreme Court has ruled that former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra must serve a full year in jail, overturning his previous parole after determining his hospital stay was unlawful. Thaksin, who returned from self-imposed exile in 2023, was initially sentenced to eight years for corruption, commuted to one year by royal pardon, but spent minimal time in a jail cell. The court's decision, stemming from the "14th floor case," addresses public outrage over alleged special treatment. This ruling represents another significant setback for the Shinawatra political dynasty, which has dominated Thai politics for decades, following his daughter Paetongtarn's recent removal from the premiership.</p>

          <p>Russia launched its most extensive aerial strike of the war against Ukraine, firing over 800 drones and 13 missiles at cities including Kyiv, resulting in four deaths and marking the first attack on the main Ukrainian government building. This assault is part of a significant escalation in strikes over the past three months, with September on track for the heaviest shelling yet. Analysts from the Institute of War Studies suggest Russia aims to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses, damage critical infrastructure, and induce panic among the population to undermine recruitment efforts and discredit the government. The intensified and staggered assaults indicate that a ceasefire is not imminent, as Russia commits to mass drone attacks to achieve strategic destruction and psychological effects.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson stated the city received no prior notice regarding Homeland Security's "Operation Midway Blitz," a ramped-up immigration enforcement effort targeting "criminal illegal aliens." The department, acting under President Trump's "zero tolerance" message, aims to combat crime, citing a recent fatal hit-and-run involving an undocumented individual in Urbana. Governor J.B. Pritzker criticized the Trump administration for lack of communication and coordination, accusing them of trying to scare Illinois residents rather than address public safety collaboratively. Mayor Johnson opposes militarized immigration enforcement due to past human rights abuse allegations against ICE, including detaining citizens and violating human rights, urging residents to access "know your rights" resources.</p>

The film's restrained storytelling evokes deep emotional responses from Chinese audiences, who experience "utter silence to muffled sobs" and leave with tear-streaked faces.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Syria's state news agency reported that Israel carried out air strikes in the central and western parts of the country, prompting condemnation from Syria's Foreign Ministry as a "blatant infringement" of its sovereignty and regional stability. While Israel offered no immediate comment, its defense minister previously stated forces operate in all combat zones for Israel's security. These alleged attacks follow dozens of previous Israeli strikes across Syria since the fall of ex-President Bashar al-Assad, with Israel claiming it aims to prevent weapons from falling into "extremists'" hands. Reports indicate targets near Homs, Palmyra, and Latakia, with no immediate word on casualties, marking the 97th Israeli attack this year according to a war monitor.</p>

          <p>Damon Dash, co-founder of Roc-A-Fella Records, has filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, declaring over $25.3 million in debt and only $4,350 to his name. The petition, filed in Florida, reveals that the majority of his debt, approximately $19.1 million, is owed to the government in taxes. Dash also owes nearly $648,000 in domestic support obligations to his ex-wife Rachel Roy and ex-girlfriend Cindy Morales. His one-third share of Roc-A-Fella Records was recently auctioned to the New York Department of Taxation and Finance to help cover tax debt. He also faces ongoing legal battles, including a $4 million libel judgment from filmmaker Josh Webber.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. has experienced the steepest decline in mothers of young children in the workforce in over 40 years, with more than 400,000 women leaving their jobs in the first half of 2025. A University of Kansas analysis attributes this trend primarily to the prohibitive cost and overwhelming demands of childcare, where average daycare costs can negate a mother's entire paycheck. Many mothers, like Mackenzie Bruegge from Iowa, find it financially unviable to work, despite loving their jobs. Economists warn that without adequate support policies for caregivers, women will continue to backtrack in the labor force, highlighting a systemic issue affecting families and the broader economy.</p>

          <p>New league tables ranking the performance of NHS trusts in England have been published, with specialist hospitals like Moorfields Eye Hospital topping the list, while Queen Elizabeth Hospital, King's Lynn, ranks lowest due to structural issues. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the tables aim to identify areas needing "urgent support" and end the "postcode lottery" in healthcare, giving patients more transparency. Trusts will be ranked quarterly across categories including patient waiting times, A&E care, and financial performance, with top performers gaining more autonomy and struggling ones receiving enhanced support, with accountability for bosses. NHS Providers, however, questions the accuracy and potential for unintended consequences of the ranking system, fearing a focus on metrics over patient needs.</p>

The change follows the suicide of head teacher Ruth Perry, to which a coroner ruled the inspection contributed. Starting November 10, schools will be graded across seven areas on a five-point scale, from "exceptional" to "urgent improvement," aiming to provide parents with more detail. Critics, including Perry's sister, argue this is a "cosmetic rebranding" that still poses risks to teacher well-being due to its high-stakes, punitive nature, urging the Education Secretary to intervene and delay the rollout.</p>

The Department of Homeland Security declared it would "FLOOD THE ZONE" in Los Angeles, intensifying fears among non-citizens and their families, who have already faced arrests and family separations. Local officials, including Mayor Karen Bass and Governor Gavin Newsom, denounced the ruling as "dangerous" and an "attack on every person." Advocates warn that agents could become more aggressive, leading to increased suffering and economic disruption, as the ruling lifts a temporary ban on stops based on appearance, language, and vocation.</p>

          <p>Cannabis use among Americans aged 65 and older surged by 46% between 2021 and 2023, according to a study published in JAMA Internal Medicine. This increase is attributed to diminishing stigma and the growing legalization of cannabis for medical and recreational purposes across many states. Seniors like Gayle Crawley and Steven Clarke use cannabis for medicinal issues such as PTSD, pain, and relaxation, preferring edibles over smoking. However, medical professionals like UC San Francisco professor Matt Springer warn of potential health risks, particularly for the cardiovascular system, regardless of the method of ingestion, citing studies linking cannabis use to increased cardiovascular disease and stroke risks.</p>

The new service will handle approximately 10,000 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) of fresh durians annually, complementing the Dalian Northeast Asia Fruit Transit Centre. Analysts note that improved logistics are crucial for this region, which is geographically distant from traditional entry points, to meet growing consumer curiosity for the popular and pricey fruit.</p>

All six passengers and crew are safe, but the Portuguese-flagged vessel sustained fire damage to its main deck and below-deck storage. Tunisian authorities, however, deny a drone attack, stating the explosion originated inside the boat and that reports of a drone attack "have no basis in truth." This incident follows previous confrontations, including Israel seizing a British-flagged yacht carrying Greta Thunberg in June. Israel has maintained a naval blockade on Gaza since 2007 to prevent weapons reaching Hamas, a blockade that has remained through the current conflict.</p>

Firefighters had implemented protective measures, including sprinkler systems and fire-resistant wraps, but the fire's intensity, fueled by decades of unburned material and numerous dead trees, poses a significant threat.
