          <p>Amidst escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, commercial traffic continues through the Strait of Hormuz, a critical route for global oil trade. Maritime shipping experts report increased caution among shipowners, with some opting to avoid the Red Sea and Persian Gulf. Security firms advise vessels to reconsider transiting the Strait of Hormuz and to assess affiliations for potential targeting. The US-led Joint Maritime Information Center asserts the Strait of Hormuz remains open, urging companies to review contingency plans, but any perceived US involvement could significantly heighten risks for ships, including potential missile attacks or sea mines. The current situation could lead to increased insurance costs and potential surcharges on ocean freight container shipping rates.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to host a parade celebrating the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army in Washington, D.C., marking the capital's first major military parade in over three decades. Military parades in the U.S. have historically been rare, often celebrating the end of wars or the return of military personnel, with the last major parade marking the end of the Gulf War in 1991. Presidential inaugural parades have also included military personnel, particularly during the Cold War, but such displays became less common after the Vietnam War era. The upcoming parade has drawn criticism for its cost and perceived self-aggrandizement, while supporters view it as a fitting tribute to military service and sacrifice.</p>

          <p>International Atomic Energy Agency Director-General Rafael Grossi informed the United Nations Security Council that Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear sites have significantly damaged the primary enrichment site at Natanz, including its electricity infrastructure and backup generators. While there was no direct physical attack on the underground cascade, the loss of power may have damaged the centrifuges. The IAEA reported normal radioactivity levels surrounding the site, but noted radiological and chemical contamination inside the facilities, manageable with appropriate radiation protection measures. Grossi reiterated that nuclear facilities should never be attacked due to the serious implications for nuclear security, safety, safeguards, and international peace.</p>

          <p>Stocks closed lower and oil prices surged after Israeli airstrikes on Iran heightened investor concerns about a broader Middle East conflict. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite all experienced declines, while U.S. benchmark crude oil and Brent crude both saw significant increases. Analysts suggest a deepening conflict could disrupt oil flow from Iran, potentially leading to the closure of the Strait of Hormuz, though this is currently considered unlikely. Middle East tensions are also affecting other markets, with declines in bitcoin prices and airline stocks, and a rally in defense stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>USA Fencing has announced changes to its policies regarding the national anthem and hosting events in states with anti-LGBTQ+ laws. The organization will now give equal consideration to all 50 states when selecting host cities for national tournaments, using a rubric that scores bids on cost, safety, and travel convenience. The national anthem will now be required to be played at every event, effective at the 2025 Summer Nationals and reviewed annually. These changes come after criticism of the previous policies, including from Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who argued they created politically-determined winners and losers and contradicted USA Fencing’s duty to develop interest and participation throughout the United States.</p>

          <p>House Republicans' reconciliation legislation, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, proposes changes intended to boost families' finances, including investment "Trump accounts" for newborns and an enhanced child tax credit. However, the proposed changes, emphasizing work requirements, may reduce aid for children in low-income families through cuts to Medicaid and SNAP. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that households in the bottom 10% of income distribution would lose about $1,600 per year due to reductions in in-kind transfers. Critics argue the plan disproportionately benefits wealthier families while excluding vulnerable families from the full child tax credit.</p>

This approach contrasts with the failures leading up to the October 7 attack by Hamas, which exposed intelligence gaps and a lack of preparedness. Israel's focus on neutralizing Iran's capabilities is evident in its targeted strikes and clandestine operations within Iran. The situation carries the risk of a protracted and destructive conflict, but also the potential for a decisive victory, contingent on preparation and execution.</p>

China, the world's largest producer of rare earths, supplies about 90% of the U.S.'s rare earth minerals, and has imposed export controls amid trade tensions with the U.S. Although the U.S. and China recently reached an agreement to resume regular exports of rare earths, Ford is still facing challenges in securing these materials.

          <p>Following Israel's strikes against Iran's military leadership and nuclear program, questions arise about the United States' role in the escalating conflict. Initially, the Trump administration seemed hesitant, but later expressed support for Israel's actions, hoping it would force Iran to make concessions. The conventional wisdom has been that a full-scale attack on Iran's nuclear facilities would require US involvement, particularly in destroying deeply buried enrichment sites. Iran's response, including missile barrages, and the potential for attacks on American interests raise concerns about a broader conflict, and whether the US will remain on the sidelines.</p>

After the first set, the 22-year-old took a medical timeout because she had been experiencing back spasms for the previous few months. She had a stronger start to the second set, leading with a double break, but was unable to hold off Zheng's powerful hitting.</p>

          <p>Downtown Los Angeles has experienced a stark contrast between daytime calm and nighttime chaos amid protests against federal immigration raids and President Trump's deployment of the military. While daytime protests have been largely peaceful, nighttime demonstrations have seen violence, property damage, and clashes with law enforcement. Businesses have been vandalized, and graffiti has been spray-painted on buildings, leading to a city-ordered curfew. Volunteers have worked to clean up the damage during the day, highlighting the efforts to maintain order and civility despite the unrest.</p>
