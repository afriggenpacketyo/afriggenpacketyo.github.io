          <h2>Trade Issues Could Slow Chinese Airline Growth and Boeing Deliveries, Analysts Say</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts predict that trade tensions and ongoing supply chain issues will significantly hinder the growth of China's aviation sector. Despite recent tariff reductions, remaining duties on imports from the U.S. could force Chinese airlines to pay millions more for Boeing jets. This, combined with global delivery delays, is expected to slow China's civil aviation passenger capacity growth to an average of 3.1% annually until 2028, a stark contrast to the 15.4% average annual growth seen in the decade leading up to 2019. Some Chinese airlines have already refused Boeing plane deliveries amidst the trade upheaval, and cancellations may occur. Optimism surrounding the aviation industry is dampened by these factors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority in imposing reciprocal tariffs, a key element of his economic agenda. The U.S. Court of International Trade determined that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president the power to unilaterally implement sweeping duties. The court ordered a permanent halt to the tariffs and barred future modifications, specifically targeting tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China related to drug trafficking. Dow futures rose following the announcement, while the Trump administration swiftly appealed the ruling. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the U.S. will "aggressively" revoke visas from Chinese students, particularly those with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields. The State Department will also revise visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of future applications from China and Hong Kong. This move could affect a significant portion of the approximately 280,000 Chinese students currently in the U.S., especially those in fields like semiconductor engineering or aerospace.

          <p>An unsealed FBI intelligence memo offers details on the bureau's assessment that some Venezuelan government officials likely facilitated the migration of Tren de Aragua gang members to the U.S. to undermine public safety. This conclusion is disputed by other intelligence agencies, including the CIA and NSA, which find the claim inaccurate. The memo, submitted in a Texas court, is based on statements from seven sources, including one who claimed President NicolÃ¡s Maduro used intermediaries to distance himself from the gang's activities. The National Intelligence Council, however, believes the detainees might have fabricated their ties to the Venezuelan regime to lessen their punishment.</p>

          <h2>US Trade Court Blocks Trump's Sweeping Tariffs</h2>

          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, delivering a significant blow to a key part of his economic policies. The Court of International Trade ruled that an emergency law invoked by the White House does not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The court emphasized that the US Constitution grants Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations. The Trump administration has lodged an appeal, but the ruling could significantly impact global trade relations.</p>

          <p>A Salvadorian family made three attempts to cross into Canada, seeking asylum from potential deportations under President Trump's immigration policies. Araceli, along with her partner and two daughters, faced hurdles due to the "safe third country agreement" between Canada and the US, which requires asylum seekers to apply in the first country they enter. The family's initial attempts were thwarted due to document discrepancies, but they eventually succeeded after legal intervention. Immigration experts note a rise in asylum seekers fleeing President Trump's immigration policies, leading to stricter border policies on the Canadian side.</p>

The data links synchronize with Peopleâ€™s Liberation Armyâ€™s airborne early warning platforms. This mirrors Pakistan's use of Chinese technology to shoot down Indian fighters near the disputed Kashmir region, marking a significant advancement in operational coordination.</p>

          <p>A panel of federal judges has blocked President Trump from imposing some of his steepest tariffs on China and other U.S. trading partners, stating that federal law did not grant him "unbounded authority" to tax imports. The U.S. Court of International Trade found that Trump's tariffs exceeded the authority granted by the emergency powers law. The ruling delivers a significant setback to Trump's trade policies, potentially undercutting his leverage in negotiations with other nations.
