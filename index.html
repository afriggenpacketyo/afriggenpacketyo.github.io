          <p>A man in Texas, Justin Anthony Banta, has been charged with capital murder and tampering with physical evidence after allegedly slipping an abortion drug into his pregnant girlfriend's drink without her knowledge or permission. The woman, who was six weeks pregnant, experienced heavy bleeding after meeting Banta at a coffee shop and later lost her baby. Banta had reportedly offered to cover the cost of an abortion when she initially disclosed her pregnancy but she wanted to keep the baby. Police discovered that Banta remotely accessed and reset his phone, deleting crucial evidence related to the case, which is ongoing given the active investigations. The legal context is important given Texas has some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the US, banning all abortions except in dire medical circumstances. Optimism is tempered by the tragic circumstances of the case.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) will deploy school police to create safe zones around campuses and graduation ceremonies in response to increased immigration raids in Los Angeles. Superintendent Alberto Carvalho announced that school police would act as a barrier to keep federal immigration agents away from students, employees, and families. This decision comes after isolated clashes between police and protesters, and the reversal of a Biden administration policy that largely exempted schools from immigration enforcement. Carvalho emphasized the district's commitment to providing a safe and threat-free public education for all students, regardless of immigration status, and is prepared to put his job on the line to protect students and their families. The move aims to alleviate fears among families and ensure graduation ceremonies can proceed peacefully, though officials acknowledge they cannot interfere with judicial warrants. The plan includes minimizing outdoor lines at graduation venues and providing virtual viewing options, while also respecting student's rights to protest.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has criticized President Trump's decision to deploy thousands of additional troops to Los Angeles in response to protests against immigration raids, calling it "the deranged fantasy of a dictatorial president." The state is suing the president for sending in troops without the governor's permission, marking the first time since 1965 that a president has deployed National Guard troops to a US city without gubernatorial approval. Protests erupted after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers conducted raids in Latino areas, leading to looting, arson, and clashes with law enforcement. Trump defended his decision, stating that the National Guard stopped the city from "burning down," while Newsom condemned the troop deployment as a step toward authoritarianism. The situation reflects a broader conflict between the state and the federal government over immigration policy and enforcement, further escalating political tensions.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece discusses the controversy surrounding President Trump's decision to send National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests. The author criticizes Trump's actions as hypocritical, given his past behavior and legal troubles, and argues that undocumented immigration is not the major threat to public safety that Trump portrays. The author acknowledges the costs associated with supporting undocumented immigrants but emphasizes their economic contributions and the willingness of employers to hire them. The situation is seen as a reflection of the complex and often contradictory nature of immigration policy, where economic realities and political rhetoric clash. The author defends the Los Angeles community and its approach to immigration, contrasting it with what he views as divisive and harmful policies from the Trump administration.</p>

Brad Marchand and Sam Bennett continued their strong play, while Sam Reinhart and Carter Verhaeghe each scored their first goals of the series. Sergei Bobrovsky made 32 saves for the Panthers, while Connor McDavid struggled to get his team on track, and the Oilers took 15 penalties, including a late-game brawl. The game was a lopsided affair after the first two games were closely contested, with the Panthers capitalizing on the Oilers' mistakes.

          <p>Over 300 scientists from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have signed an open letter criticizing the Trump administration for policies that they say are politicizing research, interrupting global collaboration, and hindering the NIH's ability to conduct important research. The letter, called the Bethesda Declaration, calls for the reinstatement of staff, the restoration of funding, and the reversal of policies capping indirect research costs. Scientists expressed concerns that political momentum is being prioritized over human safety and the responsible use of public resources. The NIH director, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, acknowledged the concerns but defended the agency's policy directions, emphasizing the importance of respectful dissent in science.</p>

He highlighted China's advantages in AI development, including a large young population, sufficient electricity, and a developed information network. Ren's interview comes as the US increases restrictions on China and Huawei, with new guidance suggesting the use of Ascend chips could violate export controls.</p>

          <p>Russian drone strikes have hit multiple locations in Ukraine, including Kyiv and Odesa. In Odesa, a "massive" drone attack struck a maternity hospital, an emergency medical facility, and residential buildings, resulting in one death and at least four injuries. Patients and staff from the hospital were evacuated before the strikes, which caused significant damage to buildings. Kyiv also experienced drone attacks, with emergency services responding to incidents across four districts. The attacks are part of an ongoing conflict, with Russia claiming the strikes are retaliatory measures for Ukraine's recent actions inside Russia.</p>

          <p>U.S. officials have clarified the rules of force for the Marines and National Guard personnel deployed in Los Angeles amidst protests. The troops are tasked with protecting federal buildings and personnel only, and will not engage crowds unless necessary. While carrying weapons, their guns will not be loaded with ammunition, and they will not use rubber bullets or pepper spray. These rules could change if President Trump invokes the Insurrection Act, which he has not done. The personnel are operating under rules of force that prioritize de-escalation, and the Los Angeles Police Department is urging open communication between all agencies to ensure a coordinated response.</p>

Rice prices have doubled compared to the previous year, prompting the government to take action. The released rice will consist of harvests from 2020 and 2021, with the 2020 rice expected to be sold at a reduced price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has committed ¬£14.2 billion to build the new Sizewell C nuclear plant on the Suffolk coastline, ahead of the Spending Review. The Treasury said that Sizewell C would create 10,000 direct jobs, thousands more in firms supplying the plant, and generate enough energy to power six million homes. Opponents of the project have criticized the investment, arguing that the money could be spent on other priorities and that the project will add to consumer bills. The government insists that nuclear power provides enormous amounts of low-carbon, non-intermittent energy and is crucial to the government's plans to almost completely eliminate fossil fuels from the UK's energy grid by 2030.</p>

Introduced in 2003, statutory paternity leave allows new fathers to take up to two weeks off work, receiving ¬£187.18 a week or 90% of their average earnings, whichever is lower.

          <p>A research project by four students from a New Mexico high school has uncovered the horrors of Unit 731, a secret Japanese military unit that conducted experiments on people in China and other parts of Asia during World War II. The students' documentary also explores America's role in keeping Unit 731's war crimes quiet. Their project, which revisits a dark corner of wartime history, questions how that history is taught in US schools today. The team's research began with a college-prep seminar course, where students were expected to choose and research a topic, eventually leading them to the atrocities committed by Unit 731.</p>
