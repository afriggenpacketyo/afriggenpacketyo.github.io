          <p>Two 19-year-old camp counselors from Mexico, Silvana Garza Valdez and María Paula Zárate, described their efforts to manage and protect young campers during the catastrophic floods in Texas. They recalled keeping the children calm with games and songs as floodwaters rose, and preparing them for a helicopter evacuation. The counselors reflected on the surreal and terrifying nature of the event, expressing shock and gratitude for their survival after learning that cabins they had occupied just a week prior were destroyed. Their account provides a personal perspective on the heroism and fear experienced amidst the tragedy.</p>

          <p>Minnesota state Senator John Hoffman has been discharged from the intensive care unit and moved to a rehabilitation facility following a shooting at his home three weeks ago. Hoffman was shot nine times, and his wife, Yvette, was shot eight times in what authorities have described as a politically motivated attack. The alleged shooter, who is also accused of killing state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband on the same night, is in custody facing federal and state charges. Yvette Hoffman was released from the hospital in June, marking a positive step in the family's recovery.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is ending its long-standing policy requiring passengers to remove their shoes during security screening at many major U.S. airports. The rule change, which began rolling out in early July, will eventually apply to all standard security lanes nationwide, aligning them with the existing TSA PreCheck policy. The shoe removal requirement was first implemented in 2006, years after Richard Reid's failed attempt to detonate explosives hidden in his footwear on a flight. Passengers who trigger alarms at scanners will still be required to remove their shoes for additional screening.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced it will send more defensive weapons to Ukraine to help the country defend itself against Russia's ongoing assault. This decision comes shortly after the White House confirmed a temporary halt on some weapon shipments, a move attributed to a review of U.S. military stockpiles. President Trump stated that Ukraine is being hit very hard and needs the ability to defend itself, emphasizing the shipments will be primarily defensive. The announcement followed recent phone calls between Trump and the leaders of both Ukraine and Russia, with Trump expressing disappointment in his conversation with Vladimir Putin.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Chinese students are choosing to pursue higher education in Singapore over the United States, citing cultural adjustments and safety concerns in America. Industry insiders note that while the U.S. has been the traditional top choice, Singapore's high-quality universities, cultural familiarity, and perceived stability are making it an increasingly attractive alternative. One Chinese student currently in the U.S. explained her decision to apply to Singaporean universities for her master's degree, pointing to the nation's welcoming environment. This trend suggests a potential shift in international education preferences amid changing global dynamics.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that one in five vehicle accidents in the United States occurs in parking lots, resulting in over 500 deaths and 165 injuries per day. The study identifies driver distraction as a major cause, with a high percentage of drivers admitting to using phones, texting, and even grooming while navigating parking areas. Poor urban design is also a significant factor, as some cities have vast, poorly regulated parking areas that lack basic safety features like adequate lighting and clear markings. The article suggests that improved design, better maintenance, and more attentive driving are crucial for reducing these preventable incidents.</p>

          <p>The number of fatalities from the flash floods that devastated central Texas over the Fourth of July weekend has climbed to more than 100, with an unknown number of people still missing. The disaster, triggered by torrential downpours, caused the Guadalupe River to swell, overwhelming communities and a summer camp. Camp Mystic, an all-girls' Christian camp, confirmed that at least 27 of its campers and staff were among the dead. The White House has pushed back against claims that budget cuts at the National Weather Service affected the disaster response, calling the event an "act of God."</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost their fourth consecutive game, falling 9-1 to the Milwaukee Brewers after a calamitous first inning for pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto. In the shortest start of his MLB career, Yamamoto gave up five runs in just two-thirds of an inning, undone by a three-run homer and compounded by poor defense. The 41-pitch collapse put the Dodgers in a hole from which their shorthanded lineup, missing several key players due to injury, could not recover. The Brewers' All-Star pitcher Freddy Peralta capitalized on the lead, delivering six shutout innings against the struggling Los Angeles offense.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has moved to permanently restrict landlords from evicting tenants for the purpose of substantial remodels, a practice known as "renoviction." An amendment to the city's "just cause" ordinance will now require landlords to obtain a Government Agency Order to vacate a unit for renovations, typically issued for safety code violations. This measure aims to close a loophole that some landlords allegedly used to displace tenants and subsequently raise rents for new occupants. The city is also developing rules to ensure tenants are properly relocated and can return to their units at a controlled rent increase post-renovation.</p>

The order ensures that Medicaid funding continues for 14 days, with a hearing scheduled for later in July.

Samsung attributed the poor outlook to inventory value adjustments, U.S. restrictions on chip sales to China, and ongoing losses in its chip foundry business.

          <p>Beijing has activated a new flight path, W121, in the Taiwan Strait without consulting Taipei, a move that has raised alarms in Taiwan. This is the last of three branch routes off the main M503 flight path, which at its closest point is only 4.2 nautical miles from the unofficial median line separating mainland China and Taiwan. Mainland China's civil aviation authority stated the change was a technical adjustment to relieve air traffic pressure and improve safety. However, the unilateral decision is viewed by Taipei as a potential security concern that further erodes the buffer zone between them.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review by the Justice Department and the FBI has concluded that financier Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide in 2019 and that there was no so-called "client list" or evidence of blackmail against prominent individuals. According to a memo on the findings, investigators reviewed video footage confirming no one entered Epstein's cell at the time of his death and found no credible evidence to pursue investigations against uncharged third parties. The review aimed to address widespread conspiracy theories and provide transparency, though officials noted some graphic material containing child pornography would not be released.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw has been named to his 11th career All-Star team, this time as a special "Legend Pick" by Commissioner Rob Manfred. The selection, which recognizes his career accomplishments, came as a surprise to the 37-year-old pitcher, who has made only nine starts this season after returning from surgery. Kershaw expressed his gratitude for the "tremendous honor," acknowledging that while his performance this season might not typically warrant a selection, he intends to enjoy the experience. This special designation has previously been used for other future Hall of Famers like Albert Pujols and Miguel Cabrera.</p>

          <p>South Korea has canceled a planned $2.2 billion follow-on purchase of 36 AH-64E Apache Guardian attack helicopters. The decision was reportedly influenced by a 66% increase in the aircraft's cost and a strategic shift based on lessons from the war in Ukraine, which has highlighted the vulnerability of helicopters to modern air defenses and drones. A member of South Korea's National Assembly stated that the country must invest in future-warfare capabilities like drones and smart systems rather than expensive legacy platforms. The funds will likely be reallocated to develop these emerging military technologies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Police in Budapest have announced they will not prosecute participants of the city's recent Pride parade, even though the event was officially prohibited by the government. Authorities cited public uncertainty over the event's legal status, which was created after Budapest's liberal mayor, Gergely Karacsony, declared it an official municipal event, potentially exempting it from the ban. The decision comes as a relief to the record-breaking crowd of over 200,000 who attended. Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government has enacted several anti-LGBTQ+ policies, including a law passed in March that allows for the banning of Pride marches.</p>

The letter calls Maguire's comments a "deliberate, inflammatory attack" and asks Sequoia to apologize, authorize an independent investigation, and implement a zero-tolerance policy on hate speech.

          <p>The chief inspector of prisons in England and Wales has warned that an overwhelming amount of drugs being smuggled into prisons is destabilizing the system and undermining rehabilitation efforts. A new report highlights that criminal gangs are using drones to deliver contraband to inmates, who are often bored due to overcrowding and a lack of purposeful activities. A survey found that 39% of prisoners said it was easy to get drugs, and the report noted that at some high-security prisons, inexperienced staff were unable to contain the criminality. The watchdog called the issue a threat that needs to be taken seriously at the highest levels of government.</p>

State officials rejected the federal analysis, setting up a legal and political confrontation over the interpretation of civil rights law.

          <p>The catastrophic flooding in central Texas has raised serious questions about the adequacy of emergency warning systems and the impact of federal budget cuts. Kerr County, the hardest-hit area, lacks a siren-based flood warning system, a project that had been debated for years but not funded. While the National Weather Service issued multiple alerts, some residents received no warnings, and the first urgent cellphone message to "seek higher ground" was not sent until 4 a.m. Critics are also examining whether staffing shortages and funding cuts at the NWS may have affected forecasting and coordination with local emergency officials.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The deadly flash flood in Texas serves as a stark reminder of the similar dangers California faces from extreme weather events, particularly along its rivers and creeks. While California's flood risks often stem from large-scale atmospheric rivers rather than intense thunderstorms, the potential for catastrophic, sudden inundation is comparable. Experts note that although California generally has stronger regulations restricting construction in high-risk floodways, many communities and homeless populations remain vulnerable. The state's history of deadly floods, like the 2018 Montecito debris flows, underscores the ever-present risk in a climate-changed world.</p>
