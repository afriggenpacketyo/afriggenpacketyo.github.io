          <p>A 25-year-old man from New York, visiting Puerto Rico for a Bad Bunny concert, was fatally shot at a nightspot in La Perla, San Juan. Police indicate he was an innocent bystander caught in an argument between other individuals that escalated to gunfire, which also injured two local residents. The incident highlights ongoing safety concerns in the historically volatile neighborhood, which had seen improvements in recent years following a major police raid and its feature in the "Despacito" music video. Authorities are in the early stages of their investigation and have not yet established a definitive motive.</p>

Rutte emphasized that while Trump is initiating the dialogue, any final peace deal concerning Ukrainian territory or security guarantees must involve Ukraine and European allies. He assured that weapon deliveries to Ukraine will continue regardless of the summit's outcome and that the alliance remains united, stating Putin will not be allowed to decide NATO's posture or Ukraine's future strategic position.</p>

          <p>A 27-year-old woman, previously associated with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's 2018 campaign, has been arrested in New York City for allegedly making terroristic threats. She is accused of posting on social media, encouraging an attack on a Brooklyn high school due to its population of Jewish students, whom she described as "Israhell loving Zionisits." The suspect reportedly defended her post in a direct message, claiming she called for a "verbal attack" on the institution, not physical violence against individuals. She has pleaded not guilty to charges including making a terroristic threat and a threat of mass harm.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued a directive for homeless individuals in Washington, D.C., to "move out, IMMEDIATELY," stating they will be provided with alternative places to stay far from the capital. This announcement is part of a broader, intensified focus on crime in the District, which Trump claims will be addressed "very fast" and without being a "MR. NICE GUY." The move follows a recent executive order facilitating the removal of homeless encampments and comes despite Justice Department data showing a 30-year low in violent crime in the city. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has criticized the president's rhetoric as hyperbolic and false.</p>

          <p>Police in Downpatrick, Northern Ireland, have initiated a murder inquiry after a man's body was discovered in a house on Sunday. A 30-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder in connection with the death. Authorities suspect the incident may be linked to a separate, serious assault that occurred earlier the same day at St Patrick's Church, where a priest, Fr John Murray, was attacked with a bottle and left in a serious condition. Local political leaders have expressed shock and sadness over the violent events that have disturbed the community.</p>

          <p>Heavy rainfall and subsequent flash flooding led to the cancellation of the final day of the Wisconsin State Fair, as storms swept across several Midwest states. The Milwaukee area was hit particularly hard, with some locations receiving up to 10 inches of rain, causing widespread power outages and prompting numerous water rescues. The severe weather also impacted other events, including a triathlon, and resulted in road closures. In neighboring Nebraska, the storms were linked to one fatality and caused significant damage to a state penitentiary, displacing hundreds of inmates.</p>

Illinois Governor JB Pritzker labeled the effort as "cheating" and an attempt by Governor Greg Abbott to "whittle away" at democracy in service of Donald Trump. In response, Abbott has threatened to have the Democratic lawmakers arrested upon their return to Texas and vowed to call continuous special sessions until the matter is resolved.

The summit was arranged after Trump set a deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face harsher sanctions, and follows talks between a U.S. envoy and Putin. A key point of contention is that Ukraine is not currently scheduled to attend, raising fears in Kyiv that a deal could be made at its expense, potentially involving territorial concessions.

          <p>Central Beijing, including areas around Tiananmen Square and Changan Avenue, was blocked off over the weekend for a large-scale rehearsal of an upcoming military parade. The event, scheduled for September 3, will commemorate the 80th anniversary of China's victory over the Japanese invasion during World War II. According to state media, the rehearsal was comprehensive, testing all organizational and command operations for the main event. President Xi Jinping is expected to preside over the parade, which will feature a commemorative assembly and a military procession through the heart of the capital.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Electric Spark," re-examines the work of novelist Muriel Spark, arguing that her reputation as a comic writer obscures her significance as a major religious author in modern British literature. The article posits that Spark, a Catholic convert, expressed her theology primarily through her narrative form, often "playing God" with her characters and plot. She frequently used techniques like prolepsis, or revealing a character's fate early on, to shift the reader's focus from "what happens" to "why," exploring themes of divine will, conspiracy, and human fallibility. Her work was deeply influenced by her life experiences.</p>

          <p>In her upcoming memoir, former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon suggests that her predecessor, the late Alex Salmond, may have been behind the 2018 leak of a government investigation into sexual misconduct claims against him. Allies of Salmond, who was later cleared of all charges, have vehemently dismissed this as a "fabrication" and "hypocrisy." The journalist who broke the story also stated he finds the theory not credible, noting Salmond appeared genuinely shocked when contacted for comment at the time. The controversy reignites the bitter feud that fractured the Scottish National Party.</p>

          <p>U.S. fashion designer Willy Chavarria has issued an apology following criticism that a shoe he designed with Adidas culturally appropriated a traditional Mexican sandal. The Oaxaca Slip-On was inspired by huaraches made by Indigenous artisans but was reportedly produced without partnership or credit to the Oaxacan communities. The controversy drew comments from Mexico's president, who stated the government was exploring legal options to support the affected communities. Chavarria expressed deep regret that the design was not developed in collaboration with the people of Oaxaca, and promotional images have been removed.</p>

          <p>President Trump's invitation for Vladimir Putin to meet in Alaska represents a significant gamble to fulfill his campaign promise of ending the war in Ukraine. The move has alarmed allies, particularly Ukraine, who fear Trump may concede to Russian demands, such as redrawing borders, without their involvement. The summit was arranged after Trump grew frustrated with Putin's intransigence and threatened new sanctions, prompting the Russian leader to re-engage through back-channel talks. While Trump views himself as a master dealmaker, the article questions whether Putin is negotiating in good faith or merely buying time, creating a fragile situation.</p>

The storm's high winds, with gusts over 80 mph, caused widespread damage, including to two housing units at the Nebraska State Penitentiary in Lincoln. The damage forced the displacement of 387 inmates, though no injuries were reported among prisoners or staff.

During the sabbatical, the family focused on health, personal growth, and quality time, and they are now expecting their second child.

          <p>As generative AI provides attackers with more sophisticated tools, companies are increasingly adopting AI agents for their own cyber defense. These autonomous agents can handle routine detection, analysis, and alert tasks, freeing up human cybersecurity professionals to focus on more complex threats and strategic work. This automation helps combat worker burnout and addresses the talent shortage in the industry. While the technology is still evolving, experts believe AI agents are essential for defense, as they can manage tasks like monitoring executive travel or quarantining suspicious emails, allowing security teams to keep pace with the evolving threat landscape.
