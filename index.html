          <p>The Scottish Parliament is set to vote on a bill that would legalize assisted dying for terminally ill adults, marking the third time such a proposal has been considered. The bill requires two doctors to assess a patient's mental fitness before they can receive medical assistance to end their life. While supporters argue it would alleviate suffering, opponents raise concerns about safeguarding vulnerable individuals. The vote is expected to be close, with party lines blurred and the Scottish government officially neutral on the matter, however it is likely to fail based on current polling data. </p>

          <p>Following trade talks, the United States and China have agreed to lower tariff rates, reducing the triple-digit duties imposed since April. For the next 90 days, Chinese goods shipped to the US will be subject to at least 30% in tariffs, and American exports will receive a minimum of 10% in duties. However, these rates do not include previous tariffs, held over from the first iteration of the trade war, meaning the baseline rate is about 50%. The 90-day window may prevent a Christmas disaster for retailers, but there will still be an impact on back-to-school sales, as well as added costs for tariffs and logistics so prices will be going up overall. </p>

          <p>Australian pension funds are rethinking their long-held strategies of investing in U.S. assets and the dollar due to waning confidence in American growth. Volatility surrounding Sino-U.S. trade tensions has prompted investors to reassess their U.S. exposure and the dollar's role as a safe haven. While there have not yet been any major shifts in strategy, currency dealing desks in Australia have noticed modest changes in hedging demand from some pension funds. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>India has proposed to levy import duties on some products made in the United States to counter Washington's tariffs on steel and aluminium products produced in Asia's No.3 economy, a notice to the World Trade Organization (WTO) shows. India, the world's second-largest crude steel producer, told the WTO that Washington's "safeguard measures" would affect $7.6 billion worth of India-made products imported into the United States. India's proposed duties on U.S. products comes as the two countries are set to clinch a trade deal, with New Delhi offering to slash tariff gap by two-thirds. </p>

India has long opposed third-party mediation, particularly in the Kashmir dispute, which dates back to 1947. While Islamabad has welcomed Trump's comments, Delhi's position on Kashmir has hardened, especially after it withdrew the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019, triggering widespread protests in Kashmir. </p>

          <p>One of the most anticipated auctions of the season proved to be anticlimactic on Monday evening at Christie’s in New York, where many objects were presold to guaranteed bids and there was little evidence of the enthusiastic buyers who defined the market’s peak in 2022. Experts said the sale was marred by the economic uncertainty surrounding President Trump’s tariffs and how they might hurt the global art market. While the Riggio collection appeared to have done fine with a $272 million total, stripped of the fees, the sale fell short of the auction house’s pre-sale expectations. </p>
