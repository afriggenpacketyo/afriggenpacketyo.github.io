          <p>Authorities in Portugal have resumed the search for Madeleine McCann, who disappeared 18 years ago from Praia da Luz. Portuguese and German investigators are focusing on disused buildings and wells in the Lagos municipality, near where Madeleine went missing. The search, expected to last until Friday, covers a 21 sq km site between Praia da Luz and the area where the prime suspect, Christian BrÃ¼ckner, had been staying. BrÃ¼ckner is currently serving a sentence in Germany for the sexual assault of an American tourist in Portugal in 2005. Optimism for finding McCann is low, but the investigation continues. </p>

          <p>A recent Ukrainian drone attack on Russian military airfields and assets has highlighted the vulnerability of even the most advanced militaries to inexpensive, off-the-shelf drones. The mission, dubbed Operation Spider's Web, demonstrated how swarms of small drones can evade defenses and inflict significant damage on high-value targets. This event serves as a warning to military bases and critical infrastructure worldwide, including in the United States, emphasizing the need to address this emerging threat. The innovative use of technology is likely to inspire similar asymmetric attacks in the future. </p>
