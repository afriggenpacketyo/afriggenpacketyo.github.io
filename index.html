          <p>Judge Charles Breyer, brother of retired Justice Stephen Breyer, has been assigned to oversee California Governor Gavin Newsom's lawsuit against the Trump administration. The lawsuit alleges that President Trump deprived California of its sovereignty by federalizing National Guard soldiers in response to anti-immigration enforcement protests and riots in Los Angeles County. Newsom claims Trump's mobilization of the National Guard was an "unprecedented power grab," while Trump asserts it was necessary to protect ICE personnel and federal buildings.

          <p>A large international study involving nearly 300,000 children has found a two-way link between screen time and emotional well-being. Increased screen time is associated with higher risks of aggression, anxiety, and low self-esteem, while children with pre-existing social or emotional challenges tend to spend more time on screens. Time spent on gaming consoles showed particularly strong links to emotional problems. The study emphasizes the importance of limiting recreational screen time and encouraging children to engage in social activities and physical exercise. The optimism score is 45.</p>
