          <p>Researchers from the Bank of China have voiced concerns about the sustainability of the United States' expanding national debt, recommending a gradual reduction in China's holdings of U.S. dollar assets. In an article for a central bank-supervised publication, they highlighted the unsustainability of U.S. Treasury expansion. This comes as China has already been trimming its U.S. Treasury holdings to their lowest level since 2009. The researchers suggest diversifying reserves by increasing holdings of gold and other strategic resources. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's space agency has successfully completed a key engine test for the Long March-10 rocket, a crucial step in its plan to send astronauts to the moon by 2030. The test confirmed that the 21 YF-100K engines for the superheavy launcher could operate in sync under various power conditions. The Long March-10 is designed to deliver a 27-tonne payload into a trans-lunar orbit. The mission plan involves two separate launches to send the Mengzhou crew spacecraft and the Lanyue lander to rendezvous in lunar orbit.</p>

Putin called the meeting a "starting point" for improving bilateral relations and proposed a future meeting in Moscow.

          <p>This commentary article portrays the Alaska summit as a diplomatic victory for Vladimir Putin, who was welcomed with a red carpet and treated as an equal by a deferential Donald Trump. The author notes that Putin framed the narrative, spoke first, and secured Trump's agreement on claims of a rigged 2020 U.S. election. The piece criticizes Trump for appearing low-energy and for taking advice from an authoritarian leader indicted for war crimes. The summit is described as an anticlimactic event that bolstered Putin's standing without achieving progress on peace.</p>

          <p>The meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska is analyzed through five key observations, highlighting that the summit served as a significant diplomatic win for the Russian leader. Putin was welcomed back onto the world stage with a red-carpet reception, a stark contrast to his previous international isolation. The article notes that despite the summit's premise, no ceasefire deal was reached, and Trump's statement was notably vague. The meeting ended with an invitation for Trump to visit Moscow, leaving more questions than answers.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's government is proposing new residency regulations that would require mainland Chinese nationals to prove they have relinquished their Chinese household registration and passport to live on the island. The policy is framed as a national security measure to address threats from Beijing, including societal infiltration and identity ambiguity. The proposed amendment marks a significant shift in cross-strait residency governance. Applicants would need to provide notarized proof of renunciation or have their Chinese passport physically invalidated to be eligible for residency.</p>

          <p>Erin has intensified into a Category 2 hurricane, becoming the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, with forecasts predicting it could become a major hurricane over the weekend.

Current forecast models show Erin's path curving northward, keeping it well offshore from the U.S. East Coast.

          <p>Democrats in California have unveiled a proposal to redraw the state's congressional district maps, aiming to gain up to five U.S. House seats and bolster their chances of winning control of Congress. The move is a direct response to a similar Republican-led redistricting effort in Texas. The plan would require a state constitutional amendment and voter approval in a special election. If passed, the new maps would significantly reshape several GOP-held districts to favor Democrats, a strategy that critics have condemned as partisan gerrymandering.</p>

The article notes that while Trump claimed progress was made, he offered no specifics and took no questions, while Putin reiterated demands that effectively amount to Ukrainian capitulation. The author argues that the summit was a victory for Putin, who was welcomed back to the world stage. The event is framed as a high-stakes meeting that produced more ambiguity than resolution.</p>

          <p>An internal review by the Arkansas Department of Corrections reveals that Grant Hardin, a former police chief, meticulously planned his prison escape over six months, exploiting lax security in the facility's kitchen. Hardin created a fake law enforcement uniform using markers and laundry, hiding his supplies in a trash can. He stated that he simply walked up to a gate and directed the tower guard to open it. The report led to the firing of two employees and highlighted systemic failures, including Hardin's misclassification at a medium-security prison.</p>
