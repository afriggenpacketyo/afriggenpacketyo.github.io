          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced a significant policy shift, allowing verified adult ChatGPT users to access erotic materials starting in December. This change, part of a 'treat adult users like adults' principle, follows previous restrictions aimed at mitigating mental health risks. The company plans to roll out enhanced safety features and parental controls for minors, while also introducing new chatbot personalities. Altman's decision marks a departure from his earlier stance against sexualized AI chat features, as OpenAI faces increased scrutiny over its safety policies.</p>

          <p>The USA men's soccer team secured a 2-1 victory over Australia in a friendly match, with Haji Wright scoring both goals after an early deficit. The win came despite captain Christian Pulisic being forced off in the 27th minute due to a lower leg complaint following several heavy challenges. Australia initially took the lead through Jordy Bos, but USA's control of possession and a spark from substitute Diego Luna helped them equalize before halftime. This result marks Tony Popovic's first loss as Socceroos boss and denies Australia an easier World Cup group.</p>

This performance, the Dodgers' first postseason complete game since 2004, silenced the Brewers after an initial leadoff home run. Max Muncy and Teoscar Hernández contributed solo homers, with Muncy setting a new Dodgers postseason record. The win gives Los Angeles a commanding 2-0 series lead as the NLCS shifts to Dodger Stadium, making a Brewers comeback a significant challenge.</p>

Defense attorneys are seeking to dismiss indictments and disqualify Essayli, arguing his extended term circumvented confirmation processes. The judge questioned the potential impact of dismissing 203 indictments made under Essayli's tenure. This case mirrors similar legal challenges in New Jersey and Nevada, highlighting broader concerns about the appointment of temporary federal officials and the integrity of the judicial process.</p>

          <p>Fesia Davenport, Los Angeles County’s chief executive officer, received a $2 million settlement this summer due to professional fallout from Measure G, a voter-approved ballot measure. The measure will make her appointed position obsolete by 2028, replacing it with an elected county executive. Davenport cited reputational harm, embarrassment, and emotional distress as reasons for seeking damages. She began medical leave last week, with the settlement preventing her from suing the county over Measure G's impact on her career and future plans.</p>

While core CPI showed a slight improvement, experts warn it's too early to declare an end to deflationary pressures, highlighting significant structural challenges for China's economy.

          <p>A suspected copper wire thief, Elliaz Natividad, 25, was criminally charged after being found inside a manhole in West Los Angeles attempting to steal copper wire. A resident's tip led deputies to the scene. Natividad faces charges of attempted grand theft of copper materials and possession of burglary tools. This incident follows widespread copper wire thefts in Los Angeles, which have caused significant damage, power outages, and disruption to emergency services and internet access.

          <p>Gun rights organizations, including the NRA, have filed a lawsuit challenging a new California law that bans certain Glock-style semiautomatic firearms. The law prohibits pistols with a 'cruciform trigger bar,' a feature enabling conversion into illegal machine guns using 'switches.' Plaintiffs argue the law violates the Second Amendment by banning commonly owned handguns, asserting that semiautomatic pistols are neither 'dangerous and unusual.' Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, the bill's author, stated its intent is to protect communities from gun violence, citing past mass shootings involving modified weapons.</p>

The new settings also prevent teens from following accounts that regularly post age-inappropriate content. Meta is applying these regulations to its AI technology, ensuring AI responses are suitable for a PG-13 audience, and offers parents a 'Limited Content' option for stricter filtering.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new tariffs on imported furniture, kitchen cabinets, and other housewares, along with lumber, have taken effect. These levies, ranging from 10% to 50%, are intended to protect American manufacturing from foreign products.

Goldman Sachs estimates consumers will absorb 55% of added costs, and businesses 22%. The IMF notes the tariffs have been less disruptive than expected but warns the full impact is yet to be felt.

The phenomenon, dubbed 'vapocalypse' or 'vape effect,' has led to a surge in fires in waste facilities and homes.
