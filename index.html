          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Trump lacks the authority to unilaterally impose tariffs, a significant setback to his trade war strategies. The U.S. Court of International Trade found the tariffs unlawful in a case brought by small businesses, arguing that Trump's actions were an "unprecedented power grab." The court determined that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president the right to issue "across-the-board worldwide tariffs." This ruling marks the first time a federal court has addressed the legality of Trump's tariffs, potentially reshaping future trade policy. Optimism score is based on the check and balance system of the government. </p>

          <p>Demand for credit default swaps (CDS), which act as insurance for investors against potential U.S. government debt default, is increasing amid unresolved debt ceiling concerns. Spreads on U.S. 1-year CDS have risen sharply, reflecting investor nervousness about the government's ability to meet its obligations. While some analysts attribute the surge to political risk rather than actual insolvency fears, the unresolved debt ceiling and potential economic calamity are driving demand for CDS contracts. Congress has until late July to raise the debt ceiling to avoid a technical default, similar to the crisis in 2023. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department, under Secretary Marco Rubio, plans to "aggressively" revoke visas of Chinese students with connections to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) or studying in critical fields. This action aims to counter potential espionage and protect national security, revising visa criteria for future applicants from China and Hong Kong. House Republicans introduced the Stop CCP VISAs Act to address concerns over Chinese nationals gathering intelligence for the CCP. Senator Ashley Moody criticized providing visas to Chinese nationals, emphasizing the need to protect U.S. national security. This policy shift reflects growing concerns about CCP influence and espionage activities within U.S. academic institutions.</p>

He also testified that Ventura confided in him about not wanting to participate in these parties. The testimony came as news emerged that Ventura recently gave birth to her third child with her husband, fitness instructor Alex Fine, after testifying while visibly pregnant earlier in the trial.

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed displeasure with U.S. chip controls that have effectively closed the $50 billion China market to the company. Huang stated that Nvidia is taking a multibillion-dollar writeoff on inventory that cannot be sold or repurposed due to the restrictions. Despite reporting strong quarterly results, Huang emphasized the significant revenue loss due to the inability to sell previously approved H20 processors to China. The Trump administration's decision to require an export license for the H20 processor has cut off sales with "no grace period," raising concerns about national security and Nvidia's competitive position in the global market.</p>

          <p>The UK government has lifted a key planning restriction requiring heat pumps to be one meter from a neighbor's property, aiming to accelerate the adoption of low-carbon heating technology. This change, part of the Warm Homes Plan, could make it easier for millions of homes in England to install heat pumps. However, consumer groups caution that the high upfront costs remain a significant barrier, particularly for older housing stock needing additional upgrades. The relaxation of rules also includes easing restrictions on the size and number of heat pumps households can install, primarily benefiting those in terraced housing.</p>

Critics argue that Badenoch's strategy of policy reviews has left the party without a clear message, allowing Reform UK to gain ground. Redundancies at Conservative Party headquarters and complaints about a lack of advisors further compound the challenges facing Badenoch's leadership.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's FEMA has denied North Carolina's request for 100% federal cost-sharing for Hurricane Helene cleanup, reversing a Biden administration policy. This decision will cost state residents "hundreds of millions of dollars," according to Governor Josh Stein. The denial comes as the Department of Homeland Security considers eliminating or downsizing FEMA, with Secretary Kristi Noem criticizing the agency's performance. The debate over funding coincides with predictions of above-average hurricane activity on the Atlantic coast this year, raising concerns about disaster preparedness and response.</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported a 69% jump in revenue to $44.1 billion, driven by strong demand for AI chips, despite U.S. restrictions on sales to China. The company's net income rose 26% to $18.78 billion, exceeding Wall Street's sales expectations, although profit predictions fell short. The Trump administration's chip restrictions are projected to cost Nvidia $4.5 billion, but the company is expanding sales of its newest AI chip, Blackwell. CEO Jensen Huang emphasized the importance of AI for national competitiveness, while also criticizing U.S. restrictions on chip sales to China. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump defended his trade policies against criticism that he often "chickens out" on tariff threats, a concept dubbed the "TACO trade." Trump argued that his tariff threats have jumpstarted trade talks and helped the U.S. gain ground in negotiations. He pointed to the European Union as an example, where a 50% tariff threat led to renewed discussions. Trump dismissed the idea that he has backed down, asserting that his actions are part of a negotiation strategy aimed at securing better trade deals for the United States. </p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge, Richard Leon, struck down President Trump's executive order targeting law firms, deeming it "unconstitutional." Leon's 73-page opinion notably employed numerous exclamation points, mirroring Trump's own style. The judge described the administration's arguments as "absurd!" and emphasized the order's punitive nature towards those taking on causes disfavored by Trump. The ruling favored the law firm WilmerHale, which had been targeted for hiring former special counsel Robert Mueller, marking the third time a federal judge found Trump's attacks on law firms unconstitutional. </p>
