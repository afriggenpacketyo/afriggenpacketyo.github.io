            <p>U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer stated that there are currently no scheduled talks between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping amidst an escalating trade war. Greer emphasized that the issue is at the leaders' level, but China chose to retaliate, leading to the current situation. He also noted China has been selling off treasuries for some time, and the U.S. must be prepared for a resilient economy. The administration is shifting its approach from reciprocal tariffs to national security tariffs, particularly for semiconductors, and will be deliberate about reshoring the semiconductor supply chain.

            <p>Former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown accused President Trump of weaponizing the global trading system with steep import tariffs. Brown called for a global rescue plan, including synchronized interest rate cuts, to cushion the blow from tariffs and prevent a 1930s-style depression. He urged finance ministers and central bankers to discuss shoring up the global economy at the IMF and World Bank meetings. Brown also emphasized the need for the UK to find partners other than the US to rebuild the world order.</p>
