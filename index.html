          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington to discuss bilateral relations and pressing international issues. The meeting, set for Thursday, marks the first in-person encounter between the two leaders since Merz assumed office on May 6. Discussions will encompass Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine, the complex situation in the Middle East, and trade policies that have caused friction between the European Union and the United States. This meeting underscores Germany's interest in de-escalating trade tensions, especially considering Trump's previous threats to impose tariffs on goods imported from the EU. Optimism is tempered by the complexity of the issues at hand.</p>

          <p>British cyclist Simon Yates delivered an exceptional performance in the penultimate stage of the Giro d'Italia, snatching the pink jersey from Isaac del Toro and effectively securing his second Grand Tour title. Yates's attack on the Colle delle Finestre allowed him to overcome a deficit of one minute and 21 seconds, leaving Del Toro and Richard Carapaz behind. His Visma-Lease A Bike team executed a masterstroke, with teammate Wout van Aert aiding Yates in building a significant lead over the final 20km. Yates's victory marks him as only the third British rider to win the Giro, joining Chris Froome and Tao Geoghegan Hart, and he was overcome with emotion at the finish line as he hugged team staff.</p>

          <p>Hamas has responded to the U.S.-led proposal for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza, seeking amendments to ensure a permanent ceasefire, complete Israeli withdrawal, and unimpeded humanitarian aid. The response includes notes on U.S. guarantees, the timing of hostage release, aid delivery, and Israeli forces' withdrawal. Meanwhile, the U.N. Food Program reports that 77 trucks carrying aid were stopped and looted by hungry Palestinians due to severe shortages caused by a nearly three-month Israeli blockade.

Israel has restricted the number of aid trucks, leading to repeated looting incidents, and is promoting a controversial US-backed corporation called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, bypassing the UN system.

          <p>Federal health officials have altered their COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, no longer advising the vaccine for healthy children and pregnant women, leading to criticism from medical organizations. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services stated that the vaccine is not recommended for these groups, and the CDC offers "no guidance" for pregnant women, urging parents to consult healthcare providers for children. Some doctors argue there's no new evidence to support removing these recommendations, emphasizing the vaccine's safety and the risks of COVID-19 during pregnancy. The American Academy of Pediatrics criticized the change as confusing, while California's Department of Public Health continues to support vaccination for all individuals aged 6 months and older.</p>

          <p>The European Union has strongly criticized President Donald Trump's decision to double tariffs on steel imports to 50%, warning that it undermines efforts to reach a negotiated solution in the ongoing trade war. An EU spokesperson stated that the move adds uncertainty to the global economy and increases costs for consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. The EU is prepared to impose countermeasures, including in response to the latest U.S. tariff increase, and is finalizing consultations on expanded measures. The United Steelworkers union also criticized Trump's announcement, calling it a direct attack on Canadian industries and workers.</p>

          <p>Former First Lady Michelle Obama is facing backlash for stating that creating life is "the least" of what a woman's reproductive system does, during a podcast episode with her brother and OB/GYN Dr. Sharon Malone.

Pro-life activists have criticized her remarks, asserting that motherhood is a beautiful and powerful gift, while others have defended her comments as highlighting the broader scope of women's health beyond just reproduction.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist specializing in youth development, offers five straightforward rules for effective parenting in an age of overwhelming and contradictory advice. These rules emphasize trusting parental instincts over influencers, following cultural traditions over clickbait, and paying attention to individual children's interests over conforming to the crowd. She also advises focusing on enjoyment rather than obsessing over developmental milestones and being authentic rather than striving for perfection. By prioritizing love, attention, and genuine engagement, parents can create a supportive environment for their children's growth and well-being.</p>

          <p>Germany's radical right, exemplified by the AfD, often portrays itself as the defender of Christian values against Islam, yet religion may be more of a tool than a genuine conviction. The AfD exploits Christian traditions to appeal to a broader base, particularly in their attacks on immigration and Islam, despite not cultivating close ties with established churches. While devout Christians are rare within the AfD, the party leverages the perception of Christianity's special role in German history and culture. This instrumental relationship allows the AfD to capitalize on social uncertainties and anxieties, particularly surrounding issues of gender identity and cultural change.</p>

This action comes shortly after the discovery of five murdered musicians from the band Grupo Fugitivo, highlighting the dangers faced by musicians caught in cartel turf wars.

With 'Bad Sisters,' she felt a sense of ownership and belonging, despite the large team involved. She also discussed turning to writing due to a lack of acting roles, leading her to create parts for herself and other flawed women, a concept that was uncommon at the time.</p>

          <p>Israel has barred Arab foreign ministers from conducting a high-level visit to the West Bank, a trip planned ahead of a June conference backed by France and Saudi Arabia. The conference aims to urge the creation of a Palestinian state, but the denial of access underscores the ongoing tensions and obstacles to diplomatic efforts in the region. This action further complicates international efforts to foster dialogue and progress towards a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

          <p>An undocumented man, Ramon Morales-Reyes, accused of threatening to assassinate Donald Trump, may have been framed by someone he accused of a previous assault, according to news reports. Investigators are exploring whether the threatening letter was an attempt to prevent Morales-Reyes from testifying against his alleged attacker in a 2023 case. Despite the letter being signed with Morales-Reyes' name, local investigators found the handwriting did not match, and jailhouse calls revealed the alleged attacker discussing sending letters to ICE to have Morales-Reyes deported. This case highlights the potential for abuse within the immigration system and the vulnerability of undocumented individuals.</p>

None of the night sessions during the first eight days of this year's tournament featured a women's singles match, leading to accusations of female players not being considered "worthy" of the slot.

While some Black celebrities have shown support for Trump, critics argue that these pardons are a superficial gesture that ignores the systemic issues affecting Black Americans, such as unemployment, maternal mortality, and police brutality.</p>

This level is well above civilian use and close to weapons grade, making Iran the only non-nuclear-armed state producing uranium at this level. The IAEA cannot confirm if Iran's program remains peaceful, noting a production rate equivalent to roughly one nuclear weapon per month. Israel has accused Iran of being "totally determined" to acquire nuclear weapons, while Iran maintains its program is peaceful.
