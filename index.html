          <p>A police officer in Alvarado, Texas, was shot in the neck and subsequently released from the hospital after responding to a call about a suspicious person. The incident occurred late on the Fourth of July outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility. Authorities report that multiple armed suspects, some wearing body armor, opened fire after luring law enforcement with fireworks and vandalizing property. Eight individuals were taken into custody, and the Justice Department is closely monitoring the situation as an assault on federal property.</p>

          <p>Camp Mystic, a Christian girls' summer camp on the Guadalupe River, has become the site of a devastating flood disaster in Texas. The camp's director and several young campers are among the at least 59 people confirmed dead in Kerr County, with more campers and a counselor still missing. Heavy rains caused the river to rise with little warning, destroying cabins and personal belongings. The event highlights the human toll of the historic flooding, turning a place of joy into a scene of immense loss and grief.</p>

          <p>A fourth-round Wimbledon match between Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Sonay Kartal was disrupted when the electronic line-calling system failed to register an out ball. The chair umpire ordered the point replayed, a decision that frustrated Pavlyuchenkova, who argued a crucial game was "stolen" from her. Although she ultimately won the match, the incident has sparked debate about the reliability of the new automated system and the role of chair umpires in overriding technological errors. The All England Club attributed the malfunction to operator error.</p>

          <p>Acclaimed documentary filmmaker Ken Burns has described the proposed elimination of federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting as "shortsighted" and "misguided." In an interview, Burns defended PBS and NPR against White House claims of bias, arguing that public media is essential, especially for rural areas where it may be the only available signal. He stressed that he could not have made his historically significant films without the support and long-term timelines provided by the public broadcasting system, which he called a "good American institution."</p>

          <p>With a July 9 deadline looming, European Union leaders are scrambling to secure a trade deal with the U.S. to avoid potentially severe tariffs threatened by the Trump administration. The bloc is internally divided on strategy, with some leaders like Germany's Chancellor favoring a quick deal, while others like France's President Macron are wary of an imbalanced agreement. After months of tense negotiations, the EU is now aiming for a more modest "framework deal," acknowledging that a comprehensive agreement is unattainable before the deadline.

          <p>An NPR producer in Gaza provides a harrowing first-person account of the life-threatening journey to obtain food from a U.S.-supported distribution site. The report details facing Israeli military fire, armed private contractors, and violent crowds to secure basic rations amid widespread hunger. The journalist describes the system, which has replaced U.N. aid channels, as a "death trap" where hundreds have been killed or wounded. This personal narrative vividly illustrates the lawlessness and desperation fueled by the near-famine conditions in the Gaza Strip.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in Peru have discovered a 3,500-year-old city named Peñico, which is believed to have been a crucial trading hub connecting early Pacific coast communities with those in the Andes and the Amazon basin. The discovery is significant for understanding what happened to the Caral, the oldest known civilization in the Americas, after it was impacted by climate change. Researchers at the site, located about 200km north of Lima, unearthed 18 structures, including ceremonial temples and residential complexes, along with various artifacts, providing new insights into the region's ancient history.</p>
