          <p>The Trump administration has installed a "Presidential Walk of Fame" at the White House, featuring portraits of past presidents. However, instead of a portrait of Joe Biden, a photograph of an autopen signing his name was used. This move is seen as a symbolic gesture by President Trump to question the legitimacy and capacity of his predecessor, aligning with his ongoing, unsubstantiated claims about the 2020 election and Biden's fitness for office. The display is part of several aesthetic changes Trump has made to the White House since returning to office.</p>

          <p>Stocks of European medical technology companies fell after the United States announced a national security investigation into imports of medical devices. The probe, which could lead to new tariffs, has created uncertainty in the market, causing the pan-European Stoxx 600 index to dip. The decline in medtech contrasts with a positive performance in the retail sector, highlighted by a significant surge in H&M's shares following strong earnings.

While no casualties were reported, three vehicles were damaged, and the collapse prompted the evacuation of a nearby police station and other buildings. Officials believe the sinkhole was caused by construction work for an underground train station. Emergency crews are working to repair the damage, concerned that heavy seasonal rains could worsen the situation.</p>

          <p>Denmark's Defense Minister has characterized recent drone sightings over several Danish airports, including a military base in Aalborg, as a "hybrid attack." The incursions led to flight suspensions and have been described by the Prime Minister as the most serious attack on the nation's critical infrastructure to date. The incidents follow a similar event near Copenhagen's airport, which police attributed to a "capable actor." These events have heightened security concerns across the country as investigations continue into the origin and purpose of the drones.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British government is exploring options to provide financial support to suppliers of Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) following a major cyber-attack that has halted the carmaker's production. The attack forced JLR to shut down its IT networks, and factories are not expected to resume operations until at least October, costing the company an estimated £50 million per week. There are growing fears that smaller suppliers, who rely heavily on JLR, could face bankruptcy without government intervention. Potential support measures include government-backed loans or purchasing component parts to maintain cash flow for the affected firms.</p>

An autopsy revealed the child suffered numerous severe injuries, including multiple skull fractures and broken bones. Milam's attorneys have appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing his conviction was based on discredited bite mark evidence and that he is intellectually disabled, but previous appeals have been denied.</p>

          <p>An Israeli missile strike in Doha has intensified discussions among Arab and Islamic nations about forming a collective security pact, sometimes referred to as an "Islamic NATO." The attack has reportedly shaken assumptions in Gulf states about the reliability of U.S. security guarantees, prompting calls for greater strategic autonomy. In response, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) activated a joint defense clause, and Saudi Arabia announced a mutual defense agreement with Pakistan. While a formal NATO-style alliance is considered unlikely, experts suggest a more informal "6+2" security arrangement involving the GCC, Turkey, and Egypt could emerge to create a message of deterrence.</p>

          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has strongly condemned recent U.S. airstrikes on boats in the Caribbean suspected of drug trafficking, calling them an "act of tyranny" and "murder." The strikes, authorized by the Trump administration to combat the flow of fentanyl, have reportedly killed 17 people. President Petro questioned the necessity of lethal force, arguing that the vessels could be intercepted and the crews arrested without fatalities, as has been done in past collaborative efforts. The U.S. actions have also drawn criticism from legal experts and UN officials over potential violations of international law.</p>

          <p>A White House memo has revealed a plan to use a potential government shutdown as an opportunity to permanently eliminate some federal positions through a "reduction in force." This marks a significant departure from past shutdowns, where employees were temporarily furloughed. The Office of Management and Budget memo states the administration could issue layoff notices to workers in programs not aligned with the president's priorities. The move is seen as a tactic to pressure Democrats into passing a Republican-backed funding bill and has been condemned by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer as an "attempt at intimidation."</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has claimed he was the victim of "triple sabotage" during his visit to the United Nations General Assembly and has demanded an official investigation. He cited three incidents: an escalator he was on stopping abruptly, a teleprompter malfunctioning during his speech, and a faulty audio system in the main auditorium. In a social media post, Trump called the events "sinister" and not a coincidence. UN officials have offered explanations, suggesting a videographer may have accidentally stopped the escalator and that the teleprompter was operated by the U.S. delegation.</p>

The ruling is a victory for 20 states that sued the administration, arguing that critical emergency preparedness funding was being illegally withheld to punish so-called "sanctuary" jurisdictions. The judge found the policy to be "arbitrary and capricious and unconstitutional," stating that the potential loss of disaster funds would cause irreparable harm.

The farm's owners have been fighting the order in court, a battle that has drawn international attention and led to their brief arrest for obstructing officials.
