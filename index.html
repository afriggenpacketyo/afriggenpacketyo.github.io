        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>HSBC reported a second-quarter pre-tax profit of $6.3 billion, a 29% year-over-year drop that missed analyst expectations. The shortfall was attributed to impairment charges from a Chinese bank and lost income from divested businesses. Despite the profit plunge and a 10% rise in operating expenses, the bank announced a new $3 billion share buyback program. CEO Georges Elhedery highlighted global economic challenges, including trade tariffs, that are creating market uncertainty and could impact future profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy stated that the government's new willingness to recognize a Palestinian state is intended to influence the situation in Gaza and encourage a ceasefire. The policy shift, announced by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, makes recognition contingent on Israel's failure to agree to a ceasefire and take steps to end the war. The move has been praised by some as a historic step towards a two-state solution but criticized by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as rewarding terrorism and by UK opposition parties for various reasons.</p>

        </div>

          <p>Swiss banking giant UBS announced a second-quarter net profit of $2.395 billion, more than double the figure from the same period last year and significantly beating analyst forecasts. The strong performance was driven by a 25% revenue increase in its investment bank's global markets unit, fueled by market volatility, and a 12% rise in transaction-based income in its wealth management division. Despite the positive results, the bank faces ongoing challenges, including a dispute with Swiss regulators over proposed new capital requirements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a massive earthquake off the coast of Russia, residents along the U.S. West Coast and Hawaii reacted to tsunami alerts with a mixture of caution, nonchalance, and curiosity. In Southern California, where only small waves were expected, many beachgoers were undeterred, while others reflected on their lack of emergency preparedness. In Crescent City, a Northern California town familiar with tsunamis, the atmosphere was relaxed, with patrons at a local brewery waiting for sirens before taking action. The varied responses highlight a public accustomed to such alerts, balancing awareness with a degree of skepticism.</p>

It explains that the Footsie is dominated by multinational corporations that earn the vast majority of their revenue overseas, such as in mining, energy, and defense. The index's international focus means its performance is more influenced by global factors and currency fluctuations than by the state of corporate Britain itself. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake near Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has generated a tsunami, prompting warnings and advisories for coastal areas across the Pacific, including Japan, Hawaii, and the entire U.S. West Coast. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center predicted waves of 3 to 10 feet in some regions, leading to evacuations in Russia and sirens sounding in Honolulu. The quake, the strongest globally since 2011, caused power outages and structural damage near its epicenter.

Johnson described the shutdowns as a significant symbolic victory for the pro-life movement, arguing it demonstrates the financial unsustainability of these clinics without abortion revenue. Planned Parenthood cited rising costs and staffing shortages for the closures, which come after Texas enacted a near-total ban on abortion. Johnson believes the closures are demoralizing for the pro-choice movement and prove that abortion was the primary revenue source for these facilities.</p>

The 436-million-year-old brachiopod fossils, found in Guizhou province, were arranged in a distinct checkerboard-like pattern on the former sea floor. Researchers believe the creatures, known as Nucleospira calypta, used hundreds of thin, bristle-like structures called setae to sense their neighbors and maintain optimal spacing.

The decision marks a significant break with US policy and signals Israel's growing diplomatic isolation among key Western allies. Foreign Secretary David Lammy framed the move as correcting a 'historical injustice' dating back to the 1917 Balfour Declaration, which made conflicting promises to Jewish and Arab communities.</p>

The deal, which runs until the end of July 2030, was announced in a filing with the Korea Exchange. While the customer's identity is officially confidential, reports have indicated that the counterparty is American electric-vehicle maker Tesla. The contract value is larger than the company's entire revenue for the second quarter of this year, marking a significant business win as LG Energy Solution continues to expand its manufacturing presence in the United States.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams safety and team captain Quentin Lake is entering the final year of his rookie contract with his long-term future with the team uncertain. While the Rams are in negotiations for an extension with running back Kyren Williams, another key player in the same situation, Lake will likely have to play out the season to determine his fate. The article notes that the Rams have not historically signed safeties they drafted to second contracts. Lake, a versatile and reliable part of the defense, remains focused on his on-field performance, believing that making plays will ultimately secure his future.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is set to issue an executive order that will weaken a state housing law, SB 9, in areas at high risk of wildfire. The order will allow local governments, including Los Angeles and Malibu, to restrict the development of duplexes and fourplexes in neighborhoods recently affected by fires, such as Pacific Palisades. The decision follows pressure from local officials who raised concerns that increased density under SB 9 could dangerously strain evacuation routes during future wildfires. They argued the law was not intended to be used to rapidly rebuild and densify areas with such high fire risk.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to revoke its 2009 'endangerment finding,' the scientific basis that classifies greenhouse gases as a threat to public health and allows for their regulation under the Clean Air Act.

The decision directly challenges the scientific consensus on climate change and reverses a policy that has underpinned climate regulations for 16 years.

          <p>Singapore's central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), has kept its monetary policy unchanged but warned that economic growth is expected to slow in the latter half of 2025. The MAS cited significant uncertainty, particularly from potential changes in global trade tariffs under the Trump administration, which could impact the nation's export-driven economy. Despite strong GDP growth in the first half of the year, the central bank noted that its current policy stance is appropriate to respond to future risks to price stability. Singapore manages its policy by adjusting the exchange rate band for its dollar rather than interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

In response, a Chinese spokesperson accused Japan, the US, and other Western nations of using 'defense' as a pretext to expand military cooperation and deploy space weapons. The exchange comes as the US and Japan have been increasing their collaboration on space-based surveillance and intelligence, including the establishment of a US space command in Japan.</p>

The RBA has already cut rates twice this year but held them steady at its last meeting to await more data. With inflation easing and GDP growth coming in softer than expected, analysts believe the new data provides sufficient evidence for the RBA to proceed with another rate reduction at its upcoming August meeting.

The baboons' bodies were then fed to the zoo's predators. Animal rights groups have filed a criminal complaint, calling the decision 'avoidable and illegal' and blaming the zoo for irresponsible breeding policies.
