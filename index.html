          <p>Detective Devin Rigo of the Hillsboro Police Department urgently pursued a maroon minivan, believed to be the crucial crime scene in the murder of 56-year-old Kenneth Fandrich, to a Portland scrapyard. Fandrich was found dead at an Intel campus, with surveillance footage showing a masked assailant dragging him into the van before staging his body. The investigation connected the vehicle to Dr. Steven Milner, Fandrich's wife's former lover, who had a history of stalking the victim. Despite Rigo's desperate race, the primary piece of forensic evidence was tragically crushed, complicating the prosecution's case against Milner.</p>

          <p>Since its £305 million Saudi-led takeover in 2021, Newcastle United has undergone a significant transformation, modernizing its training facilities and dramatically improving team performance under coach Eddie Howe. Despite being dubbed the "richest club," its growth has been strategically gradual, influenced by Premier League Profit and Sustainability Rules. Newcastle notably ended a 70-year trophy drought by winning the Carabao Cup and qualified for the Champions League twice in three seasons, seeing revenue soar. However, the club continues to face criticism from human rights campaigners who argue the ownership uses football to "sportswash" Saudi Arabia's human rights record, adding a complex ethical dimension to its success.</p>

          <p>China is implementing a novel digital strategy in Africa, utilizing social media influencers to cultivate its brand image among younger generations, including Gen Z and Millennials. This initiative involves the Chinese embassy in Kenya sponsoring influencers for tours of China, allowing them to showcase the country's diverse culture, striking scenery, and rich history firsthand. Experts interpret this as a notable evolution in Beijing's soft power diplomacy, moving beyond traditional state-led approaches to engage directly with new audiences. The objective is to foster deeper cultural exchange and tourism, presenting a more nuanced portrayal of China than often conveyed by conventional media.</p>

          <p>In his new memoir "Truly," music legend Lionel Richie disclosed that he almost pursued a career in the Episcopal priesthood, having been a "disastrously shy altar boy" and undergoing training.

An encouraging shout from an audience member, "Sing it, baby!", served as a profound affirmation, convincing him to fully commit to a musical career. This unexpected recognition prompted him to abandon his priestly vocation, ultimately leading him to discover his talents as a songwriter and singer, thus shaping his iconic legacy in music.</p>

          <p>Despite a recent surge in electric vehicle (EV) sales, the US is significantly lagging behind other major markets like China and Europe in EV adoption. This disparity is attributed to comparatively weaker government support, which limits subsidies and trade-in programs seen elsewhere. While former President Biden pushed for increased EV adoption, President Trump advocates for market-driven choices and has rescinded some incentives, including a $7,500 tax credit. High tariffs on Chinese-made cars also limit affordable options, creating challenges for US carmakers who are already scaling back investments amidst policy uncertainties.</p>

          <p>China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) has vehemently condemned the production and sale of toys depicting Japan's notorious Unit 731, which was responsible for horrific biological warfare atrocities during World War II. The PLA's social media account, Junzhengping, criticized merchants for "promoting a distorted version of history" and transforming "bloody atrocities into assemblage 'laboratories'." This strong public outcry led to the swift removal of several building block sets from Chinese e-commerce platforms. The article emphasizes that such historical injustices inflict a profound wound on the nation and permit no room for ambiguity or opportunistic exploitation.</p>

          <h2>Fiji Faces Surging HIV Epidemic Driven by Drug Use and Unsafe Practices</h2>

          <p>Fiji is experiencing one of the world's fastest-growing HIV epidemics, with cases soaring elevenfold to approximately 5,900 by 2024, prompting a national emergency declaration. The surge is primarily linked to intravenous drug use, unsafe sex, needle sharing, and "bluetoothing"—a practice of sharing blood after injection. Many new cases are among young people, with the youngest recorded at age ten. Challenges include a drastic shortage of needle-syringe programs and widespread meth use. Experts warn of an impending "avalanche" of cases, stressing Fiji's limited resources to combat this escalating health crisis.</p>
