          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that President Trump can terminate the protected status of approximately 500,000 immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela while an appeal of the president's order is pending. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, arguing that the majority undervalued the devastating consequences of upending the lives of nearly half a million noncitizens while their legal claims are still being considered. This decision follows a previous ruling allowing the Trump administration to revoke the status of nearly 350,000 Venezuelan immigrants under the Temporary Status Program. The ruling allows the government to inflict maximum predecision damage according to Jackson's dissent.</p>

Despite the extreme conditions, including flying through thick clouds and ice forming on his face and equipment, Peng managed to survive the ordeal.

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly renewing its efforts to "decouple" the U.S. economy from China through measures such as initiating a trade war, implementing export controls, and revoking student visas. This push aims to sever economic ties between the two countries and reduce reliance on Chinese goods and technology. The administration's actions signal a more confrontational approach to U.S.-China relations, potentially impacting various sectors and industries. These policies are being enacted despite concerns about the potential economic consequences for both nations.</p>

This data suggests that inflationary pressures may be easing, but the Federal Reserve has chosen to hold interest rate cuts on hold until there is more clarity regarding President Trump’s economic policies. The Fed's decision reflects uncertainty about the future direction of fiscal policy and its potential impact on inflation. The central bank is carefully monitoring economic indicators before making any adjustments to monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion piece explores the reasons why millennials are increasingly hesitant to have children, with the U.S. fertility rate falling to a record low. Factors such as financial concerns, career priorities, climate change anxieties, and the overturning of Roe v. Wade are cited as potential explanations. The author suggests that a new, nearly impossible standard for parenting, driven by redefined notions of harm and trauma, also contributes to this trend. Adult children are more likely to cut off contact with parents, expecting them to be accountable for their mental health and career success.</p>

          <p>President Trump responded angrily to a question about the viral "TACO trade" meme, which stands for "Trump always chickens out," a jab at his trade policies. The phrase mocks Trump's back-and-forth on tariff policies, suggesting he repeatedly delays or backs off from initial demands. Investors engage in "TACO trade" by buying stocks after Trump announces new tariffs and then profiting when the markets rebound as he delays or retracts them. Trump defended his decision to slash tariffs on China and push back deadlines for tariffs on European Union countries, calling the question "nasty."</p>

          <h2>Republican Student Loan Plan Sparks Controversy Over Extended Repayment Terms</h2>

          <p>A higher education expert warns that the House Republicans' plan for student loans, which includes a 30-year repayment timeline, could lead to "indentured servitude" for borrowers. The proposed changes, part of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," would limit repayment options to a 10- to 25-year fixed payment plan or an income-driven repayment plan with loan forgiveness after three decades. Critics argue that such extended repayment terms would keep borrowers in debt for an unacceptably long period. Proponents claim the plan ensures borrowers eventually pay off their balances in full.</p>
