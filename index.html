        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Co-op has revealed that a significant cyber-attack earlier this year resulted in at least £206 million in lost revenue. The security breach, which occurred in April, caused severe disruptions including payment system failures, product shortages, and the theft of data from all 6.5 million members. The retailer reported an overall underlying pre-tax loss of £75 million for the first half of the year, citing the attack as a major contributing factor alongside rising costs. The full financial impact may be even greater as the company anticipates further consequences in the second half of the year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, has stated that Labour MPs have been privately encouraging him to challenge Sir Keir Starmer for the party's leadership. In an interview, Burnham, who is not currently a Member of Parliament, did not rule out a future leadership bid, creating political waves ahead of the Labour Party's autumn conference. While some party figures dismissed the comments as unhelpful, Burnham's statements are widely seen as a potential pitch for a leadership run. To do so, he would first need to resign as mayor and win a seat in a Westminster by-election, presenting a significant logistical and political challenge.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Ragasa, previously a super typhoon, has caused significant death and destruction across the Philippines, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and southern China, with the death toll reaching at least 25 people. The storm triggered a deadly lake burst in Taiwan and led to widespread flooding, power outages, and the evacuation of nearly 2 million residents in China's Guangdong province. Although weakened, the storm is now moving towards Vietnam, where authorities are preparing for its impact. Clean-up and recovery efforts are underway in the affected regions as another storm system approaches the Philippines.</p>

          <p>A woman whose body was discovered in Spain over 20 years ago has been identified as 31-year-old Russian citizen Liudmila Zavada. The breakthrough came through 'Operation Identify Me,' an Interpol-led campaign that publicly shares information on unidentified female murder victims in Europe. Ms. Zavada's body was found in July 2005 near Barcelona, and her death was considered suspicious, but her identity remained a mystery. Turkish police matched her fingerprints to a national database earlier this year, leading to a DNA confirmation with a relative in Russia. She is the third person identified by the initiative, which aims to solve dozens of similar cold cases across the continent.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Democratic Party is failing to capitalize on a political opportunity due to the prominence of its far-left wing, exemplified by figures like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. The author contends that their focus on issues like Palestinian rights and defunding the police alienates mainstream American voters. The article highlights Mamdani's past socialist rhetoric and Ocasio-Cortez's refusal to honor the late Charlie Kirk as examples of a political philosophy that is out of step with the broader electorate. The piece suggests that Republicans would welcome the chance to frame the entire Democratic party by the actions and beliefs of these progressive leaders.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are set for a mixed opening as investors cautiously await the latest U.S. weekly jobs data, which could influence the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently indicated that a cooling labor market was a key factor in the central bank's decision to cut rates. In Europe, investor focus is on consumer confidence reports from France and Germany, where data suggests a halt in the downward trend but remains at a very low level due to geopolitical and economic uncertainties. Additionally, the Swiss National Bank's latest monetary policy update is being closely watched, particularly after the U.S. imposed a surprise 39% tariff on Swiss goods.</p>

          <p>The UK government is exploring options to provide financial support to Jaguar Land Rover's suppliers after a cyber-attack forced the carmaker to halt production. The attack has shut down JLR's factories until at least October, raising fears that smaller firms in its supply chain could face bankruptcy. Among the ideas being considered are government-backed loans or a plan for the government to purchase and stockpile component parts to maintain cash flow for suppliers. The disruption is reportedly costing JLR at least £50 million per week and has affected its global operations, highlighting the growing threat of cyber-attacks on major UK businesses.</p>

Despite impressing in training with his calm presence and strong fundamentals, head coach Ruben Amorim has opted to start the incumbent Altay Bayindir, citing Lammens' need to adapt to a new league and country. However, Bayindir's recent performances and statistics have been subpar, leading many to believe it is only a matter of time before Lammens is given his chance. The club's early exit from the EFL Cup has removed a potential 'soft landing' for his first appearance, meaning his debut will likely come under the high pressure of a Premier League match.</p>

After a quiet first season, Slot repurposed Gravenberch as a holding midfielder, a role in which he excelled, before granting him more attacking freedom this season to great effect. The Dutch player has been a standout performer, scoring two goals in four league games after scoring none last season, and demonstrating superior defensive and creative statistics. This resurgence has vindicated the faith shown by Slot and has positioned Gravenberch as a key player for both Liverpool and the Netherlands national team.</p>

However, experts suggest a formal NATO-style alliance is unrealistic, as nations are hesitant to be drawn into conflicts not vital to their own interests.

          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has strongly condemned recent U.S. airstrikes on suspected drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean, labeling them an "act of tyranny" and calling for potential criminal proceedings if Colombians were killed. The Trump administration has defended the strikes, which have reportedly killed 17 people, as necessary to combat the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. However, President Petro questioned the use of lethal force, stating that a simple arrest would suffice and that such actions amount to murder. The strikes have raised concerns among legal experts and U.S. lawmakers about potential violations of international human rights law.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has claimed he was the victim of a "triple sabotage" during his visit to the United Nations, demanding an investigation into a series of technical malfunctions. In a social media post, Trump detailed how an escalator he was on came to a sudden halt, his teleprompter failed during his speech to the General Assembly, and the sound system in the auditorium was apparently off. He asserted that these events were not a coincidence and called for those responsible to be arrested. A UN official suggested the escalator's safety mechanism may have been inadvertently triggered and noted the teleprompter was operated by the U.S. delegation.</p>

Mainland China's CSI 300 also advanced, while markets in South Korea and Australia posted modest gains.

          <p>The White House has indicated that if a government shutdown occurs on October 1, it may seek to permanently eliminate some federal positions rather than just temporarily furloughing employees. In a memo from the Office of Management and Budget, agency heads were instructed that a funding lapse would be an opportunity to issue "reduction in force" notices to workers in programs not aligned with the president's priorities. This marks a significant departure from past shutdowns and is seen by critics, like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, as an intimidation tactic. The threat escalates the high-stakes budget negotiations between the White House and congressional Democrats.</p>

          <p>According to reports, former FBI Director James Comey is expected to be indicted on criminal charges in the coming days in a Virginia federal court. The specific charges are unclear but are believed to be related to accusations that he lied to Congress in 2020 about authorizing a leak of information during the 2016 presidential campaign. This development follows President Trump's recent public pressure for action against Comey and the replacement of the interim U.S. Attorney in the district with a lawyer who has previously represented Trump.

The investigations cover items from surgical masks and syringes to pacemakers and wheelchairs, reflecting concerns about U.S. reliance on foreign supply chains.

The ruling is a victory for 20 states that sued the administration, arguing that their critical disaster response funding was being held hostage to enforce the president's immigration agenda. U.S. District Judge William Smith found the policy to be "both arbitrary and capricious and unconstitutional," stating that the potential loss of these funds would cause irreparable harm to public safety.

A new study reveals that Africa imported over 9,500 megawatts worth of Chinese solar panels in the first seven months of the year, a substantial increase from the previous year. This surge is driven by falling technology costs and the development of large-scale energy plants by Chinese firms, particularly in countries like South Africa, Algeria, and Nigeria. Given China's dominance in global solar panel production, these import figures serve as a strong indicator of Africa's rapidly growing solar power infrastructure.</p>
