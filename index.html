          <p>A federal judge is set to sentence music mogul Sean 'Diddy' Combs following his conviction on two counts of transportation for prostitution. Prosecutors are advocating for a prison term of at least 11 years, citing a history of violent behavior, while his defense team has requested a 14-month sentence, arguing he is a reformed individual. Combs was acquitted of more serious charges, including racketeering and sex trafficking, after a lengthy trial. The sentencing will hear from both Combs and one of his accusers, with the judge's decision concluding a high-profile case that has kept Combs in a federal detention center for the past year.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood expressed disappointment that pro-Palestinian demonstrations proceeded after a terrorist attack killed two men outside a Manchester synagogue. She described the continuation of such protests as feeling "un-British" and urged demonstrators to reconsider future marches, highlighting the strain on police resources. The comments came after clashes in London led to 40 arrests, including assaults on police officers. The UK's Chief Rabbi also condemned the demonstrations, suggesting a link between the rhetoric on the streets and the violent attack, and called for the government to take a stronger stance on managing the protests.</p>

          <p>The individual identified as the Manchester synagogue attacker is Jihad Al-Shamie, a 35-year-old British citizen of Syrian descent who was not previously on the radar of counter-terrorism authorities. Neighbors described him as a quiet weightlifting enthusiast who kept to himself, alternating between Western and traditional Syrian clothing. Al-Shamie reportedly entered the UK as a child and was granted citizenship in 2006. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood noted her surprise at his first name, stating she had never encountered a Muslim named Jihad, which translates to "struggle." Authorities are continuing to investigate his background and potential motives for the deadly attack.</p>

          <p>The Church of England has historically appointed Sarah Mullally as the next Archbishop of Canterbury, making her the first woman to hold the principal leadership role in the church's history. Currently serving as the Bishop of London, Mullally will succeed Justin Welby, who resigned following findings that he failed to act on reports of abuse by a volunteer at Christian summer camps. Her appointment marks a significant milestone for the Church of England, which is the mother church of the global Anglican Communion, representing over 85 million members worldwide.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is commencing its new term with a docket featuring contentious social issues, including bans on "conversion therapy" for minors and state laws restricting transgender athletes. The court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, will also review several policies from the Trump administration, such as sweeping reciprocal tariffs and the president's authority to fire officials at independent agencies without cause. These cases will test the boundaries of executive power and could reshape federal regulations. Legal experts anticipate the term will be defined by the court's confrontation with expansive assertions of presidential authority across a range of economic and social matters.

          <p>The son of detained Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi, Kim Aris, has publicly appealed to Chinese President Xi Jinping to help secure his mother's release from prison. Aris, who typically avoids the media, has stepped forward due to growing concerns over his mother's deteriorating health and poor conditions in detention following the 2021 military coup. He is urging China to exert pressure on the military junta to free his mother and other political prisoners. This plea highlights the dire situation of the Nobel laureate, who has been largely isolated from the outside world since the military seized power in Myanmar.</p>

However, some lawmakers, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, have raised concerns that these digital tags could enable "dynamic pricing," where costs for essential goods might surge during peak demand.

Blair, who was instrumental in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland, would serve on a "Board of Peace" chaired by Trump. However, Blair's involvement is controversial due to his role in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, a decision for which he later apologized.

To preserve coverage of high school sports and the state legislature, the network has drastically reduced its local journalism, laying off seven of its eleven journalists.

          <h2>USMNT Coach Pochettino Explains Philosophy of Not Justifying Roster Decisions to Players</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mauricio Pochettino, manager of the U.S. Men's National Team, has defended his practice of not explaining to players why they were left off the roster for international duty. He argues that players should inherently understand their performance and that providing justifications is unnecessary. This philosophy was highlighted as he announced the squad for upcoming friendlies, which saw the return of players like Weston McKennie and Cameron Carter-Vickers while omitting others like Yunus Musah. Pochettino emphasized his goal is to change the team's culture, ensuring no player feels entitled to a spot and that selection is earned through consistent club performance and commitment to the team's principles.</p>

          <p>The 2025 WNBA Finals will feature a compelling matchup between the Las Vegas Aces, led by four-time MVP A'ja Wilson, and the defensively strong Phoenix Mercury. The Aces reached the finals by rediscovering their defensive identity late in the season and relying on the stellar play of Wilson and Chelsea Gray. The Mercury, a rebuilt team featuring veterans Alyssa Thomas and Satou Sabally, have excelled with tough defense and a resilient mindset. While most writers predict the Aces will win the series in six games due to their championship experience and star power, the Mercury's grit and defensive prowess are expected to make it a highly competitive series.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Americans are experiencing long-term unemployment as the nation's job market slows down, with 1.9 million people jobless for over six months. This represents the highest level since 2021, and the share of long-term unemployed has risen to 26%. Economists attribute this trend to a "low-hire, low-fire" environment where fewer new positions are being created, making it difficult for job seekers to re-enter the workforce. Many individuals report sending out hundreds of applications with little to no response, forcing them to deplete savings and retirement funds while facing financial hardship. The situation poses risks to both individual households and the broader U.S. economy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federally funded community health centers, which serve nearly 34 million low-income patients across the U.S., are facing a severe financial crisis as the government shutdown cuts off critical grant money. The lapse in funding is compounded by anticipated cuts to Medicaid, which accounts for 43% of their revenue, threatening their ability to provide essential services. Leaders of these health centers warn that without a long-term funding solution, they may be forced to reduce staff, cut services, or even close, potentially overwhelming hospital emergency rooms. The situation creates a precarious future for a vital part of the nation's healthcare safety net. (not investment advice)</p>

For voters in the state, there is a mix of frustration and confusion about which political party is responsible for the impasse.

While some residents and local leaders are wary of the deployment, many are exhausted by persistent violence and are open to the potential benefits, regardless of the political motivations. Local officials, including Democratic State Representative Antonio Parkinson, are focused on collaborating with the federal task force to ensure it serves the community's best interests. Despite protests from some who advocate for investment in social programs instead, the city is cautiously observing the rollout, hoping it will bring a lasting positive impact on public safety.</p>

The article contrasts the historic, slow beginnings of rail travel with China's rapid development of a vast and efficient network that has transformed domestic travel, cutting a 15-hour journey from Beijing to Xian down to just four hours. While railways in many parts of the world have been neglected in favor of air and sea transport, China's investment demonstrates the potential for rail to be a modern, charismatic, and effective mode of transportation, moving beyond its outdated image.</p>

          <p>Two remote islands in the Marshall Islands, Bikar Atoll and Jemo Islet, are experiencing a remarkable ecological recovery after a successful program to eradicate invasive rats. The rodents had decimated native seabird populations, sea turtles, and vegetation for decades. A year after conservationists used drones to distribute targeted bait, the islands are now rat-free, and wildlife is thriving, with a new colony of 2,000 sooty terns and thousands of native tree seedlings emerging. This successful restoration project, led by Island Conservation, demonstrates the profound and rapid positive impact that removing invasive species can have on fragile island ecosystems, offering a blueprint for similar efforts worldwide.</p>

The court ruled that Finland lacked the jurisdiction to prosecute the crew for the incident, which occurred in December of last year. Prosecutors had alleged the crew intentionally dragged the ship's anchor for 90 kilometers, severing five cables, an accusation the crew denied. The incident is one of several recent disruptions to undersea infrastructure in the region, raising concerns about potential sabotage, though this case was complicated by issues of international maritime law.</p>

This statement follows reports that the Trump administration is considering providing Ukraine with such weapons and the intelligence to target infrastructure deep inside Russia.
