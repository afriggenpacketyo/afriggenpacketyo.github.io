        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's inflation rate climbed to 3.8% in the year to July, its highest point since January 2024, significantly exceeding the Bank of England's 2% target. The Office for National Statistics identified surging airfare and food prices as the primary drivers, with air travel costs seeing their largest monthly jump since 2001. This unexpected increase complicates the Bank of England's decisions on interest rates, as it balances controlling inflation with stimulating a struggling economy. The figures have prompted concern from both the government and opposition about the rising cost of living for UK households. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has clarified that any US security guarantees for a potential peace deal in Ukraine would not involve deploying American ground troops, though he suggested air support might be considered. This statement tempers earlier promises that were seen by European allies as a significant step toward resolving the conflict. The article also covers other news, including a Republican lawsuit against California's redistricting plan and a protest by Microsoft employees over the company's software being used by the Israeli military in Gaza.

          <p>China has sent at least one ocean research vessel, the Xiang Yang Hong 10, to operate near Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea, a frequent point of contention with the Philippines. The deployment follows a recent collision in the disputed waters and coincides with patrols by a Philippine coastguard ship in the same area. Satellite tracking data shows both Chinese and Philippine vessels remained in close proximity near the shoal. This move underscores the ongoing tensions and strategic maneuvering by both nations over the contested maritime territory, which has become a primary flashpoint in their dispute.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a High Court ruling that granted a temporary injunction against housing asylum seekers at a hotel in Epping, Essex, other councils across England are considering similar legal challenges. The court sided with the local council's argument that the hotel's use constituted a planning law breach and a public safety risk, particularly after violent protests. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has encouraged all 12 of his party's councils to follow this precedent. The development creates a significant challenge for the Home Office, which currently houses over 30,000 asylum seekers in hotels and now faces pressure to find alternative accommodations more quickly.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive new analysis from UCLA's Williams Institute estimates that over 2.8 million people in the U.S., including 724,000 youth aged 13 to 17, identify as transgender. The study, which used federal and state health surveys, provides the largest-scale data of its kind and documents a significant trans youth population in every state. Researchers note that young adults are far more likely to identify as trans than older generations, possibly due to greater social acceptance. The authors warn that this may be the last such report for years, as the Trump administration is actively removing gender identity questions from key federal surveys.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece critiques Donald Trump's proposal to stage a UFC cage fight on the White House lawn to celebrate America's 250th anniversary. The author notes the surprising re-emergence of Ivanka Trump, who has reportedly been asked by her father to be "in the middle of this" event, in a public-facing role. The column speculates that her involvement could be a strategic move to broaden the appeal of UFC, a key part of the MAGA cultural landscape, to more women. However, the author concludes by questioning the appropriateness of such "circuses" when many Americans are struggling with the rising cost of living.</p>

          <p>The NWSL's Washington Spirit are experiencing a surge in popularity, potentially eclipsing their MLS counterparts, DC United, as the premier soccer team in the nation's capital. While the Spirit, under ambitious new ownership, are drawing energetic crowds and winning championships, DC United has been mired in a decade of poor performance, alienating longtime fans. The article highlights the starkly different trajectories of the two clubs, with the Spirit effectively connecting with the community and investing in talent. This shift in Washington, D.C. reflects a broader national trend of growing interest and investment in women's professional sports.</p>

          <p>In an open letter, a former CIA Director and career diplomat decries what he calls a "retribution campaign" and a "war on public service and expertise" under the current administration. Addressing recently fired government employees, he argues that the dismissals are not about genuine reform but about instilling fear and deterring public servants from speaking truth to power. He draws a parallel to McCarthyism, warning that hollowing out institutions and punishing dissent weakens the United States on the world stage. He expresses fear that this "strategic self-immolation" benefits adversaries like Russia and China and undermines American democracy.</p>

          <p>Seventy years after its controversial publication, Vladimir Nabokov's "Lolita" continues to be a subject of intense cultural debate, reflecting shifting societal values. Initially, many critics read the novel as an allegorical, albeit scandalous, love story, a view that shaped its pop culture image for decades. However, contemporary interpretations, particularly in the post-Me Too era, increasingly focus on it as a horror story about child sexual assault, with the narrator Humbert Humbert's beautiful prose seen as a deceptive trap. The article argues that the novel's enduring power lies in this ambiguity, allowing it to survive and provoke new conversations about art, morality, and abuse.</p>

          <p>Amid a severe heat wave in Southern California, a new report from the California Fast Food Workers Union alleges that many chain restaurants are failing to comply with the state's indoor heat safety regulations. The survey found that nearly half of workers experienced symptoms of heat illness in the past year, yet very few received required safety training. California's rules, effective since July 2024, mandate access to water, cooling areas, and breaks when temperatures exceed 82 degrees. The report suggests that enforcement of these protections is lacking, leaving workers in dangerously hot kitchen environments vulnerable to illness.</p>

Forty years after the original mockumentary, the band members express lingering saltiness about how they were portrayed by director Marty DiBergi, who they claim is now hiding the new film from them.

The piece suggests this "fighting fire with fire" approach could backfire by prompting more states to engage in mid-decade redistricting, ultimately harming Democrats more.

          <p>An opinion piece argues that converting downtown Los Angeles's empty office skyscrapers into "co-living" spaces presents a more financially feasible solution to the city's housing crisis than traditional apartment conversions. While converting offices to standard apartments is often cost-prohibitive without public subsidies, the co-living model, featuring small private rooms with shared kitchens and bathrooms, is significantly cheaper. This approach could create thousands of affordable units, costing around $1,000 per month, catering to students, young professionals, and lower-income residents.

While the hurricane is not projected to make landfall, its powerful swells are prompting warnings and swimming prohibitions at beaches from Florida to New England. North Carolina's Outer Banks are under a storm surge warning, with mandatory evacuations ordered for Hatteras and Ocracoke islands due to the risk of significant coastal flooding. The National Hurricane Center is urging extreme caution, as conditions are expected to be hazardous throughout the week.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has condemned a recent appeals court decision that issued a temporary restraining order on a land transfer required for the Resolution Copper mine in Arizona. In a social media post, Trump called the pushback from opponents, including the San Carlos Apache Tribe, "Anti-American," arguing the project is vital for the U.S. economy and job creation. The massive copper mine, a joint venture between mining giants Rio Tinto and BHP, has faced years of legal challenges over religious, cultural, and environmental concerns from the tribe. The company views the ruling as a temporary pause in a decades-long effort.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's 50% tariff on steel and aluminum imports is causing significant economic strain for India's export-focused steel foundries, particularly in the Kolkata region. Foundry owners report that new orders from the U.S. have slowed dramatically, forcing some to halt work and flooding the domestic market with surplus products, intensifying competition. The Federation of Indian Export Organizations estimates an 85% drop in U.S.-bound steel exports, threatening a sector that employs over 200,000 workers. The Indian government is considering countermeasures, including seeking a bilateral trade agreement and implementing safeguard duties to protect against Chinese dumping. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>S&P Global has affirmed its AA+ credit rating for long-term U.S. sovereign debt, stating that it expects "meaningful" revenue from President Trump's tariff policies to largely offset the fiscal impact of his recent tax-and-spending legislation. The ratings agency noted that the bill, which cuts both taxes and spending, is projected to increase the federal deficit significantly. However, S&P warned it could lower the rating in the future if deficits continue to rise due to political inability to contain spending, or if political developments weaken U.S. institutions and jeopardize the dollar's status as the world's primary reserve currency.

          <p>A group of Democratic senators and representatives is demanding more information from the Department of Homeland Security about a state-run immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz." In a formal letter, the lawmakers expressed concerns that this "novel" model, which uses state prisons for federal immigration detention, could violate federal law and reduce accountability for detainee conditions. The facility has been touted by the Trump administration as an efficient model for carrying out deportations. The lawmakers are questioning the legal authority for the facility and whether it meets federal standards for the treatment of detainees.</p>

          <p>Scientists in Belgrade, Serbia, are conducting experiments using mealworms to break down polystyrene, a common plastic used in packaging that takes over 500 years to decompose naturally. The research shows that bacteria in the mealworms' guts can digest the plastic, converting it into carbon dioxide and water without leaving microplastic residue. This project, supported by the government and the UNDP, builds on similar research globally and offers a potential biological solution to plastic waste. While still in its early stages, the method could provide an environmentally friendly alternative to incineration and help address Serbia's significant landfill problem.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report reveals that turnover among local election officials in the United States is at its highest rate in at least 25 years, with two in five officials who administered the 2020 election having left their jobs. This trend, which has accelerated since 2020, is attributed to increased pressure, harassment, and burnout fueled by misinformation and challenges to election integrity. Researchers from the Bipartisan Policy Center and UCLA note that the high turnover is a "canary in the coal mine" for deeper structural issues like chronic underfunding. Despite these challenges, the 2024 election was considered an administrative success, showing the resilience of the system.</p>
