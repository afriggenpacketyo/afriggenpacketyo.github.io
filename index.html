          <p>The UK's new "one in, one out" migrant returns deal with France is set to begin next week, with the first deportation flights expected. This pilot scheme, agreed upon by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and President Emmanuel Macron, involves returning asylum seekers to France who arrived via small boats. In exchange, the UK will accept an equal number of asylum seekers from France who meet security and eligibility criteria. Critics, including the Conservatives, have voiced concerns that the policy may prove unworkable and susceptible to abuse, as Channel crossings have increased significantly from the previous year.</p>

          <p>Veronica Swanson Beard and Veronica Miele Beard, sisters-in-law and co-founders of the luxury fashion label Veronica Beard, recount their journey from meeting at a wedding to building a successful brand. Their signature "Dickey Jacket," a tailored blazer with an interchangeable insert, was conceived to address a gap in modern women's wardrobes, inspired by 19th-century detachable shirtfronts. Despite juggling eight children between them in the early days, the brand gained traction with Saks Fifth Avenue and now boasts 42 stores worldwide. Beyond fashion, the duo is committed to philanthropy and aims to empower women through their designs and their "make it happen" mantra.</p>

Team members expressed disappointment, with Tony Harries stating, "We're here to win medals, we're GB, we're not here to just compete."

          <p>Nepal's leading political parties, including the Nepali Congress and CPN-UML, have collectively called for President Ram Chandra Poudel to reinstate the parliament, which he dissolved following deadly anti-corruption protests. They argue that the dissolution, made at the recommendation of interim Prime Minister Sushila Karki, was unconstitutional and against judicial precedents. The parties contend that demands from the "Gen Z" protest movement, which sparked the unrest, should be addressed through a democratically elected institution. Karki, the nation's first female interim leader, faces the immediate challenge of restoring law and order and rebuilding trust amidst deep political discontent.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued a call for all NATO countries to cease purchasing Russian oil and to impose substantial tariffs, ranging from 50% to 100%, on China for its continued oil imports from Russia. He asserts that these combined actions are crucial to ending the war in Ukraine. Trump criticized NATO's "less than 100%" commitment to victory, arguing that member states buying Russian oil weaken their negotiating leverage. He emphasized China's strong influence over Russia, believing that powerful tariffs would effectively "break that grip" and bring about an end to the conflict.</p>

The incident occurred because a fan intended to reverse negative pressure was not readily available, causing the smoke to be drawn inside. The incinerator, primarily used for animal carcasses, is occasionally utilized by local law enforcement and FBI agents for drug disposal, a practice unknown to shelter staff. The shelter's 75 animals were relocated, and its future remains uncertain pending contamination tests and an investigation into the incinerator's operating temperature.</p>

Experts like UCLA law professor Adam Winkler observe that public stances on gun policy have become deeply entrenched, rendering reform unlikely even after horrific tragedies. Kirk, a fervent Second Amendment advocate, famously argued that gun deaths were a "prudent deal" for protecting liberty, reflecting a prevailing pro-gun sentiment that correlates with rising gun ownership and fatalities.</p>

          <h2>Conservative Activists Redefine Culture War Tactics, Targeting Progressive Discourse</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 09:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Conservative activist Christopher Rufo's recent actions indicate a significant shift in culture war tactics, moving from merely denouncing "cancel culture" to actively employing it against progressive discourse. Rufo, widely known for successful campaigns like the one that led to the resignation of Harvard's president, is now overtly embracing the premise that "all cultures cancel," aiming to expand the range of acceptable discourse rightward by simultaneously limiting it on the left. His strategy involves instigating online outrage mobs and meticulously scrutinizing past statements, exemplified by his targeting of a New Yorker writer's decade-old tweets. This approach reflects the right's ascendant cultural influence under Trump, signaling a more aggressive and potentially unprincipled era of ideological conflict.</p>

          <p>Joshua Oliver, 28, has admitted to charges of arson and burglary in connection with a fire that caused significant damage to a building housing Labour MP Sharon Hodgson's constituency office in Washington. The blaze, which also impacted a small charity for rare genetic diseases and an NHS mental health service for veterans, resulted in estimated damages between £250,000 and £500,000. Oliver, who was reportedly living in a tent near the building, claimed he did not intend for the fire to spread from a wheelie bin he ignited. He also pleaded guilty to three counts of criminal damage, including smashing windows at Vermont House and his father's house.</p>

Kirk expressed gratitude for the support received from law enforcement and President Trump, whom she stated her husband deeply admired.

          <p>This article critically examines and largely debunks the assertion by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) movement that the current generation is the "sickest in American history." It presents compelling evidence of substantial progress in public health, noting that average life expectancy has nearly doubled since the late 19th century, largely due to advancements in vaccines, antibiotics, and improved environmental cleanliness. While acknowledging contemporary health challenges such as rising obesity and mental illness rates, the article argues these issues must be contextualized, emphasizing how dramatically the country has advanced from a past plagued by rampant infectious diseases and alarmingly high infant mortality rates.</p>

          <p>British television presenter Davina McCall has announced her engagement to celebrity hairdresser Michael Douglas, following seven years of their relationship. This joyful news comes just months after McCall revealed her benign brain tumor was "not coming back" after successful surgery last year, during which Douglas provided significant support. McCall, a widely recognized figure on British television and currently hosting "Stranded on Honeymoon Island," has been married twice previously and is a mother of three children. The couple reportedly first met on the set of "Big Brother" in the early 2000s but only began dating after her divorce was finalized in early 2018.</p>

          <p>Activist investor Sachem Head Capital Management is actively advocating for a merger between Performance Food Group (PFG) and US Foods, even nominating four candidates to PFG's board to advance this objective. The firm believes that combining these second and third largest foodservice distributors could generate substantial synergies, potentially ranging from $800 million to over $1 billion, largely through optimizing purchasing, logistics, and warehouse operations. Sachem Head's track record, including a successful turnaround at US Foods, bolsters their argument. While a similar past merger was blocked, the current regulatory environment under the Trump administration and PFG's regional focus might allow this significant deal to proceed.

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has announced an anti-dumping investigation targeting imports of US commodity interface IC chips and gate drive IC chips. This probe was initiated following a request from the Jiangsu provincial semiconductor association, which claims domestic industries have been harmed. The preliminary evidence suggests that while US chip import volumes rose by 37% between 2022 and 2024, their prices simultaneously dropped by 52%, suppressing domestic sales prices. This investigation, launched just ahead of a US-China trade meeting, signals escalating trade tensions and will examine the impact on Chinese industry over the specified period.

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, currently facing accusations of mortgage fraud from the Trump administration, appears to have documentary evidence that could refute these claims. A loan estimate for her Atlanta home, reviewed by Reuters, indicates she explicitly declared the property as a "vacation home" to her lender, rather than a primary residence. This directly contradicts allegations that she claimed two different homes as primary residences to illicitly gain mortgage and tax advantages. Cook, who has consistently denied any wrongdoing and is suing President Trump over attempts to dismiss her, further supported her defense by declaring the Atlanta property as a "second home" on a federal security clearance form.</p>

          <p>Convenience stores are increasingly capturing a larger share of the breakfast market, with morning meal traffic to "food-forward" c-stores growing by 9% compared to fast food chains' 1% rise. This shift is largely attributed to convenience stores expanding their prepared food options, offering perceived "good bang for their buck," and providing a wider variety of choices. Major fast-food players like McDonald's are experiencing declining breakfast visits as consumers become more budget-conscious and seek alternative options. The trend underscores a changing consumer landscape where convenience, value, and diverse offerings are becoming crucial differentiators in the highly competitive morning meal market.</p>
