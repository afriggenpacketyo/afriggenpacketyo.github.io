          <p>Jonathan Peter Brooks, a plastic surgeon, has been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 22 years for attempting to murder a colleague, Graeme Perks. Brooks broke into Perks's home armed with a crowbar, petrol, matches, and a knife, intending to set the house on fire. Perks, who was a witness against Brooks in disciplinary proceedings, sustained severe injuries after being stabbed, with doctors estimating a 95% chance of death. The judge dismissed Brooks's claim of being unfit to attend court, noting his physical capacity to do so. The violent attack stemmed from Brooks's desire to eliminate Perks as a witness in professional disciplinary matters.</p>

Gordon stated that the prosecution fabricated evidence to support their narrative, reminding the jury of Marten's testimony about erecting their tent in a sheltered area with adequate clothing and ventilation. Victoria's body was found in a shopping bag in an allotment shed in Brighton in March 2023, and the trial continues.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris faced criticism for her statement on anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles, blaming the Trump administration and calling the unrest "overwhelmingly peaceful." Conservatives online and Trump officials condemned Harris's remarks, with some accusing her of siding with violent criminals and illegal immigrants over law enforcement and communities. Harris stated that the Trump administration's actions were intended to spread panic and division, rather than ensure public safety. The protests erupted after ICE raids in Los Angeles, leading to the deployment of the National Guard and sparking debates over immigration policies and law enforcement responses.</p>

          <p>A New York Federal Reserve survey indicated that Americans' inflation fears receded in May, coinciding with President Trump's softened stance on tariff proposals. The one-year inflation outlook decreased to 3.2%, a 0.4 percentage point drop from April, while the three-year and five-year forecasts also edged down. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett highlighted that inflation has decreased despite rising tariff revenue, contradicting predictions of tariff-induced inflation. The survey also revealed positive trends in employment and debt management, with fewer people expecting job loss and improved confidence in stock market performance (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>An Italian referendum aimed at loosening citizenship rules failed as less than a third of eligible voters participated in the poll. The referendum also sought to strengthen labor rights, but the low turnout rendered the vote invalid. This outcome reflects a lack of public engagement with the proposed reforms and represents a setback for those advocating for more inclusive citizenship policies and improved worker protections.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While technically possible to use a 401(k) to pay off credit card debt through a loan or withdrawal, it's often not advisable due to long-term financial risks. A 401(k) loan requires repayment with interest, and job loss can trigger immediate repayment, leading to taxes and penalties. Outright withdrawals incur a 10% penalty if under 59Â½, plus income taxes, and both options sacrifice potential compound growth. Before tapping retirement savings, exploring alternatives like debt consolidation, credit counseling, or debt settlement is recommended (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>President Trump's proclamation restricting travel and immigration from 12 countries and limiting entry from seven others went into effect, citing national security concerns. The ban targets individuals seeking permanent residency or temporary visas from countries with security risks.

Trump stated that the list could be revised based on countries' improvements or emerging threats. This action follows previous travel bans during his first administration, which faced legal challenges but were ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court.</p>
