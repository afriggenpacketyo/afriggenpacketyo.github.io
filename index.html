          <p>Edward Coristine, known online as "Big Balls," has resigned from the US government's Doge service, following the departure of his former boss, Elon Musk. Coristine, a 19-year-old, previously worked at Musk's Neuralink before joining Doge, which oversaw job cuts across federal agencies. Prior to his government role, Coristine ran a company called DiamondCDN, which provided network services to various clients, including a website linked to a cybercrime ring. The White House has stated that Doge's mission will continue despite these departures, but the future of the department remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>New York City's Democratic mayoral primary is still uncertain as ranked-choice voting comes into play. Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani holds a slight lead over former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the initial tally, which includes mail-in ballots and first-choice votes. Mamdani received endorsements from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders, while Cuomo seeks a political comeback after resigning amid sexual harassment allegations. The final outcome will depend on ranked-choice tabulations, which begin on July 1, potentially influenced by a recent heatwave and voter turnout.</p>

Biscay was arrested in connection with outstanding vandalism warrants and multiple felony and misdemeanor charges, with bail set at $70,000.

          <p>A classified assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency indicates that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities set back Tehran's nuclear program by several months. The strikes sealed off entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities, including Fordo, but the underground enrichment infrastructure remains largely intact. Some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was moved before the strikes, and the assessment estimates it will take months to less than a year for Iran to regain access to the underground facilities. The White House disputes these findings, with the press secretary calling the assessment "flat-out wrong."</p>

By studying thousands of stars, researchers discovered that stars born today spin much faster than those formed billions of years ago. This faster spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to form. The study provides evidence that the galaxy's star-forming clouds have grown more turbulent over time.</p>

          <p>UK newspapers are leading with stories about the UK's acquisition of new fighter jets capable of carrying nuclear bombs, which is seen as a response to China and Russia. The papers also cover Donald Trump's profanity-laced reaction to violations of the Israel-Iran ceasefire. Other headlines include reports on Keir Starmer's stance on welfare bills and the Bezos wedding. The Daily Mirror focuses on Britain getting "war ready" with its newly unveiled National Security Strategy.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump reacted strongly to ceasefire violations between Israel and Iran, using profanity and demanding an end to the bombing. A Pentagon report suggested that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities were not as successful as initially claimed. Meanwhile, ICE detentions surge for people with no criminal record, and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended holding interest rates despite Trump's attacks. A Department of Justice leader reportedly suggested defying courts over deportations.</p>
