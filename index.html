          <p>Asian stock markets and U.S. stock futures experienced a sharp decline following President Trump's announcement of new tariffs. The tariffs, which took effect on Saturday, have raised concerns about inflation, reduced consumer spending, and hindered economic growth. China retaliated by imposing tariffs on U.S. products, escalating the trade war tensions. While some economists anticipate potential tariff easing in the future, the risk of further trade restrictions remains a significant concern for investors.

These "circuit breakers" are triggered during periods of extreme volatility to allow investors time to reassess. During non-U.S. trading hours, a 7% drop in S&P futures triggers a halt until buyers emerge at the "limit down" level. The NYSE also has specific circuit breaker thresholds that, when reached, will pause trading to prevent further panic selling.
