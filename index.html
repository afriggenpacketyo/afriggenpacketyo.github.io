          <p>Albania is holding parliamentary elections, viewed as a critical juncture for its democratic progress and aspirations for EU membership, as Prime Minister Edi Rama seeks a fourth term. The ruling Socialist Party is campaigning on an EU accession platform, promising to bring Albania into the EU by 2030, but analysts emphasize the need for institutional reforms and anti-corruption efforts. The opposition, a coalition led by Sali Berisha, faces challenges due to internal divisions and corruption charges against its leaders, while new parties are emerging to offer reformist alternatives. Recent electoral code changes aim to introduce preferential voting, but limitations remain that reinforce party leadership control.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced a significant surge in April, primarily fueled by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, effectively offsetting a sharp decline in exports to the United States due to recently implemented tariffs. While overall exports rose by 8.1%, shipments to the U.S. plummeted by over 21%, highlighting the impact of trade tensions. The surge in exports to ASEAN countries, particularly Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand, suggests a shift in trade dynamics, possibly involving transshipment through third countries. Despite the challenges posed by U.S. tariffs, China's overall trade performance demonstrates resilience, although analysts anticipate potential weakening in the coming months.</p>

          <p>The 19th Venice Architecture Biennale is exploring how cities can adapt to rising temperatures caused by climate change, addressing the urgent need for urban resilience. Curator Carlo Ratti emphasizes the importance of collaboration across disciplines to rethink the built environment and address the challenges of a warming world. The exhibition highlights the overheating of urban areas due to sealed surfaces and lack of green spaces, and presents solutions such as transforming cities into flood-resistant "sponge cities." The German Pavilion's "Stress Test" exhibition offers a visceral experience of the future urban climate, underscoring the need for rapid action to make cities habitable.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is set to announce new sanctions targeting Russia's 'shadow fleet' of oil tankers, which have been used to circumvent existing sanctions on Russian oil and gas exports since the invasion of Ukraine. These restrictions, announced by Prime Minister Keir Starmer at a summit of northern European leaders, will affect up to 100 vessels responsible for transporting over Â£18 billion worth of cargo since the start of 2024. The sanctioned tankers will be barred from British ports and could be detained in UK waters, aiming to disrupt Russia's war efforts and protect subsea infrastructure. The Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) members are also expected to announce further support for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Japan intends to continue pressing for the complete removal of tariffs imposed by the United States, even after a recent trade agreement between the U.S. and Britain left some levies in place. The Japanese government insists on the elimination of reciprocal tariffs, specifically an additional 25% levy on cars and a 25% duty on steel and aluminum, as a prerequisite for reaching a trade agreement with Washington. Despite the U.S.-Britain deal, Japan plans to hold further talks with the U.S. to achieve its goal of full tariff removal, underscoring the ongoing trade negotiations and Japan's stance on trade barriers.</p>

          <p>Shares of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), China's largest contract chip maker, experienced a decline of nearly 7% following first-quarter earnings that fell short of estimates. While revenue increased by approximately 28% year-on-year to $2.24 billion, and profit attributable to shareholders surged 162% to $188 million, these figures missed expectations due to production fluctuations. SMIC anticipates revenue to decrease by 4% to 6% sequentially in the current quarter, with gross margin also expected to decline. Despite the earnings miss, SMIC's wafer shipments increased by 15% from the previous quarter, driven by changes in geopolitics and increased demand from government policies.</p>

          <p>Sweeping tariffs on imported aluminum imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump are reshaping global trade flows and increasing costs for American consumers, but they have not succeeded in reviving domestic aluminum production. Skyrocketing electricity prices in the U.S., relative to global competitors, are leading to smelter closures rather than restarts. The impact of aluminum tariffs at 25% is starkly visible in the physical aluminum market, and this cost will ultimately be borne by downstream users. The primary barrier remains the lack of access to competitively priced, long-term power, according to the industry.</p>

          <p>Kent E. Calder of Kyodo News analyzes America's revived strategic interest in Greenland, driven by its geographic location and the interplay of climate and geopolitical considerations. With the Arctic warming and Russia expanding its presence, Greenland's proximity to both Russia and the U.S. East Coast makes it strategically significant. The Trump administration's unilateral approach to Greenland, however, raises concerns among NATO allies. Calder suggests applying the "Compact of Free Association" model from the Pacific to balance U.S. interests with international concerns, ensuring NATO security and reinforcing stability.</p>

Ukraine has rejected Russia's proposed ceasefire and increased attacks on Moscow, adding to the tensions surrounding the parade. The parade symbolizes Russia's national pride and military might, but also underscores the deep divisions caused by the ongoing conflict.</p>
