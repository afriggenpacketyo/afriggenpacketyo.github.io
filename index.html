          <p>In an unprecedented move to address its food security crisis, the Cuban government has leased farmland to a foreign company for the first time since the 1959 revolution. A private Vietnamese agricultural firm is now cultivating rice on the island, bringing its own resources, technology, and expertise. This partnership has already yielded a bumper harvest, with production per hectare nearly four times the national average. The project aims to reduce Cuba's reliance on costly food imports amid a deepening economic decline.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The euro zone's economy grew by a modest 0.1% in the second quarter, narrowly avoiding stagnation and surpassing economists' flatline predictions. This slight expansion follows a more robust 0.6% growth in the first quarter. Analysts suggest the data indicates that the European economy has so far shown resilience to the uncertainty surrounding U.S. trade policies and tariffs. The slowdown was anticipated as the effects of previous economic boosts began to fade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Google has announced it will sign the European Union's voluntary code of practice on artificial intelligence, creating a notable split with rival tech giant Meta, which recently refused. While Google stated its support for the code's goal of promoting access to new AI tools, it also voiced concerns that the EU's overall regulatory approach could slow innovation. This divergence highlights the ongoing debate within the tech industry on how to best navigate the EU's landmark AI Act.</p>

          <p>Banking giant HSBC announced a new $3 billion share buyback program, even as its second-quarter profits of $6.3 billion fell short of analyst estimates. The profit miss was primarily attributed to impairment charges related to a Chinese bank and a loss of income from recently disposed business units. The bank acknowledged a challenging global economic environment marked by tariffs and volatility but expressed confidence in the continued growth of its wealth management division.

          <p>This opinion piece examines the online ridicule aimed at NBA star Karl-Anthony Towns, whose expressive mannerisms have been labeled as "zesty" and queer-coded by commentators. The author argues this mockery is a form of public policing of masculinity, particularly for Black men, where displays of softness or joy are often met with homophobic derision. The article connects this phenomenon to broader cultural anxieties about gender norms, even as Towns achieves peak performance in his professional career.</p>

          <p>Manchester United defender Luke Shaw has publicly backed head coach Ruben Amorim's strict measures to reform the club's culture, which Shaw described as having been "toxic" and "unhealthy." Following a disappointing season, Amorim has reportedly instituted higher standards, demanding 100% effort and making it clear that underperforming players will not play, regardless of their reputation. Shaw, the team's longest-serving player, agrees that this hard-line approach is necessary to restore a positive and professional environment.</p>

This slowdown brings inflation into the Reserve Bank of Australia's target range of 2-3%.

          <p>Despite administration rhetoric focusing on deporting dangerous criminals, recent data reveals that immigration raids in the Los Angeles area are increasingly apprehending immigrants with no criminal history. An analysis showed that in June, nearly 70% of those arrested by ICE had no criminal convictions, a dramatic increase from just 35% in April. This disparity suggests that enforcement actions are being driven more by quotas than by public safety threats, catching ordinary workers and community members in the process.</p>
