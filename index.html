        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Comcast has announced that the spinoff of its NBCUniversal cable network portfolio will be named Versant, a name chosen to emphasize the company's versatility and familiarity with various subjects. According to CEO Mark Lazarus, Versant will include cable networks like USA, CNBC, MSNBC, Oxygen, E!, SYFY, and Golf Channel, as well as digital assets like Fandango and Rotten Tomatoes. Versant will not launch its own streaming service but will focus on individual brand development and is likely to return money to shareholders via dividends, while acquisitions may extend beyond pure media plays, such as Golf Channel's acquisition of GolfNow. Versant is on track to be spun out from Comcast before the end of 2025, and generated about $7 billion in revenue last year.</p>

          <p>Sir David Attenborough is launching a new film, Ocean, which he believes is crucial for saving biodiversity and protecting the planet from climate change, emphasizing the ocean's role as the planet's support system and humanity's greatest ally against climate catastrophe. The film documents the decline in ocean life during Attenborough's lifetime, showing the damage caused by bottom trawling and highlighting the ocean's remarkable ability to recover, particularly the resurgence of whale populations after the ban on commercial whaling. Attenborough hopes the film will inspire leaders to take action to protect a third of the world's oceans, enabling them to thrive and trap more carbon dioxide. The film stresses that a healthier ocean ecosystem would be able to trap more carbon dioxide, helping protect the world from climate change, according to scientists.</p>

          <p>Columbia University administrators and trustees have initiated a review of the faculty-led university senate, potentially redefining control over student demonstrations and disciplinary actions. This move comes after accusations that the senate delayed disciplining pro-Palestinian demonstrators and amid criticism from the Trump administration, which has stripped the school of federal funds. Some trustees allege antisemitism within the senate, while senators defend their actions as upholding the university's protest rules against external pressures. The review has sparked tensions between faculty, who fear a power grab, and trustees, who aim to ensure the university's smooth operation.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is expected to maintain its current policy at its upcoming meeting, given the uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs and mixed economic indicators. Policymakers are likely to wait and assess the impact of trade policies and inflation expectations before making any moves. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is anticipated to emphasize that all options are on the table for the June meeting, acknowledging the conflicting data, including low consumer optimism and high inflation expectations. The article notes that the market is pricing in almost no chance of an interest rate cut at this week's meeting, and only about a 1-in-3 probability of a move at the June 17-18 session.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with its ban on transgender military service members, lifting a lower court injunction without providing detailed reasoning. Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson dissented, and the decision allows the military to begin discharging transgender service members and halt enlistment of transgender individuals. The Trump administration argues the ban is a "medical" exclusion due to concerns about unit cohesion and lethality, while advocacy groups condemn it as discriminatory. The Pentagon estimates over 4,200 active service members have a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, while advocacy groups place the number of trans service members around 15,000.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is set to resume collection efforts on defaulted student loans this summer, potentially affecting 5.3 million borrowers. The Treasury Department will notify borrowers about wage garnishments, which could begin as early as June. This marks a shift from the Biden administration's focus on providing relief to struggling borrowers. Experts express concern about the impact on retirees who rely on Social Security benefits, and the article notes that the government has extraordinary collection powers on federal debts and it can seize borrowers' federal tax refunds, wages, and Social Security retirement and disability benefits.</p>

The lawmakers question the rationale behind the move, arguing the website provides crucial information for ensuring spending aligns with congressional directives. The White House claims the website's data is sensitive and its disclosure would hinder executive branch deliberations. Public interest groups have filed lawsuits to restore the website, which was established during the Biden administration but originated from the Trump administration's withholding of aid to Ukraine.</p>

The Alien Enemies Act gives the president the power to detain and deport migrants when there is a declared war between the U.S. and a foreign nation, or when there is an "invasion" or "predatory inclusion" against the U.S. by a foreign nation or government.</p>
