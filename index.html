          <p>Following a devastating attack on tourists near Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, which resulted in at least 26 deaths and 17 injuries, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi cut short his trip to Saudi Arabia. The attack, claimed by The Resistance Front (TRF), targeted civilians and has led to heightened security measures in the region. The assault has been described as a "terror attack" by Indian officials, prompting widespread condemnation and security reinforcements to patrol the region.</p>

          <p>China has reportedly proposed an alliance with Japan to counter President Trump's tariffs, but analysts suggest this is unlikely due to Japan's prioritization of its security alliance with the U.S. over economic alignment with China.

          <p>The UK government plans to address the driving test backlog by next summer by providing 10,000 extra tests monthly. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander acknowledged the current wait times as "totally unacceptable" and revealed plans to increase training capacity for examiners.

          <p>President Trump's initial rise inspired right-wing populists globally, but his second term's trade policies and confrontational stance are causing a "Trump slump." Populist leaders are distancing themselves as Trump's tariffs create economic strain and alienate allies. In Canada, the Conservative Party's momentum has stalled due to association with Trump, while in Australia, trust in the U.S. has plummeted. The shift reflects a broader challenge for right-wing populists adapting to Trump's evolving policies.</p>
