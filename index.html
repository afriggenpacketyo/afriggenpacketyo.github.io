          <p>President Trump is cutting his G7 trip short to return to Washington due to escalating tensions in the Middle East, particularly the conflict between Israel and Iran. He arrived in Canada for the G7 summit but will leave after dinner with other heads of state. This decision follows increasing airstrikes and missile attacks between Israel and Iran, with Trump urging Iran to negotiate a deal to limit its nuclear program. The U.S. maintains it is not directly involved in Israel's strikes but has assisted in intercepting Iranian missiles. Optimism surrounding the situation is dwindling as the conflict intensifies.</p>

          <p>At the G7 summit in Canada, President Trump displayed a trade agreement signed with the United Kingdom while standing next to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Trump mistakenly referred to the agreement as being with the European Union and downplayed the differences between this agreement and one signed in May. The White House clarified that the agreement was indeed with the UK and provided additional details on steel and aluminum quotas. Trump also complimented Prime Minister Starmer's performance, concluding the bilateral meeting on a positive note.</p>

          <p>Following a shooting in Minnesota where a gunman targeted Democratic lawmakers, killing one and wounding another, lawmakers in Washington are reassessing security measures. The suspected shooter had a "hit list" of 45 elected Democrats, prompting concerns about the safety of politicians. Senators will receive a briefing from the U.S. Capitol Police and the Senate Sergeant at Arms Office to address these concerns. While some express skepticism about increased security, there's a broader call for investigations into online threats against lawmakers, recognizing the escalating dangers faced by elected officials and their staff.</p>

          <p>A coalition of press rights organizations is suing the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) over alleged abuse of journalists during protests related to President Trump's immigration policies. The lawsuit cites instances of officers using foam projectiles and tear gas against journalists, violating state laws designed to protect media coverage of unrest. The suit seeks a court order to prevent further obstruction of journalists' constitutional rights. The LAPD has announced an internal review of a separate incident involving alleged excessive force during a recent protest, but has not commented on the pending litigation.</p>

          <p>Several cities across the Southeast are facing uncertainty after the Trump administration canceled the BRIC program, a FEMA initiative providing funds for storm preparedness. These cuts are particularly impacting communities that heavily supported President Trump in the 2024 election. Cities like Central, Louisiana, and Conway, South Carolina, were relying on BRIC grants to implement flood mitigation projects and improve infrastructure resilience. The cancellation leaves these communities scrambling for alternative funding sources and jeopardizes their ability to protect residents from future storm damage.</p>

Trump's defense of Vladimir Putin occurred before his scheduled meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which was later canceled due to Trump's early departure from the summit because of Middle East developments.

Key disagreements include Medicaid funding, the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, and the debt ceiling increase. The Senate proposes steeper cuts to Medicaid and a permanent $10,000 SALT deduction, while the House seeks higher deductions and a lower debt ceiling increase. These differences could lead to a clash between the two chambers, jeopardizing the bill's passage by the July 4 deadline (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Circle's stock price experienced a significant surge following comments from CEO Jeremy Allaire about stablecoins potentially having their "iPhone moment." Allaire suggested that stablecoins could soon become ubiquitous, similar to the impact of the iPhone. The stock jumped as much as 22% to over $168 in early trading Monday, significantly higher than its $31 IPO price. This optimism is fueled by the resurgence of the crypto market and a rebounding IPO market, creating a compelling narrative for Wall Street (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Edmonton Oilers are competing to bring the Stanley Cup back to Canada, which hasn't happened since 1993, facing the Florida Panthers in Miami. Despite a strong Canadian presence in the NHL, American teams have dominated the league for over three decades. The repeated losses have fostered a sense of rivalry with the U.S., especially amid trade tensions and political jabs. While Canadians unite behind the Oilers, the team faces concerns about history repeating itself as they head into a critical Game 6.</p>

          <p>A doctor charged with supplying Matthew Perry ketamine in the month leading up to his death has agreed to plead guilty to four counts of distribution of ketamine. Dr. Salvador Plasencia faces a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison. Perry's death was ruled to be primarily caused by ketamine. Plasencia allegedly asked another doctor, Mark Chavez, to obtain the drug for him and then sold it to Perry for $4,500. Another individual, Jasmine Sangha, is also scheduled to go to trial in August for allegedly providing the dose that killed the actor.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Wins First Big Case in Higher Education Assault</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration secured a significant legal victory in its efforts to reshape American higher education when a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit over funding cuts to Columbia University. The lawsuit was brought by faculty groups after the administration cut $400 million in funding, citing antisemitism during pro-Palestinian protests. The judge ruled that the faculty unions lacked standing and did not clearly indicate how the administration had broken the law. The ruling is seen as a win for the administration's agenda in higher education.</p>

          <h2>Yosemite National Park to Open All Campgrounds This Summer</h2>

          <p>For the first time since 2019, all 13 of Yosemite National Park's campgrounds will be open to visitors this summer. This will add 500 more campsites than in recent years, offering more opportunities for visitors to experience the park. Maintenance and staffing challenges led to closures in recent years, but these have been addressed. Reservations are available at Recreation.gov, but finding a spot is notoriously competitive. The park's reservation system was introduced in 2020 and was halted earlier this year, but has since been reinstated.</p>
