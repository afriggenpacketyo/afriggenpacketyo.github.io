          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native mistakenly deported from Maryland, is back in the United States to face charges of illegally transporting undocumented migrants. A federal grand jury indicted Abrego Garcia for allegedly participating in a years-long conspiracy to transport migrants from Texas to the interior of the country. Prosecutors moved to have Abrego Garcia held in pretrial custody, citing danger to the community and risk of flight, while his attorney called the charges "an abuse of power." The Justice Department's move follows court battles and scrutiny of a 2022 traffic stop, with Attorney General Pam Bondi thanking El Salvador for returning Abrego Garcia to the U.S.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk may be swappinginsultswith President Trump after pivoting away from politics and stepping down from the Department of Government Efficiency, but the broader initiative, driven by what hedescribedas a mission to end the “tyranny of the bureaucracy,” will soldier on. Even if its impact on government spending remains limited, DOGE’s aggressive approach has rattled Washington’s political establishment. Anti-managerialism is back. Well positioned to answer decades of frustration with mainstream conservatives’ failure to deliver results, this old idea has become the central principle of the New Right.</p>

          <p>Latino Democratic legislators are strongly opposing California Governor Gavin Newsom's proposal to limit state-funded healthcare for undocumented immigrants. The plan includes freezing Medi-Cal enrollment for undocumented individuals over 19 in 2026 and imposing monthly premiums. It would also eliminate long-term care and dental benefits for this population. Legislators argue that these cuts are unacceptable and that the state can find alternative solutions to maintain access to Medi-Cal for all residents. Newsom acknowledged the difficult decision but emphasized the state's commitment to the immigrant community.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's willingness to spend his fortune on elections could drive the brittle party system into chaos and loosen Trump’s hold on it. Musk has raised two electoral threats: opposition to Trump’s One Big, Beautiful Bill and the possibility of starting a new political party. The threat of Musk-funded primaries might ring a little hollow as Trump will almost certainly still be beloved by core Republican voters in 2026. In the November 2026 midterm elections, Musk could have much more impact for much less money, if he funds a few spoiler third-party candidates in a few key swing states and districts.</p>

The author worked alongside researchers from many European countries as well as the United States, coming to Harvard through the same visa programme the Trump administration now seeks to eliminate. If it succeeds in depriving Harvard of programmes like the one that made my stay possible, the centre would become orphaned overnight.</p>
