          <p>A New York judge dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation lawsuit against Blake Lively, his former co-star in "It Ends With Us," after Lively accused him of sexual harassment and initiating a smear campaign. The judge ruled that Baldoni and his production company failed to adequately allege that Lively's threats constituted wrongful extortion and did not prove defamation. Lively's lawyers hailed the opinion as a complete victory, while Baldoni has the option to amend and refile allegations related to contract interference. This legal battle has been ongoing for several months, stemming from Lively's claims of sexual harassment on set and Baldoni's subsequent defamation suits against Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and the New York Times. The judge also determined that the New York Times did not act with malice in publishing their story. The article highlights the complexities of legal disputes in the entertainment industry and the importance of substantiating claims of defamation. </p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has removed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a CDC advisory panel, stating that a "clean sweep" is needed to restore public confidence in vaccine science. Kennedy claims the panel has been plagued with conflicts of interest and has become a rubber stamp for vaccines. The announcement comes after HHS stopped recommending routine Covid-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women and canceled programs intended to discover new vaccines to prevent future pandemics. Health policy experts have expressed concern that the shake-up could produce politicized recommendations that undermine confidence in the CDC and public health. This action reflects Kennedy's skepticism towards vaccines and his intent to reshape vaccination policies in the U.S.</p>

Trump implied that the situation in LA is improving and criticized Newsom as an "incompetent governor" who is "destroying one of our great states." Trump claimed that the National Guard was sent in to ensure law and order, contrasting his current actions with his previous statements about needing a governor's request to deploy the National Guard.

          <p>President Donald Trump unveiled a federal program to provide $1,000 government-funded investment accounts for American babies, with support from business leaders who plan to contribute billions more. The "Trump accounts" are tax-deferred investment accounts tracking stock market performance for children born between 2025 and 2029. CEOs from companies like Uber, Goldman Sachs, and Dell Technologies committed billions for employeesâ€™ childrenâ€™s accounts. The program passed the House as part of a budget bill but faces Senate Republican resistance due to concerns about adding to the national debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The clean energy transition is heavily reliant on critical minerals such as lithium, copper, cobalt, and neodymium, which are essential for technologies like solar panels, batteries, and electric motors. Demand for these minerals is projected to increase significantly by 2040, but their uneven distribution across the world poses potential supply chain challenges. The US is a major consumer of critical minerals but not a significant producer, leading to efforts to increase domestic production and secure international supplies. Innovation in alternative materials and recycling will also play a crucial role in meeting future demand.</p>

          <p>The ongoing battle between the Trump administration and Harvard University over international student visas could have a significant economic impact, potentially costing the Boston economy $180 million. International students contribute billions to the U.S. economy annually, with Harvard supporting over 1,125 local jobs and contributing significantly through student spending. A ban on international enrollment could destabilize a vital revenue stream for the university and the surrounding region. The dispute highlights the economic importance of international students and the potential consequences of restrictive visa policies.</p>
