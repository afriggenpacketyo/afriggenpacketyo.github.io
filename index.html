          <p>Donald Trump's meme coin business has generated over $320 million in fees for its creators, highlighting the intersection of politics and personal finance. The coin's value jumped after Trump promoted a dinner event for top holders, showcasing the potential for financial gain and access to the former president. Critics argue the anonymity of cryptocurrency could allow undue influence on Trump through purchasing digital assets. Trump has dismissed concerns about profiting from his presidency, stating he shouldn't have to contribute his real estate if it appreciates because he's president. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that disputed ballots in the 2024 North Carolina Supreme Court race must remain in the final count, effectively securing a victory for Democratic incumbent Allison Riggs. Judge Richard Myers found that removing ballots after the election would violate due process and equal protection rights. He ordered the State Board of Elections to certify the results, which showed Riggs winning by a narrow margin. This decision comes after Republican challenger Jefferson Griffin filed protests seeking to disqualify ballots, arguing they were unlawfully cast, but the judge emphasized that election rules cannot be changed retroactively.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to prevent Harvard University from receiving new federal research grants, citing concerns about antisemitism on campus, race-conscious admissions policies, and a perceived abandonment of academic excellence. Education Secretary Linda McMahon criticized Harvard for "disastrous mismanagement" and accused the university of "ugly racism." Harvard responded by accusing the administration of illegally withholding funding for lifesaving research in retaliation for the university's lawsuit challenging the government's funding cuts. The university maintains it will continue to comply with the law, promote viewpoint diversity, and combat antisemitism.</p>

          <p>Utah faces the challenge of saving the Great Salt Lake from drying up, an environmental disaster with far-reaching consequences. The lake, significantly depleted, poses risks of toxic dust plumes, ecosystem collapse, and economic damage to industries like tourism and mining. While the state has invested in water conservation, critics argue that efforts are insufficient and hampered by reluctance to constrain water-intensive industries like agriculture and real estate development. A recent year of record snow has stabilized the lake's decline, but substantial cuts in water consumption are needed to restore it to a healthy level, requiring significant political and economic shifts.</p>

          <p>Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is under scrutiny for potentially violating New York City campaign finance rules by using his campaign website to communicate strategic information to a super PAC supporting his mayoral bid. This practice, known as red-boxing, involves publicly posting instructions for outside groups to circumvent coordination restrictions. The New York City Campaign Finance Board has warned campaigns about these rules, and Cuomo's opponent has requested an investigation. While Cuomo's team denies any violation, there is overlap between his messaging and that of the super PAC, raising concerns about potential illegal coordination.</p>

          <p>Credit Suisse Services AG pleaded guilty and will pay $511 million for conspiring with wealthy American taxpayers to hide over $4 billion in offshore accounts. The DOJ said the bank enabled clients to evade U.S. tax obligations from 2010 through 2021. This action violated a 2014 plea agreement, in which Credit Suisse previously admitted to similar misconduct. The bank is now required to cooperate fully with ongoing investigations and disclose any new information about U.S.-related accounts.</p>

          <p>As President Trump prepares for a trip to the Middle East, analysts suggest he has disengaged from the Gaza conflict, giving Prime Minister Netanyahu a free hand to escalate military action. While Trump initially aimed for a peace deal, his focus has shifted, potentially welcoming a forceful resolution against Hamas. Despite sporadic expressions of concern for Gaza's population, Trump's administration has been less involved in managing Israel's campaign compared to the Biden administration, which actively sought to limit civilian suffering and prevent international condemnation.</p>

          <p>India is worried about Chinese 'dumping' of goods as trade tensions with the U.S. escalate, with cheaper Chinese imports flooding Indian ports. With Donald Trump imposing tariffs on Chinese goods going into the U.S., manufacturers in China have begun looking for alternative markets. India's textiles makers say they are bearing the brunt of the trade tensions as Chinese producers are dumping yarn in key production hubs. The Indian trade ministry has set up a committee to track the influx of cheap Chinese goods.</p>
