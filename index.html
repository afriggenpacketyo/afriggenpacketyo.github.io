          <p>A Japanese expert suggests a building under construction at North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear complex might house advanced centrifuges for uranium enrichment.  This aligns with Kim Jong Un's September call for new centrifuges to enhance nuclear weapons production. The International Atomic Energy Agency is monitoring the construction, noting similarities to an existing enrichment plant. The new facility, if confirmed, would be North Korea's third uranium enrichment site.</p>

          <p>South Korea's presentation of a model for a novel naval drone carrier indicates its aim to become a leader in drone-based maritime warfare.  The 15,000-tonne HCX-23 Plus, a multi-deck ship lacking a traditional command island, represents a significant shift in naval design. Experts see this as a potential game-changer for grey-zone and near-sea operations, despite inherent risks. The innovative design could mark a substantial advance in unmanned maritime power projection.</p>
