          <h2>South African President's White House Visit Overshadowed by Trump's Focus on White Genocide Claims</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa aimed to strengthen ties with the United States during his White House visit, but President Trump's insistence on discussing false claims of white genocide derailed the meeting. Trump played video clips of apartheid-era chants and highlighted attacks against white South Africans, overshadowing Ramaphosa's attempts to discuss trade and economic cooperation. Despite the contentious meeting, Ramaphosa claimed some success, noting Trump's apparent doubt about the genocide claims and the agreement to continue trade discussions. The article suggests that the visit underscores the challenges South Africa faces in maintaining its relationship with the United States amid Trump's controversial views and policies. ()</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House of Representatives narrowly passed President Trump's tax bill after intense negotiations and amendments aimed at appeasing both moderate and conservative Republicans. The bill includes making Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent and eliminating taxes on tips, but also pairs tax cuts with cuts to the social safety net. A Congressional Budget Office analysis indicates the bill would disproportionately benefit high-income households while reducing resources for the lowest-income decile. The bill faces an uncertain future in the Senate, with several Republicans already expressing the need for significant changes. ()</p>

          <p>Experts warn that a Republican tax bill moving through the House could cost over 830,000 jobs and increase pollution emissions by dismantling clean energy incentives established by the Inflation Reduction Act. The bill would end tax credits for cleaner cars this year and eliminate incentives for wind, solar, and nuclear energy projects by 2032. The average household could see their energy bills rise by more than $230 by 2035 due to the changes, and the US would emit 260 million tonnes more pollution in 2035. ()</p>

Once they had grown up, they could withdraw the proceeds to pay for certain expenses, including going to college or buying a house. ()</p>
