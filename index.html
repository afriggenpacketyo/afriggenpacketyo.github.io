          <p>The UK Ministry of Defence will invest over £1 billion to develop battlefield technology, incorporating AI and drones to expedite decision-making. A new Digital Targeting Web aims to connect soldiers with real-time information from satellites and aircraft, enhancing target identification. Defence Secretary John Healey highlighted the lessons learned from the war in Ukraine, where AI is used to identify and strike Russian targets. This investment is part of the government's commitment to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, with cyber operations overseen by a new Cyber and Electromagnetic Command.</p>

          <p>Following a U.S. Court of International Trade ruling that President Trump overstepped his authority in imposing sweeping tariffs, the administration is expected to seek alternative legal means. Goldman Sachs analysts suggest the White House could utilize Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 for a swift tariff implementation, though it would be temporary. Other options include launching Section 301 investigations or broadening Section 232 tariffs, already in place for steel and aluminum. The administration's appeal of the ruling indicates a determination to maintain its trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to revoke visas for some Chinese international students, particularly those studying in "critical fields" or with ties to the Chinese Communist Party. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the policy change, which also includes revised visa criteria for future applicants from China and Hong Kong. This move comes amid increasing scrutiny of ties between U.S. higher education and China, with concerns about access to federally-funded research.

Diddy is on trial for racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking, with his ex-girlfriend Cassie, rapper Kid Cudi, and singer Dawn Richard already having testified. Arson investigator Lance Jimenez testified about a car fire that damaged Kid Cudi's Porsche, while Diddy's former stylist testified to witnessing Diddy threaten and assault Cassie. The prosecution's focus has been on Cassie's testimony, which experts say is critical to proving coercion.</p>

Seventeen of the largest pension firms have already approved the reforms in a voluntary agreement, with a legislative back-stop if progress is insufficient by the end of the decade.

          <p>The Trump administration, as announced by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, will begin to "aggressively revoke" visas of Chinese students with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or those studying in "critical fields." This action includes a revision of visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of all future applications from China, including Hong Kong. The move is expected to create anxiety across university campuses and may lead to reprisal from China, which is the second-largest country of origin for international students in the United States. The directive's lack of detail raises concerns among students and university administrators.</p>

          <p>Beijing should prepare for Washington to adopt alternative pressure tactics beyond tariffs in future negotiations, according to Wu Xinbo, dean of the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University. Wu believes Trump may show more restraint with tariffs after seeing their mixed results and potential side effects for the US. Alternative measures could involve science, diplomacy, and security, suggesting a broader range of strategies in US-China relations. This assessment highlights the need for China to anticipate diverse approaches from the Trump administration.</p>

It notes that thousands of Americans serve in the Israeli ranks, with some having strong ties to Israeli settlements. The author contrasts this with Americans fighting alongside Ukrainians against Russian occupation. The piece argues that the radicalization of young Zionist men and women does not receive the attention it deserves, due to a combination of historical antisemitism concerns and America's affinity for Israel.</p>

The ruling, which has been appealed, states that the president does not have the authority to impose such tariffs without Congressional approval. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not delegate unbounded tariff authority to the president. This decision has deepened the divide between the administration and the judiciary, leading to uncertainty and confusion in global trade.</p>
