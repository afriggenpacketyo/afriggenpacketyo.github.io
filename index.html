          <p>A jury found that The New York Times did not libel former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin in a 2017 editorial. Palin claimed the editorial, which linked her political action committee to political rhetoric that enabled violence, damaged her reputation and led to increased death threats. The Times corrected the article within 14 hours of publication, and the jury concluded that the error was an honest mistake. Palin vowed to continue pressing the press to be accurate, while the Times reaffirmed the importance of publishers not being liable for honest errors. This case highlights the balance between freedom of the press and accountability for factual accuracy.</p>

          <p>The United Nations is set to conduct a strategic review of UNRWA, the agency helping Palestinian refugees, to assess its impact under current constraints. This review comes as Israel has banned UNRWA from operating on its territory, but its Palestinian staff remain crucial for aid delivery and medical services in Gaza. The review will also examine the consequences and risks for Palestinian refugees related to UNRWA's operations. The review is not about changing UNRWA’s mandate, but rather improving its effectiveness.</p>

The students were detained separately in March as part of a White House crackdown on perceived antisemitism on US college campuses.

          <p>President Trump suggested that tariff revenue could potentially replace the federal income tax. Economists are skeptical of this claim, noting that it's not a realistic proposal. While tariff negotiations are ongoing, the current universal tariff rate on goods imported into the United States is 10%, with rates on imports from China reaching as high as 145%. Changes to the income tax would require congressional legislation.</p>
