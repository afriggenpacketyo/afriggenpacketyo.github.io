          <p>The United States is set to partially evacuate its embassy in Baghdad, citing heightened security risks. Non-essential staff and their families will be removed from the premises. This decision follows weeks of stalled talks between the US and Iran regarding Tehran's nuclear program, with President Trump expressing reduced confidence in Iran's commitment to halting uranium enrichment. The evacuation reflects concerns about potential dangers in the region and is part of an ongoing assessment of personnel posture at US embassies. The US has given notice to move personnel out, and the situation remains uncertain. </p>

          <p>Eight female college athletes are appealing the House v. NCAA antitrust settlement, arguing it unfairly distributes $2.7 billion in back pay. They claim the settlement disproportionately benefits male athletes in football and basketball, while shortchanging female athletes by $1.1 billion, thus violating Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination in education. The athletes' attorney argues that the proposed payout would cause irreparable harm to women's sports, as it primarily favors revenue-generating sports, potentially leading to scholarship cuts for female athletes in other sports. The appeal will be heard by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</p>

          <p>The UK government's recent Spending Review signals a gamble on long-term capital spending to transform the public realm and boost economic potential. While day-to-day spending is limited, and even cut in some areas, the government is prioritizing long-term investments. This approach contrasts with the typical political focus on short-term gains. The government hopes this strategy will lead to national renewal, but it requires patience from an electorate that has been feeling squeezed for years, with many people in England and Wales likely paying higher council tax to help fund the police.</p>

          <p>The United States is conducting a review of the multi-billion dollar Aukus submarine deal with the UK and Australia to ensure it aligns with the "America First" agenda. This review comes as Australia faces pressure from the White House to increase its military spending. The agreement, signed in 2021, aims to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines and foster collaboration on cutting-edge technology as a response to China's growing power. Officials from Australia and the UK have downplayed the review, viewing it as a natural reassessment by the new administration.</p>

          <p>Scientists have identified a new species of dinosaur, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, from museum collections in Mongolia. This species, dating back 86 million years, is considered the closest known ancestor of all tyrannosaurs, including the T.rex. The discovery reveals insights into the evolution of tyrannosaurs from small, fleet-footed predators to formidable giants. Khankhuuluu represents a transitional fossil, weighing about 750kg, and showcases early evolutionary stages of features like skull anatomy that gave tyrannosaurs their powerful bite forces. The findings have helped revise the tyrannosaur family tree and rewrite the understanding of their evolution.</p>
