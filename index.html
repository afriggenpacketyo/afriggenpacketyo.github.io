          <p>Following a deadly militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that killed over two dozen civilians, India launched missile strikes on what it claims were terrorist infrastructure sites within Pakistan and Pakistan-controlled Kashmir. Pakistan condemned the strikes as an act of war and vowed a forceful response, stating that the attacks resulted in civilian casualties. The Indian government described the operation as "focused, measured, and non-escalatory," targeting locations allegedly used for planning attacks against India. President Trump commented on the situation, expressing hope for a quick resolution to the conflict, as tensions escalate between the two nuclear-armed nations.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio is planning to merge the Palestinian Affairs Office into the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem, reinstating a diplomatic framework established during President Trump's first term. This decision aims to unify the U.S. diplomatic mission in Israel's capital under the U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee. The move reverses the Biden administration's establishment of the U.S. Office of Palestinian Affairs in 2022, which was seen by some as rewarding Palestinian leadership after a wave of terrorism. The United States reaffirms its commitment to its historic relationship with Israel and securing peace in the region.</p>

          <p>Rivian Automotive adjusted its 2025 targets for vehicle deliveries and capital spending due to the impact of President Trump's tariffs, despite exceeding Wall Street's expectations for the first quarter and confirming its 2025 earnings targets. The company anticipates incurring additional expenses of a couple thousand dollars per vehicle due to tariffs, including a 25% tariff on imported auto parts. Rivian's new guidance includes deliveries of between 40,000 and 46,000 units, a decrease from the previous range of 46,000 to 51,000 units, and increased capital expenditures of $1.8 to $1.9 billion. Rivian reconfirmed plans to achieve a modest positive gross profit this year.</p>

India's government said there were "cross-border linkages" to Pakistan, which denied involvement. The precise nature and location of the strikes is unclear. The roots of the Kashmir conflict trace back to the 1947 partition of British India, which led to the creation of a predominantly Hindu India and a predominantly Muslim Pakistan.

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is planning to eliminate Energy Star, the energy efficiency certification program for appliances, as part of an agency reorganization. The EPA's climate change office and the division overseeing Energy Star will be eliminated. The move is part of a broader restructuring to shrink staffing to levels last seen during the Reagan administration. Critics argue that eliminating the Energy Star program is counterintuitive to reducing household costs, while supporters of energy efficiency call the program crucial for meeting growing energy demands.</p>

          <h2>Mattel Considers Price Hikes in Response to Tariffs After Trump's Remarks on Toys</h2>

          <p>Mattel is considering raising prices on U.S. toys due to tariffs imposed on Chinese imports, following President Trump's suggestion that children can cut back on the number of toys they have. The company estimates that Trump’s tariffs could cost it $270 million this year. Mattel is mitigating the impact by diversifying its manufacturing locations and reducing reliance on China. The U.S. Toy Assn. advocates for zero tariffs on toys to ensure access to play for all children.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oil prices are falling due to concerns about a potential trade war slowing the global economy and increased production from OPEC+. Lower oil prices mean lower prices at the pump for consumers, but could negatively impact U.S. oil producers, who may cut spending and hiring. The U.S. is the largest oil producer in the world, and the current situation runs counter to President Trump's vision of an expanding U.S. oil industry. The combination of tariffs and OPEC+ production hikes has brought prices low enough to hamper U.S. production.</p>

However, details are scarce, with pledges to remove redundant military structure and streamline leadership. Concerns have been raised about whether the cuts will be based on merit or partisan loyalty, following Hegseth's dismissal of military leaders. The restructuring aims to modernize the Army with long-range missiles, drones, and cyber warfare capabilities, while divesting outdated formations.</p>
