          <p>Two winning tickets have been sold for the estimated $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot, the second-largest prize in the game's history. The winning numbers were drawn Saturday, ending a three-month period without a jackpot winner. The Texas ticket was sold at a convenience store in Fredericksburg, while the Missouri winner's location has not yet been announced. Winners can choose between a lump sum payment of approximately $826.4 million before taxes or an annuity paid out over 30 years.</p>

          <p>The town of Leticia, Colombia's only port on the Amazon River, is at risk of being landlocked as drought and sedimentation cause the river to shift its course into Peruvian territory. This environmental crisis is fueling a diplomatic dispute over Santa Rosa, a river island claimed by both nations, which has intensified after Peru upgraded the island's administrative status. With Leticia's economy heavily dependent on river access for trade and supplies, Colombian officials are now seeking dialogue to resolve the long-standing border issue peacefully.</p>

          <p>The South Korean government has announced a deal with the United States to release over 300 of its nationals who were detained during a large-scale Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid at a Hyundai electric vehicle plant in Georgia. The raid, which targeted suspected undocumented workers, was part of a broader investigation into unlawful employment practices. South Korea, a key U.S. ally, had expressed significant concern over the detentions and plans to send a charter plane to bring the released workers home once administrative procedures are complete.</p>

          <p>Five refugee aid workers, known as the "Hajnowka Five," are on trial in Poland for human trafficking after assisting an Iraqi-Kurdish family near the Belarusian border in 2022. The case highlights the growing tension between Poland's strict anti-immigration policies, supported by the EU, and the actions of humanitarian groups trying to help migrants. While prosecutors argue the activists undermined state security, the defense contends they were saving lives from the illegal and dangerous practice of pushbacks, placing the country's stance on human decency on trial.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police have arrested 890 people at a demonstration opposing the UK government's proscription of the activist group Palestine Action. The majority of arrests were made under the Terrorism Act for showing support for a banned organization, with additional arrests for offenses including assaults on police officers. The government banned Palestine Action in July following a break-in at an RAF base. Protest organizers, Defend Our Juries, condemned the police response as violent and argued the ban is unenforceable and a waste of resources.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Eagles women's rugby team has been eliminated from the World Cup despite a dominant 60-0 victory over Samoa. Australia's subsequent performance against England was sufficient to secure them a quarter-final spot based on point differential, ending the American campaign. Despite the disappointment, the team's performance highlighted the emergence of promising young talent, such as 22-year-old flanker Freda Tafuna, who scored four tries against Samoa. This new generation of players provides a strong sense of optimism for the team's prospects in the next World Cup.</p>

          <p>According to pediatrician Dr. Daniel Golshevsky, establishing healthy sleeping habits, or "sleep hygiene," in infancy is one of the most critical actions new parents can take for their child's long-term health and success. These habits are foundational for cognitive development, emotional regulation, and resilience later in life. Dr. Golshevsky advises creating a soothing environment that mimics the womb, involving both parents in settling routines, and ensuring the baby is well-fed. He stresses that while routines are helpful, flexibility is key to reducing parental stress and responding to a baby's individual needs.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll reveals a sharp partisan divide over President Trump's deployment of the National Guard to U.S. cities. Supporters, primarily Republicans, believe the action reduces crime and enhances their personal safety, regardless of where they live. Opponents, largely Democrats, view the deployment as politically motivated and a threat to civil liberties, without effectively reducing crime. The survey indicates that opinions are more closely tied to political affiliation than to whether respondents live in urban or rural areas.</p>

This form of hyperbole, used 194 times this year, reflects a worldview where events are framed in extreme, black-and-white terms, positioning himself as a heroic figure addressing unprecedented crises.

          <p>The New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite that can devastate livestock, is spreading through Central America and approaching the U.S. border after a decades-long containment program in Panama has faltered. A recent human case in Maryland, the first in over 50 years, highlights the growing risk. The parasite, which lays eggs in open wounds of warm-blooded animals, could cause billions of dollars in losses to the American cattle industry. The U.S. is now investing millions to build new sterile fly production facilities to combat the threat.</p>

          <p>Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, has voiced concerns about the political "balance" of the UK cabinet following the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner. Rayner's departure has triggered a major government reshuffle and a contest for the deputy leadership of the Labour Party. Burnham suggested the contest is an opportunity to discuss the party's internal management and advocated for a new deputy leader from the north of England to counter a perceived London-centric focus in the government.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests that President Trump's second-term economic policies are increasingly resembling the Peronist model that damaged Argentina's economy. The article draws parallels between Trump's use of high tariffs, import substitution strategies, and direct presidential intervention in corporate affairs with the populist policies of former Argentine President Juan Perón. Critics warn that this approach, which centralizes economic decision-making and rewards political connections, moves the U.S. away from market capitalism and risks creating entrenched interests that could resist future reforms.</p>

With most companies reporting no tangible impact on earnings from AI, concerns are growing that the market is in a bubble where investor excitement has outpaced the technology's current benefits, potentially leading to a severe economic correction.

          <p>A growing number of countries are formally recognizing Palestinian statehood, with the issue set to be a key topic at the upcoming UN General Assembly. While 147 nations already recognize Palestine, recent announcements from France, Canada, and Australia signal a significant shift among Western powers who have historically withheld recognition pending a comprehensive peace agreement. This change in stance is largely driven by Israel's ongoing war in Gaza, increasing diplomatic pressure for a two-state solution despite strong opposition from the Israeli government.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Powerball data highlights how state taxes significantly impact the take-home amount for jackpot winners. Following the recent $1.8 billion jackpot, a winner in a state with no lottery tax, such as Texas or Florida, would receive substantially more than a winner in a high-tax state like New York. The report details the tax implications, noting that federal taxes take an initial 24% withholding with more due later, while state taxes can range from zero to over 10%, creating a wide disparity in the final payout.</p>

This lack of outreach casts doubt on the thoroughness and transparency of the government's investigation, especially as the administration faces political pressure over Trump's own ties to Epstein. Critics argue that ignoring victims while engaging with figures like Ghislaine Maxwell undermines the credibility of the entire process and fails to prioritize survivor justice.</p>

          <p>A growing number of federal student loan borrowers are using deferment and forbearance options to pause their monthly payments. Over a quarter of all borrowers had their payments suspended in the third quarter, more than double the number from the same period last year. While these tools can prevent default, they can also be costly, as interest often continues to accrue, particularly during forbearance. Experts advise borrowers to explore income-driven repayment plans, which can offer affordable payments and progress toward forgiveness, as a more sustainable long-term solution.</p>

          <p>President Trump's aggressive deportation campaign, combined with historically low U.S. birth rates, could lead to the nation's first-ever recorded population decline in 2025.

Economists warn this could have severe consequences for essential sectors like agriculture, construction, and healthcare, which are heavily reliant on immigrant labor, potentially leading to labor shortages, higher prices, and slower economic growth.</p>
