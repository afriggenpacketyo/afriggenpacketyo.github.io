          <h2>Japan Considers Increasing Tariff-Free Rice Imports From the U.S.</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 06:23:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government is contemplating expanding tariff-free imports of U.S.-grown rice as part of ongoing trade negotiations with Washington, potentially increasing the amount to around 410,000 tons from the current 350,000 tons. This proposal comes amid rising rice prices in Japan and aims to secure exemptions from U.S. tariffs, with economic revitalization minister Ryosei Akazawa expected to hold further talks with the United States later this month. While this move may alleviate supply shortages and rising costs, it could also negatively impact domestic rice farmers' incomes due to potential price depression. Japan's rice production for 2024 is estimated at 6.83 million tons. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California's tide pools, vibrant ecosystems teeming with diverse marine life, are facing increasing threats from marine heatwaves, sea star wasting syndrome, and pollution. The decline of sea stars, key predators in these ecosystems, has led to an overpopulation of sea urchins, which are devastating kelp forests. Scientists are monitoring these changes, studying resilient sea star genomes, and exploring captive breeding programs to restore balance. These collaborative efforts aim to safeguard the tide pools' future amid increasing environmental stressors.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging attempts to control academic decision-making by threatening to review billions in federal funding. This action follows Harvard's refusal to comply with demands such as appointing an outside overseer to ensure viewpoint diversity. The university argues that the administration's actions, including freezing grants and initiating investigations, have real-life consequences for patients, students, and researchers. Harvard asserts that no government should dictate what private universities teach or whom they admit, marking the first lawsuit in response to Trump's crackdown on universities regarding pro-Palestinian protests and antisemitism.</p>

The author, Veronica A. Arteaga, emphasizes the rising prevalence of autism reflects better awareness and improved diagnostic tools, not a catastrophe. She calls for investment in services, housing, and employment pathways, rejecting rhetoric that stigmatizes difference and isolates those who live it, and highlighting the strength and resilience of families raising children with autism.</p>

          <p>Recent stock market volatility, characterized by sharp declines followed by significant rebounds, offers two crucial lessons for investors. For long-term savers, this volatility is the price of admission for realizing gains over time, as historical data shows that missing the market's best days can significantly impact portfolio performance. Professional investors should view these volatility spikes as opportunities to lock in gains, as the market's biggest opportunities often arise from its most turbulent periods. The key takeaway is that emotional reactions to market spasms can hinder portfolio growth, while remaining invested and focused on long-term goals can lead to substantial returns.

          <p>Jan-Werner Müller argues that despite oscillating opinions about recent protests, they remain crucial for building morale and long-term movement power. While protests rarely lead to immediate policy changes, they serve as morale boosters and build community. Protests are not the same as resistance, with the former accepting existing authorities and asking for change, and the latter not necessarily recognizing the legitimacy of the powers that be. He argues that the most famous protest in US history was a capstone march after years of difficult and dangerous organizing.</p>

Hiltzik expresses concern that Kennedy's views will negatively impact research funding and stigmatize autistic individuals, who contribute to society in diverse ways.

Experts debate the feasibility and cost of such a system, with concerns raised about potentially sparking a new nuclear arms race.
