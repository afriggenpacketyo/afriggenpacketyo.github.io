          <p>Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth dismissed China's concerns that the Golden Dome project would militarize space, asserting its sole purpose is to protect the United States. Hegseth highlighted President Trump's "America First" policy and the $125 billion investment in the missile defense shield, slated for completion in three years. He also defended his decision to initiate Christian prayer services at the Pentagon, citing historical precedent and religious freedom. Hegseth celebrated the renaming of Fort Liberty back to Fort Bragg and announced increased jump pay for paratroopers, shifting resources to prioritize quality over quantity within the Army's parachutist ranks.

          <p>China's most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, has completed its eighth "intensive" sea trial, according to state media reports. The trial included tests and flights of the ship-borne J-35 stealth fighters, which are designed for catapult launch, though the article did not confirm launches from the Fujian itself. The Fujian, equipped with advanced electromagnetic catapults, is the Peopleâ€™s Liberation Armyâ€™s third carrier. This carrier is expected to significantly boost the Chinese navy's capabilities in offshore defense and long-distance escort operations once it enters service, marking a significant advancement in China's naval power.</p>

          <p>Venezuela, under President NicolÃ¡s Maduro, is holding an election for governor and legislators of Essequibo, a territory internationally recognized as part of Guyana, a neighboring country. This action is seen as an attempt by Maduro to bolster nationalistic sentiment and consolidate his power amid domestic dissatisfaction and reported military unease. The Essequibo region, rich in oil, has been the subject of a long-standing dispute, with many Venezuelans believing it historically belongs to them, a claim that has intensified with recent oil discoveries. Guyana has tightened border security and vows to arrest anyone supporting the election, while the International Court of Justice has ordered Venezuela to refrain from holding the vote.</p>

          <p>Russia launched its largest aerial attack on Ukraine, deploying a high number of drones and missiles in a single night, targeting over 30 cities. At least 14 people, including three children, were killed, and dozens more were injured in what Ukrainian officials described as a "combined, ruthless strike aimed at civilians". Ukraine's Air Force reported shooting down many of the incoming missiles and drones, but hits were recorded in numerous regions, causing widespread damage to residential buildings and infrastructure. President Zelensky called for stronger international pressure on Russia to end the war, lamenting the ongoing violence despite calls for a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>A Kyodo News survey reveals that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens anticipate a decrease in soaring rice prices following the appointment of a new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi. This expectation follows the dismissal of his predecessor due to controversial remarks about receiving gifted rice, which angered consumers amid high inflation. The poll also indicates that many believe rice prices should fall below 3,000 yen per 5 kg, reflecting public concern over the cost of living.

          <p>The post-pandemic surge in "revenge travel" is waning as economic and political uncertainties impact Americans' travel plans. Travel advisors report heightened concerns about a possible economic downturn, treatment of Americans abroad, and government policies. Travelers are increasingly hesitant to book trips, leading to a drop in summer bookings, particularly to Europe, and a shift towards domestic road trips. The change is driven by factors like stock market volatility and fears about international travel, resulting in last-minute deals and a more cautious approach to vacation planning.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists are developing advanced stealth materials effective against both infrared and microwave detection, potentially challenging systems like the U.S.'s Golden Dome. These materials are designed for high-speed aircraft and missiles, crucial for military assets operating in high-temperature environments. Modern battlefield surveillance relies on infrared and microwave detection, making multispectral stealth technology increasingly important. This advancement highlights the ongoing competition in military technology and the development of countermeasures.</p>

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first rail firm to be renationalized under the Labour government, with the first nationalized service departing on time. The government called it a "new dawn for rail" but stopped short of promising lower fares, focusing instead on service improvements and infrastructure investment. Unions have raised concerns about outsourcing staffing, while the opposition Conservatives are calling for Labour to deliver on its promises. Two more rail firms are slated for public ownership later this year, following four others under previous Conservative governments.</p>

          <p>An attack on a Palm Springs fertility clinic has brought attention to the fringe movement of anti-natalism, which posits that procreation is immoral due to the inevitability of suffering. The suspect, Guy Edward Bartkus, identified as a pro-mortalist, advocating for death over life. This ideology, while marginal, has gained traction online due to anxieties about climate change and AI, leading to discussions about whether reproduction should cease. The article explores the philosophical underpinnings of anti-natalism and its more extreme variants, while emphasizing that mainstream proponents condemn violence.</p>

          <p>Russia launched a massive aerial assault on Ukraine, deploying nearly 370 missiles and drones and killing at least 12 people across the country. The attack, the largest of its kind in the war, underscores the failure of cease-fire negotiations and a recent escalation in violence, despite diplomatic efforts. President Zelensky condemned the attacks and called for increased international pressure on Russia. The intensified violence coincides with a prisoner exchange between the two countries and follows signs that President Trump may be stepping back from cease-fire efforts.</p>

          <p>American businesses are facing an "era of thrash" characterized by economic uncertainty, political instability, and rapidly changing policies. Companies are grappling with unstable tariffs, bond-market swings, canceled federal contracts, and rising import costs, creating a challenging environment for investment and growth. Despite this chaos, the American economy has shown resilience, with high corporate profits and low unemployment rates. However, the article suggests that this resilience may be waning as political instability and arbitrary executive decisions further destabilize the business environment, creating a more vulnerable economic landscape.</p>
