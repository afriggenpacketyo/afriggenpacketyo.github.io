          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer met with Chinese officials in Geneva to discuss reducing tariffs that threaten global trade, as both countries have imposed high taxes on each other's goods. Despite low expectations for a major breakthrough, there's hope for scaling back tariffs, which could ease tensions in financial markets. President Trump hinted at lowering tariffs to 80%, though the Chinese side insists on mutual respect and equality in negotiations. The article notes the economic impact of the trade war, with China reporting a drop in exports to the US and US companies anticipating price increases.</p>

          <p>Pakistan claimed that India launched missiles at three of its air bases, prompting retaliatory strikes on Indian missile facilities and air bases. Tensions have escalated since a deadly attack in India-controlled Kashmir, which India blames on Pakistan, leading to increased cross-border fire and civilian casualties. The US Secretary of State urged both nations to de-escalate, but the situation remains volatile, with analysts suggesting the countries are effectively at war. Airports in Pakistan have been closed, and residents in Kashmir reported hearing explosions, raising fears of further escalation.</p>

          <p>The end of the 'de minimis' rule, which allowed low-value packages from China to enter the US without tariffs, has led to panic-buying and price hikes for online shoppers.

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from implementing sweeping job cuts at numerous federal agencies, citing concerns about the legality of the administration's reorganization efforts. The judge ruled that the federal employee unions are likely to prove that the administration exceeded its legal authority in attempting to downsize the government. The restraining order prevents agencies from laying off staff or putting workers on administrative leave, pending further consideration of the case.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift has been reportedly subpoenaed in the legal battle between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, though Swift's representative denies her direct involvement in the film's creative decisions. The lawsuit stems from Lively's allegations of on-set sexual harassment and Baldoni's countersuit claiming defamation. Baldoni's team suggests Lively and a 'megacelebrity friend' pressured him to accept script changes. Swift's representative stated that her only connection to the film was licensing her song 'My Tears Ricochet' for the trailer and a scene.</p>

          <p>China's consumer prices experienced a drop in April, fueling concerns about deflation amid the ongoing trade war with the United States. The national consumer price index (CPI) decreased by 0.1 percent year-on-year, mirroring the decline seen in the first three months of the year. The persistent tariffs on goods between the two countries continue to impede trade, leading to increased stockpiles for Chinese manufacturers. While negotiations with the US are considered, high tariffs continue to impede bilateral trade.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have introduced the initial components of a proposed $4 trillion tax cut, prioritizing the extension of key provisions from President Trump's 2017 tax cuts. The plan includes temporary expansions of the standard deduction and child tax credit, set to expire after President Trump's term. Democrats have criticized the legislation, arguing that it disproportionately benefits the wealthy and relies on cuts to programs for the poor. The bill faces a challenging path to passage in both the House and Senate due to partisan divisions and concerns over spending cuts.</p>
