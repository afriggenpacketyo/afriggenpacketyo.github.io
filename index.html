          <p>Hurricane Erin has intensified into the Atlantic season's first major hurricane, reaching Category 4 strength with winds of 155 mph and is expected to become a Category 5 storm. While tropical storm watches are active for the Northern Leeward Islands, which could see up to 6 inches of rain, the hurricane is projected to track between Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast. Although a direct landfall is not currently forecast, authorities warn of dangerous high waves and life-threatening rip currents affecting coastal areas from North Carolina to Virginia next week.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a crucial meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has outlined his conditions for a lasting peace agreement with Russia, rejecting a simple ceasefire. His demands include a complete cessation of hostilities, the release of all Ukrainian prisoners and abducted children, and continued international pressure on Russia. Zelenskyy expressed concern that Russia might escalate attacks to gain leverage in the negotiations, emphasizing the need for a durable solution rather than a temporary pause in conflict.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has suspended all operations for its main and Rouge services after its 10,000 flight attendants went on strike, affecting an estimated 130,000 daily customers. The strike began after contract negotiations with the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) stalled over key issues like wages and unpaid work hours. The airline had offered a 38% compensation increase over four years, but the union argued it was below inflation and market value. The Canadian government is now facing pressure to intervene and potentially force binding arbitration to resolve the dispute.</p>

          <p>An internal review by the Arkansas corrections department found that convicted murderer Grant Hardin, known as the “devil in the Ozarks,” meticulously planned his May 25 escape over six months. Hardin stated that lax security in the prison kitchen allowed him to gather materials to create a fake law enforcement uniform, which he used to simply walk out of a gate after a guard opened it without confirming his identity. The report highlights significant security failures, including misclassifying Hardin's custody level and having blind spots in camera coverage, leading to the termination of two employees.</p>

          <p>Severe monsoon rains in northwest Pakistan have triggered devastating flash floods and landslides, leading to the deaths of more than 220 people in the last 48 hours. Rescue operations are ongoing in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where entire villages like Pir Baba have been flattened by floodwaters carrying massive boulders, destroying homes and infrastructure. This recent tragedy adds to a death toll of over 540 since the monsoon season began in June, highlighting the increasing frequency of extreme weather events which experts link to climate change.</p>

          <p>The recent summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska is being viewed by observers as a symbolic victory for Moscow, marking the Russian president's diplomatic return to U.S. soil after a decade. Although the nearly three-hour meeting concluded without a formal ceasefire agreement for the war in Ukraine, both leaders described the talks as productive, signaling a potential thaw in U.S.-Russia relations. However, Trump's post-summit remarks about potential territorial swaps sparked confusion and concern over whether he had tacitly accepted Russia's occupation of Ukrainian territories.</p>

          <p>School districts across Florida are removing hundreds of books from libraries as the new school year begins, driven by pressure from the state's board of education and conservative activist groups. After the Hillsborough county district was threatened with legal action over allegedly 'pornographic' titles, it pulled over 600 books, a move PEN America called 'state-driven censorship.' Fearing similar retribution, at least nine other districts have proactively removed titles, often without a formal review process, targeting books by authors of color and LGBTQ+ writers, including works by Maya Angelou and Kurt Vonnegut.</p>

Compared to 1975, when nearly half of young adults had met all four markers, today less than a quarter have. Researchers attribute this shift to increased economic barriers, including the rising cost of living and job instability, as well as changing societal attitudes towards family formation, with many now prioritizing education and financial stability over marriage.</p>

She recommends three powerful steps: using a visual reminder that learning is a process, engaging in positive self-talk to reframe difficult moments, and undertaking small, manageable experiments that push you out of your comfort zone. By practicing these techniques, individuals can learn to tolerate discomfort and see challenges as opportunities for development rather than signs of failure.</p>

This trend is particularly pronounced among underage individuals, where self-reported drinking has fallen dramatically since the 1990s. This cultural shift is seen as positive for public health, potentially reducing alcohol-related deaths, illnesses, and social harms.</p>

          <p>Health officials are alerting up to 500 people from across the U.S. and seven other countries about potential rabies exposure after a bat colony was discovered in the attics of eight cabins at Jackson Lake Lodge in Grand Teton National Park. Although the few bats tested were negative for rabies, officials are taking precautions because a bat bite or scratch can go unnoticed, especially during sleep. The Wyoming Department of Health is recommending prophylactic shots for certain high-risk individuals who stayed in the affected cabins between May and late July, when the issue was discovered.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Engine Capital has acquired an approximate 3% stake in life sciences company Avantor, urging its board to implement significant changes to address chronic underperformance. In a public letter, Engine Capital outlined a plan that includes improving operational efficiency, reducing costs, optimizing the company's portfolio, and refreshing the board of directors. The firm suggests that if a standalone turnaround is not viable, Avantor should consider a full sale of the company to maximize shareholder value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kash Patel, the current FBI Director and a former Trump administration official, has won a $250,000 default judgment in a defamation lawsuit against blogger Jim Stewartson. The lawsuit cited a series of posts where Stewartson accused Patel of being a 'Kremlin asset' and planning the January 6 Capitol attack. A federal judge in Las Vegas issued the ruling after Stewartson failed to respond to the lawsuit, stating that the blogger acted with malice. Stewartson claims he was never properly served with the lawsuit and intends to pursue his own case against Patel.</p>

          <p>Farmers in the American Midwest are grappling with a dual crisis of extreme weather events and economic strain from the Trump administration's trade tariffs. Unpredictable weather, from drought one year to excessive rain the next, has slashed crop yields, while retaliatory tariffs, particularly from China, have caused U.S. soybean exports to hit a 20-year low. This has created a perfect storm of rising operational costs and falling international demand, squeezing farmers financially even as many in rural areas continue to support the president.

They also question the effectiveness of the deployment, calling it a misguided political maneuver and a distraction, as data shows crime in the city has actually plunged.</p>

          <p>For the crucial 2026 Senate elections, the Democratic party is turning to well-known, older candidates like former Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown (72) and former North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper (68). This strategy highlights a tension between the party's desire for a new generation of leaders and the practical need to field candidates with proven statewide appeal in increasingly difficult states. While some activists see this as an indictment of the party's ability to build a strong bench of younger talent, strategists argue that these experienced figures offer the best chance to compete for vital Senate seats.</p>

          <p>As the 80th anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing approaches, the aging survivors, or 'hibakusha,' are making a final, urgent plea for the abolition of nuclear weapons. Toshiyuki Mimaki, 83, vice-chair of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning organization Nihon Hidankyo, continues to share his experiences with younger generations. Their efforts come at a critical time, as an intensifying arms race in East Asia and reliance on nuclear deterrence by major powers challenge the 'nuclear taboo' they helped establish. With their numbers dwindling, the survivors are planning one last major campaign to push for global disarmament.</p>

The find is considered exceptional and may have been deliberately buried alongside a similar object discovered in the same area in 2021, offering new insights into early medieval life in the region.</p>
