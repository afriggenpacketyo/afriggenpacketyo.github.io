            <p>An Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) inquiry has attributed the killing of 15 emergency workers in Gaza last month to an "operational misunderstanding" and a "breach of orders." The IDF claims its troops believed they were facing a threat from enemy forces, but video evidence contradicts initial claims that the convoy approached suspiciously without lights. The deputy commander of the unit involved has been dismissed for providing an incomplete report, while the IDF maintains that six of the casualties were Hamas members, a claim for which evidence has not been produced. The Red Crescent and other international organizations have called for an independent investigation.</p>

            <p>British RAF Typhoon jets intercepted two Russian aircraft flying close to Nato airspace in separate incidents this week. The intercepts, which took off from Malbork Air Base in Poland, were part of the UK's contribution to Nato's enhanced air policing. The UK's involvement in Nato's enhanced air policing is called Operation Chessman and sees personnel from across the RAF deployed to Malbork alongside Sweden, Nato's newest member. Minister for the Armed Forces Luke Pollard said that the UK was "unshakable" in its commitment to Nato.</p>

            <p>Researchers suggest the Step Pyramid of Djoser in Egypt, potentially 4,500 years old, offers a blueprint for hydraulic engineering. They propose a hydraulic-powered mechanism may have been used to lift the massive stone blocks, utilizing water pressure from inside the pyramid. The team believes nearby structures, like the Gisr el-Mudir enclosure, served as check dams and water treatment facilities to support the hydraulic system. If proven, this would push back the timeline for advanced hydraulic systems.</p>

            <p>The article questions the reliability of commonly cited economic indicators, such as consumer sentiment and bond yields, in predicting recessions. It argues that economists and pundits often make incorrect predictions, and that no single metric can accurately forecast economic downturns. The author suggests focusing on actual data from retailers, banks, and payroll companies to gauge the health of the economy. By monitoring these sources, one can gain a better understanding of consumer behavior, capital availability, and employment trends, providing insights into the economy's direction.

Experts advise rebalancing portfolios based on risk tolerance and timeline, potentially shifting to a more conservative allocation like a 60/40 stock/bond mix. Building cash reserves to cover two years of income can help avoid selling investments during market downturns, mitigating sequence of returns risk. Diversifying with a bond ladder is also recommended. (not investment advice)</p>
