            <p>China's C909 passenger jet is expanding its presence in Southeast Asia, with VietJet beginning commercial operations with the aircraft on Saturday. Vietnam becomes the third Southeast Asian country to adopt the plane made by Comac, following Indonesia and Laos. The jets, leased from Chengdu Airlines, will operate on domestic routes in Vietnam, with Chengdu Airlines providing support for crew, maintenance, and operations. Three overseas carriers have launched 15 Southeast Asian routes using the C909, transporting over 250,000 passengers so far, marking a significant step in China's aviation industry.</p>

The exhibit, accessible to the public until late January, celebrates the 30th anniversary of the original TV series. This initiative follows previous Evangelion-themed campaigns by local railway companies, including the installation of a 'Spear of Longinus' at Tenryu Futamata Station, which served as a model for a location in the 2021 movie. The campaign also includes special railway passes and a stamp rally to encourage visitors to explore the city.</p>

            <p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government is accused of dismantling democratic checks and balances, seizing control of media, civil society, and universities. Critics allege corruption and cronyism, with Orban consolidating power within his Fidesz party. The EU has frozen funds in response, but Orban's allies have already taken control of much of the country's media. Independent media outlets face pressure and limited access, while universities experience government interference. This situation has drawn comparisons to authoritarian tactics used by Vladimir Putin, raising concerns about the future of democracy in Hungary.</p>

            <p>Two people died in Moore, Oklahoma, after heavy rainfall caused flooding that swept two vehicles off the road.

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Experts warn that tongue-scraping, a dental hygiene practice aimed at removing bacteria and debris from the tongue, may pose potential heart health risks. While some studies suggest it improves taste, concerns arise from the possibility of macroscopic cuts introducing bacteria into the bloodstream, increasing the risk of endocarditis, a heart valve infection. Over-scraping can also lower nitric oxide levels, potentially raising blood pressure. Experts recommend moderation and emphasize that tongue-scraping is not a substitute for regular dental visits, brushing, and flossing, as the benefits are minimal.</p>

            <p>A Texas Easter tradition involves making and breaking cascarones, confetti-filled eggs, connecting generations through a shared cultural practice. The tradition is common in Texas and Northern Mexico, where kids playfully break the eggs over each other's heads. For Denise Solis, cascarones are a powerful link to her late mother, who passed away just before Easter in 2003, and she continues the tradition with her own child. The egg symbolizes rebirth and new life, reflecting the Easter celebration of resurrection, and scholars trace the tradition back to when Texas was part of Mexico.</p>

Celebrations included fireworks in Greece and candle-lighting in Jerusalem at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, believed to be the site of Jesus' crucifixion and burial. Pope Francis' delegate, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, presided over the Easter Vigil Mass at St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City.

            <p>China is taking a more direct approach in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)-Rwanda conflict due to its significant mining interests in the region. Beijing, through its UN ambassador, has urged Kigali to cease support for the M23 rebel group and withdraw Rwandan troops from the DRC. This marks a departure from China's typical non-interference policy in African conflicts, as it also voted in favor of a UN Security Council resolution condemning Rwanda's role. China aims to safeguard its mining investments and maintain positive relations with both countries, navigating a complex diplomatic situation.</p>

            <p>DHL Express is temporarily suspending deliveries to American consumers for packages worth over $800 due to increased customs red tape following the introduction of Donald Trump's new tariff regime. The changes have led to a surge in formal customs clearances, causing multi-day delays for shipments exceeding the threshold. The White House is also set to clamp down on deliveries under $800, specifically those from China and Hong Kong, by closing a loophole that allows low-value packages to enter the US without duties. This will impact fast-fashion firms like Shein and Temu, who have warned of price increases.</p>

            <p>The increasing popularity of snail slime in beauty products has raised ethical concerns about the treatment of snails. While the industry assures consumers that snails are treated well, some methods of slime extraction involve stressful and potentially harmful techniques. Animal welfare organizations, like PETA, warn that snails can feel stress, pain, and fear. The author questions the normalization of industrialized snail labor for uncertain beauty benefits, suggesting that the industry may eventually seek secretions from another unfortunate animal if ethical concerns persist or a synthetic alternative is developed.</p>

            <h2>Trump's Harvard Bullying Won't Help Diversity of Thought</h2>

            <p>Donald Trump's attempts to impose political authority over academic life at Harvard University are unlikely to foster true diversity of thought. Trump demands that departments lacking viewpoint diversity hire new faculty to transform their political complexion. This approach risks turning viewpoint diversity into a political cudgel, undermining scholarly objectivity. The author argues that a better approach is to encourage the capacity of the human mind to stay on the move between different points of view, rather than institutionalizing political identities.</p>
