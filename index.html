Despite the recent friction, the planned conversation suggests a potential step toward de-escalation and progress in the complex U.S.-China economic relationship, with President Trump stating he believes the U.S. will "do fine with China."</p>

Murayama is remembered for his landmark 1995 statement expressing "deep remorse" for Japan's actions during World War II, a declaration that significantly contributed to Sino-Japanese relations. During his tenure, he became the first sitting Japanese prime minister to visit the Marco Polo Bridge, the site marking the start of Japan's full-scale invasion of China in 1937, cementing his legacy as a figure of reconciliation.</p>

Marc Pinto, the agency's head of global private credit, acknowledged concerns over lending standards but found no evidence of systemic risk or contagion that could trigger a broader financial crisis. He highlighted the resilience of the U.S. economy and noted that default rates on high-yield debt are low and expected to decline, suggesting credit quality is in a relatively strong position.

          <p>Prominent tech investor Ron Conway has resigned from the board of the Salesforce Foundation, citing a misalignment of values with CEO Marc Benioff. The departure follows Benioff's suggestion that he would welcome federal troops to address policing shortages in San Francisco, a comment that drew both praise from figures like Elon Musk and criticism from local leaders. Conway, a longtime Democratic donor, reportedly expressed his disagreement in an email to Benioff, marking a significant fallout within the city's influential tech and philanthropic circles over civic policy and public safety.</p>

          <p>John Bolton, who served as President Trump's national security advisor, has been indicted by a federal grand jury in Maryland on 18 counts related to the mishandling of classified information. The indictment alleges Bolton shared top-secret details from personal diary entries with two relatives who lacked security clearance and improperly stored national defense information at his home. Bolton has proclaimed his innocence, framing the charges as a politically motivated act of retribution by the Trump administration and comparing it to Stalinist tactics, a claim echoed by other recently indicted Trump critics.</p>

          <p>The UK government has lost its legal bid to prevent a judicial review of its decision to proscribe the direct-action group Palestine Action under terrorism laws. The Court of Appeal ruled that the group's co-founder, Huda Ammori, can proceed with a High Court challenge next month, rejecting the government's argument that a separate, slower de-proscription process was the only available option. This ruling is significant as it allows for a faster legal examination of the ban's lawfulness, which could impact the ongoing criminal cases against individuals charged with supporting the group.</p>

          <p>The connection between talcum powder and cancer has been a subject of concern since the 1970s, primarily due to the risk of asbestos contamination. Talc and asbestos are minerals that form in close proximity, making it difficult to mine talc without asbestos fibers, which are conclusively known carcinogens. The World Health Organization's cancer research agency classifies talc as "probably carcinogenic," with links to ovarian cancer, mesothelioma, and lung cancer when contaminated. Following numerous lawsuits, major producers like Johnson & Johnson have transitioned to using cornstarch in their powders instead of talc.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Small businesses across the United States are struggling to absorb the costs of President Trump's tariffs, forcing many to take out high-interest loans, raise prices, and halt hiring plans. Unlike larger corporations, smaller companies have less leverage to negotiate with suppliers or diversify their supply chains, making them particularly vulnerable to the sudden increase in duties. Economists warn that the financial distress experienced by these businesses, which constitute a significant portion of the U.S. economy, could be an early indicator of broader economic challenges ahead if the trade policies continue.

          <p>Hospitality experts and bartenders suggest that the standard tip for bar service is now 20% of the total bill, an increase from the previous 15-18% standard. For individual drinks like beer or wine, a tip of $1 to $2 per drink is considered a good rule of thumb, while more complex, labor-intensive cocktails may warrant a higher percentage. While exceptional service can merit a more generous tip, poor service may justify a lower amount, though factors like how busy the bar is should be considered.

This approach involves rewarding customers, from large data centers to individual homes, for reducing power usage during peak hours or selling stored energy back to the grid. A recent Duke University study suggests this bipartisan tool could add over 100GW of new capacity, equivalent to 50 Hoover Dams, offering a scalable way to enhance grid efficiency and prevent blackouts without relying on new fossil fuel infrastructure.</p>

This experience, combined with discovering a racist covenant in their home's original deed, leads her to reflect on the illusory nature of permanence, whether in legal contracts, property ownership, or marriage itself, concluding that true commitment is a daily choice, not a guarantee on paper.</p>

          <p>Millions of Americans, particularly early retirees not yet eligible for Medicare, face substantial increases in health insurance costs if the enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies expire at the end of the year. The subsidies, which cap premiums at 8.5% of household income, are a key point of contention in the ongoing government shutdown negotiations. Without an extension, an Idaho couple profiled in the article expects their monthly premiums to nearly quadruple, forcing them to consider difficult financial decisions like drawing more from retirement savings or claiming Social Security early.</p>

          <p>Three men who followed a Nazi ideology have been sentenced to prison for planning terrorist attacks against mosques and synagogues in the UK. Christopher Ringrose, Marco Pitzettu, and Brogan Stewart were part of an online group preparing for an assault on an Islamic education center in Leeds before their arrest by counter-terrorism police. The group had amassed over 200 weapons, including machetes and a 3D-printed firearm, and styled themselves as a military unit preparing for a "race war." The judge stated that all three men continue to adhere to their violent, extreme right-wing ideology.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military has conducted another airstrike in the Caribbean targeting a vessel alleged to be involved in drug smuggling, but for the first time, there are reported survivors.

The White House has maintained that the strikes are a transparent and authorized effort to combat drug cartels, while Venezuela's UN ambassador has accused the U.S. of carrying out extrajudicial executions of civilians at sea.</p>

          <p>The potential U.S. transfer of long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine has emerged as a central element in the latest diplomatic maneuvers between Washington and Moscow. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested that discussions about the missiles prompted Russian President Vladimir Putin to agree to a meeting with President Trump in Budapest. While President Trump has publicly floated the idea of sending the powerful weapons as leverage, he has also expressed concerns about depleting the U.S. stockpile, creating uncertainty ahead of his high-stakes meetings with both the Ukrainian and Russian leaders.</p>

          <p>At the World Conference on China Studies in Shanghai, Chinese academics argued that conventional Western theoretical frameworks are often inadequate for accurately understanding China. Scholars, including Lin Shangli, president of Renmin University, called for a research approach that is more deeply rooted in the country's unique historical and social context. They emphasized the need for field research to overcome biases and properly interpret phenomena like China's governance structure, which they contend cannot be fully explained through the lens of Western logic and knowledge systems due to vast differences in social scale.</p>

          <p>A "48 Hours" contributor investigating the 2023 murder of Washington, D.C. photographer Joe Shymanski found herself in an unexpected position when the case led back to her small Pennsylvania hometown.

Snyder's boyfriend, Brandon Holbrook, was the prime suspect, and in an exclusive interview, Snyder addressed suspicions from the victim's family while maintaining her innocence. The case highlights the strange intersections of past and present as the reporter navigated interviewing a former acquaintance in a murder investigation.</p>

          <p>The UK's director of public prosecutions, Stephen Parkinson, is facing pressure from Members of Parliament to provide a fuller explanation for the collapse of an espionage case against two men accused of spying for China. Parkinson had previously stated the case was dropped because the government failed to provide sufficient evidence that China posed a national security threat at the time of the alleged offenses. However, the government has since published witness statements detailing China's "large scale espionage," prompting parliamentary committees to launch inquiries and demand answers from the Crown Prosecution Service.</p>

          <p>This analysis argues that while the ceasefire in Gaza marks a momentous change, the Trump administration's peace plan is built on a fragile foundation that could easily crumble. Two major unresolved issues threaten to derail the process: the lack of a specific timeline or enforcement mechanism for Israel's phased withdrawal, and vague provisions for Hamas's disarmament. The absence of clear monitoring and verification for these critical steps creates significant potential for disputes that could lead to a breakdown of the ceasefire and a return to conflict, leaving the plan's long-term goals unattainable.</p>

          <p>Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has recently adopted a critical stance against her own party's leadership on issues like the government shutdown and the expiration of healthcare subsidies. According to political analyst Tia Mitchell, this behavior is consistent with Greene's hard-right, populist roots, which sometimes diverge from the positions of President Trump and the GOP establishment. While Greene remains a staunch Trump ally, her priority is adhering to her core values, even if it means breaking with the party line, a move that resonates with her constituents who see her as an authentic fighter.</p>

To protect against this anticipated economic turmoil, Kiyosaki strongly advocates for investing in hard assets like gold and income-generating real estate, which he believes are resilient against inflation and central bank policies.

This ruling means airlines are only liable for the lower compensation limits set for checked baggage under the Montreal Convention, rather than a higher amount for the loss of a pet, a decision the owner's lawyer called a "missed opportunity" for animal rights.</p>
