          <p>Boeing is nearing a deal with the Justice Department that would allow the aerospace company to avoid pleading guilty or facing trial in a criminal case related to the two deadly 737 Max crashes. This development follows a previous agreement where Boeing agreed to plead guilty, which was later rejected by a judge over diversity, equity, and inclusion concerns. The fraud charge against Boeing stems from allegations that the company misled regulators about a flight-control system implicated in the crashes, marking another chapter in the ongoing legal saga surrounding the 737 Max disasters and Boeing's accountability.</p>

          <p>Tesla has appointed Jack Hartung, a former Chipotle executive, to its board of directors, effective June 1, as the company faces declining EV sales, shrinking profits, and concerns over CEO Elon Musk's focus on other ventures like the Department of Government Efficiency. Hartung, known for his disciplined financial approach at Chipotle, will join Tesla's audit committee, expanding the board to nine members. Musk has indicated that his time spent running DOGE will decrease by the end of May, and this appointment comes as Tesla prepares to launch its "retro-futuristic" diner in Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve plans to reduce its staff by 10% over the next few years, according to a memo from Chairman Jerome Powell, which is aimed at consolidating functions and modernizing practices. The reduction will include offering a voluntary deferred resignation program to eligible employees, with the goal of bringing the total number of employees below 22,000. This initiative follows calls for cost cuts across civil service agencies, including pressure from the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency. The memo did not explicitly mention Musk or DOGE as a direct factor in the decision.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation for posting an image on Instagram featuring seashells arranged to form the numbers "8647," which some government officials and Trump supporters interpreted as a threat to President Trump. The phrase "eighty-six" is slang for "get rid of," and Trump is the 47th president, leading to accusations that Comey was calling for violence. Comey deleted the photo and claimed he was unaware of the term's violent connotations, but Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and the Secret Service are investigating the post, while Trump himself believes Comey knew exactly what he meant.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors are reportedly considering abandoning a deal in which Boeing would plead guilty to a felony charge related to the fatal 737 Max crashes, potentially opting for a non-prosecution agreement instead.

Under the potential non-prosecution agreement, Boeing would pay approximately $445 million to a crash victimsâ€™ fund, invest in compliance and safety, and be overseen by an independent consultant, but the families are vowing to strenuously object to the deal, marking the latest twist in the long-running legal battle over the crashes.</p>

          <p>Eleven of the 23 Pasadena Unified School District schools have contaminated soil following the Eaton fire, with high levels of lead and arsenic detected. Over 40% of the schools had lead levels exceeding state health-based limits, and over 20% had arsenic levels beyond what L.A. County considers acceptable. Parents are concerned about the safety of their children, and the district plans to restrict access to contaminated areas and conduct remediation efforts over the summer, but some parents feel the response is too late.</p>

          <p>Home electricity bills are projected to reach an average of $784 this summer, marking a 12-year high due to rising temperatures and increasing electricity prices. This represents a more than 6% increase from the previous year, adding financial strain to households already grappling with inflation and higher costs for everyday goods. Low-income families, who spend a larger portion of their income on energy, may struggle to afford cooling, potentially leading to health risks, and some states lack sufficient assistance programs to address the issue.</p>

The schism in elite golf, combined with lucrative earnings, has contributed to this sense of entitlement, potentially undermining the sport's appeal to a wider audience, and his article explores the changing dynamics between golfers and the media, suggesting that a more considerate approach is needed to maintain public interest.</p>
