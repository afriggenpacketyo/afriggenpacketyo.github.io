          <p>The United States and Ukraine have finalized a long-awaited agreement establishing the United States-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund, granting the U.S. access to Ukraine's rare earth mineral reserves. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized that this deal sends a clear message to Russia regarding the Trump administration's commitment to a peaceful and prosperous Ukraine. Ukrainian Minister of the Economy Yulia Svyrydenko highlighted the fund's role in attracting global investment to Ukraine, which is seeking to bolster its economy amid ongoing conflict. Bessent also stated that entities involved in financing Russia's war efforts would not benefit from Ukraine's reconstruction.</p>

          <p>Patrick Roy Vereb, the owner of a Pittsburgh funeral home and pet memorial service, faces multiple felony charges for allegedly defrauding customers of over $650,000.

Authorities identified more than 6,500 victims across several counties, with local animal hospitals and rescues expressing their dismay and offering support to affected families.

          <p>Mohsen Mahdawi, a pro-Palestinian activist at Columbia University, was released from federal custody after being detained by immigration officials who sought to revoke his green card. Judge Geoffrey W. Crawford drew parallels between the case and McCarthyism, citing Mahdawi's extensive ties to his community and lack of danger to the public. Despite his release, Mahdawi's immigration case continues, with authorities claiming his activism undermines the Middle East peace process. His lawyers secured a temporary restraining order to prevent his transfer to a more conservative jurisdiction, and supporters hailed his release as a victory for freedom of dissent.</p>

          <p>Following a historic election victory, Mark Carney confronts a divided Canada, particularly along generational lines. Young voters, concerned about housing affordability, the cost of living, and crime, coalesced around the Conservatives, a shift from the previous election that saw youth support for Carney's predecessor, Justin Trudeau. Polling data indicates that younger Canadians feel let down by Liberal policies, while older voters prioritized concerns about Donald Trump. Carney and the Liberals face the challenge of regaining the trust of younger voters who feel frustrated and unheard, while also navigating a political landscape where the Conservatives made significant gains.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic discusses the plight of over 250 men, mostly Venezuelan, who were deported from the United States to El Salvador and are now held at the CECOT prison. These individuals were deported without due process and face indefinite detention in a country that is not their own, raising concerns about human rights. The Trump administration's efforts to justify the deportations by labeling the men as gang members have come under scrutiny, with evidence failing to withstand scrutiny.

          <p>Florida is on the verge of banning fluoride from its public drinking water supply, as state lawmakers have passed legislation awaiting Governor Ron DeSantis' signature. If enacted, Florida would join Utah as the only states to prohibit water fluoridation, a practice DeSantis has called "forced medication." The bill, passed as part of a broader farm bill, would prevent municipal authorities from adding "water quality additives" to the water supply. This decision comes despite decades of experts asserting that fluoride prevents millions of cavities, with the CDC considering it one of the greatest public health innovations of the 20th century.</p>

Conservative justices suggested that charter schools are contractors for a public service, while liberal justices argued they are public institutions that cannot advance a specific ideology using taxpayer funds.

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments regarding the use of government funds to run religious charter schools, specifically considering the case of St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School in Oklahoma. The court is examining whether the First Amendment permits states to sponsor and finance religious charter schools, thereby determining if charter schools are fundamentally public or private. Conservative justices expressed sympathy towards the school, while liberal justices raised concerns, leaving Chief Justice John Roberts with the potential deciding vote, as Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself from the case.</p>

          <p>Fox News has filed a motion for summary judgment against Smartmatic's $2.7 billion defamation suit, arguing that its coverage of Trump's false election fraud allegations did not harm Smartmatic's business. Fox News contends that Smartmatic already had a poor reputation and that there is no evidence linking the network's coverage to any lost business opportunities. Smartmatic counters that Fox News' conduct has cost the company jobs and billions in asset value, while Fox News maintains that reporting on allegations made by a sitting president is newsworthy and protected by the First Amendment.</p>

          <h2>Experts Dispute Trump's Claims of Falling Egg Prices</h2>

          <p>President Trump has claimed that egg prices are falling, but food economists dispute this assertion, stating that retail egg prices have increased during his term. While wholesale egg prices have declined, the extent to which this will translate into relief for consumers remains unclear. Economists also reject the notion that a president has significant control over egg prices, attributing recent price fluctuations to factors such as bird flu and market demand. While the White House acknowledges that retail prices may still be elevated for some consumers, the data suggests a more complex picture than Trump's claims portray.</p>

          <p>Bad Bunny will appear in Darren Aronofsky’s “Caught Stealing,” set to release in August. The director, Aronofsky, said that Bad Bunny is “the sweetest guy in the world” and that he fits the character he plays in the movie very well. However, Bad Bunny’s presence created a bit of a distraction on set as fans flocked to the filming locations to get a view of the artist. The director had to get creative to ensure Bad Bunny’s smooth and chaos-free transition on and off the set.</p>

          <p>Despite the rapid pace of President Trump's executive actions, Congress has largely acquiesced to his agenda, enacting few laws in comparison.

Congress faces crucial decisions regarding spending bills and whether to challenge Trump's tariffs. Scholars express concern over the decline of Congress's legislative power, emphasizing the importance of checks and balances in a republican government.</p>
