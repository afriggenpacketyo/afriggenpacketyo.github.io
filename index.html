          <p>Axel Rudakubana, the 18-year-old serving a minimum of 52 years for the murder of three young girls in Southport, is under police investigation for allegedly attacking a prison officer by throwing boiling water over him. The Ministry of Justice confirmed that the officer was hospitalized as a precaution and discharged the same day. This incident has heightened concerns regarding the safety of prison officers, especially after a similar attack by the Manchester Arena bomber in April. Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick has described prison violence as a "full blown crisis," urging immediate action from the justice secretary.</p>

          <p>Xi Jinping has strategically positioned China to dominate global supplies, aiming to deter foreign actions against the country. This involves increasing exports, directing substantial loans to industrial borrowers, and introducing economic warfare tactics like export controls and blacklists. The United States, facing potential shortages and rising prices, is under pressure as China restricts the export of critical minerals. This strategy reflects Xi's ambition to redefine Chinaâ€™s global role and challenge the supremacy of the United States, potentially dividing the world into competing spheres of influence.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plans to restructure government agencies and implement mass layoffs, stating that the government overhaul lacked congressional authorization. The ruling favors a coalition of unions, non-profits, and local governments who argued the changes would disrupt critical services. Judge Illston emphasized that while the President can seek changes, large-scale reorganizations require congressional cooperation. The ruling comes in response to concerns that the administration's actions were causing chaos and inefficiency within federal agencies.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft meant to land on Venus, is expected to re-enter Earthâ€™s atmosphere after 53 years adrift in space. Due to a rocket malfunction in 1972, the spacecraft remained in Earth orbit, slowly spiraling back. Experts predict the re-entry will occur this weekend, though the exact time and location remain uncertain. While the spacecraft's heat shield increases its chances of surviving re-entry, the risk of injuries on the ground is considered low.</p>

          <p>Cerys Vaughan, a teenage amateur footballer, is seeking an apology from the Football Association after she was sanctioned for remarks made to a transgender woman opponent. Vaughan questioned the player's gender during a match, raising concerns about fairness and safety. Although an FA appeal board later deemed the initial hearing "unfair" and dropped the charges after the complainant withdrew, Vaughan asserts the case significantly impacted her life. The FA confirmed the case's closure, citing the complainant's withdrawal and maintaining confidentiality.</p>
