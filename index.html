            <p>In Beijing, dozens of humanoid robots participated in a half-marathon alongside human runners, showcasing China's technological advancements. The robots, ranging in size and capability, were developed by private firms and universities, with rules allowing both manual and autonomous control. Teams were permitted to change batteries or swap robots during the race. This event highlights China's ambition to become a leader in humanoid robotics, as outlined in a 2023 policy document aiming for mass production by 2025.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court issued a temporary block on the deportation of Venezuelans held in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, responding to an emergency appeal from the ACLU. The ACLU argued that immigration authorities were moving to restart removals under this rarely invoked law, which has been used only three times in U.S. history, most recently during World War II. The Trump administration contended the act granted them power to swiftly remove immigrants identified as members of the Tren de Aragua gang, regardless of their immigration status. The court's order provides temporary relief while the legal battle continues.</p>

            <p>China hosted the world's first humanoid half-marathon in Beijing, where over 20 robots competed against 12,000 human runners. Despite showcasing advancements in humanoid technology, the robots were significantly slower than their human counterparts, with the fastest robot finishing nearly two hours behind the human world record. The event served as a test for AI systems, with teams allowed to change batteries and substitute robots, highlighting the challenges in perfecting humanoid technology.

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Economists warn that Donald Trump's escalating trade war and imposition of tariffs could lead to corporate profiteering, as companies may use tariffs as an excuse to raise prices beyond legitimate cost increases. Senator Elizabeth Warren has cautioned that corporations might exploit the situation to "price-gouge American consumers," even for goods not directly affected by tariffs. This phenomenon, termed "greedflation," could result in consumers facing higher prices and reduced purchasing power, potentially reversing recent improvements in inflation.

Senator Chris Van Hollen, who met with Garcia in El Salvador, accused the country's president of staging the meeting to portray Garcia favorably.

            <p>BBC Verify investigates the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man deported to El Salvador, focusing on allegations of his MS-13 ties. Despite a Supreme Court order for his return, the White House insists Garcia is a gang member. Police records from 2019 detail observations and a confidential source identifying Garcia as an MS-13 member, though he has no criminal convictions. His lawyers argue he fears persecution by Barrio-18, MS-13's rival gang, which led to his protective order in 2019.</p>

In a 2-1 ruling, with Obama-appointed judge Nina Pillard dissenting, the court put a temporary hold on Boasberg’s determination finding probable cause the administration committed contempt of his March 15 oral and written rulings to turn the planes around, while ordering further disclosures from the government about which officials may have been directly involved.</p>
