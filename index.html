        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has declared his intention to remain in office despite exit polls projecting a significant loss of his ruling coalition's upper house majority. This outcome, which Ishiba "solemnly" accepts, reflects deep public frustration over rising prices, especially for rice, and a series of political scandals beleaguering the Liberal Democratic Party and its partner Komeito. Ishiba stressed his focus on critical US trade negotiations, acknowledging the political instability this defeat could unleash. The election also highlighted the growing influence of the right-wing Sanseito party, which gained support by appealing to nationalistic and anti-immigrant sentiments, further fragmenting Japan's political landscape.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has strongly criticized the Trump administration's intensified immigration crackdown, asserting that aggressive ICE raids have caused widespread fear and significantly impacted the city's immigrant communities. She highlighted the economic and cultural consequences, noting that typically bustling Latino neighborhoods now resemble "ghost towns" as residents avoid leaving their homes due to deportation fears. Bass condemned the tactics of unidentified ICE agents and the deployment of federal troops, deeming them unnecessary military intervention. Despite these strong disagreements, the Mayor acknowledged the administration's help during recent wildfires, expressing a desire for an end to the current "reign of terror" and a return to normalcy for the city's residents.</p>

          <h2>Trump's HUD Secretary Criticizes Fed Chair Powell Over Building Costs and High Interest Rates Amid Housing Crisis</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 11:47:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner has strongly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, accusing him of wasting billions on Fed headquarters renovations while high interest rates perpetuate a national housing crisis. Turner echoed President Trump's sentiment that Powell's refusal to lower rates is "choking" the housing market and stifling economic growth. He contrasted this with HUD's own cost-saving relocation from Washington D.C., advocating for greater fiscal responsibility from the Fed. The article underscores the ongoing political tension between the Trump administration and the Federal Reserve, with the administration pushing for lower interest rates despite the Fed's insistence on independent, data-driven monetary policy decisions.

          <p>Republican Representative Tim Burchett is persistently calling for the full release of Jeffrey Epstein's Department of Justice files, joining a growing bipartisan push for transparency in the high-profile case. Burchett emphasized the critical need to protect the identities of victims and innocent individuals while ensuring public access to relevant information. He openly challenged President Trump's initial dismissal of Republican demands as "foolish" and a "hoax," though he acknowledged Trump's subsequent directive to unseal grand jury evidence as a positive "start." Despite this, Burchett expressed skepticism about ever fully uncovering the truth, citing Washington's inherent secrecy.</p>

          <p>A declaration of principles for peace in the Democratic Republic of Congo, signed in Doha under Qatari mediation, commits the Congolese government and AFC/M23 rebels to a permanent ceasefire and direct negotiations. While the agreement outlines a clear timeline for a comprehensive peace deal, experts express significant skepticism, citing a history of unimplemented accords and immediate post-signing disagreements, particularly regarding rebel withdrawal. Challenges remain in establishing robust monitoring mechanisms and addressing crucial justice provisions, which are notably absent from the current document. Despite international pressure, the ultimate success of this fragile peace process hinges on the genuine political will and commitment of both warring parties on the ground.</p>

Concurrently, Israel has issued new evacuation orders for crowded central Gaza, causing widespread panic among tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians and raising concerns for Israeli hostages believed to be held in the area.

          <p>UK Environment Secretary Steve Reed has pledged to halve sewage discharges by water companies by 2030, a commitment spurred by widespread public anger over escalating pollution in the nation's waterways. This ambitious target follows a record increase in serious pollution incidents in 2024, despite significant executive bonuses. Reed acknowledged the clear failure of the regulator Ofwat, suggesting regulatory changes, but dismissed calls for nationalization as too costly. The government plans a record £104 billion investment over five years to upgrade infrastructure, which is expected to result in higher consumer bills. Environmental charities, however, are urging for legally binding commitments rather than mere political pledges.</p>

          <p>US Vice-President JD Vance is reportedly planning a summer family holiday in the picturesque Cotswolds, following President Trump's recent visit to Scotland. This choice of destination marks a notable contrast to Vance's working-class Appalachian background. The trip, which will also include a stop in London despite his prior critical comments about the city's identity, follows Vance's public criticisms of European governments regarding free speech and immigration policies. The article notes that Vance may face a different reception in Scotland, given his past controversial remarks on abortion rights and "thought crime." This visit occurs as US tourist traffic to the UK has significantly plummeted, potentially influenced by Trump administration policies and rhetoric.</p>

Since the new price isn't explicitly displayed, customers must inquire with employees or scan items at the register for clarity.

This trend is particularly noticeable in roles like content, customer service, and HR, where generative AI tools are increasingly capable. Experts also note that companies might be overestimating AI's current abilities, leading to a "hybrid model" or outsourcing when the technology falls short, all while maintaining limited transparency about these labor market shifts.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has adopted an aggressive new social media strategy, directly confronting President Trump and his allies with sharp, often provocative, language and memes. This significant shift from the traditional "go high" Democratic approach was reportedly triggered by Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles during immigration sweeps, which Newsom viewed as an unacceptable federal intervention. His office now actively uses strong rhetoric to counter misinformation and challenge narratives, aiming to match the combative tactics emanating from the White House. While this strategy has demonstrably boosted Newsom's social media engagement and appeals to a segment of Democrats, it also carries the risk of alienating voters who prefer more respectful political discourse.</p>

          <p>A child psychologist and author advocates for "self-connection"—the ability to tune into one's own emotions and inner voice—as the single most vital skill for a child's lifelong success and well-being. The article explains that seemingly innocuous parental responses that dismiss or invalidate a child's feelings can subtly undermine this crucial connection, potentially leading to anxiety and insecurity later in life. Self-connection, conversely, builds emotional resilience, fosters healthy boundaries, cultivates authentic confidence, and significantly contributes to strong mental health. The article offers seven actionable strategies for parents, such as validating emotions and modeling self-awareness, to nurture this essential skill in their children.</p>

          <p>Gene Marks argues that traditional US labor market measurements, which primarily focus on "jobs," are increasingly obsolete given the evolving nature of work. He highlights the rise of "over-employed" individuals holding multiple jobs or diverse income streams, often working remotely or launching side businesses, which are not adequately captured by current metrics. Marks points to discrepancies in official job figures and advocates for a shift towards measuring "income" as a more relevant indicator of labor market health. He suggests leveraging data from tax returns and private platforms for a more accurate assessment, emphasizing the urgent need for this re-evaluation amidst the transformative impacts of AI, immigration, and the expanding gig economy.

Despite its "frozen in time" appearance, local residents are actively planning events and infrastructure improvements, including a "musical highway," to capitalize on the anticipated surge in tourism.

Many families, including Yehuda Cohen's, believe only sustained US pressure on Netanyahu can force a comprehensive deal, criticizing the government's perceived prioritization of territorial objectives over human lives.

          <p>This article explores the scientific premise that personality traits are not fixed and can be intentionally changed, challenging the conventional belief that personality is immutable after a certain age. Psychologist Shannon Sauer-Zavala's research indicates that conscious and sustained behavioral shifts can effectively alter one's characteristic ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving. The article highlights the personal journey of author Olga Khazan, who successfully transformed her neurotic and introverted tendencies through deliberate actions like attending improv classes and consistent journaling. This approach, described as "fake it 'til you make it," suggests that by persistently adopting desired behaviors, individuals can genuinely reshape their personality, leading to significant personal growth and improved mental well-being.</p>

          <p>A naturalized U.S. citizen, employed by the U.S. Commerce Department, has been barred from leaving China for several months, potentially on national security grounds, after traveling there for a personal visit. The individual, a former U.S. Army serviceman, was reportedly detained upon arrival in Chengdu in April. While the precise reason for the exit ban remains unconfirmed, sources suggest it relates to actions Beijing considered harmful to national security, or his alleged failure to disclose his U.S. government employment on his visa application. This incident underscores the significant risks faced by individuals with dual citizenship or ties to foreign governments when traveling internationally.</p>
