          <p>Three U.S. officials revealed to CBS News that President Trump opposed an Israeli plan to assassinate Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.  The proposed assassination was reportedly discussed after Israel launched a large-scale attack on Iran.  Trump's rejection of the plan was also reported by Reuters, and Prime Minister Netanyahu neither confirmed nor denied the reports during a Fox News interview.  Trump subsequently warned Iran against retaliating against U.S. targets.</p>
