          <p>The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a strong report confirming that evidence of human-caused climate change is "beyond scientific dispute." This directly contradicts the Trump administration's efforts to revoke the EPA's 2009 "endangerment finding," a key basis for regulating greenhouse gases. The report states that scientific understanding of climate threats has only strengthened since 2009, warning that current extremes will become future norms. This scientific consensus is being cited by lawmakers urging the EPA to maintain its regulatory authority over climate-causing pollution.</p>

          <p>American tennis star Taylor Townsend issued a public apology after receiving backlash for social media posts criticizing unfamiliar foods offered at a tournament in Shenzen, China. In now-deleted videos, she expressed shock at dishes like bullfrogs and turtles, which led to accusations of cultural insensitivity from Chinese social media users. In her apology, Townsend stated she felt privileged to experience different cultures and that her comments did not reflect her positive overall experience in the country. The incident occurred while she was competing in the Billie Jean King Cup Finals.</p>

          <p>In her upcoming book, Vice President Kamala Harris reveals that her "first choice" for a running mate in the 2024 election was Pete Buttigieg. However, she ultimately decided against it, believing it would be "too big of a risk" for a Black woman to run on a ticket with a gay man. Harris expresses her admiration for Buttigieg's political talents and laments that the political climate made the pairing unviable, ultimately selecting Minnesota Governor Tim Walz instead. This candid admission highlights the complex calculations of identity and electability in modern American politics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region displayed a mixed performance after the U.S. Federal Reserve implemented an anticipated interest rate cut. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell described the move as a "risk management cut," suggesting it was a precautionary measure rather than a response to a weak economy. While Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi opened higher, Australia's ASX 200 declined. The Fed's signal of potential future cuts is being closely watched by global investors, including those awaiting the Bank of Japan's upcoming policy decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The University of California's governing board has approved requests for campus police departments to acquire additional military-grade weapons and equipment. The approved items include thousands of rifle rounds for UC San Diego and pepper-ball launchers for UCLA. This decision comes as scrutiny over the university system's handling of campus protests intensifies, particularly following clashes with pro-Palestinian demonstrators in 2024. While the university states the equipment is used cautiously to protect the community, some faculty members have expressed concern that it will be used against students and have a chilling effect on free speech.</p>

          <p>New research has found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire regularly consume fermented fruits containing low levels of alcohol. By testing the figs and plums that make up a significant portion of the apes' diet, scientists determined the average alcohol content was around 0.3% by weight. Given the large quantity of fruit they eat, this amounts to a daily intake of about 14 grams of ethanol for a chimp, the equivalent of nearly two standard alcoholic drinks for a human. The study supports the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, suggesting our own attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in primate diets.</p>

This rate is a significant increase from a historic low of 11% in 2021, with the surge attributed to the expiration of pandemic-era aid programs like the expanded federal child tax credit.

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom's office has labeled a social media post by President Trump as a "straight up lie." Trump had claimed that California was in the final stages of approving low-income housing in the affluent Pacific Palisades neighborhood, which was affected by a major firestorm in January. However, Newsom's office pointed out that both the state and the city of Los Angeles have issued orders that effectively ban new duplex projects and lot splits in the area's burn zone. The exchange represents another political clash between the two leaders over California's housing and disaster recovery policies.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve's Modest Interest Rate Cut Unlikely to Satisfy President Trump's Demands</h2>

          <p>The Federal Reserve enacted a 0.25% interest rate cut, a move seen as a response to weakening jobs data but likely insufficient to end President Trump's pressure campaign against the central bank. The decision comes amid Trump's ongoing efforts to exert influence over the Fed, including an attempt to fire board member Lisa Cook and the recent appointment of Stephen Miran. While the modest cut demonstrates the Fed is still acting with relative independence, the President's sustained attacks and personnel moves continue to test the institution's long-standing political autonomy.

          <p>The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee is widely expected to hold its key interest rate at 4% when it meets on Thursday.

With UK inflation still running at 3.8%, nearly double the central bank's target, policymakers are unlikely to risk another cut that could fuel further price rises. The decision comes a day after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut its own rates, highlighting differing economic conditions between the two countries. (not investment advice)</p>

The rate cut is intended to reduce the cost of funding for businesses and ease the burden on mortgage holders in the city.
