          <p>An opinion article discusses a recent scandal at a prestigious Chinese medical school involving a surgeon accused of having an inappropriate relationship with a junior doctor. The surgeon allegedly left an anesthetized patient to defend the doctor against a colleague's criticism. This incident has sparked public anger and scrutiny of the doctor's unconventional path to medicine through an experimental program. The scandal has further eroded public trust in China's healthcare system, which has been plagued by issues of corruption and inequality. This article explores how the incident has damaged the public's confidence in the healthcare system.</p>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated he was awaiting Russia's delegation list before deciding on Ukraine's next steps and urged stronger Western sanctions if Putin rejected the meeting. The Russian delegation will be led by Vladimir Medinsky, a hard-line aide to Putin, and will include Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin.</p>

          <p>The UK is set to allow foreign states to own up to 15% of British newspapers and news magazines under new laws. This change follows a previous ban enacted after a takeover bid for the Telegraph and the Spectator by RedBird IMI, which was backed by the Abu Dhabi ruling family. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy stated the changes would protect "media plurality" while helping publishers "raise vital funding". The decision was made after consultations revealed that a complete ban was considered too restrictive for securing financing.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has endorsed two bills aimed at simplifying housing development in urban areas. Newsom emphasized the need to cut red tape to address the state's housing crisis. The governor's revised budget proposal includes provisions to reform the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and remove other obstacles to new housing. Assembly Bill 609 and Senate Bill 607, sponsored by Assemblymember Buffy Wicks and state Sen.

          <p>The Santa Monica City Council has approved a proposal to turn the Third Street Promenade into an entertainment zone by allowing public drinking. The new policy will permit visitors to purchase alcoholic beverages from participating businesses and consume them outdoors on Fridays through Sundays from 6 p.m. to 2 a.m., beginning in June. The goal is to revitalize the commercial district, which has experienced declining foot traffic since 2019.

          <p>According to this New York Times article, overdose deaths in the United States decreased by nearly 30,000 last year, signaling progress in combating the public health crisis. The data, released by the CDC, shows declines in all major drug use categories and in most states. Public health experts attribute the improvement to changes in the illicit drug supply, increased access to treatment, and naloxone use. However, proposed funding cuts to federal health programs, including those addressing the drug crisis, raise concerns about sustaining this progress, even as drug fatalities remain high.</p>

          <p>According to this New York Times article, Missouri's Republican-controlled legislature has approved a ballot measure to ban abortion again, seeking to overturn a recent citizen-sponsored ballot measure that overturned a near-total ban. The question will appear on the ballot in November 2026, or possibly earlier, and would amend the state Constitution to ban abortion except in medical emergencies, or in cases of sexual assault or incest reported within 48 hours and before 12 weeks of pregnancy. This move bucks the trend of voters siding with abortion rights in other states, and abortion rights groups have condemned the measure as a direct assault on voters.</p>

Fox News has dismissed the allegations as a distraction from Smartmatic's failing case, while also claiming Smartmatic failed to preserve evidence, including instructions from its CEO to delete relevant text messages.

The freeze will not affect those already enrolled in Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program, and will not impact children.

          <p>A cross-party committee of MPs is calling for a change in the law to prevent benefit claimants from suffering harm at the hands of the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). The report reveals that at least 274 deaths have been investigated internally by the DWP since April 2015, with allegations of mishandling potentially contributing to serious harm. MPs are recommending a statutory duty to safeguard vulnerable claimants, holding the secretary of state accountable for their protection. The report highlights the need for deep-rooted cultural change within the DWP to rebuild trust and prioritize safeguarding in policy development.</p>

          <p>Two individuals were discovered deceased inside a tent at a Westlake homeless encampment, following a prior incident in January when another person died in an RV fire at the same location. The Los Angeles Police Department responded to the scene and found the bodies of a man and a woman, with the L.A. County medical examiner's office investigating the causes of death. The deaths occur amidst a rising death rate among people experiencing homelessness in L.A. County, attributed to factors like fentanyl overdoses and encampment fires.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to weaken limits on some "forever chemicals" (PFAS) in drinking water, reversing parts of a rule finalized last year. Limits on three types of PFAS, including GenX substances, will be scrapped and reconsidered, as will a limit on a mixture of several types of PFAS. The EPA will maintain standards for PFOA and PFOS at 4 parts per trillion but will give utilities two extra years, until 2031, to comply. Health advocates have criticized the move, while water utilities have supported it, citing the high costs of treatment systems.</p>

The media landscape has changed significantly, with two Netflix shows and social media campaigns fueling new interest in the case. The article also discusses how the brothers' claims of sexual assault were treated with skepticism at the time, and how that attitude has evolved.</p>

          <p>Paramilitary fighters in Sudan have launched unprecedented drone strikes on Port Sudan, signaling a new phase in the country's civil war. The attacks, which have led to power blackouts and water shortages, demonstrate the Rapid Support Forces' (RSF) ability to carry on the fight despite territorial losses. The escalating drone warfare has highlighted the role of foreign actors in the conflict, with the army accusing the UAE of supplying the RSF with drones, a claim the UAE denies. Some experts see the RSF's bombardment of Port Sudan at least partly as retaliation for attacks on their positions.</p>
