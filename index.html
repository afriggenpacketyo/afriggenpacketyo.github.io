          <p>A recent survey by the Sandpiper Group indicates that a majority of global business leaders attribute the ongoing trade war more to the current U.S. administration's policies than to China's actions. The survey, which polled over 3,000 business leaders across 27 markets, revealed that nearly three-quarters of respondents believe the White House's approach is responsible for the escalating trade dispute. Furthermore, a significant percentage feels the U.S. should take the lead in de-escalating tensions, raising concerns about the U.S.'s global standing. The article highlights the worry among business leaders regarding geopolitical instability and their preparedness to manage associated risks.</p>

          <p>The article delves into the complex public health issues surrounding e-cigarettes, acknowledging their potential benefits for smokers seeking to quit traditional cigarettes while also highlighting the risks they pose to nonsmokers, especially young people. E-cigarettes deliver nicotine without the harmful chemicals produced by burning tobacco, and studies suggest they can be more effective than traditional cessation aids. However, the surge in vaping among teens, fueled by targeted advertising, has led to a new generation addicted to nicotine, which can damage the heart and brain. The article raises the question of whether vaping represents a net improvement in public health or has inadvertently created a new crisis.</p>

          <p>The article explores the debate surrounding building codes in the United States, particularly the requirement for two staircases in apartment buildings over three stories. Advocates argue that allowing single-stair buildings, common in Europe and other parts of the world, could significantly reduce construction costs and increase the availability of affordable housing. They claim that modern safety features like sprinklers make single-stair buildings just as safe, while opponents, including fire safety officials, express concerns about evacuation and fire operations. The discussion highlights the potential for modernizing building codes to address the housing crisis while ensuring safety.</p>

          <p>Actor Michael Pitt, known for his role in "Boardwalk Empire," has been arrested and indicted in Brooklyn on multiple charges, including sexual abuse, criminal sex act, assault, and strangulation.

          <p>Nintendo projects to sell 15 million units of its upcoming Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026, marking its first sales forecast since announcing the device's June launch. Despite a drop in fourth-quarter revenue and profit due to anticipation for the new console, Nintendo expects a significant rise in net sales for the upcoming year. However, the company is cautious about U.S. tariff rates, which could impact profits if prices need to be adjusted, potentially decreasing demand in the U.S. market. Despite these concerns, analysts believe Nintendo's forecasts are conservative, with the Switch 2 poised for a strong debut.</p>

          <p>Germany's governing coalition, led by Chancellor Friedrich Merz, faces the challenge of confronting the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which has gained traction in recent polls. The situation is complicated by Germany's domestic intelligence service designating the AfD as an extremist organization, raising questions about how to handle a party deemed politically toxic yet influential enough to disrupt the coalition's agenda. The ruling coalition is exploring options to restrict public funding for the AfD and remove its members from civil-service positions, while navigating a narrow majority in Parliament that requires near-unanimity across a left-right coalition.</p>

          <p>Senator Chris Murphy discusses the Democratic Party's challenges in the face of the second Trump administration, arguing that the party was unprepared for Trump's coordinated assault on the rule of law.

Murphy emphasizes the need for Democrats to offer a credible alternative to Trump's policies and to connect with voters on issues of economic fairness and spiritual well-being.</p>
