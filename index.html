            <h2>Trump Administration Downplays Market Instability Amid Tariff Concerns</h2>

            <p>President Trump and his administration are dismissing ongoing market volatility as merely "transition problems" stemming from his tariff policies. While global markets initially rebounded after Trump eased tariffs against many nations, uncertainty persists, particularly concerning China, which now faces a substantial 145% tariff. Trump insists he seeks a deal with Beijing but accuses them of past exploitation, signaling a reset in trade relations. Treasury Secretary Bessent highlights ongoing negotiations with other countries, aiming for tariff certainty within 90 days, while Trump leaves open the possibility of extending the pause or reverting to higher tariffs if deals aren't satisfactory.

            <p>Economist Erica York suggests President Trump's triple-digit tariffs on Chinese imports could effectively halt most trade between the U.S. and China. She noted that tariffs exceeding 100% typically cut off trade, except for essential goods without substitutes. The market's uncertainty persists despite a temporary tariff reduction for most countries, excluding China. York also emphasized that Trump's protectionist stance, even with the pause, has pushed the country to its most protectionist levels since the 1940s, resulting in significant cost increases and economic setbacks.

            <p>A Missouri woman, Brenda Ruth Deutsch, has been arrested on multiple felony counts, including child abuse and endangerment, after allegedly attempting to trade a foster child for an exotic animal.

Authorities learned of a rumor that the child was traded for an animal and found the child under child protective services in Texas. Deutsch, who has fostered over 200 children, is currently held on a $250,000 bond.</p>

The students planned the attack using encrypted chats and drew tactics from an online manual. Santa Clara County Dist. Atty. Jeff Rosen's decision marks the first large-scale charging of student protesters in California with serious penalties. The charges include vandalism and conspiracy to trespass, with the university estimating $250,000 in damages.

During a visit to Navajo Nation, tribal leaders expressed concerns about the effects on programs like diabetes care and energy assistance. Kennedy has insisted that no “essential services” would be cut, but the scope of the cuts has raised questions about his oversight. Despite these concerns, Kennedy emphasized his commitment to addressing issues like outdated medical centers and access to healthy foods.</p>

            <p>Technology stocks experienced a sharp decline, with the Nasdaq Composite dropping 4% following its largest single-day rally since the dot-com crash. The market reversal occurred after President Trump announced a 90-day pause on some tariffs, but then confirmed a cumulative tariff rate of 145% on China. Major tech companies like Apple, Tesla, Meta Platforms, Amazon, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet all experienced significant losses, contributing to the overall market downturn.</p>

While there is general agreement that the current system needs to change, there is disagreement on whether to adopt universal standard time or daylight saving time. Some senators suggest allowing states to opt out, but others warn this could cause confusion. Experts presented evidence linking the transition to daylight saving time to increased health risks.</p>

The judge expressed concerns about the policy's impact on migrants' safety and due process rights. The judge said elements of the policy of deporting migrants to countries other than their own without being able to raise concerns about their safety was "very troublesome". Lawyers for the noncitizens argued the policy creates havoc by using "a bait and switch" to send migrants to countries other than their place of origin</p>

The study found that young Atlantic salmon exposed to clobazam, a benzo, were more likely to survive their migration to the sea. Researchers suggest the drug may make the fish less risk-averse, helping them navigate stressful environments like dams. However, experts caution that any alteration to natural behavior can have negative consequences, potentially impacting the fish's long-term survival and ecological relationships.</p>
