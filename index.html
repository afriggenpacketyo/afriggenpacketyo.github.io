          <p>Global equities experienced modest gains as investors assessed President Trump's announcement of a ceasefire timeline between Iran and Israel, alongside increasing weariness towards U.S. policymaking. The MSCI World index saw a slight increase, while U.S. futures also edged higher. Market sentiment remained relatively subdued, potentially indicating a growing desensitization to American policy shifts. According to Hugh Dive, the markets are responding less dramatically to policy changes due to elements of the market becoming jaded and the subdued Iranian response to U.S. strikes, reflecting a winding back of alarming headlines moves in tariffs that has seen subsequent shocks lessened.

          <p>President Trump's decision to bomb Iran's nuclear facilities reflects a long-standing debate over Iran's nuclear program, with the US intelligence community maintaining that Iran has never built atomic bombs. This assessment has often clashed with the views of Israel and Iran hawks, who argue that Iran could quickly develop a bomb. Trump's willingness to prioritize Israeli perspectives and his distrust of the CIA have led him to disregard expert opinions on Iran and the Middle East. Despite consistent intelligence assessments, Trump has expressed skepticism, signaling a departure from previous administrations that relied on intelligence community findings to inform their actions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Western airlines face greater disruptions than their Chinese counterparts due to the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel, coupled with U.S. military strikes, which forces carriers to avoid flying over dangerous airspace on China-Europe routes. Western firms are at a disadvantage because they remain barred from Russian airspace, while Chinese companies continue to utilize it, giving them more flexibility in rerouting flights. Flight diversions and cancellations increased after Tehran's missile assault on an American military base in Qatar, with Western firms diverting flights through Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Afghanistan, as well as southern routes over Egypt and Saudi Arabia. The competitive gap between Chinese and Western airlines may widen as travelers, especially those from China, prioritize airfare and flight times.</p>

          <p>The Gully family is selling the Island of Shuna in the Hebrides after owning it for 80 years, since the Dowager Viscountess Selby purchased it after World War II. The 1,000-acre island, featuring a ruined castle, working farm, and holiday accommodation business, is listed for £5.5 million. Jim Gully described his childhood on the island as idyllic, with white sand beaches and rocky coves, and the family has managed the island for generations, including running holiday cottages and a farm. The castle on the island was built in 1911 by George Alexander MacLean Buckley, but fell into ruins in the 1980s due to upkeep costs, and Sotheby's International Realty suggests the island could become a "wellness destination".</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany may face tax hikes and increased debt to meet a potential 5% NATO defense spending target, which would require allocating 3.5% of GDP to classic defense and 1.5% to related areas like infrastructure and cybersecurity. Jumping from 2% to 5% GDP expenditure would necessitate additional billions of euros annually, likely financed through loans, potentially leading to distribution conflicts in the budget. While new rules exempt defense expenditures above a certain threshold from Germany's debt brake, increased debt could lead to higher interest costs, straining the federal budget. Experts also point to EU fiscal rules as a potential obstacle to increased debt, though these rules can be temporarily suspended under exceptional circumstances.</p>

U.S. crude oil prices and global benchmark Brent both decreased, falling below levels seen before Israel's attack on Iran on June 13. The market sell-off indicates investors' belief that the conflict will de-escalate following U.S. strikes on Iran, with some analysts suggesting President Trump is employing a "peace through strength" strategy. Trump thanked Iran for providing early notice about the strike, which he said allowed for the prevention of any loss of life, and called for peace.</p>

          <p>China has become increasingly reliant on rare earth supplies from Myanmar, which accounted for about 57% of China's total rare earth imports last year, despite being the world's top producer of rare earths. Myanmar is a key source of dysprosium and terbium, crucial heavy rare earths used in high-tech manufacturing, including defense, aerospace, and renewables. China's reliance on Myanmar has created supply chain risks due to the ongoing civil war, particularly in the Northern Kachin State, where most of the heavy rare earths originate, resulting in supply disruptions and price spikes. A report from Global Witness indicated that China has effectively outsourced much of its rare earth extraction to Myanmar at a terrible cost to the environment and local communities.</p>

          <p>Germany's cabinet is set to approve the 2025 draft budget, which includes record figures in defense spending and government borrowing. The defense budget is projected to more than double by 2029, reaching €152.8 billion, driven by growing security concerns and pressure from the U.S. to increase defense spending. Net borrowing will also significantly increase, jumping to €81.8 billion in 2025, facilitated by a recent law easing Germany's debt brake. Germany has been operating with a provisional budget since the start of the year.</p>

          <p>Eight people died on Lake Tahoe after multiple boats capsized due to a sudden storm with high winds and large swells. The incident occurred during the first official weekend of summer, with conditions changing rapidly as the storm moved in, sending tents flying and causing boats to crash into each other. A 27-foot vessel carrying tourists was among those that capsized, and the death toll reached eight after two more bodies were recovered. Witnesses described chaotic scenes as people struggled to get off the water amid the worsening conditions, with some crying as their boats were wrecked.</p>

          <p>More than 100 Labour MPs are supporting an effort to block the government's planned changes to the benefits system, expressing concerns about cuts to disability and sickness-related benefits. The MPs have signed an amendment that would allow them to vote on a proposal to reject the welfare reform bill in its entirety, citing the expected increase in relative poverty and a lack of consultation. The welfare reform bill includes proposals to make it harder for disabled people with less severe conditions to claim personal independence payment (Pip). The level of support among Labour MPs indicates a potential rebellion against the government's welfare plans.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has rescinded the 2001 Roadless Rule, which protected 58.5 million acres of national forestland from road construction and timber harvesting.

Environmental groups denounce the decision, arguing that it endangers wildlife habitats, drinking water sources, and recreational opportunities. Opponents also dispute the notion that eliminating the rule will reduce fire risk, suggesting it is a giveaway to timber companies.</p>

An official from the Department of Homeland Security praised the ruling, while the head of a legal group representing the immigrants said the ruling strips away critical due process protections.</p>

This development follows a day of heightened tensions, with Iran retaliating for the U.S. strikes, though reports indicate no American casualties or damage occurred.
