          <h2>NATO Leaders Aim for Unity on Increased Defense Spending</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-25 04:43:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NATO is expected to approve a collective defense spending increase from 2% to 5% of GDP by 2035, though some members express reservations about meeting the ambitious target. Secretary General Mark Rutte is working to reassure allies of the U.S.'s commitment to NATO, emphasizing that increased spending is necessary given the threat from Russia. Several member states, including Spain and Belgium, seek flexibility on how and when they must raise their defense spending. Despite potential challenges, other heads of state hope for consensus and unity among NATO allies on this critical issue. The need to get serious on defense is paramount amidst growing global security concerns. Optimism surrounding NATO unity remains cautiously optimistic.</p>

          <h2>Government Concerned About Harassment Claims in Post Office Scandal Compensation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-25 04:38:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government fears that pursuing victims of the Post Office scandal to apply for compensation could be perceived as harassment. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) found that many wrongly accused sub-postmasters have yet to receive fair and timely redress, despite over £1 billion being paid out. Former sub-postmaster Chris Head criticized the current compensation processes, citing cases where victims have not been fully compensated. The Department for Business and Trade (DBT) has agreed to consult the Horizon Compensation Advisory Board on sending follow-up letters to potential Horizon Shortfall Scheme applicants. The long-running public inquiry into the Post Office scandal is set to publish its final report on July 8.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Labour MPs are opposing the government's planned welfare changes, which aim to cut disability and sickness-related benefits payments. Over 130 MPs, including 122 Labour MPs, have signed an amendment to reject these plans, despite ministers' efforts to persuade them to back down. Senior cabinet members, including Chancellor Rachel Reeves, have reportedly contacted MPs to convince them to support the government. Defence Secretary John Healey stated that the government aims to create a system that better targets support towards those with the highest needs. The BBC's chief political correspondent noted the sour mood surrounding the issue and potential broader problems for the Labour leadership.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An initial classified assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) indicates that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities have set back Tehran's nuclear program by several months. The strikes caused the entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities, including Fordo, to be sealed off, delaying the resumption of the enrichment program. However, some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was reportedly moved before the strikes. The White House has disputed the findings, calling the assessment "flat-out wrong," while others within the Trump administration maintain that the strikes were devastating. A classified briefing for Congress has been scheduled to discuss the administration's actions in Iran.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As summer brings record high temperatures, it's crucial to understand the difference between heat exhaustion and heat stroke, both of which are heat-related illnesses. Heat exhaustion, characterized by headache, fatigue, and heavy sweating, requires immediate removal from the sun, hydration, and rest. Heat stroke, a more severe condition, can lead to impaired consciousness and requires immediate medical attention, including rapid cooling of the body. Preventing these conditions involves avoiding excessive sun exposure, staying hydrated, and wearing appropriate clothing. Being aware of the symptoms and taking prompt action can mitigate the risks associated with extreme heat.</p>

He contrasts the current unrest with the spontaneous nature of the 1992 riots, emphasizing that the present situation feels like a continuation of BLM/Antifa from 2020 without the same level of community backing. Moon supports peaceful protest but condemns property damage and looting. He advises Angelenos to arm themselves for self-defense during social chaos, advocating for Second Amendment rights and proficiency with firearms.

Mainland China, with extensive underground bunker systems, is believed to have its own bunker-busting weapons. The analysts are assessing the implications of the U.S. action and China's approach to developing its own arsenal.

Initially, air was slowly leaking out of a sealed-off module, but the leak stopped, raising concerns that a new leak may have formed on an interior wall, causing the entire station to lose air. NASA and Roscosmos are investigating the issue, but results are not yet clear. The Axiom-4 mission, carrying Peggy Whitson and three others, launched despite the ongoing investigation.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD is reducing production and delaying expansion plans due to rising inventory levels and price cuts in China's competitive auto market. The company has cancelled night shifts and reduced output at some factories, and suspended plans to establish new production lines. This adjustment signals a potential slowdown in BYD's rapid sales growth, which had propelled it to become the world's largest EV maker. Data indicates that BYD's output growth has slowed, and dealer inventories are high. BYD's recent price incentives have triggered broader selloffs in Chinese auto stocks and further price reductions from competitors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to acquire 12 new F-35A fighter jets capable of carrying nuclear bombs, joining NATO's airborne nuclear mission. Downing Street describes the move as "the biggest strengthening of the UK's nuclear posture in a generation." The jets can also carry conventional weapons and will be based at RAF Marham in Norfolk. The decision follows the Strategic Defence Review, which highlighted increasing nuclear risks from other states. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer emphasized the need to invest in national security in an era of radical uncertainty.</p>

While these attacks have not yet caused widespread disruptions, experts warn that the situation could escalate if the ceasefire between Iran and Israel collapses. Federal authorities are on alert for additional attempts to penetrate U.S. networks, with the Department of Homeland Security issuing a warning about increased Iranian cyber threats. Experts say Iran is a “chaos agent” in cyberwarfare. The situation highlights the need for bolstering America's digital defenses.</p>

          <p>The ongoing debate about the origins of COVID-19, whether natural or lab-related, is less a political issue and more a symptom of public distrust in science, according to journalist Jane Qiu. A new documentary blaming the debate on right-wing conspiracy theories is misguided, as many credible experts believe the question is unsettled. Lack of transparency and inclusiveness in decision-making have fueled public anxieties over virus research. A key issue is the crisis of trust surrounding scientists, funding agencies, and research institutions.</p>
