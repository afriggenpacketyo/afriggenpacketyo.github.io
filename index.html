Some are considering transferring to universities in Canada or Europe, reflecting a decline in the perception of America as a pillar of free expression. While most remain committed to completing their degrees, the Trump administration's policies have created an environment of uncertainty and self-censorship among international students.

          <p>The initial public offering (IPO) market shows signs of recovery, potentially benefiting Goldman Sachs' investment banking segment. Recent IPO filings and successful debuts have renewed optimism after a rocky period marked by trade tensions and economic uncertainty. Goldman Sachs served as a lead underwriter for recent high-profile financial technology deals. Analysts suggest that easing trade tensions and a more stable stock market are emboldening companies to pursue IPOs. However, some experts caution that fewer companies are choosing to go public compared to previous decades, as private markets offer easier access to capital. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest appealing property taxes to potentially secure years of savings by addressing over-assessments, which are common due to inaccuracies in property details. The process involves verifying assessment accuracy, comparing property values with neighbors, and checking eligibility for tax exemptions. Appealing involves demonstrating how the assessor incorrectly applied the assessment formula to your house, and changes typically take effect for the current tax year. Key steps include gathering paperwork, knowing appeal deadlines, and seeking expert guidance to challenge assessment numbers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent trip to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE is being hailed as a victory lap for his Middle East policies, particularly his support for younger Sunni Arab leaders and the Abraham Accords. Trump emphasized the region's shift towards commerce and technology over conflict and terrorism. He also announced the lifting of sanctions on Syria to give its new leaders a chance at greatness, reflecting a move away from American interventionist foreign policy. This article frames Trump's approach as fostering peace through strength and encouraging sovereign nations to control their own destinies.</p>
