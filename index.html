          <p>Japan and the United States are reportedly planning a summit between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and President Donald Trump during the Group of Seven (G7) leaders' meeting in Canada in mid-June. Prior to this, Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, is expected to visit Washington for another round of ministerial-level negotiations regarding Trump's tariff policies. Japan aims to persuade the U.S. to remove tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum, including a 10 percent baseline levy and a 14 percent country-specific portion. Despite previous negotiation failures, both countries are working towards reaching a deal as quickly as possible. The focus is on boosting investment and creating jobs in the U.S., while Trump aims to reduce the trade deficit with Japan.</p>

          <p>A recall on Dr Pepper Zero Sugar has been upgraded by the FDA to Class II due to a serious health risk. 19,203 cases of 12-ounce cans labeled as ‚Äúzero sugar‚Äù actually contained the full amount of sugar, around 39 grams. The mislabeling poses a risk to individuals needing to avoid sugar, particularly those with diabetes, and the affected cans were distributed in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina with a ‚Äúbest by‚Äù date of February 16, 2026. Customers who purchased the affected cans are advised to return them for a full refund or discard them. This occurred after Coca-Cola recalled Topo Chico Mineral Water due to possible bacterial contamination.</p>

          <p>Criminal gangs are exploiting loopholes in European law to smuggle ketamine, often swapping it for salt during transit. Ketamine is classified as a medicine in some countries but as a narcotic in others, making it easier to divert from legal supply chains. Smugglers ship the drug from India to Germany, then through the Netherlands and Belgium, before it disappears into the black market, and in one case, customs officers at Brussels Airport discovered a tonne of ketamine had been replaced with salt. Consumption has risen dramatically in the UK, leading to increased deaths and health problems, and European police forces are planning to liaise with Indian authorities to tackle the problem.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release an additional 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles to address rising prices. Farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi announced that 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests will be sold through direct contracts with retailers. The 2020 rice is expected to be sold at 1,700 yen ($12) per 5 kilograms, and this move aims to supply smaller supermarket operators and specialty shops. The release will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, and the ministry suspects some wholesalers and farmers are hoarding rice in anticipation of further price increases.</p>

The Taiwan Defence TTX event features participation from nine retired generals and eight retired lieutenant generals hailing from Taiwan, the US, and Japan.

          <p>President Donald Trump has asserted that Los Angeles is under siege, justifying his decision to deploy National Guard troops to quell protests related to immigration enforcement. Trump claimed the city was "invaded and occupied by illegal aliens and criminals," prompting him to direct federal agencies to "liberate Los Angeles from the Migrant Invasion." However, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and California Governor Gavin Newsom have refuted Trump's claims, stating that local law enforcement can manage the unrest. Newsom has accused Trump of inflammatory actions and has initiated a lawsuit against the president for mobilizing the National Guard without state consent.</p>

          <p>More than 300 Foreign Office staff who raised concerns about potential UK "complicity" in Israel's actions in Gaza were told they could consider resigning if they profoundly disagreed with government policy. The staff had questioned the UK's continued arms sales and what they called a "stark‚Ä¶ disregard for international law" by Israel. Senior civil servants responded that while healthy challenge was welcome, resignation was an "honourable course" for those with fundamental disagreements. This response has been met with "outrage" and a sense of disappointment among the concerned officials.</p>

          <p>A new report by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) warns of an "unprecedented decline" in global fertility rates. The report indicates that millions of people are unable to have their desired number of children, citing financial constraints and lack of suitable partners as key factors. A survey of 14,000 people across 14 countries revealed that one in five respondents have not had or do not expect to have their desired number of children. The agency is urging governments to address the underlying causes of fertility decline to support individuals in achieving their reproductive goals.</p>

          <p>The UK government has committed ¬£14.2 billion to build the new Sizewell C nuclear plant on the Suffolk coastline, ahead of the Spending Review. The Treasury said Sizewell C will create 10,000 direct jobs, thousands more in firms supplying the plant, and generate enough energy to power six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed the "landmark decision" as a way to "kickstart" economic growth, while Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the investment was necessary to usher in a "golden age of clean energy". However, critics have raised concerns about the project's cost and potential impact on consumer bills.</p>

          <p>Fatal drug overdoses among young Americans have plummeted, with a 47% reduction in risk for those aged 20 to 29. Provisional CDC data indicates that fatal overdoses among those under 35 decreased from over 31,000 in 2021 to roughly 16,690 last year. Experts attribute the decline to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, less deadly fentanyl being sold, increased addiction healthcare access, and a shift towards less risky drug use among teens. However, some groups, like those born between 2005 and 2011, have seen a slight increase in deaths, and concerns remain about potential funding cuts to addiction services.</p>
