          <p>R&B singer Kehlani's scheduled performance at Central Park's SummerStage for Pride festivities has been canceled following pressure from New York City officials, citing security concerns related to the singer's pro-Palestinian views. First Deputy Mayor Randy M. Mastro warned the City Parks Foundation that its license to stage the concert series could be at risk if the performance proceeded. This follows a similar cancellation at Cornell University, though city officials deny citing Kehlani's personal opinions as the reason. Kehlani, who has been an outspoken critic of Israel's actions in the Gaza conflict, appeared unfazed by the cancellation, stating they remain grounded in their purpose and are focused on their upcoming album release. The article also includes a statement from PEN America calling the cancellation cowardly.</p>

          <p>Columbia student activist Mohsen Mahdawi, a green card holder, spoke out in his first network interview since being detained during a citizenship interview, asserting that President Trump will not silence him. Mahdawi, who helped lead Columbia's protests against the Israel-Hamas war, was detained under a rarely used law allowing visa revocations for individuals deemed to pose "adverse foreign policy consequences." Despite facing allegations of antisemitism, Mahdawi maintains his advocacy for justice and peace. He sued for his release, arguing his First Amendment rights were violated, and a judge ordered his release, but an appeals court will review his case. The article provides context on the Trump administration's defense of taking away visas and Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricial McLaughlin's statement.</p>

          <p>Ian Wilkinson, the only surviving guest of a deadly beef wellington lunch, testified in the Australian court case against Erin Patterson, who is charged with the murder of three relatives and the attempted murder of another. Wilkinson recounted the events of the lunch, stating that Patterson plated all the food and that he and his wife, Heather, ate the entire meal. He described his relationship with Patterson as friendly but not close, noting that the invitation to the lunch seemed like an opportunity to improve their relationship. Patterson has pleaded not guilty, claiming she unintentionally served poison to family members she loved, and her defense team says she "panicked" after unintentionally serving poison to family members she loved.</p>

          <p>A newly declassified memo confirms that U.S. intelligence agencies rejected President Trump's claim that the Venezuelan government controls the Tren de Aragua gang, which he used to justify deporting Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act. The memo states that while Venezuela's environment enables the gang's operations, the Maduro regime likely does not cooperate with or direct the gang's activities in the United States. This release further undermines the Trump administration's rationale for using the act and raises questions about its criticism of media coverage.

In a letter, Education Secretary Linda McMahon tells the Ivy League university that it is not eligible for any new federal grants until it meets the administration's demands and "demonstrates responsible management of the university." The two-page letter to the university's president calls out what the administration views as Harvard's "systemic pattern of violating federal law." Harvard accused the administration of "doubling down on demands that would impose unprecedented and improper control over Harvard University and would have chilling implications for higher education."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is seeking to force Harvard University back to the negotiating table by informing the nation’s oldest and wealthiest college that it would not be eligible for any new federal grants. That decision was relayed in a contentious letter to Alan M. Garber, the president of Harvard, from Linda McMahon, the education secretary, who blasted the school for “disastrous mismanagement.” An Education Department official said that Harvard’s eligibility for research grants depended on its ability to first address concerns about antisemitism on campus, policies that consider a student’s race, and complaints from the administration that the university has abandoned its pursuit of “academic excellence” while employing relatively few conservative faculty members.</p>
