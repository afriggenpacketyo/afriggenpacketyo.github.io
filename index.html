          <p>Elon Musk has threatened to sue Apple, claiming the company engages in anti-competitive practices by favoring OpenAI's ChatGPT in its App Store. Musk's AI company, xAI, alleges that Apple's curation makes it impossible for its Grok chatbot to achieve top rankings, constituting an "unequivocal antitrust violation." Apple responded by stating its App Store is designed to be fair and that rankings are based on objective criteria. The threat escalates an ongoing public feud between Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who has dismissed Musk's claims as hypocritical.</p>

          <p>An obituary for Brandon Blackstock, the former husband of Kelly Clarkson, remembers him for his devotion to a "cowboy way of life" in Montana after a career in the music industry. Blackstock, who died at 48 after a three-year battle with melanoma, was lauded as a dedicated father to his four children and a key figure in the careers of many celebrities. The eulogy details his passion for his Montana ranch, rodeo, and outdoor life, which he built with his partner Brittney Marie Jones. Clarkson was not mentioned, but sources noted she was devastated for their children.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order demanding that the Trump administration immediately improve conditions at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Manhattan. The order responds to a lawsuit from migrants who described the holding rooms as dirty, overcrowded, and lacking basic hygiene products. Judge Lewis Kaplan mandated specific capacity limits to ensure 50 square feet per person and required that the cells be cleaned three times daily. The ruling addresses complaints of inhumane conditions, including inedible food and open toilets, at the 26 Federal Plaza location.</p>

          <p>Mexico has extradited 26 inmates, described as high-level operatives in powerful drug cartels, to the United States to face charges for violent crimes and organized crime. This marks the second major transfer of its kind this year, signaling ongoing cooperation between the two nations on security matters. U.S. officials confirmed that members of the notorious Jalisco New Generation (CJNG) and Sinaloa cartels were among those transferred. The extradition occurred amid pressure from the White House for Mexico to intensify its crackdown on drug trafficking, a key point of collaboration between the administrations.</p>

          <p>Texas House Democrats, who left the state to prevent a quorum and block a Republican-led redistricting plan, are now discussing their return. They consider their departure a success, as it has effectively stalled the special session and a proposal to create five new GOP-majority congressional districts. In response, Republican leaders have threatened to end the session if a quorum isn't met soon, while Governor Greg Abbott has promised to call another special session with the same agenda. The political standoff highlights the intense national battle over gerrymandering and legislative power, with both parties accusing the other of unfair tactics.</p>

          <p>Oklahoma Sooners quarterback John Mateer has responded to allegations of sports gambling after screenshots of his 2022 Venmo transactions circulated online. The payment descriptions referenced "sports gambling" and a specific UCLA vs. USC game, raising concerns about potential violations of NCAA rules, which strictly prohibit student-athletes from betting on sports. In a statement, Mateer claimed the descriptions were merely "inside jokes" between friends and firmly denied ever participating in sports betting. Oklahoma Athletics stated it takes such allegations seriously but is unaware of any pending NCAA investigation into the matter.</p>

          <p>The UK's National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) has issued new guidance encouraging police forces to disclose the ethnicity and nationality of suspects in high-profile and sensitive cases.

While the decision to release such information will still rest with individual forces, the new guidance seeks to create a more consistent and fair approach nationwide.</p>

The Transport Committee's report highlights that bus journeys have dropped while costs have outpaced inflation, isolating some communities. Proponents argue the measure, similar to a successful program in Scotland, would boost the economy and reduce social exclusion for young people who rely on public transport.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's automotive industry is at a critical crossroads as production has fallen to its lowest level since 1953, sparking concerns about its long-term viability. Recent closures of major plants, including Vauxhall's in Luton and Honda's in Swindon, have contributed to a significant decline in output, with high energy and labor costs making the UK an expensive place to manufacture vehicles. Experts warn that falling below a critical mass of production could dismantle the entire ecosystem, affecting thousands of jobs and regional economies. While new investments in electric vehicle and battery production offer some hope, the industry faces a monumental challenge to recover. (not investment advice)</p>

The nomination follows Trump's firing of the previous commissioner after a jobs report showed weaker-than-expected hiring.

          <p>During his holiday in the UK, U.S. Vice President JD Vance held a private meeting with senior Conservative politicians Robert Jenrick and Chris Philp in the Cotswolds. The meeting was organized by Vance's team and marks his first time meeting with the shadow justice and home secretaries, respectively, who share similar policy positions on issues like immigration and free speech. Vance's trip has included both official and private engagements, including a meeting with Foreign Secretary David Lammy. The visit occurs amid some local protests and disruptions due to the heavy security detail accompanying the vice president.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>E. J. Antoni, President Trump's nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), has previously suggested the agency should suspend its monthly jobs reports. In a recent interview, Antoni, an economist at the Heritage Foundation, questioned the accuracy of the monthly data and proposed publishing only quarterly figures until methodological issues are fixed. This stance has intensified criticism of his nomination, which followed Trump's firing of the previous BLS commissioner over a report showing slower job growth. Economists and former officials have expressed strong concern that the move politicizes a critical, nonpartisan economic agency.</p>

          <p>Alaska's Mendenhall Glacier has begun to release a massive volume of trapped rainwater and snowmelt, prompting officials to issue evacuation warnings for residents in parts of Juneau. The glacial outburst is causing the Mendenhall River to rise, with the National Weather Service forecasting a potential record-breaking crest on Wednesday. This annual event occurs when water dammed by the glacier in Suicide Basin builds enough pressure to escape, threatening homes and property downstream. In recent years, these floods have become more severe, sweeping away houses and causing widespread damage, leading to the installation of a temporary levy this year.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that a key aspect of Donald Trump's political strategy is forcing his opponents into choosing between difficult, often compromising, options. The piece cites several examples, including Democrats considering mid-decade gerrymandering to counter Republican efforts, despite previously championing fairer maps. It also points to the dilemmas faced by officials during his first term, prosecutors deciding whether to charge a former president, and city mayors navigating his use of federal forces. The author contends that by creating these no-win scenarios, Trump challenges the principles of his adversaries and puts them in a position where any action can be politically perilous.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department's annual review of human rights in China, while pared back in length as part of a broader report restructuring, has retained its sharp criticism of Beijing's conduct. The report, which catalogues alleged violations, was released after a months-long delay amid controversy that the Trump administration might soften its stance on human rights abuses. The China section continues to be a comprehensive assessment used by Congress to inform policy decisions, such as foreign aid and security assistance. The release was notably subdued this year, lacking the traditional launch event led by the Secretary of State.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly stated that Ukraine will not give up the Donbas region in exchange for a ceasefire, warning that such a concession would only serve as a Russian springboard for future attacks. His comments come as Russian troops have reportedly advanced 10 kilometers near the eastern town of Dobropillia, a move Zelenskyy characterized as an attempt to create a favorable narrative ahead of President Putin's meeting with President Trump. Zelenskyy expressed frustration at being excluded from the Alaska summit, arguing that any talks about Ukraine without its participation are counterproductive.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump publicly criticized Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, suggesting he should fire the bank's chief economist over predictions about the economic impact of tariffs. In a social media post, Trump claimed tariffs were generating massive revenue for the U.S. without causing inflation, contrary to a recent Goldman Sachs report. The report, led by chief economist Jan Hatzius, warned that American consumers will ultimately bear an increasing share of tariff costs. Trump retorted that Solomon should either get a new economist or "just focus on being a DJ," a reference to the CEO's side hobby.</p>

Despite this, Zelenskyy remains wary, stating that Putin is simultaneously preparing for new military offensives and that any peace talks must involve Ukraine to be legitimate.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that China's construction of a massive dam on the Yarlung Tsangpo (Brahmaputra) River, while causing anxiety in downstream nations like India and Bangladesh, also offers a chance to build confidence. The author suggests that amid rising water-related political tensions in South Asia, this project could serve as a catalyst for establishing robust transboundary water diplomacy. Hailed by China as a landmark clean energy project, the dam's geopolitical implications are undeniable. The article posits that transparent engagement from Beijing regarding the dam's operations could help mitigate regional fears and foster much-needed cooperation on shared water resources.</p>

          <p>Approximately 800 National Guard troops have begun deploying in Washington D.C. after President Trump assumed federal control over the city's police force, a move he justified by labeling the capital a "lawless city." Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser, who had previously called the action "unprecedented," stated the city would utilize the extra manpower. The troops will not have arrest powers but will be armed. The deployment has been met with protests and comes despite Department of Justice data showing a 35% decrease in violent crime in Washington since 2023, raising questions about the necessity of the federal intervention.</p>

          <p>In a town hall for Census Bureau employees, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick acknowledged that Congress, not the president, has the final authority over the national census. His comments came less than a week after President Trump called for a "new" census and appear to recognize the legal hurdles facing any attempt to conduct a count before the scheduled 2030 census. Lutnick also suggested that the census should differentiate between legal residents and those in the country without legal status. This reflects an ongoing Republican push to use census data to redraw electoral maps in their favor before the next election cycle.</p>
