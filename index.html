          <p>Former President Barack Obama held a virtual meeting to encourage Texas House Democrats who had left the state to prevent the passage of a Republican-led redistricting plan. He praised their actions as a crucial stand against partisan gerrymandering, stating their courage helps set the tone for a long struggle to protect democracy. The meeting, also attended by former Attorney General Eric Holder, highlighted national Democratic support for the state-level effort to counter what they describe as a systematic assault on voting rights.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, a socialist candidate for New York City mayor, is facing increased scrutiny over his tenancy in a rent-stabilized apartment while earning an annual income near $150,000. The criticism has been amplified by an official ethics complaint filed by a watchdog group, which questions the circumstances under which he secured the affordable housing unit. Mamdani has defended himself by stating he was unaware the apartment was rent-stabilized when he moved in and was earning a much lower salary at the time.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer argued that investors should not exit the stock market even if it appears 'frothy,' asserting that the current environment is different from the dot-com bubble. He contends that for every instance of irrational exuberance, such as the explosive gains of some recent IPOs, there are powerful, rational stories driving stocks like Amazon and Eli Lilly. Cramer's view is that the strength of these fundamentally sound companies is enough to overwhelm market speculation and justify continued investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge in Texas has indicated he will dismiss a lawsuit filed against a state law that restricts property ownership and leasing by Chinese citizens. The judge is reportedly dismissing the case on the grounds of standing, meaning the plaintiffs do not have the legal right to sue. The law, which is set to be implemented soon, has been challenged by civil rights groups as discriminatory and unconstitutional, and the lawyer for the plaintiffs has announced plans to appeal the court's decision.</p>

          <p>Data analytics company Palantir has experienced a dramatic surge since its 2020 public debut, with its stock growing over 1,700% and its valuation surpassing $430 billion. A key driver of this growth has been its lucrative contracts with the U.S. government, which accounted for 55% of its revenue last quarter, including a major new agreement with the U.S. Army. While its commercial sector is also showing promise, investors are paying a significant premium for the stock, reflecting high expectations for its AI-powered platforms. (not investment advice)</p>

The ongoing outbreaks highlight a failure to control the virus, which is now becoming further entrenched in human populations across the African continent.</p>
