            <p>A plane carrying six individuals crashed in an open field near Copake, New York, resulting in at least one fatality. The NTSB is leading the investigation, revealing that the plane was intact before a high-speed descent, and air traffic control received no distress call. Among the passengers was Karenna Groff, an NYU medical student and former MIT soccer player, who tragically lost her life. The crash site's muddy conditions complicate access, and the cause of the crash remains unclear as authorities continue their investigation.</p>

The LifeX 2035 Term Income ETF (LDDR) offers a similar approach by investing in treasuries with maturities up to 10 years, distributing monthly income until 2035. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump's focus on acquiring Greenland has ignited a sense of defiance on the isolated Arctic island, with residents asserting they are not for sale but open for business. The U.S.'s interest in Greenland dates back centuries, but Trump's approach has prompted a reassessment of the territory's relationship with Denmark. Greenlanders are uniting behind a mantra of self-determination, emphasizing their desire to maintain control over their future and resources.</p>

            <p>A landmark antitrust trial against Meta has commenced, potentially forcing Mark Zuckerberg to sell Instagram. The FTC alleges that Meta's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp eliminated competition, creating a monopoly. Zuckerberg has reportedly lobbied Trump to drop the case, which could become politicized during Trump's second term. The FTC's case hinges on whether consumers are better off as a result of the mergers, with Zuckerberg's own words potentially serving as key evidence.</p>
