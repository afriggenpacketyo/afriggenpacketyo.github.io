          <h2>Volkswagen Lowers Financial Outlook as US Tariffs and EV Shift Impact Profits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 02:35:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German automaker Volkswagen has significantly lowered its full-year financial guidance after reporting a 29% drop in second-quarter operating profit, falling to 3.83 billion euros. The company attributes the decline to the impact of U.S. import tariffs, restructuring costs, and a strategic shift toward selling all-electric models, which currently have lower profit margins. Consequently, Volkswagen has revised its 2025 operating return on sales forecast downward and now expects full-year sales to be flat compared to the previous year, highlighting a challenging market with ongoing trade uncertainties.

          <p>India is under increasing pressure to secure a trade agreement with the United States before an August 1 deadline, after which certain U.S. tariffs are set to rise. The urgency has grown following a recent U.S.-Japan trade deal that addressed similar issues, such as market access for agricultural products, a sensitive sector for India. Analysts suggest that the U.S. also has strategic incentives to finalize a deal, viewing India as a crucial partner to counterbalance China's manufacturing dominance in the Indo-Pacific. India's role within the BRICS bloc is also seen as a potential bargaining chip in negotiations with Washington.</p>

          <h2>Federal Appeals Court Declares California's Ammunition Background Check Law Unconstitutional</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 02:18:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel has ruled that California's law requiring background checks for all ammunition purchases is unconstitutional, stating it infringes upon the Second Amendment. In a 2-1 decision, the court found the state failed to demonstrate the law aligns with the nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation, a standard set by a 2022 Supreme Court ruling. Governor Gavin Newsom condemned the decision as a setback for gun violence prevention, while gun rights advocates celebrated it as a victory against overreaching government control. The state may appeal the ruling to a larger panel or the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>China has stepped into a mediation role regarding the escalating border conflict between Thailand and Cambodia, calling for both nations to exercise restraint and de-escalate the situation. A Chinese official emphasized that as friendly neighbors and important ASEAN members, both countries should resolve their differences peacefully. The statement comes after intense clashes, including artillery and rocket fire, erupted along their shared border on Thursday.

          <p>International aid organizations are sounding the alarm over a severe and worsening hunger crisis in Gaza, where a significant portion of the population is facing starvation.

The World Health Organization has described the situation as "mass starvation," while the World Food Program reports that a third of the population, including children, goes multiple days without eating.

          <p>Former UFC middleweight champion Robert Whittaker is preparing for his return to the octagon against Reinier de Ridder in Abu Dhabi, nine months after a severe jaw injury. During his last fight, a face crank submission caused his bottom teeth to cave in, requiring surgery to remove several teeth and install implants, a procedure he says has ultimately improved his life. Despite the unsettling nature of the injury, Whittaker maintains a positive outlook, stating his current motivation is to be a role model for his children rather than just regaining the title. He is training for a challenging, lengthy bout.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that France will officially recognize Palestine as a state, a significant diplomatic move amid the ongoing war and humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

The Palestinian Authority welcomed the announcement, while the Israeli government strongly condemned it, arguing it rewards terrorism. The move makes France the largest Western power to take this step, potentially encouraging other European nations to follow suit as international pressure on Israel mounts.</p>

          <p>Resident doctors in England have commenced a five-day strike as their pay dispute with the government continues, marking the twelfth such walkout. Health Secretary Wes Streeting has pledged to minimize disruption, instructing hospitals to avoid canceling treatments except in exceptional circumstances, a shift from previous strikes that focused primarily on emergency care. The British Medical Association (BMA) warns this approach could stretch staff too thinly and reiterated that restoring pay, which they claim has fallen by a fifth since 2008 in real terms, is the only way to resolve the dispute. The strike is expected to impact NHS services despite efforts to maintain operations.</p>

While the International FA Board (Ifab) regularly discusses VAR's future, Bullingham stated the FA's position is that the current model is in a good place.

          <p>Ranchers in southern Mexico are battling a severe outbreak of the New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite infecting cattle and other animals, which has prompted the U.S. to bar Mexican cattle imports.

A U.S.-supported plant to produce sterile flies for eradication won't be ready until next year, leaving ranchers to face the costly problem largely on their own.

The deal is set to support both nations' nuclear-powered submarine programs, generate tens of thousands of jobs, and potentially deliver £20 billion in British exports over 25 years. UK and Australian officials emphasized the partnership's importance for collective security in the Indo-Pacific. The move comes as the U.S. reviews its commitment amid concerns over China's military expansion in the region.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell had a public disagreement over the cost of the Fed's extensive headquarters renovation during a joint site visit. Trump insisted the project's cost had risen to $3.1 billion, a figure Powell disputed, explaining it incorrectly included a building completed five years ago. Despite the tense exchange and Trump's previous suggestions that cost overruns could be a fireable offense, the president stated firing Powell was not necessary. He did, however, reiterate his strong desire for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates to spur economic growth.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County public health officials have confirmed that an international traveler with measles passed through Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and stayed at a nearby Hilton hotel while infectious earlier this month. The department is urging anyone who was at LAX on July 5 or the Hilton Los Angeles Airport between July 5 and July 7 to monitor for symptoms and verify their vaccination status. This exposure comes amid the largest U.S. measles outbreak in decades, with officials warning that summer travel can heighten transmission risks. They emphasized that the MMR vaccine is the most effective protection against the highly contagious illness.</p>

          <p>The mountain village of Ruidoso, New Mexico, experienced another round of severe flash flooding on Thursday due to heavy afternoon rainfall, leading to road closures and multiple rescues. Video on social media captured a home being swept away by the rushing waters, a consequence of past wildfires that have left the surrounding hillsides unable to absorb the rain. This event follows deadly flooding earlier in the month that killed at least three people. The National Weather Service has been issuing routine flood warnings for the area as the summer rainy season continues to inundate the vulnerable, fire-scarred landscape.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has employed an unorthodox legal maneuver to ensure Alina Habba, the president's former personal attorney, remains in charge of the U.S. Attorney's Office in New Jersey. After federal judges in the state selected a different candidate, the White House withdrew Habba's official nomination just before her interim term expired and then re-appointed her as the acting U.S. Attorney. This move appears to exploit a vacancy law to restart the clock on her temporary tenure. The action effectively bypasses the judicial selection process and has been criticized as a politicization of the justice system.</p>

The workers are located in the Red Chris mine, where a remote-controlled scoop is being used to clear a large debris pile blocking their exit. Officials from the mining firm Newmont stated the trio has access to sufficient air, food, and water in a designated refuge chamber. However, communication was lost after a second cave-in occurred, complicating the rescue. Specialized drones are being used to assess the underground area as teams work to re-establish contact and safely clear the blockage.</p>

The plaintiffs, who include a longtime federal prosecutor who handled January 6 cases and the department's former top ethics official, argue their terminations were unlawful. They claim they were fired via one-page memos that cited presidential power but offered no specific reason, violating procedures that protect civil servants from arbitrary removal. The lawsuit seeks their immediate reinstatement and back pay, adding to the controversy surrounding a wave of dismissals from the agency under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>A research team from China's Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics has achieved a scientific first by directly observing and measuring quantum friction. The experiment, conducted using folded graphene, revealed a counterintuitive effect where friction did not uniformly increase with the material's thickness; in some cases, thicker layers exhibited less friction. This phenomenon was traced to how bending the material altered electron movement, restricting energy loss as heat. The discovery, published in Nature Communications, could pave the way for creating ultra-efficient, low-wear nanoscale devices and advanced quantum materials.</p>

          <p>CIA Director John Ratcliffe strongly supported the recent public release of a sensitive 2017 House Intelligence Committee report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, according to a CIA spokesperson. The declassification, led by DNI Tulsi Gabbard, has sparked concerns about risks to intelligence sources and methods. Gabbard claims the documents show Obama-era officials manufactured a narrative to undermine President Trump. The report, which questioned the analysis of a key CIA source in Russia, was declassified by Trump with few redactions, a move that critics like Sen. Mark Warner called "desperate and irresponsible."</p>

          <p>Princeton, Texas, located 30 miles north of Dallas, has been named the fastest-growing city in the U.S., its population surging from 17,000 in 2020 to 37,000 last year. The boom is driven by affordable housing, with homes selling for around $300,000 in a county where the median price is nearly $475,000. This explosive growth has created significant growing pains, forcing the city to temporarily halt construction to allow infrastructure like sewer lines, water, and roads to catch up. With another 13,000 homes already approved, Princeton is racing to manage its development as it is projected to reach 100,000 residents within five years.</p>
