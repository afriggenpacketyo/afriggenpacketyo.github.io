The new government's efforts have been aided by the United States' decision to lift most sanctions, which is intended to encourage financial recovery. However, progress is being significantly hampered by a severe lack of liquidity within the country. This financial shortfall poses a major obstacle to stabilizing the nation and establishing a functional economy for its citizens.</p>

          <p>Even with the annual inflation rate holding steady at 2.7%, financial experts suggest that pursuing debt forgiveness remains a sensible strategy for many Americans. The primary reason is that credit card interest rates are still near historic highs, with average rates around 22%. This creates a massive gap between the rate at which debt grows and the rate at which money loses purchasing power to inflation. Given ongoing economic uncertainties, such as the potential impact of tariffs, addressing high-interest debt now can provide crucial financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>E. J. Antoni, President Trump's nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), recently suggested that the agency should consider suspending its monthly jobs reports. In an interview before his nomination, Antoni, an economist from the Heritage Foundation, questioned the accuracy of the monthly data and argued the BLS should rely on its more accurate quarterly data until methodological issues are fixed. The nomination follows the recent firing of the previous BLS commissioner, whom Trump accused of "rigging" jobs data after downward revisions were made to previous months' figures.</p>

          <p>Employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta are recalling the terrifying moments when a gunman fired at least 180 shots at their office buildings, killing a responding police officer. The shooter, who died from a self-inflicted gunshot, was found to have expressed discontent with the COVID-19 vaccine. CDC workers described harrowing experiences, from hiding in bathrooms to being near windows that were shot out. Some employees expressed frustration with what they perceive as a lack of security and leadership, stating the attack was "shocking but not surprising."</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department under the Trump administration has published a significantly altered version of its annual global human rights report. The new document has been downscaled, with reduced criticism of U.S. allies like Israel and increased disapproval of perceived adversaries such as Brazil. Entire sections on topics like government corruption and the persecution of LGBTQ+ individuals have been eliminated from the report, which was previously considered a comprehensive global study. Critics have accused the administration of gutting the report and abandoning core U.S. values.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump publicly criticized Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon on social media, accusing the bank of making a "bad prediction" about the negative economic impact of his tariffs. Trump asserted that foreign companies and governments are absorbing the costs, not U.S. consumers, and suggested Solomon should focus on his former hobby as a DJ rather than running a major financial institution. The attack comes after a Goldman Sachs research note stated that U.S. consumers had absorbed a significant portion of the tariff costs, a view shared by many economists.</p>

          <p>Based on the latest government inflation data, policy experts are projecting that Social Security beneficiaries could receive a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in 2026. This estimated increase would be slightly higher than the 2.5% adjustment provided in 2025. The official COLA is calculated by the Social Security Administration based on inflation data from July, August, and September and is announced in October. The projection reflects the current inflationary environment and its direct impact on the financial benefits that millions of retirees and other beneficiaries depend on. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's sweeping plan to "clean up" Washington, D.C., by federalizing its police force and overhauling local policies is likely to face major obstacles. According to legal analysis, the 1973 Home Rule Act, which allows a president to assume control of the police, limits this power to a maximum of 30 days without congressional approval. Furthermore, the president lacks the direct authority to change many local laws, such as those related to cash bail or sanctuary city policies. This suggests that the initiative may be more of a symbolic exercise than a practical, long-term strategy.</p>
