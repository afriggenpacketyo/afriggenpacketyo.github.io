          <p>Democrats are accusing the Trump administration of using law enforcement to silence political opposition, citing incidents such as the handcuffing of Senator Alex Padilla and the arrests of Representative LaMonica McIver and New York City Comptroller Brad Lander. These incidents have sparked criticism that the administration is breaking norms by allowing federal law enforcement to arrest elected officials who dissent. Representative Jamie Raskin alleges that these tactics are meant to intimidate people, while the White House defends the actions by accusing Democrats of breaking the law and obstructing federal law enforcement.

The EFF condemned the decision as stifling democratic debate, asserting that Malema would not trade his revolutionary beliefs for a visa, and the party reiterated its commitment to supporting the oppressed, especially the Palestinian people.

The guidance covers various aspects of university life, including protests, debates, training, and teaching, and clarifies that Holocaust denial is not protected speech. The guidelines aim to ensure that universities remain places where free speech is protected and promoted, with students expected to engage with diverse opinions respectfully.</p>

Slim foldables are increasingly important as consumers seek devices that offer the benefits of a folding phone without compromising on thickness and weight. While the market for foldables remains small, analysts suggest that thinner designs may attract more consumers, although the overall utility of folding devices remains a key challenge.

The UN nuclear watchdog noted that there was no danger to the public after the strike from any radiological effects, and Israel's military stated that the strike targeted the component intended for plutonium production to prevent the reactor from being restored for nuclear weapons development.</p>

          <p>Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako visited Hiroshima to pay their respects to atomic bomb victims ahead of the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. During their first trip to the city since the emperor's accession in 2019, they laid white flowers and bowed deeply at a cenotaph in Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park, which holds the names of around 340,000 victims. They also visited an exhibition hall displaying relics of the bombing and listened to stories from survivors, underscoring their commitment to remembering the tragedy.</p>

          <p>Japan will dispatch two Self-Defense Forces airplanes to eastern Africa for a possible operation to evacuate its nationals from the Middle East, amid the escalating Israel-Iran conflict. Defense Minister Gen Nakatani stated that two C-2 transport aircraft with approximately 120 crew members will fly to an SDF base in Djibouti and be on standby, following a request from Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya. This measure is intended to provide a swift response capability should evacuation efforts become necessary due to the regional tensions.</p>

          <p>A Japanese district court has ordered the state to pay a total of 1.2 million yen in compensation to two asylum seekers, ruling that their repeated detentions by the immigration agency did not adequately consider their physical and mental conditions. The court found that some detentions violated international human rights covenants and amounted to unjust physical restraint, particularly when the asylum seekers' health was deteriorating. While the court dismissed claims questioning the immigration law itself, the ruling underscores the importance of considering individual circumstances during detention.</p>

          <p>The US is bracing for another hectic wildfire season, but federal fire crews are concerned that budget and staff cuts have left them underprepared. Severe cuts to budgets and staff have hamstrung the agencies that manage public lands, leading to gaps in the workforce that supports wildfire mitigation and suppression. Concerns are also rising that the Trump administration's new wildfire directive will be rushed, adding uncertainty as crews prepare for the season. The loss of support staff could mean a range of needs, from meals to medical services, will not be in place during large fires.</p>

A decade ago, Mattel released Hello Barbie, an internet-connected doll that listened to kids and used AI to respond, but it was discontinued due to security vulnerabilities. While AI can be a powerful educational tool, there are concerns about children becoming overly reliant on technology and losing the ability to use their imaginations, as well as potential privacy and security risks. Alternatives like Tonieboxes and Nex Playground offer tech-centric play without the same dystopian implications.</p>
