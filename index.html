Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated the goal is not to permanently govern the territory but to establish a security perimeter and then transfer control to allied Arab forces. This decision follows the breakdown of ceasefire negotiations and faces significant international opposition due to the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has issued a nationwide injunction, marking the fourth court order to block the Trump administration's policy aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of non-citizen parents. The ruling certifies a class action, arguing that the plaintiffs are highly likely to succeed in proving the executive order violates the 14th Amendment. This decision follows a complex legal battle and a Supreme Court ruling that limited, but did not eliminate, the power of nationwide injunctions.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance's office has clarified that he and his staff were not aware of a Secret Service request to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to raise the water level of Ohio's Little Miami River. The adjustment was made to ensure safe navigation for the Vice President's security detail during a family boating trip. The Secret Service confirmed the decision was made independently during standard planning and was deemed operationally necessary after a public safety boat ran aground.</p>

His resignation occurred just before a scheduled vote to expel him, following the dismissal of his legal challenge to remain in office. Ward, who is in custody awaiting sentencing, will no longer receive his parliamentary salary, and his departure triggers a by-election for the seat he held.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, pausing further construction at a controversial immigrant detention center in Florida known as "Alligator Alcatraz." The ruling came after environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe argued that the facility was built without required environmental impact studies, threatening the sensitive Everglades ecosystem and sacred tribal lands. While the facility can continue to house detainees, the 14-day order prevents new work, such as paving, which experts testified could cause contaminated runoff.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has begun detaining migrants who crossed the English Channel as part of a new pilot removal deal with France. Under the "one in, one out" agreement, those who arrive by small boat are eligible for immediate detention and return to France, with the UK accepting an equal number of vetted asylum seekers in exchange. A government source confirmed several dozen migrants have been detained and could be returned within weeks, a move the government says is necessary to secure the borders.</p>

          <p>Meta's launch of a new Instagram Map feature has triggered a significant backlash from users concerned about privacy and the sharing of their location data. The tool, similar to Snapchat's Snap Map, is intended to let users share their "last active location" with friends. While Instagram chief Adam Mosseri insisted the feature is opt-in by default, some users claimed their location was being shared without their consent, raising fears about stalking and other potential dangers.</p>

          <p>The UK government is drafting legislation to impose new restrictions on serious violent and sexual offenders upon their release from prison. The plan would confine offenders to specific, tailored geographical zones where they are allowed to be, rather than just excluding them from certain areas. Ministers argue this will provide victims greater peace of mind, though probation officers have raised concerns about the increased workload and monitoring pressure on an already strained service.</p>

          <p>Democrats have condemned a Texas Republican senator's claim that the FBI would assist in locating state Democratic lawmakers who fled to prevent a GOP-led redistricting effort. This development is part of a broader, aggressive push by Republicans to redraw congressional maps in their favor in states like Texas and Indiana ahead of the midterm elections. Vice President JD Vance also met with Indiana lawmakers to encourage them to redraw their state's map, highlighting a national strategy to secure a House majority through gerrymandering.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order that could pave the way for higher-risk assets like cryptocurrency and private equity to be included in 401(k) retirement plans. The order directs federal agencies to rewrite regulations, a process that could take months, to expand the types of qualified investments available in employer-sponsored plans. This move is praised by the crypto and private equity industries, which have long sought access to the trillions of dollars held in American retirement accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to lift a lower court's ban on "roving patrols" used by immigration agents in Southern California for mass deportations. A federal judge had restricted the tactic, which involved armed agents making arrests without establishing reasonable suspicion, finding it likely violated the 4th Amendment. The administration argues the ban irreparably harms its ability to enforce immigration laws in a district with a large population of undocumented immigrants, a move civil rights lawyers called "unprecedented."</p>
