        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has surpassed California in new utility-scale solar capacity, a shift driven by major utilities like Florida Power & Light rather than rooftop installations. This growth is facilitated by state rules that streamline the approval process for projects under 75 megawatts, making solar an increasingly cheaper option than natural gas. However, the industry faces future challenges from the rollback of federal tax credits and growing constraints on the existing power grid, which requires significant investment in storage and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has begun its month-long recess, leaving more than 150 of President Trump's nominations for key government positions in limbo due to partisan gridlock. The backlog significantly affects the judiciary and diplomatic corps, with ambassadorships to the United Nations and the European Union remaining unfilled. Republican leadership has condemned what they term "unprecedented" obstruction from Democrats, who in turn argue that the nominees are exceptionally flawed and unqualified, leading to a stalemate over the confirmation process.</p>

          <p>The British government is advancing new plans that could impose prison sentences of up to five years on people smugglers who use social media to advertise illegal crossings into the UK. This measure targets criminal gangs promoting dangerous journeys across the English Channel, with analysis showing that 80% of the record 25,000 migrants who made the trip this year used online platforms to connect with smugglers. The initiative is part of a broader government strategy to combat illegal immigration.</p>

          <p>New Mexico's Democratic Governor, Michelle Lujan Grisham, has denounced the new federal law overhauling Medicaid, labeling its provisions as unworkable and a significant bureaucratic burden. She argued that the funding cuts and new work requirements will jeopardize healthcare access, especially in rural communities, and that the allocated $50 billion rural hospital fund is woefully insufficient. The governor warned that the long-term effects of the federal cuts would be catastrophic for the state's healthcare system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A self-imposed deadline for a new U.S.-Canada trade agreement has passed without a deal, prolonging a six-month tariff war and creating uncertainty for businesses. While Canada now faces a 35% tariff rate on some goods, the existing CUSMA/USMCA free trade pact shields nearly 90% of its exports, providing a significant economic buffer. Analysts suggest Canada is in a position to wait for the economic impact of tariffs to increase pressure on the U.S. side, potentially improving its negotiating stance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Swiss government is urgently considering how to revise its trade offer to the United States to avoid a planned 39% tariff on its goods announced by President Trump.

Economists are warning that the steep tariff, if imposed, could trigger a recession in Switzerland's heavily export-dependent economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Multiple U.S. railroad customer groups are formally requesting that regulators block the proposed $85 billion merger between Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern. Seven associations representing shippers have voiced concerns that the deal, which would create the first coast-to-coast freight operator, would consolidate too much power, leading to higher prices and reduced service standards. This customer opposition joins that of major rail unions, who argue the merger threatens jobs and service reliability. (not investment advice)</p>
