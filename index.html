          <p>India stated its armed forces conducted strikes against Pakistan, targeting what it calls "terrorist infrastructure" in Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, following a militant attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, where 26 people were killed. The operation, named "Operation Sindoor," targeted nine sites, with the Indian Ministry of Defence emphasizing the actions were focused, measured, and non-escalatory, and that no Pakistani military facilities were targeted. Pakistan responded by stating it has every right to give a robust response to this act of war, with reports indicating retaliatory actions. The strikes have led to airspace diversions and international concern, with the U.S. monitoring the situation closely. </p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport is experiencing significant delays and cancellations, entering its ninth day of disruptions, compounded by an air traffic controller shortage and adverse weather conditions. The air traffic controllers' union reports that multiple members are on trauma leave after an equipment failure caused them to lose communication with pilots, leading to a temporary loss of radar and communication. U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy plans to announce an overhaul of the nation's aging air traffic control system to address these issues, while the FAA assures the airspace is safe but slowing the rate of arrivals. Senator Chuck Schumer is calling for an investigation into the matter.</p>

          <p>Following ICE operations in Nashville that led to the arrest of a convicted child sexual assault perpetrator and an alleged gang member, Nashville Mayor Freddie O'Connell expressed concern that these actions are not focused on making the city safer. O'Connell emphasized that the city's police department does not participate in federal immigration enforcement and lacks access to federal immigration databases. DHS responded by asserting that the Nashville Mayor should want these criminal illegal aliens off American streets, and that the American people voted for President Trump's immigration enforcement. ICE recently announced a high number of arrests and removals of illegal immigrants during President Trump’s first 100 days of his second term.</p>

          <p>The federal government is resuming collections on defaulted federal student loans, initiating an accelerated process to collect funds from borrowers' wages, tax refunds, or Social Security benefits. This action follows a five-year pause implemented during President Trump's first term as a temporary relief measure in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which was extended multiple times by the Biden administration. Over 5 million borrowers are currently in default, with an estimated 4 million more at risk of defaulting soon.

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to transport a group of immigrants to Libya on a U.S. military plane, marking a significant escalation in its deportation program, which has faced legal challenges and political debate. This decision is notable because Libya is currently embroiled in conflict, and its migrant detention centers are known for "horrific" conditions. The State Department warns against traveling to Libya due to crime, terrorism, and armed conflict. This action aligns with the administration's effort to deter illegal immigration by sending a strong message that deportees could face brutal conditions in their home countries.</p>

          <p>The Met Gala appearances of Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan and artist Diljit Dosanjh sparked disappointment among South Asian fans, who felt the stars were not given due recognition. Khan, who has a global following, was seemingly unrecognized by Vogue livestream co-hosts, while Dosanjh was quickly panned away from on the red carpet. This perceived lack of respect led to online criticism, with many expressing that the stars were not treated with the reverence they deserved given their international stature and cultural significance.</p>

          <p>Alvin Brown, the vice chair of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), was unexpectedly removed from his position by the Trump administration, a rare move that has raised questions. The removal occurred a little over a year after Brown was sworn in for a term expected to end in 2026. The decision comes as the NTSB is investigating nearly 1,250 active cases, including several high-profile incidents. The White House has not provided a reason for Brown's removal, and he has not publicly commented on the matter.</p>

However, recent tariffs have increased their import duties to 181.47%, making it financially unsustainable to continue importing from China. The company has canceled new orders from China and is struggling to find alternative foreign vendors, as many other countries also face new tariffs.</p>

This could reduce China's reliance on imported aluminium ore from Guinea and Australia.
