The investigation identified 13 missed opportunities to escalate his care, highlighting a systemic failure to value caregiver insight over clinical metrics.

          <p>The Trump administration has implemented a series of new tariffs on goods from key trading partners, arguing they protect American jobs and manufacturing. These import taxes, which include levies on steel, aluminum, and cars, have created volatility in the global economy and led some companies to raise prices for U.S. consumers. Critics argue the policy is a negotiating tactic that disrupts global trade, while the administration maintains it is necessary to reduce the U.S. trade deficit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A radar-related issue with the UK's air traffic control system, NATS, caused significant disruption to flights across the country on Wednesday. The problem led to the cancellation of over 150 flights and grounded thousands more, with experts warning that knock-on effects could last for days during the peak summer travel season. While the system was restored within an hour, airlines are demanding answers and passengers are being urged to check their flight status.</p>

          <p>Lithuanian Prime Minister Gintautas Paluckas has resigned from his position following mounting pressure from investigations into his business dealings. The probes, initiated after media reports of alleged misconduct, include scrutiny over a past conviction and a subsidized state loan his company received. Paluckas denies any wrongdoing, calling the scrutiny a "coordinated attack," but stepped down before potential impeachment proceedings. His resignation will likely trigger the fall of the entire cabinet.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Trump administration's decision to withdraw the United States from UNESCO for a second time is a significant error that undermines America's global leadership on human rights and free expression. The authors contend this move is part of a broader pattern of disengaging from international obligations and attacking cultural institutions that promote democratic ideals. They compare the withdrawal to historical examples where authoritarian regimes targeted culture, urging Congress to reverse the decision.</p>

          <p>Hospital officials in Gaza report that more than 50 Palestinians were killed and hundreds were injured after Israeli forces allegedly fired on crowds waiting for aid lorries near the Zikim crossing. The Hamas-run Civil Defence agency accused Israeli troops of shooting at the civilians, while the Israeli military stated it fired only "warning shots" and was unaware of casualties. This incident occurred as a U.S. special envoy arrived in Israel amid a worsening humanitarian crisis and warnings of famine.</p>

          <p>Shares of Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest brewer, fell sharply after the company reported a 1.9% decline in second-quarter sales volumes, which was worse than analysts had predicted. The drop was primarily driven by underperformance in China and Brazil, where demand for its beer products weakened. Despite the volume decline, the maker of Budweiser saw its revenues and operating profit increase due to higher prices, showcasing the resilience of the beer category. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of 43 peers, including distinguished lawyers, has warned the UK government that recognizing a Palestinian state would breach international law. In a letter to the attorney general, they argue that Palestine does not meet the criteria for statehood outlined in the Montevideo Convention, citing a lack of defined borders and a single effective government. This comes after the Prime Minister announced the UK would move toward recognition, a position the government defends by noting the UK is not a signatory to the convention.</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened Canada's trade deal negotiations after the country announced its intention to recognize a Palestinian state. In a social media post, Trump stated that Canada's move would make it "very hard" to secure a trade agreement, intensifying pressure just before a key tariff deadline. The statement links U.S. trade policy directly to foreign policy decisions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, creating a new point of friction between the two North American allies.

Since February, about a quarter of the agency's workforce has been lost, threatening its ability to manage grants for programs supporting rural hospitals, addiction treatment, and maternal care.

          <p>This article explores the benefits of daily journaling as a tool for self-reflection and creativity, as detailed by writer Suleika Jaouad in her book "The Book of Alchemy." Jaouad suggests that journaling is a transformative practice that helps make sense of life's challenges and can be enhanced by reading the journals of other writers for inspiration. To build a consistent practice, she advises setting a specific duration, integrating it into a daily routine, and keeping the barrier to entry low by using any available medium, from a notebook to a phone app.</p>

Advocates report that many who entered the U.S. legally through now-shuttered programs are being detained by ICE, a sharp contrast to the administration's public support for persecuted Christians. The policy overhaul has created fear and uncertainty for many faith communities who had viewed the U.S. as a safe haven from persecution.</p>
