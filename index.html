          <p>Shares of luxury automaker Ferrari suffered their worst trading day in history following the release of new financial guidance that fell short of analyst expectations. The company adjusted its full-year revenue forecast and scaled back its electric vehicle ambitions for 2030, now aiming for only 20% of its lineup to be fully electric. This revision, attributed to a client-centric approach and changing market conditions, contributed to a significant drop in both its Milan-listed and U.S.-listed stock prices, raising concerns about the company's near-term growth and operating leverage.

          <p>An Indiana murder case explores the perplexing death of Kevin Davis, who was found with fatal head injuries at the bottom of a staircase. His wife, Alison Davis, claimed he fell, but authorities later charged her with murder, suspecting she used a blunt object that was never found. A key element of the investigation involves the couple's protective pit bull, Willow, who was in an upstairs room and prevented a detective from entering, leading to speculation that the murder weapon may have been concealed inside. Alison Davis was ultimately acquitted, leaving police to wonder what might have been discovered in that room.</p>

          <p>A top Chinese resources official has asserted that China must take a more proactive and influential role in the development of international rules for deep-sea mining. In a recent article, Wu Changbin, director of the China Deep Ocean Affairs Administration, argued that as the country with the largest number of mining areas, China should play a "key guiding role" in forming the regulatory framework. This push comes as nations look to the seabed for critical minerals like cobalt and nickel, which are essential for technologies such as electric vehicles, highlighting China's strategic ambitions in global resource governance.</p>

          <p>The NBA is making a significant return to China with preseason games in Macao, marking a milestone in rebuilding its relationship with its second-largest market after a six-year hiatus. The league is looking to tap into its massive Chinese fanbase of over 425 million social media followers to drive future growth, especially as U.S. television viewership declines. This return is underscored by a renewed partnership with Alibaba and extensive community outreach, signaling a strategic effort to re-establish a strong presence. The move is seen as a positive development for the league, its partners, and fans in Asia.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-10 07:28:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has officially designated Google's search and search advertising services with "strategic market status," activating new regulatory powers. This decision follows a nine-month investigation concluding that the tech giant holds "substantial and entrenched market power," with over 90% of U.K. searches on its platform.

          <p>Japan's long-standing ruling coalition has collapsed after the junior partner, Komeito, withdrew its support for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The move jeopardizes the premiership of LDP leader Sanae Takaichi, who was expected to become the country's first female prime minister. Komeito cited the LDP's failure to adequately address a persistent political slush-fund scandal as the reason for its withdrawal, stating that a lack of clear answers made their continued support "utterly impossible." This sudden political instability has caused market nervousness and raised concerns among business leaders at a time of crucial diplomatic engagements for Japan.</p>

This move comes as recent polling suggests a tight race between Plaid, Labour, and the Reform UK party. Ap Iorwerth is attempting to frame his party as the primary alternative to both the established Labour government and the rising influence of Reform UK, aiming to broaden its appeal beyond its traditional strongholds.</p>

          <p>Russia launched one of the largest concentrated strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure of the war, using hundreds of drones and missiles to cause widespread blackouts and civilian casualties. The overnight attack damaged residential buildings in Kyiv, injuring at least 20 people, while a child was killed in the country's southeast. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the "cynical and calculated" strikes, stating they are designed to cripple the country ahead of winter. He issued an urgent plea to the U.S., Europe, and the G7 for more air defense systems and decisive action to counter the terror campaign against civilian targets.</p>

          <p>China's market regulator has opened an antitrust investigation into U.S. chip giant Qualcomm's acquisition of Israeli firm Autotalks, causing the company's shares to fall. The State Administration of Market Regulation (SAMR) announced it suspects Qualcomm of violating the country's anti-monopoly laws in the deal, which closed in June. This probe marks another instance of Chinese regulators targeting major U.S. tech companies, escalating tensions between Washington and Beijing ahead of anticipated meetings between their leaders. The move follows a similar investigation into Nvidia and new export controls on rare earths, signaling a tougher stance from Beijing.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has begun withdrawing its troops from parts of Gaza following the government's approval of a ceasefire agreement aimed at ending the two-year war with Hamas. The deal includes the release of all remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for approximately 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. As part of the initial phase, Israeli forces are retreating to a buffer zone, allowing some displaced Palestinians to attempt to return to their homes amid vast destruction. The U.S. is contributing about 200 troops to a multinational force to monitor the ceasefire, a fragile step toward stability in the devastated region.</p>

          <p>The European Commission is formally questioning four major U.S. tech platforms—Apple, Google, Snapchat, and YouTube—regarding the adequacy of their child protection measures under the Digital Services Act (DSA). Officials expressed concern that minors are not being sufficiently protected online, citing issues like easily circumvented age restrictions and algorithms that may cause addiction. The requests for information are the first step in a process that could lead to formal proceedings and substantial fines of up to 6% of a company's global turnover if a breach is established.

          <p>The appointment of journalist and media entrepreneur Bari Weiss as editor in chief of CBS News has generated significant discussion and controversy. Weiss, who founded the heterodox publication The Free Press after a high-profile departure from The New York Times, will report directly to Paramount chairman David Ellison. Her elevation is viewed by some as a strategic move by Paramount to gain favor with the Trump administration, while others see it as an attempt to restore balance to a legacy media outlet perceived as biased. The move positions Weiss, a self-described centrist, as a key figure in a high-stakes experiment to reshape a storied news organization.</p>

The 62-year-old star, currently competing on "Strictly Come Dancing," underwent a hysterectomy and radiation therapy, completing her treatment in late 2024. Kingston stated she had initially dismissed symptoms like bloating and aches as signs of aging before seeking medical help after spotting blood in her urine. She said the experience inspired her to join the dancing competition, embracing a "life is too short" philosophy, and she is now urging other women not to ignore potential health warning signs.</p>

          <p>The sudden bankruptcy of First Brands, a major auto parts supplier, has caused significant anxiety on Wall Street over potential systemic risks in the private debt market. The company collapsed after relying heavily on opaque, off-balance sheet financing, known as factoring, to borrow against its invoices, accumulating liabilities between $10 billion and $50 billion. The rapid implosion has spooked investors, who fear it may be a sign of broader instability within the largely unregulated private debt sector. Concerns are growing about a lack of transparency and the potential for contagion if other companies have similar precarious financial arrangements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is hearing arguments regarding President Trump's authority to federalize Oregon's National Guard troops for deployment in Portland. The case follows a lower court's temporary restraining order that blocked the move, which the Trump administration has challenged. State officials argue that the president's justification for the deployment, based on descriptions of widespread violence, is "untethered from reality." The legal battle tests the limits of presidential power over state-controlled military forces for domestic law enforcement, a move that many Democratic governors have fiercely opposed as a political overreach into their cities.</p>

          <p>An ancient Roman grave marker discovered in a New Orleans backyard has been traced back to a U.S. soldier who served in Italy during World War II. The soldier's granddaughter, Erin Scott O’Brien, revealed that her grandfather brought the 1,900-year-old artifact home and that it was later passed down to her. Unaware of its historical significance, she used the marble tablet as a garden decoration and left it behind when she sold the house in 2018. The new owners, an anthropologist and her husband, identified the Latin inscription and alerted experts, leading to the FBI's art crime team facilitating its repatriation to an Italian museum.</p>

The piece calls for a bold candidate, such as Gretchen Whitmer or Josh Shapiro, to begin campaigning immediately, using modern outreach methods to communicate a clear vision on key issues like housing and healthcare. An early campaign, the author contends, would capture much-needed attention and prevent Trump from having a free pass for the next three years.</p>

During the current government shutdown, he has proposed permanently firing thousands of federal employees rather than furloughing them. His actions, which critics call an unprecedented attack on the separation of powers, aim to permanently bend the bureaucracy to the president's will and prevent it from reconstituting in future administrations.</p>

Hamas, meanwhile, faces a devastated and enraged Gazan populace weary of its rule and the catastrophic consequences of the war it initiated.
