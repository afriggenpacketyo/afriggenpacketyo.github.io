          <p>Chinese smartphone company Xiaomi is challenging Apple's dominance with its new Xiaomi 15S Pro, featuring an advanced chip and a more competitive price. Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun asserts that the company's new Xring O1 chip outperforms Apple's A18 Pro on key technical metrics, including heat management during gaming. The phone starts at $764, making it significantly cheaper than Apple's iPhone 16 Pro models. Lei also announced a substantial investment in research and development over the next five years and teased the release of Xiaomi's first SUV, the YU7, in July.</p>

          <p>The government plans to move forward with sentencing reforms aimed at easing prison overcrowding, largely accepting recommendations from an Independent Sentencing Review. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated that the reforms include an "earned progression model" allowing early release for some offenders based on good behavior, but ruled out early releases for those jailed for serious violent or sexual offenses and terror offenses. Additionally, the government will expand a pilot scheme offering voluntary chemical castration to some sex offenders, with potential plans to make it mandatory. Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick criticized the plans, while Mahmood defended them by pointing out the prior government's inaction on prison construction.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to release a report from the White Houseâ€™s Make America Healthy Again Commission, led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., identifying ultra-processed foods, vaccination, and environmental toxins as key drivers of chronic disease in children. The report, while not offering specific policy prescriptions, aims to highlight the nation's health crisis and suggest areas for further investigation and reform. The report has already faced pushback from Republicans and the agriculture industry, particularly regarding its focus on agricultural chemicals like glyphosate. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith cautioned against insinuating that glyphosate is unsafe, emphasizing its importance to farmers, while Kennedy assured her that the commission would not jeopardize their business model.</p>

          <p>Parents in Loudoun County, Virginia, are protesting the school board's investigation of three male students who complained about a transgender student in their locker room. The Loudoun County Public Schools are investigating the boys for Title IX violations after they were recorded questioning the presence of "a girl" in the male locker room. Scott Smith, whose daughter was a victim of sexual assault by a trans student in 2021, accused the board of victimizing innocent children. The school board's policy 8040, which allows students to use restrooms and locker rooms aligning with their gender identity, remains controversial.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House Republicans passed a major tax and spending bill that included a provision to raise the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, a move that has caused significant division within the party. The SALT deduction allows Americans to deduct some of what they pay in state and local taxes from their federal taxes, but the cap was set at $10,000 by Trump's tax cuts in 2017. Raising the cap is seen as benefiting mostly wealthy earners in high-tax states, leading to pressure from lawmakers in those states to make changes, highlighting the fragile political process in Congress.</p>

          <p>Lenovo Group said it is facing unexpected challenges from the latest US-China tariffs, despite strong annual results driven by demand for artificial intelligence (AI) products. The company reported a 21% increase in revenue for the year ended March 31, reaching $69.1 billion, with net income rising 37% to $1.4 billion. However, CEO Yang Yuanqing warned that the sudden implementation of 20% tariffs by the Trump administration in March caught the company off guard and negatively impacted its most recent quarter.</p>

          <p>During a tense exchange in the White House, Donald Trump confronted President Cyril Ramaphosa with contested claims about the killings of white farmers in South Africa. Trump presented a video of crosses claiming they marked graves of murdered farmers, but the crosses were from a protest against the murder of a farming couple. While South Africa has a high murder rate, figures do not support claims of "white genocide." Trump also played footage of anti-apartheid songs, falsely claiming those leading the singing were government officials.</p>

          <p>A sell-off in global bonds is intensifying as Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating and President Donald Trump's tax bill have heightened fiscal concerns among investors. The U.S. 30-year Treasury yield broke above 5%, while Japan's 40-year government bond yield hit a record high. The sell-off is driven by unease with worsening fiscal trajectories and structural factors in various markets.

Moody's recent downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt has also contributed to Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against fiat instability.
