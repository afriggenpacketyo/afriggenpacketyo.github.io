          <p>Dallas Cowboys star receiver CeeDee Lamb, who was not playing in the preseason game, was inadvertently knocked to the ground by a sprinting official on the sideline. Despite being the one who was hit from behind, Lamb and the Cowboys were assessed a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for making contact with an official. Lamb was uninjured and seen laughing about the unusual and bizarre incident with his teammates on the bench.</p>

Ecker initially told police that Pennig had shot herself in the bathroom, but investigators grew suspicious due to inconsistencies in his story and forensic evidence. A key piece of evidence was a small metal part from a broken door lock found under the victim's body, which suggested to prosecutors the door was forced open before the fatal shot was fired.</p>

          <p>The government of Niger is investigating the recent $4.3 million auction of a massive Martian meteorite that was discovered within its Sahara Desert region. Officials have raised serious concerns about the legality of the rock's export, suggesting it may have been part of an illicit trafficking operation. While Sotheby's auction house maintains all procedures were followed, the incident has highlighted the legal ambiguities and ethical debates surrounding the international trade of natural heritage found in developing nations.</p>

          <h2>The Appeal of "So Bad They're Good" Films Explained Amidst Poor Reviews for New Movie</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new adaptation of "War of the Worlds" starring Ice Cube has been so poorly received that it has sparked a wider discussion about why audiences are often drawn to "bad" movies. Critics and film enthusiasts suggest that earnestly made but technically flawed films can be more entertaining and memorable than bland, forgettable blockbusters. The charm often lies in their unintentional humor and visible production struggles, which can create a unique and beloved cult following for movies deemed "so bad they're good."</p>

          <p>The release of China's DeepSeek AI app six months ago sent a shockwave through Silicon Valley, challenging the notion that bigger is always better in AI development. The article reflects on how DeepSeek's efficiency demonstrated that capable models could be built with fewer resources, altering some industry perspectives. While concerns about its links to the Chinese government remain, its arrival marked a turning point in the U.S.-China AI rivalry and spurred a new focus on smaller, more efficient models.</p>

          <p>The man who opened fire on the CDC campus in Atlanta, killing a police officer, was reportedly motivated by a belief that the COVID-19 vaccine had made him depressed and suicidal.
