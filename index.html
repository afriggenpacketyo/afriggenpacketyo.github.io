          <p>Pinterest's stock dropped over 10% after its second-quarter earnings per share missed analyst expectations, though revenue and user growth surpassed forecasts. The company reported a 17% year-over-year increase in sales and a significant jump in net income compared to the previous year. Despite the stock's decline, Pinterest provided a strong sales forecast for the third quarter, projecting revenue that exceeds current analyst estimates. The report also highlighted that Gen Z now constitutes over half of the platform's user base. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated his economic advisor, Stephen Miran, to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors for a term ending in January 2026. Miran is a past critic of the Fed's stimulus policies and is known for authoring a controversial plan to devalue the U.S. dollar. His nomination is seen by some as a move to install a dissenting voice on the board to advocate for the administration's desire for lower interest rates. The appointment requires Senate confirmation, which is unlikely before September. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite the positive financial report, CEO Peter Jackson expressed concern over rising state taxes on sports betting, particularly in Illinois. He warned that high taxes could negatively impact casual users and potentially push gamblers toward illegal offshore sportsbooks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Chargers star left tackle Rashawn Slater was carted off the field during practice with an apparent left leg injury. Slater, who recently became the highest-paid offensive lineman in NFL history, was unable to put weight on his leg and appeared visibly distraught. The injury occurred during a team drill and prompted an immediate reshuffling of the offensive line, a unit already dealing with depth issues. The severity of the injury and the amount of time Slater may miss are currently unclear.</p>

          <p>A recipe for the classic Roman dish cacio e pepe published by the UK's Good Food website has sparked fury among Italians for its inaccuracies.

An Italian restaurant association expressed its astonishment and sent letters of complaint to the site's owner and the UK ambassador in Rome.

          <p>The 23rd annual Martha's Vineyard African American Film Festival is providing a crucial platform for Black artists to showcase ambitious projects in a supportive environment. The festival features a wide array of work, from documentaries on Black infant mortality to new projects from legends like Slick Rick and producer Mara Brock Akil. The event is celebrated as a vital space for community and encouragement, particularly as many Black creators face increasing hostility and reduced opportunities in the broader corporate and Hollywood landscapes.</p>

          <p>Community activists in Kern County, California, are protesting the proposed opening of a new ICE detention center at a former state prison. Organizations argue that the private company set to run the facility, CoreCivic, has a documented history of abuse and negligence. Protesters, including the iconic labor leader Dolores Huerta, are demanding transparency from local and federal officials. They are calling for public funds to be invested in community resources like education and housing rather than in what they term a for-profit prison economy.</p>

          <h2>Understanding When and How a Debt Collector Can Freeze Your Bank Account</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 15:25:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains that while a debt collector can legally freeze a consumer's bank account, they cannot do so arbitrarily. The collector must first file a lawsuit and win a court judgment against the debtor, a process that provides the consumer an opportunity to respond. Furthermore, federal and state laws protect certain types of funds from being seized, such as Social Security, disability, and veterans' benefits. Even after a freeze occurs, consumers have options, including filing exemption claims or negotiating a payment plan to have the freeze lifted.</p>

          <p>Florida's largest utility, FPL, is seeking a nearly $10 billion rate increase, which could be the largest such hike in U.S. history. The company argues the funds are necessary for grid reliability and investment in solar energy, and that customer bills would remain below the national average. However, environmental and consumer advocates are pushing back, arguing the increase would cause significant financial strain on vulnerable residents and is primarily designed to boost shareholder profits. State regulators will hold hearings before making a final decision on the proposal.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily ordered a halt to further construction at the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention camp in the Florida Everglades. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe, who argue the project violates environmental laws and threatens a fragile ecosystem. The facility can continue to operate, but the two-week restraining order prevents new paving or infrastructure work. The decision is a temporary victory for opponents who have also decried the inhumane conditions at the remote tented facility.</p>

          <p>After completing an $8 billion takeover of Paramount, new CEO David Ellison immediately faced questions regarding President Trump's claim of a deal for free airtime. Trump has stated he expects $20 million in public service announcements as part of a settlement for his lawsuit against CBS's "60 Minutes," which cleared a path for the Skydance Media acquisition. When questioned, Ellison deflected, stating his company was not involved in the settlement handled by the previous Paramount leadership. The situation raises concerns about media independence under the new ownership.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has launched GPT-5, the latest version of its influential AI model, which CEO Sam Altman claims offers "PhD-level expertise" on any topic. The company says the new model is smarter, faster, and demonstrates superior reasoning capabilities compared to its predecessors. While OpenAI is promoting a new era for its chatbot, some AI ethics experts are more cautious. They suggest the announcement may be driven by marketing hype and emphasize that the growing capabilities of such models make the need for comprehensive regulation increasingly urgent.</p>

          <p>A U.S. envoy has publicly called for Panama to replace the operator of key ports at the Panama Canal, labeling the company a subsidiary of the Chinese Communist Party.

His remarks escalate geopolitical tensions and come as Panama's comptroller general has filed lawsuits seeking to annul the company's 25-year contract renewal, alleging constitutional and financial irregularities in the process.</p>

          <p>A California jury has ruled that Meta violated state privacy law by collecting sensitive user data from the period-tracking app Flo Health. The class-action lawsuit alleged that Flo shared intimate reproductive health information with companies like Meta and Google without users' consent, despite promising privacy. While other companies settled, Meta took the case to trial and lost, a verdict that lead trial lawyers say sends a clear message about holding Big Tech accountable for profiting from users' private data. Meta has stated it disagrees with the ruling and plans to appeal.</p>

          <p>A new sneaker collaboration between designer Willy Chavarría and Adidas has ignited a controversy over cultural appropriation. The shoe, which incorporates the woven leather design of traditional Mexican huaraches, has drawn backlash for profiting from Indigenous craft without crediting or collaborating with the artisan communities that originated it. Critics have pointed out the shoe is made in China, not Mexico, and the government of Oaxaca is reportedly preparing legal action. The incident has sparked a broader conversation about representation and exploitation in the fashion industry.</p>
