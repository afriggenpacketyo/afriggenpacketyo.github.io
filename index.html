          <h2>Cardiologist Explains Risks of Extreme Summer Heat on Heart Health</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 05:00:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A cardiologist from the Miami Cardiac & Vascular Institute explains that extreme summer heat forces the heart to work harder to maintain stable blood pressure. As the body heats up, blood vessels widen to cool down, increasing the heart's oxygen demand and strain. Studies show that even minor temperature increases can significantly raise heart rates and the risk of cardiovascular events like heart attacks, especially for those with pre-existing conditions. The article advises staying hydrated, avoiding midday heat, and watching for warning signs such as chest tightness, shortness of breath, or dizziness to prevent serious cardiac stress.</p>

          <p>A vast tomb site in northwest China, dating back to the Western Xia dynasty (1038–1227), has been officially recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Located near the city of Yinchuan, the 40-square-kilometer area includes nine imperial mausoleums and over 270 subordinate tombs belonging to the Tangut people. The site also features ancient flood control structures and a large architectural complex used for worship and management. According to the World Heritage Committee, this designation acknowledges the site as a significant testament to the cultural fusion and interaction between diverse traditions during that historical period.</p>

          <p>Boxer Katie Taylor secured a decisive majority-decision victory over Amanda Serrano, concluding their historic trilogy with a 3-0 record. The fight, which headlined an all-female card at Madison Square Garden, was described as a smart, tactical performance by Taylor, who effectively used movement to control the bout. After two previously close and debated fights, this win provided clear closure to their rivalry. Taylor expressed immense pride in the event's significance for women's sports and savored the victory, reflecting on a career milestone she had dreamed of since childhood while remaining non-committal about her next steps.</p>

          <p>This article details President Trump's recent trade policy actions, specifically the letters sent to foreign leaders outlining his intent to impose significant tariffs starting August 1. This approach follows a 90-day "pause" where a global 10% tariff was implemented, with the promise of negotiating individual deals. With the pause ending, countries without new agreements face a return to higher, previously announced tariff rates. The article explains that these letters represent a radical and uncertain trade strategy, leaving room for negotiation but also creating market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump visited Central Texas after catastrophic flooding, praising the state and local response while meeting with officials and victims' families. The visit occurred against a backdrop of questions regarding the future of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which Trump has previously suggested overhauling to place more responsibility on states. While local leaders emphasized state-led recovery efforts, the administration has not clarified its long-term plans for the federal agency. The article notes the crucial role FEMA plays in large-scale disasters that overwhelm state resources, leaving its future direction uncertain.</p>

          <p>Following deadly floods in Texas, this article provides a guide for homeowners and renters on how to assess a property's flood risk. It highlights that as the climate changes, flooding is becoming more common, even outside official FEMA flood zones. Key steps include researching a property's flood history, using online tools to predict future risk, and understanding FEMA flood maps, which can be outdated. The article also advises inquiring about the cost and coverage of flood insurance, as it is typically not included in standard homeowner policies, and knowing state-specific disclosure laws.</p>

          <p>A preliminary report on the Air India crash that killed 260 people in Ahmedabad, India, reveals critical details about the flight's final moments. The investigation found that fuel-control switches were moved to the "cut-off" position seconds after takeoff, starving the engines of fuel and causing a total power loss. Cockpit voice recordings captured one pilot asking the other why they cut the fuel, which was met with a denial. The plane, bound for London, crashed less than a minute after departure, hitting a hospital building and killing 19 on the ground. A comprehensive investigation is ongoing.</p>

          <p>A farm worker has reportedly died from injuries sustained during an immigration raid on a cannabis farm in Southern California, where about 200 undocumented migrants were arrested. According to the United Farm Workers union, the death was a result of the enforcement action. However, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson stated the man was not being pursued when he climbed onto a greenhouse roof and fell. The incident is part of a broader crackdown on illegal immigration, sparking protests and drawing sharp commentary from President Trump, who authorized agents to use necessary means to arrest protesters.</p>

          <p>As President Trump's administration builds ties with far-right parties in Europe, France's National Rally is adopting a cautious and distant approach. Despite ideological alignment on issues like nationalism and immigration, the party, led by Marine Le Pen, is wary of a close association with Trump. This balancing act is driven by factors including traditional French skepticism of US influence, the potential negative impact of US tariffs on their voter base, and widespread French antipathy towards Trump. The National Rally is focused on a strategy of "vote maximalization" for the 2027 presidential election, requiring it to appear moderate and avoid alienating voters.</p>

          <p>A proposal by Germany's Education Minister Karin Prien to consider a quota limiting the number of immigrant children in school classes has ignited a fierce debate. Proponents, like the German Teachers' Association, acknowledge the challenges of teaching in classes with many non-native German speakers, but question the feasibility and social cohesion of such quotas. Critics, including school principals and the national student body, argue it is discriminatory, stigmatizing, and impractical, especially in diverse urban areas. The debate highlights broader systemic issues in German education, such as teacher shortages and underperformance in international comparisons, regardless of students' backgrounds.</p>

The author suggests that hope lies not in legal institutions, which lack enforcement, but in Palestinian resilience and the spirit of "sumoud" (steadfastness).

The research fellow argues that underlying tensions between the tech elite and the MAGA camp could undermine this coalition's efforts to reshape US politics. The trend of tech executives deepening ties with the US defense industry is highlighted as a key development.</p>

          <p>Evacuations have been ordered for residents and visitors on the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona due to advancing wildfires. One blaze, the Dragon Bravo Fire, was sparked by lightning and has been growing, prompting officials to issue an immediate evacuation order. A larger fire, the White Sage Fire, is burning just north of the park, also forcing evacuations and road closures. Firefighting efforts are being challenged by strong winds, low humidity, and dry conditions in rugged terrain. The incidents are part of a broader trend of increased wildfire risk in the western US due to hot, dry weather.</p>

          <p>Google has announced a significant move in the AI talent war, hiring Varun Mohan, the co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior R&D staff. The deal, valued at $2.4 billion, primarily consists of licensing fees for Windsurf's technology and compensation for the new hires, rather than a full acquisition of the company. This strategic hiring comes after Windsurf was reportedly in acquisition talks with rival OpenAI. The move highlights the intense competition among tech giants to secure top talent in the rapidly advancing field of artificial intelligence. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order barring the Trump administration from conducting indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests in seven Southern California counties. The ruling responds to a lawsuit from advocacy groups alleging that federal agents have been using unconstitutional tactics, including racial profiling that systematically targets Latino communities. Judge Maame E. Frimpong's order prohibits agents from using factors like race, accent, or presence at certain locations as the sole basis for a stop. The judge noted there was a "mountain of evidence" supporting the claims that these violations were occurring during the administration's ongoing immigration crackdown.</p>

          <h2>Prada to Collaborate with Indian Artisans Following Sandal Design Backlash</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 23:22:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to a controversy over sandals that closely resembled traditional Indian footwear, luxury brand Prada has announced plans to partner with Indian artisans. The issue arose after Prada showcased "leather sandals" at Milan Men's Fashion Week that critics, politicians, and craftspeople identified as Kolhapuri chappals, a culturally significant design from Maharashtra, India. Following a social media outcry and calls for acknowledgement from a local chamber of commerce, Prada initiated talks to discuss future collaborations. This move is seen as a step toward respectful engagement between global fashion houses and the traditional communities whose heritage inspires their designs.</p>
