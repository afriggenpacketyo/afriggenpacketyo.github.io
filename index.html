          <p>In a significant display of military force, three U.S. Air Force B-52 bombers flew near the coast of Venezuela. This action follows President Trump's confirmation of authorized CIA operations within the country, citing concerns over migrant and drug flows. The administration is also reportedly considering land-based strikes and has recently publicized lethal force against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean. The use of the nuclear-capable bombers escalates tensions and underscores the administration's aggressive stance toward the Venezuelan government.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen visited six Western Balkan nations to discuss their potential EU membership, economic growth, and necessary political reforms. During her trip, she praised Montenegro as a "frontrunner" for accession while urging Serbia to align with EU sanctions against Russia and improve its record on the rule of law and media freedom. The visit highlights the EU's geopolitical interest in stabilizing the region and countering Russian influence, though von der Leyen emphasized that accession criteria will not be lowered for candidate countries.</p>

          <p>U.S. Capitol Police are investigating the distribution of American flags to multiple congressional offices that contain a hidden swastika pattern. The symbol is reportedly difficult to see with the naked eye but becomes visible when photographed or filmed, described by sources as an "optical illusion." The investigation aims to identify the group responsible for distributing the flags and determine whether the act was intended to covertly spread hate symbols or embarrass lawmakers. Representative Dave Taylor, in whose office one flag was found, has condemned the symbol in the strongest terms.</p>

          <p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune has announced plans to soon advance a bill imposing new economic sanctions on Russia, stating that "the time has come" for a vote. The legislation, which has strong bipartisan support with 85 co-sponsors, aims to increase pressure on Moscow to end its war in Ukraine. The bill's progress had previously been stalled due to other foreign policy priorities and White House concerns over implementation details. The renewed push follows a recent phone call between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, with lawmakers aiming to send a clear message to the Kremlin.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC jointly announced the rescission of rules requiring banks to prepare for financial risks associated with climate change. The regulators argued the principles were redundant, as existing standards already require institutions to manage risks commensurate with their operations. The move was praised by Fed Governor Michelle Bowman as a way to refocus supervision on material financial risks and reduce compliance burdens. However, it drew criticism from former Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr, who called the decision "shortsighted" and warned it would make the financial system riskier.</p>

While the Fed's benchmark rate directly influences the prime rate, which variable-rate cards are tied to, analysis shows average card rates have fallen only marginally. Experts suggest that card issuers are cautious due to credit conditions and that the market remains highly competitive, with some retail cards even increasing their rates.

          <p>This article explains that while debt settlement can be an effective strategy for reducing unsecured debts like credit card balances, many types of financial obligations do not qualify. Generally, debts that are either secured by collateral or backed by government authority are excluded from typical settlement programs. This includes mortgages, auto loans, federal student loans, tax debts, and court-ordered payments like child support and alimony. For these specific debts, alternative solutions such as refinancing, specialized government repayment plans, or bankruptcy may be more appropriate avenues for relief.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by S&P Global projects that President Trump's tariffs will impose over $1.2 trillion in additional costs on global businesses in 2025. The report suggests this figure is a conservative estimate and indicates that the majority of this financial burden will be passed on to consumers. According to the analysis, companies will likely absorb only about one-third of the costs, with consumers bearing the remaining two-thirds through higher prices. The findings challenge the administration's assertion that foreign exporters would primarily bear the cost of the levies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite economic uncertainty, U.S. consumers are expected to spend robustly on Halloween this year, according to a new survey from PwC. Nearly 80% of Americans plan to participate in Halloween festivities, with average spending projected at $289 per person. Parents with young children are expected to spend even more, at an average of $445. The survey indicates that spending will be distributed across costumes, decorations, party supplies, and candy for trick-or-treaters. The strong forecast suggests that consumers are prioritizing seasonal celebrations and experiences, even while navigating a challenging economic environment.</p>

          <p>An effort by Senate Republicans to pass a full-year funding bill for the Pentagon failed after Democrats blocked the measure in a procedural vote. The move was an alternative strategy to restore some government funding and ensure military paychecks amid the ongoing shutdown. However, Democrats largely opposed the bill, arguing that defense funding should not be separated from other domestic priorities like healthcare and housing, and that appropriations should be negotiated in a bipartisan manner. The 50-44 vote fell short of the 60 needed to advance, leaving Congress at a stalemate.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal budget deficit for fiscal year 2025 was $1.78 trillion, a slight decrease of 2.2% from the previous year, according to the Treasury Department. The smaller shortfall was aided by a record $202 billion in customs duties, largely driven by President Trump's tariffs. However, the report also highlighted record-setting interest payments on the national debt, which totaled over $1.2 trillion for the year. While the deficit-to-GDP ratio remains historically high at 5.9%, the surge in tariff revenue helped offset the rising costs of servicing the nation's debt. (not investment advice)</p>
