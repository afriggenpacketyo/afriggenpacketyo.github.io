          <p>A search operation is underway in southwestern Norway for Alec Luhn, an American climate journalist who went missing during a solo hiking trip on a glacier. Luhn, an experienced outdoorsman, did not return for his flight home to the U.K., prompting his family to alert authorities. His wife, Veronika Silchenko, last heard from him when he sent a photo from his location in Odda on July 31. Rescue efforts have been challenged by poor weather, and his family is appealing for information from other hikers in the area.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has released gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b, its first open-weight language models since 2019, positioning them as lower-cost alternatives to offerings from competitors like Meta and Mistral. Unlike fully open-source models, open-weight models make their parameters publicly available, allowing developers to run and customize them more easily. The company emphasized that it conducted extensive safety testing and collaborated with chipmakers like Nvidia and AMD to ensure broad hardware compatibility for these new models.</p>

          <p>NASA's acting administrator has directed the agency to accelerate its plan to deploy a small nuclear reactor on the moon's surface by late 2029, aiming to precede similar efforts by China and Russia. The directive highlights concerns that the first nation to establish a lunar power source could declare exclusionary zones, hindering the U.S. Artemis program. The proposed Fission Surface Power project calls for a microreactor capable of generating at least 100 kilowatts, though it faces challenges from proposed budget cuts and the lack of a Senate-confirmed NASA leader.</p>

          <p>Pfizer increased its 2025 adjusted profit forecast, citing effective cost-cutting measures and a strong business performance that led to second-quarter results surpassing Wall Street expectations. The pharmaceutical giant's revenue was bolstered by its COVID products and other key drugs, leading to a more than 4% rise in its stock price. The updated outlook accounts for existing tariffs and potential drug price changes following pressure from the Trump administration, with executives stating they are in productive discussions to find solutions that balance affordability and industry competitiveness.

          <p>Tennessee executed Byron Black, a 69-year-old inmate, despite legal challenges and expert concerns over his active implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). His attorneys argued the device could deliver painful shocks during the lethal injection, but courts ultimately allowed the execution to proceed without deactivating it, marking a unique case in U.S. capital punishment. Black was convicted for the 1988 murders of his girlfriend and her two young daughters, and his execution proceeded after the governor denied a reprieve and the Supreme Court rejected his final appeals.</p>

          <p>Japan has set two new national heat records in a single day as a severe heatwave pushed temperatures to 41.8°C (107.24°F) in the city of Isesaki. This follows a trend of soaring global temperatures, with Japan having experienced its hottest summer and autumn on record last year. The extreme weather, linked by experts to climate change, is causing widespread issues, including water shortages and concerns over its impact on agriculture and natural ecosystems like the famous cherry blossoms, while posing significant health risks to the public.</p>

          <p>A months-long undercover investigation by the BBC has exposed the operations of a violent Iraqi-Kurdish gang responsible for smuggling people across the English Channel. A reporter posing as a migrant gained access to the gang's French hideout and filmed associates collecting cash payments in the UK, revealing a network spanning both countries. The investigation identified key leaders and detailed the gang's methods, including subjecting migrants to beatings and evading authorities by frequently changing their operational name, highlighting the challenges in combating these criminal enterprises.</p>

          <p>The National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) has denied all allegations in a lawsuit filed by six former San Diego Wave employees, claiming it has "no duty of care" in the matter. The suit includes claims of sexual assault by a co-worker, harassment, and discrimination. In its legal response, the NWSL argued that any incidents were between the individuals and the club, not the league, and also invoked the "doctrine of consent" and statute of limitations as potential defenses, calling for the case to be dismissed entirely.</p>

          <p>A Dutch foundation has launched a class action lawsuit against FIFA and several European football associations, arguing that the governing body's transfer regulations have unlawfully suppressed player earnings. The case, which could represent over 100,000 professional footballers, follows a European Court of Justice ruling that found certain FIFA rules breached EU law. Advised by the lawyer behind the landmark 1995 Bosman ruling, the lawsuit could lead to multi-billion-pound damages and potentially transform player mobility by allowing them to terminate contracts more freely.</p>

          <p>In a development in President Trump's libel lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal over a story about Jeffrey Epstein, Rupert Murdoch has agreed to provide a sworn declaration about his health. Trump's legal team had initially demanded an immediate deposition of the 94-year-old media mogul, citing his age and health concerns. According to a court filing, Murdoch will now provide regular health updates, and his deposition will be postponed until after a judge rules on the newspaper's motion to dismiss the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>New research indicates a growing disparity in workplace advancement between women with college degrees and those without. Over the past two decades, the labor force participation of college-educated women increased by nine percentage points, while for women without a degree, it rose by less than one. The report from the think tank Third Way attributes this divergence to factors like the rise of flexible and remote work arrangements and improved caregiving benefits, which are more accessible in white-collar professions predominantly held by degree-holders.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed a fine of nearly £46 million against former star fund manager Neil Woodford and his firm, Woodford Investment Management (WIM), for their roles in the 2019 collapse of the Woodford Equity Income Fund. The regulator found that WIM and Woodford made "unreasonable and inappropriate" investment decisions that prioritized illiquid assets, disadvantaging the 300,000 investors who lost money. WIM has stated it strongly disagrees with the findings and plans to appeal the decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new Social Security Administration (SSA) phone system, intended to reduce wait times, is reportedly causing problems for beneficiaries by rerouting calls to field offices that lack the jurisdiction to resolve their cases. Employees and advocates state that while the goal was to have any available staff member answer, the system's structure often prevents them from taking direct action on a claim from another region. This creates delays and frustration, forcing callers to be referred back to their original office, undermining the system's intended efficiency.</p>

          <p>A review of Scott Anderson's "King of Kings" highlights the book's argument that the 1979 Iranian Revolution was not inevitable but rather the result of contingent events and miscalculations. The book focuses on the shah's hubris, growing inequality, and the U.S. government's profound ignorance and inaction, which allowed Ayatollah Khomeini's faction to outmaneuver them. By eschewing grand theories about Iranian culture or Islam, Anderson presents a narrative where a "freakish convergence of circumstances," rather than destiny, led to the establishment of the Islamic Republic.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has weighed in on the contentious Texas redistricting battle, stating that Republicans are "entitled" to the five additional GOP-leaning congressional seats the proposed map would create. In a television interview, he defended the Texas plan while accusing Democratic-controlled states like Illinois and California of gerrymandering, without providing evidence. His comments come as Texas Democrats remain in Illinois to deny a legislative quorum, effectively stalling the Republican effort to redraw the state's electoral map mid-decade.</p>
