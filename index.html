          <p>Elon Musk stated at the Qatar Economic Forum that he intends to decrease his political spending in the future, a notable shift for a prominent backer of President Trump. Musk, who previously contributed significantly to Trump's campaigns and Republican congressional efforts, suggested he feels he has "done enough." While he didn't rule out future political donations entirely, he currently sees no reason to continue spending at the same level. This announcement could impact Republican fundraising efforts for upcoming elections. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite ongoing Russian bombardments and a rising civilian death toll, many Ukrainians remain determined to fight on, even as they perceive the U.S. is playing a "dirty and bloody game." Some Ukrainians are disheartened by the lack of pressure from the U.S. on Russia, but see a refusal to put pressure on Russia as reduced pressure on Ukraine to make concessions. President Zelensky has proposed a free-trade agreement with the U.S. in an effort to maintain a strong relationship with Washington.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Original Sin," claims that many Democrats were aware of Joe Biden's cognitive decline but chose to remain silent, driven by partisanship and a belief that he was the only one who could defeat Donald Trump. The article summarizes the book's claims that Biden's decline was evident as early as 2015 and worsened with family turmoil. The article highlights instances of Biden's forgetfulness and confusion, as well as efforts by his staff to mask his condition by simplifying speeches and relying on teleprompters. The article presents a critical view of the Democratic Party's decision to prioritize defeating Trump over concerns about Biden's fitness for office.</p>
