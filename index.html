          <p>Hurricane Humberto is forecast to bring life-threatening surf and rip currents to most of the U.S. East Coast and Bermuda this week, though its center is expected to pass well out to sea. The storm rapidly intensified to a powerful Category 4 hurricane, prompting a tropical storm watch for Bermuda. Swells generated by Humberto, the eighth named storm of the season, will affect the region for several days. Forecasters are also monitoring Tropical Storm Imelda, which is developing separately in the Atlantic.</p>

          <p>The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) will hold a vote in November to decide if Israel's public broadcaster, KAN, can participate in the 2026 Eurovision Song Contest. The decision follows calls for Israel's exclusion over the war in Gaza, creating a deeply divisive situation within the organization. Several countries, including Spain and Ireland, have threatened to boycott if Israel participates, while others like Germany and Austria are supportive. This vote is described as one of the biggest crises in the contest's history, potentially cementing a major division among members.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump is set to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss a 21-point plan aimed at ending the nearly two-year-long war in Gaza. The high-stakes meeting comes amid a continued international push for a ceasefire and follows Netanyahu's defiant address to the UN General Assembly, where he rejected Palestinian statehood. The discussion is a key focus of diplomatic efforts as the conflict continues to dominate the international agenda. The leaders are scheduled to hold a bilateral meeting before addressing the press.</p>

Figures such as Elon Musk of Tesla, Satya Nadella of Microsoft, and Eric Yuan of Zoom all utilized the program, which allows companies to hire foreign talent. While some of these leaders advocate for reforms to the system, their success stories underscore the program's role in bringing highly skilled entrepreneurs and engineers to the United States.</p>

          <p>The next Supreme Court term is set to tackle several contentious issues, with significant uncertainty surrounding the legality of President Trump's tariffs. The article anticipates that the court's conservative majority will likely deliver rulings that weaken the Voting Rights Act's safeguards against racial gerrymandering and further deregulate campaign finance. Additionally, cases concerning bans on conversion therapy and the participation of transgender athletes in sports are on the docket, signaling a potentially consequential term for civil rights and election law.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) announced it will resume some manufacturing operations in the coming days after a cyberattack forced a nearly month-long suspension at its UK plants. The restart will be phased, providing critical relief to the company and its supply chain, which has been under severe financial strain. The UK government recently announced £1.5 billion in loan guarantees to support JLR, with a stipulation that the funds also assist vulnerable suppliers affected by the production halt.</p>

          <p>A tragic cable car crash in Sri Lanka has claimed the lives of eight Buddhist monks, including three foreign nationals, after their cabin plunged down a mountainside near the Na Uyana forest monastery. An initial investigation suggests that a snapped cable caused the accident as the monks were traveling to meditation units. Six other monks were hospitalized with injuries, with one succumbing to his injuries later. The incident has prompted an outpouring of condolences from government officials and the global Buddhist community.</p>

          <p>Moldova's pro-Western governing party, the Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS), has won a decisive majority in parliamentary elections, defeating pro-Russian groups. The outcome is seen as a strong endorsement of the country's path toward European Union membership, a process that began after Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The election was considered a critical geopolitical referendum and was held amid repeated warnings from Moldovan authorities about a widespread Russian "hybrid war" campaign intended to influence the vote.</p>

          <p>The perpetrator of the deadly attack on a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, was identified as Thomas Jacob Sanford, a 40-year-old U.S. Marine Corps veteran of the Iraq War. Sanford, who had previously displayed support for Donald Trump, killed at least four people after ramming his truck into the church, opening fire on worshippers, and setting the building ablaze. He was killed in a shootout with responding police, and investigators are still working to establish a motive.</p>

          <p>Shares of Sony Financial Group soared nearly 16% on their first day of trading following the unit's spinoff from its parent company, Sony Group. The successful market debut in Japan reflects strong investor confidence in the newly independent entity, which includes Sony's life insurance, assurance, and banking arms. The separation was designed to allow the financial division to raise its own capital for growth while Sony focuses on its entertainment and semiconductor businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For individuals prone to Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) or milder "winter blues," experts advise beginning bright light therapy in the fall before symptoms fully manifest. Daily morning exposure to a 10,000-lux light box for about 30 minutes can help reset the body's circadian rhythms, which are disrupted by the decrease in natural daylight. Clinical studies have shown that this non-medication treatment can be as effective as standard antidepressants in relieving symptoms of seasonal depression.</p>

          <p>A form of diabetes linked to malnutrition, first identified in Jamaica in the 1950s, is gaining formal recognition as Type 5 diabetes. This condition, which doesn't fit the profiles of Type 1 or Type 2, appears in thin, undernourished individuals and is thought to result from developmental damage to the pancreas. Researchers hope that establishing a distinct name and classification will spur further research and prevent misdiagnoses, as standard insulin treatments can be dangerously inappropriate for these patients.</p>
