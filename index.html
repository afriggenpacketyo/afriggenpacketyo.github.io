          <p>Andrew Tate, a self-proclaimed misogynist and social media influencer, and his brother Tristan have been formally charged in the UK with multiple counts of sexual assault, actual bodily harm, and human trafficking. Andrew Tate faces ten criminal charges related to three complainants, while Tristan Tate faces eleven charges related to one complainant. A European arrest warrant issued in 2024 led to a Romanian court ordering their extradition to the UK; however, criminal matters in Romania must be settled first. The Tate brothers have denied any wrongdoing.</p>

          <p>The UK government is fast-tracking two major reservoir projects in East Anglia and south Lincolnshire, designating them as "nationally significant" to expedite the planning process and bolster England's water supplies. These projects, aimed for completion in 2036 and 2040, seek to enhance resilience against future droughts, especially given the increasing likelihood of hotter, drier summers due to climate change. While the water industry welcomes this initiative, some experts advocate for managing water usage through waste reduction and recycling, and local communities have expressed concerns about potential disruptions. The government intends to legislate to automatically deem the other seven proposed reservoirs as "nationally significant" too, streamlining the process further.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs imposed after his second term are illegal, arguing that they exceed the constitutional limits on Congress's ability to delegate tariff authority to the president. The US Court of International Trade's decision in V.O.S. Selections v. United States and Oregon v. Department of Homeland Security argues that Trump's reliance on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant unlimited tariff authority. The court also found that the tariffs, justified as a response to the trade deficit and drug trafficking, do not adequately address these issues. The decision, which can be appealed, may significantly restrict Trump's ability to impose broad tariffs.</p>

          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Donald Trump exceeded his authority by imposing reciprocal tariffs, a major setback to his economic agenda. The U.S. Court of International Trade determined that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president the power to unilaterally implement sweeping duties.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Golden eagles are increasingly venturing into England from southern Scotland, raising hopes that they may establish nesting sites after being absent for years. This resurgence is largely attributed to the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project (SSGEP), which has successfully translocated juvenile and sub-adult eagles from the Scottish Highlands. While it is still early to determine if they will settle permanently, the birds have been spotted in Northumberland, the North Pennines, the Lake District, and as far as Lancashire and Yorkshire. The last resident golden eagle in England disappeared from the Lake District in 2015, but conservationists are optimistic about their return.</p>

          <p>President Xi Jinping reaffirmed China's commitment to manufacturing-led growth, emphasizing self-reliance in advanced manufacturing during a visit to Henan province. This strategy, long criticized by the U.S. for deepening trade imbalances, could put China on a collision course with President Trump's goal of boosting domestic production of high-tech products. While China aims to achieve self-reliance, especially in high-tech sectors, this push could conflict with the Trump administration's demands to address trade imbalances and reduce state subsidies to Chinese companies. Experts suggest there is little scope for China to scale back its manufacturing-led strategy, which is closely tied to Beijing's drive for self-reliance.</p>

          <p>California has joined 15 other states in a lawsuit against the National Science Foundation (NSF) and its acting director, alleging illegal termination of research grants and imposition of new fees. The lawsuit claims that the NSF's actions have crippled research vital to health, the economy, and the advancement of knowledge. The suit specifically targets the NSF for terminating grants promoting diversity in higher education and the workforce, arguing that these actions violate federal law. It also seeks to overturn the Trump administration's cap on indirect costs related to research, which universities claim are critical for their work.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, ruling that he overstepped his authority and violated the Constitution. The court said that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not give the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The Trump administration has appealed the ruling, while White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai stated that it is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency. The lawsuit was filed by the nonpartisan Liberty Justice Center on behalf of small businesses affected by the duties.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has ordered the Trump administration to lift a pause on certain immigration applications, finding it was not in the public interest for immigrants to lose their legal status.

The judge agreed with pro-immigrant advocates that the government's actions were arbitrary and violated federal administrative law.

Judge Michael Farbiarz, however, did not order Khalil's release, citing unresolved issues in his residency application. Khalil was detained for his political beliefs and activism, raising concerns about free speech.
