          <p>A recent surge in cryptocurrency values has created approximately 70,000 new millionaires in the past year, bringing the total to over 240,000. Research indicates these investors spend about 9.7 cents for every dollar of crypto wealth gained, a rate more than double that of stock market investors, contributing an estimated $145 billion to U.S. consumption in 2024. While many are holding their assets in anticipation of further price increases, spending tends to focus on restaurants, entertainment, and real estate rather than luxury stereotypes, with a shift towards family-oriented purchases like homes as investors age.

          <p>Several U.S. senators have launched an inquiry into companies like Deloitte, which receive billions in taxpayer funds to build and manage state Medicaid eligibility systems. Citing a KFF Health News investigation, the senators expressed concern that error-prone technology has resulted in eligible low-income individuals wrongfully losing their health coverage and other benefits. With new work requirements looming, the inquiry seeks to ensure contractor accountability and prevent what senators call a "bureaucratic maze" from causing further coverage losses, questioning if contracts incentivize removing people from Medicaid rolls.</p>

          <p>Yehuda Cohen, the father of 21-year-old Israeli soldier Nimrod Cohen, is preparing for his son's release after two years of captivity by Hamas in Gaza. The release is part of the first phase of a ceasefire deal, which went into effect Friday, with all remaining hostages expected to be freed within 72 hours. Cohen expressed cautious hope, noting the lack of information on his son's condition and the need for rehabilitation. He also directed sharp criticism at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, accusing him of obstructing previous deals and calling for his removal from office to prevent future crises.</p>

          <p>A new report from the European Federation of National Associations on homelessness (Feantsa) reveals that homelessness is a substantial and worsening problem across the EU, challenging the bloc's goal of ending it by 2030. Germany has the highest absolute number of people without permanent shelter at over 531,000, while the Czech Republic has the highest rate proportional to its population. Rising median rents in major cities like Berlin, Paris, and Madrid are making housing unaffordable for low-income households.

          <p>Ocean freight carriers are facing widespread confusion as new U.S. government port fees on Chinese-built and Chinese-operated vessels are set to begin next week. The rules are unclear on whether vessels financed by Chinese lessors—a market valued at over $100 billion—will be subject to the hefty fees, prompting some shipowners to seek refinancing to avoid potential financial penalties. The fees are tiered, with Chinese-owned carriers facing charges up to $50 per net ton, potentially costing millions per port call, while non-Chinese operators of Chinese-built ships face a lower fee. This uncertainty is creating significant operational and financial challenges for the global shipping industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Bankruptcy Code includes a "two-year rule" that affects individuals seeking to file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy a second time. This rule stipulates that a person can only receive a new discharge of debts if their second Chapter 13 case is filed at least two years after the filing date of their previous Chapter 13 case. Misunderstanding this timing is critical, as filing even one day too early means that while the bankruptcy can proceed to restructure secured debts, unsecured debts like credit card balances will not be wiped out. This distinction significantly impacts the effectiveness of re-filing and requires careful strategic planning with legal counsel.</p>

          <p>This analysis of Peter Thiel's recent private lectures on the antichrist argues that the talks are less a coherent theological argument and more a reflection of the billionaire's own preoccupations and relationship with power. The article suggests Thiel is attempting to emulate the eclectic, syncretic style of his former professor, René Girard, but the result is a confusing mix of personal grievances against figures like Bill Gates and Marc Andreessen. Ultimately, the piece contends that Thiel's vision of a cosmic battle is narrowly focused on his own Silicon Valley circle, revealing a man who seems to be disidentifying from the immense global power he himself wields.</p>

          <p>In a series of four private lectures in San Francisco, tech investor and political donor Peter Thiel explored his theological and philosophical concerns about the rise of the antichrist. Thiel argued that a one-world state, potentially driven by fears of climate change or AI, is synonymous with the antichrist and could lead to Armageddon. Drawing on biblical passages, philosophers, and even manga, he suggested that figures like Greta Thunberg or Bill Gates exhibit characteristics of this force, which he believes seeks to halt technological progress. The lectures reveal the worldview of one of Silicon Valley's most influential figures, blending libertarian politics with eschatological Christian beliefs.</p>

The meeting was scheduled to take place in two weeks at the APEC summit in South Korea.

          <h2>State and Local Governments Increasingly Impose 'Doorstep Taxes' on Deliveries</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of state and local governments are implementing small fees, dubbed "doorstep taxes," on retail and food deliveries to generate revenue. States like Colorado and Minnesota have already enacted such fees, and several others, including New York and Ohio, are considering similar proposals ranging from 25 to 75 cents per transaction. Lawmakers view these taxes as a way to fund infrastructure and offset declining gas tax revenues as e-commerce grows. While tech companies like Amazon and DoorDash oppose the fees, arguing they are regressive, proponents say they encourage more consolidated and sustainable delivery practices.</p>

          <p>An analysis of recent Justice Department actions suggests the Trump administration is employing a strategy of "flooding the zone" with indictments against political adversaries, such as former FBI Director James Comey and New York AG Letitia James. The article posits that the primary goal may not be to secure convictions, as many of the cases appear legally weak, but rather to subject opponents to prolonged and draining legal battles. This effort is reportedly twofold: President Trump is targeting personal enemies involved in past investigations against him, while adviser Stephen Miller is aiming for a broader crackdown on progressive organizations and donors, labeling them as supporters of "left-wing terrorism."</p>

          <p>Dutch far-right politician Geert Wilders has expressed concern that he was a potential target of a suspected terrorist plot in Belgium, prompting him to cancel a public appearance. Belgian authorities arrested three men in Antwerp and found a homemade bomb, suspecting a plan to use a drone with explosives to assassinate politicians. While prosecutors did not name targets, government ministers identified Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever as one, and news reports suggested Wilders was also on the list. Wilders, who has lived with 24/7 protection for years due to extremist threats, stated he is "going nowhere" until the reports are fully investigated.</p>

          <p>A "48 Hours" report examines the murder investigation of Kevin Davis in New Haven, Indiana, where his wife, Alison Davis, was charged and later acquitted. Alison claimed her husband died from an accidental fall down the stairs, a story initially believed by police. However, authorities later concluded she had beaten him to death, though no weapon was ever found. A key element of the case was the couple's protective pit bull, Willow, who was in an upstairs bedroom and prevented the lead detective from entering and searching it on the night of the incident. The detective now speculates that the murder weapon may have been concealed in that room.</p>

          <p>While a short government shutdown is unlikely to significantly impact U.S. air travel, a prolonged one could lead to major disruptions for passengers. Most TSA officers and air traffic controllers are deemed essential and must work without pay, but an extended shutdown could lead to increased "sick-outs," as seen in 2018-2019. This would result in staffing shortages, longer security lines, and potential flight delays. The U.S. Travel Association warns a shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion per week and halt the hiring and training of new air traffic controllers, worsening an existing shortage.</p>

          <p>With the U.S. government now in a shutdown, all active-duty military personnel are required to continue their service but will not receive their paychecks until a funding deal is reached.

Some financial institutions like Navy Federal Credit Union and USAA are offering no-interest loans to affected service members.

          <p>A federal grand jury in Virginia has indicted New York Attorney General Letitia James on charges of bank fraud and making false statements related to a 2020 mortgage for a home in Norfolk. The indictment was brought by a U.S. attorney recently appointed by President Trump, who had publicly called for charges against James. The charges allege James misrepresented the home as a secondary residence rather than a rental property to secure a lower interest rate, resulting in "ill-gotten gains" of about $19,000. James called the charges "baseless" and a "desperate weaponization of our justice system" in retaliation for her successful civil fraud case against Trump.</p>

This contrasts with federal workers and even congressional staffers, whose paychecks are delayed until a new spending bill is passed.
