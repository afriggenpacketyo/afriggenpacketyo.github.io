          <p>Two men from Sandy, Utah, Maxwell and James Jensen, face charges for allegedly conspiring to support the Jalisco New Generation cartel, a designated terrorist organization. They are accused of concealing the source of proceeds from illegally smuggled crude oil and facilitating the fraudulent entry of thousands of oil shipments through Arroyo Terminals in Texas. Authorities seized tank barges, tanker trucks, and vehicles during the arrests, with prosecutors seeking a $300 million judgment.

          <p>The Army has circulated guidelines for expelling transgender troops, instructing personnel to address transgender individuals by their assigned sex at birth and initiating involuntary separations. The guidelines outline criteria for identifying soldiers with gender dysphoria, including past requests for grooming standard exemptions and social media activity. Critics argue the policies are worse than "Don't Ask, Don't Tell," and that they actively hunt down and try to identify transgender service members. The Army defends the policy as upholding values of truthfulness and discipline. </p>
