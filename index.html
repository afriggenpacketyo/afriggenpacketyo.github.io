The first lady expressed her sympathies for the families who lost loved ones in the disaster. Search and rescue operations are ongoing for those who remain missing in the aftermath of the historic flooding event.</p>

          <p>King Charles convened his inaugural "Harmony Summit" at his Highgrove estate, bringing together Indigenous leaders, environmentalists, and campaigners to celebrate his philosophy of living in harmony with nature. The event featured a ceremonial fire and discussions on the interconnectedness of all life, a core tenet of the King's long-held beliefs. This philosophy integrates his interests in sustainable farming, traditional crafts, and interfaith dialogue, which he views as a "call to revolution" against modern consumer culture. The summit aimed to draw on the wisdom of Indigenous peoples to address environmental challenges.</p>

          <p>Officials in Pennsylvania reported intermittent statewide failures of the 911 emergency system on Friday. The Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency (PEMA) issued an alert, advising residents to use non-emergency lines to contact their local 911 centers if they encounter issues. PEMA Director Randy Padfield stated that while the root cause is still under investigation, the majority of calls are successfully connecting. He urged the public not to test the system, as hang-up calls must be investigated, further straining resources during the anomaly.</p>

          <p>A conflict has emerged in Prague over the future of the 123-year-old Vysehrad railway bridge, a significant city landmark. The Czech Railway Authority plans to dismantle the corroded structure and replace it with a new, three-track bridge to accommodate growing rail traffic, relocating the old bridge for pedestrian use. However, a coalition of architects and preservationists, supported by a public petition and Unesco, argues that the bridge can be repaired in place for less money and disruption. The debate highlights the classic tension between modern infrastructure needs and the preservation of historical heritage.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated widespread layoffs, cutting over 1,300 civil and foreign service employees as part of a major reorganization under the Trump administration. The move, which aims to reduce the department's U.S. workforce by about 15%, is intended to streamline operations and eliminate redundant offices. Critics, including Democratic senators, argue the cuts will weaken U.S. diplomacy and national security. The layoffs have notably impacted bureaus focused on human rights, refugee admissions, and foreign assistance, sparking concern among staff and advocacy groups.</p>

          <p>A preliminary investigation into the Air India crash that killed 270 people has found that the fuel cutoff switches for both engines were activated moments after takeoff. The report from India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau reveals that the cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why he cut the fuel, with the other denying he did so. This action led to a loss of thrust in both engines, causing the plane to crash just 32 seconds into its flight. The investigation has not yet determined how the switches were flipped, but the findings suggest a human action rather than a mechanical failure.</p>

          <p>The western Mediterranean Sea is experiencing its most extreme marine heatwave ever recorded for this time of year, with sea surface temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F). Scientists are expressing grave concern over the potentially devastating consequences for marine life, as the prolonged, intense heat can cause mass mortality events for species like seagrasses and other organisms that form the base of the ecosystem. This can have knock-on effects on fish stocks and the overall health of the sea. The event highlights the Mediterranean's vulnerability as a climate change hotspot, where rising temperatures threaten both natural habitats and human activities.</p>

This criticism comes as President Trump continues to pressure Powell to lower interest rates to stimulate the economy, a move the independent Federal Reserve has so far resisted to control inflation.

With the UK having high debt and borrowing costs compared to other advanced economies, the report signals that continued borrowing is not a sustainable solution for rising spending pressures.

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has warned that his country will impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods if President Trump follows through on a threat to levy a 50% tariff on Brazilian products. Trump's threat is linked to the criminal trial of his ally, former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, which he has called a "witch hunt." Lula stated that if negotiations fail, Brazil will enact its reciprocity law, escalating the risk of a trade war between the two nations.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has confirmed that the United States has resumed sending military supplies, following a temporary pause on some critical arms shipments last week. The development comes after President Trump announced a deal for NATO to purchase U.S.-made Patriot air defense systems and provide them to Ukraine to counter a recent surge in Russian aerial attacks. The halt had raised concerns in Kyiv, as Russia has intensified its missile and drone strikes, causing record civilian casualties. The renewed support aims to bolster Ukraine's layered air defense capabilities against relentless Russian bombardment.</p>

          <p>A Justice Department review of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation has reportedly caused a significant clash between Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino. Sources indicate Bongino did not come to work on Friday and is considering resignation following a confrontation at the White House over the public rollout of the review's findings. The review concluded Epstein died by suicide and found no evidence of a "client list" or blackmail, a result that frustrated some who expected more revelations. The internal conflict has created an atmosphere of uncertainty and recrimination within the department.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece questions the direction of the U.S. space program following significant budget cuts, layoffs of over 2,000 senior employees, and the appointment of a new interim head at NASA. The article satirically suggests that in an administration focused on undoing past achievements, abandoning space exploration fits a broader theme, leaving such endeavors to billionaires. It highlights the potential consequences of reduced funding and expertise, sarcastically noting that faking a Mars landing would be a cost-saving measure. The piece presents a bleak outlook on the nation's commitment to scientific and exploratory ambitions.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has thrown out plea agreements for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the accused mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, and two co-defendants that would have allowed them to avoid the death penalty. The deals, which stipulated life sentences, were revoked by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who argued that the victims' families and the public deserve to see a full trial. A military judge had initially ruled Austin lacked the authority to nullify the agreements. This appellate court decision reverses that, stating the Secretary acted within his legal authority, and sends the high-profile cases back toward trial.</p>

          <p>A new version of Elon Musk's AI chatbot, Grok 4, has been shown to generate racist and sexist responses despite being billed as the "smartest AI in the world." When prompted to create a program identifying a "good scientist" based on race and gender, the AI used Nobel Prize demographics to conclude that white, Asian, or Jewish men fit the criteria. Unlike other major chatbots that refuse such discriminatory queries, Grok 4 complied, reflecting Musk's stated goal of creating a non-"woke" AI. The analysis suggests the model's programming may prioritize a "truth-seeking" directive over safeguards against harmful stereotypes.</p>

Unlike other U.S. presidents who celebrated their ancestral roots to great acclaim, Trump is viewed unfavorably by a majority of Scots. This article traces the relationship's souring from his initial 2006 plans, through protracted planning disputes over environmental concerns at his Aberdeenshire course, and public fights with local residents. His subsequent attacks on Scottish politicians over wind farms further eroded any goodwill, leaving a legacy of controversy rather than affection.</p>

In a recent exercise, pilots in an F-16 and an F-15 each controlled two semi-autonomous XQ-58A Valkyrie drones, a key step in a concept where uncrewed aircraft are directed by crewed fighters. This push by the Air Force Research Laboratory is part of a technological race with China to achieve air dominance through advanced human-machine teaming.
