          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 12:19:34 EDT</div>

          <p>President Trump stated it is "highly unlikely" he would fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, despite reports that he had told Republican lawmakers he intended to do so. The speculation arose amid Trump's persistent criticism of the Fed's interest rate policies, which he claims are politically motivated to hinder his administration. This ongoing conflict has created uncertainty, as the president has also attacked the Fed's board and its spending on headquarters renovations. Despite the political turmoil and a representative's claim that a firing was imminent, financial markets showed only a muted reaction to the conflicting reports. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Holmes Beach, a popular Florida tourist destination, has implemented a new ordinance banning the digging of sand holes deeper than one foot and prohibiting the use of metal shovels. The rule aims to protect public safety and wildlife, particularly sea turtles that can become trapped. The measure follows a near-tragedy involving a person almost falling into a large, abandoned hole and a fatal incident in 2024 where a young girl died after sand collapsed on her in a deep hole at another Florida beach. Officials emphasize the need for visitors to be mindful and fill in any holes they dig before leaving.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has proposed a new seven-year budget of 2 trillion euros, significantly increasing defense and space investment to 131 billion euros. This fivefold hike reflects growing geopolitical concerns and what the Commission President calls Europe's "era of rearmament." The budget also allocates substantial funds for climate initiatives, migration management, and 100 billion euros in support for Ukraine. To fund these priorities without increasing member state contributions, the EU plans to introduce new revenue streams, including taxes on e-waste and tobacco. The proposal requires unanimous approval from all EU member states to pass.</p>

          <p>A CNBC study has identified the top states for workers in 2025, with Texas, Florida, and Georgia leading the list. The ranking evaluates states based on factors like workforce education, STEM job concentration, worker training programs, and success in attracting skilled labor. The report notes that while the nationwide labor shortage has largely subsided, significant disparities remain between states. Texas earned the top spot for its large talent pool and robust pipeline of homegrown workers, while Florida was recognized for its effective training programs and ability to attract new talent.

          <p>President Trump has publicly rebuked a segment of his own supporters for their continued focus on the Jeffrey Epstein case, labeling the controversy a "hoax" and calling them "weaklings." His frustration follows the Justice Department's announcement that no "client list" exists and no further files will be released. This has created a significant rift within the MAGA movement, with many prominent figures feeling betrayed by what they perceive as a cover-up. Trump's sharp criticism marks a rare instance of him directly confronting his base, urging them to move on and focus on his administration's successes instead.</p>

          <p>An analytical article from The Atlantic explores the unprecedented revolt within Donald Trump's MAGA base over the Jeffrey Epstein case. The piece argues that for many supporters, the Epstein saga embodies the "deep state" conspiracy they fundamentally oppose. By adopting the official Justice Department position that no client list exists and dismissing their concerns, Trump has, for the first time, positioned himself as part of the establishment they loathe. This has created a deep ideological conflict, revealing that the conspiratorial fervor he cultivated can turn against him when he contradicts its central tenets, threatening his previously unshakeable hold on the movement.</p>

          <p>A 2022 data breach at the UK's Ministry of Defence, which exposed the personal details of nearly 19,000 Afghans seeking relocation, has been made public after a super-injunction was lifted. The leak led to a covert government operation, the Afghanistan Response Route, to secretly relocate those at risk, with 4,500 individuals already brought to the UK. The government spent £400 million on the secret scheme, which operated without public or parliamentary knowledge. Questions now surround how the breach occurred, why it was concealed for so long, and whether anyone came to harm as a direct result of their information being exposed.</p>

          <p>Hungarian parliamentarian Katalin Cseh has urged US Democrats to learn from Hungary's experience with Viktor Orbán to counter what she describes as Donald Trump's autocratic tendencies. Speaking at a forum, Cseh warned against an "it can’t happen here" mentality and stressed the need for urgent, broad-based mobilization ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. She advised focusing on community-based, visionary candidates and shifting the political narrative to everyday issues like healthcare and cost of living, rather than purely technical legal arguments. Her message emphasizes that modern autocrats often use legal and institutional means to undermine democracy from within.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, has voted to accept the resignation of Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, who has served since March 2020, making him the longest-serving PM in the country's history. The move triggers the dissolution of the entire cabinet and is part of a major government reshuffle aimed at recalibrating Ukraine's economic and defense strategies amid the ongoing war. Deputy Prime Minister and Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko is widely expected to become the next prime minister. Media reports suggest Shmyhal may be appointed as the new defense minister, continuing to serve in a key wartime role.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has dismissed two senior officials considered to be loyalists of President Trump from his department. Chief of Staff Heather Flick Melanson and top policy adviser Hannah Anderson were fired in a move that surprised some federal health officials. Sources suggest the two were seen as outsiders installed by the White House to monitor Kennedy and ensure the president's agenda was prioritized. The firings follow other recent departures of Trump allies from HHS and signal a potential consolidation of control by Kennedy within the department. Matt Buckham has been named acting chief of staff.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has deported five migrants, described as "criminal illegal aliens," to the southern African kingdom of Eswatini, a country with which they have no prior connection. The deportees, originally from Vietnam, Jamaica, Laos, Cuba, and Yemen, had been convicted of serious crimes in the US, and their home countries had reportedly refused to accept their return. The move, enabled by a recent Supreme Court decision, has sparked concern in Eswatini about becoming a repository for foreign criminals.

She did not attend the hearing but was fined approximately $1,400.

          <p>One year after endorsing Donald Trump for president, Elon Musk's political journey has been marked by controversy and a dramatic, public falling out with the administration he helped elect. Initially a key advisor who led a government efficiency task force, Musk's relationship with Trump soured over disagreements on economic policy, particularly a major tax and spending bill. His public favorability has plummeted following controversies, including a gesture seen as a Nazi salute and declining Tesla sales. Now, having exited Trump's inner circle, Musk has floated the idea of forming a new political party, signaling his continued, albeit changed, political ambitions.</p>

          <p>In an effort to tackle France's mounting debt, Prime Minister François Bayrou has proposed eliminating two of the country's eleven national holidays: Easter Monday and May 8th. The plan would require people to work two additional days per year for the same salary, with the resulting productivity gain helping the nation's finances. The proposal has been met with predictable protests from left-wing and populist parties. This is not the first time such a measure has been tried; in 2003, a similar plan turned Whit Monday into a 'Day of Solidarity' to fund services for the elderly, a policy that still generates billions annually.</p>

          <p>A major review has concluded that the UK's Prevent counter-terrorism program missed opportunities to intervene with Axel Rudakubana, who went on to kill three children in Southport. Lord David Anderson KC found that although teachers referred Rudakubana three times due to his obsession with violence, his case was closed because he lacked a clear terrorist ideology. The report calls for Prevent to focus on individuals fascinated with extreme violence, even without an ideological motive, and to improve its monitoring of public online activity. The Home Secretary has pledged to act immediately on the findings to strengthen the program.</p>
