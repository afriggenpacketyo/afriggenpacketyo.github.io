          <p>After nearly eight years of legal proceedings, Monica Sementilli has been found guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy in the 2017 killing of her husband, celebrity beauty executive Fabio Sementilli. Prosecutors successfully argued that she conspired with her lover, Robert Baker, to stage the murder as a burglary to collect on a life insurance policy. Key evidence included cell phone data, surveillance footage suggesting she monitored the crime, and secretly recorded conversations. Despite Baker testifying that he acted alone, the jury convicted Sementilli, who now faces life in prison without parole.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods have struck Texas Hill Country, leading to at least 50 confirmed deaths and leaving more than two dozen people, primarily children from a summer camp, missing. The Guadalupe River reportedly rose 26 feet in just 45 minutes, overwhelming communities and prompting over 160 air rescues. Officials described the event as unprecedented, with Gov. Greg Abbott signing a federal disaster declaration to mobilize state and federal resources. Search and rescue efforts are ongoing, involving hundreds of personnel, drones, and helicopters, as the community grapples with the scale of the tragedy.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani showcased his pitching prowess with two scoreless innings, but the Los Angeles Dodgers ultimately fell to the Houston Astros 6-4. Ohtani, celebrating his 31st birthday, struck out three batters and touched 101 mph on the radar gun, continuing his impressive return to the mound this season. However, long relief pitcher Justin Wrobleski struggled, giving up five runs and allowing the Astros to take a lead the Dodgers' offense couldn't overcome. The loss highlights the team's ongoing reliance on a tenuous pitching depth while awaiting the return of injured stars.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Ron Chernow's new biography, "Mark Twain," recounts the author's 1882 return to the Mississippi River, the setting that profoundly shaped his early life and literary voice. Traveling incognito to gather material for "Life on the Mississippi," Samuel Clemens found a river transformed by time, yet he felt an immediate sense of belonging in the pilot house of a steamboat. This journey underscored his deep nostalgia for his youth as a river pilot, a time he considered one of true freedom. The experience crystallized the paradox of his life: the more famous he became, the more he yearned for his past.</p>

          <p>China's Communist Party has revised its working regulations for key policy-making and coordination bodies, a move some analysts interpret as a sign that President Xi Jinping may be delegating more authority. The new rules apply to central commissions and party leading groups, many of which were established or empowered under Xi's leadership. According to state media, the changes are intended to standardize the top-level policy process, with these organs focusing on major strategic planning and oversight. This development could also provide insights into Xi's long-term succession plans by clarifying the roles of his deputies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent deadly floods in Texas Hill Country highlight the region's geographical vulnerability, making it one of the most dangerous places in the U.S. for flash flooding. According to hydrologist Hatim Sharif, the area's steep hills, semi-arid soil, and the Balcones Escarpment contribute to rapid water runoff. When heavy downpours occur, often intensified by warm Gulf air rising over the escarpment, shallow creeks can swell into raging rivers with devastating speed. This phenomenon, which has caused numerous fatal floods in the past, underscores the critical need for improved forecasting, public awareness, and safety measures.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Donald Trump's Foreign Policy Leverages Unpredictability as a Strategic Doctrine</h2>

          <p>This article analyzes President Donald Trump's foreign policy approach, likening it to the "Madman Theory," where a leader projects irrationality and volatility to gain strategic advantages. By questioning long-standing commitments like NATO's Article 5, Trump has created an environment of uncertainty that has coerced allies into increasing defense spending. However, political scientists question whether this doctrine can be effective against adversaries like Russia or Iran. The strategy risks being perceived as unreliable, potentially undermining U.S. credibility and encouraging allies like Europe to seek greater strategic independence.</p>

          <p>The Lifetime ISA (LISA), a UK savings vehicle, is a source of divided opinion among savers. Designed to help those under 40 save for a first home or retirement, it offers a 25% government bonus on annual contributions up to £4,000. While some users praise it as an excellent tool, others criticize its strict rules. Key complaints include a penalty that claws back some of the saver's own capital upon early withdrawal and a property price cap of £450,000, which has not been updated since 2017 and is increasingly restrictive.

The run was organized to show solidarity with those affected by recent enforcement actions and to call for an end to what participants see as aggressive and terrifying tactics. The route passed through significant neighborhoods like Koreatown, MacArthur Park, and Chinatown, ending near the Metropolitan Detention Center where immigration detainees are held. Participants expressed a mix of outrage and defiance, aiming to be visible against policies they feel have created a climate of fear.</p>

          <p>This article provides a detailed timeline of the deadly flash floods in Texas Hill Country. The National Weather Service began issuing flood watches on Thursday afternoon, upgrading them to more severe warnings and a rare "flash flood emergency" in the early hours of Friday morning. Despite these alerts, the Guadalupe River rose with unprecedented speed between 4 a.m. and 6 a.m., catching many residents and summer camps by surprise. Local officials have stated the rainfall exceeded forecasts, while also noting that decisions to evacuate are complex and that the area lacks a comprehensive alarm system.</p>

          <p>Public health experts are expressing alarm over recent Trump administration cuts to scientific research, including funding for HIV and AIDS. Dr. John Brooks, former chief medical officer for the CDC's HIV prevention division, warns these cuts could reverse significant progress and lead to an increase in new infections. While treatment for current patients is expected to continue, the slashes have reportedly canceled vital research into an HIV vaccine and cure. Experts fear the administration's focus is too narrow, neglecting the prevention strategies critical to eliminating the epidemic by 2030.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is continuing its efforts to curb the dominance of Chinese firms in the global drone market, most recently with an executive order targeting their use. However, industry insiders and analysts note that China's preeminent position makes it difficult to remove its products from supply chains. With very few non-Chinese commercial drone manufacturers in the world, a ban could significantly raise costs for businesses that rely on the technology. This move is seen by some as a negotiation tactic, but it highlights the ongoing tech and trade tensions between the U.S. and China.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration is facing backlash for sending an email that critics call "blatant misinformation" and partisan. The email claimed that President Trump's recently signed spending bill "eliminates federal income taxes on social security benefits for most beneficiaries." In reality, the bill provides a temporary, phased-out tax deduction for seniors, not a permanent elimination of the tax. Former SSA officials and Democratic lawmakers blasted the communication as a misleading, political statement from a traditionally apolitical agency, with one calling every word of the email "a lie."</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that exposure to high heat and wildfire smoke during pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester, is linked to adverse birth outcomes. Researchers found these environmental stressors were associated with babies being smaller in the womb and at birth. The effects were nearly doubled for mothers living in "climate-vulnerable" neighborhoods, which are often hotter and have less access to air conditioning or air filters. Health experts are calling for greater awareness of these climate-related risks, advising precautions like staying cool and wearing a mask when it's smoky.</p>
