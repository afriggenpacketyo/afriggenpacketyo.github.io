          <p>Ahead of a critical U.S.-Russia summit in Alaska, the Kremlin has released logistical details, stating the main topic will be the war in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with UK's Keir Starmer to discuss expectations and security guarantees, emphasizing that any decisions made without Kyiv's involvement would be unworkable. While European leaders received assurances from President Trump that he would prioritize a ceasefire and protect Ukraine's territorial integrity, some Ukrainians remain skeptical that the high-level talks will yield any meaningful breakthrough in the long-running conflict.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Producer Price Index (PPI), a measure of wholesale inflation, unexpectedly jumped 0.9% in July, significantly higher than the 0.2% forecast and marking the largest monthly increase since June 2022. This surge, driven largely by a 1.1% rise in services costs, pushed the annual PPI to 3.3%, well above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The hotter-than-expected data has tempered some market optimism for an imminent interest rate cut, suggesting that inflationary pressures may still be a persistent threat to the U.S. economy.

          <p>A columnist criticizes the Trump administration's deal allowing chipmakers like Nvidia and AMD to export to China in exchange for a 15% fee, arguing it undermines national security for revenue. The article contends the arrangement flouts a constitutional ban on export taxes and contradicts the intent of export control laws, potentially strengthening China's technological and military capabilities. This pay-to-play approach is described as unprecedented and corrupt, setting a dangerous precedent that could discourage future R&D investment in critical U.S. industries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National Park Service is urging visitors to refrain from feeding black bears, highlighting a recent increase in such incidents at Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Officials warn that feeding bears is not only a federal offense carrying hefty fines but also dangerous, as it can condition the animals to seek human food and become more aggressive. This learned behavior endangers both visitors and the bears themselves, which may become more susceptible to being hit by cars or require euthanasia if they pose a threat to public safety.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin briefly touched a new all-time high of $124,496, and Ether neared its own record, driven by investor optimism following a cooler-than-expected consumer inflation report earlier in the week. However, these gains were short-lived as both major cryptocurrencies fell after Thursday's wholesale inflation data came in much hotter than anticipated, dampening hopes for imminent Federal Reserve rate cuts. Analysts suggest the market is moving beyond speculative mania toward a phase of institutional adoption, validating crypto's role in global investment portfolios. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin is projected to intensify into a Category 1 hurricane by Saturday and further strengthen into a major Category 3 storm by Sunday as it moves north of Puerto Rico.

The current market features an inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs often have better rates than long-term ones, making them an attractive option for savers looking to lock in high returns for a fixed period.

          <p>Ukrainian officials have expressed deep concern ahead of the U.S.-Russia summit, fearing that critical decisions about their country's future will be made without their participation. President Zelenskyy has warned that any agreements reached without Kyiv's input will be 'stillborn,' while other officials have drawn parallels to the 1938 Munich Agreement. The article outlines key points of contention, including Russian demands for territory, a permanent block on Ukraine's NATO membership, and military limitations, all of which Kyiv firmly opposes, creating a tense backdrop for the high-stakes meeting.</p>

          <p>Economist Marc Sumerlin, a former senior economist in the George W. Bush administration, has confirmed that he is on the White House's list of potential nominees for Federal Reserve chair. In a television appearance, Sumerlin stated he would be interested in the position and advocated for an aggressive 50-basis-point interest rate cut, a stance that aligns directionally with President Trump's calls for monetary easing. Sumerlin emphasized the importance of Fed independence but noted that his acceptance would depend on seeing 'eye to eye' with the president on policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has declared his intention to ask Congress for long-term federal control over Washington D.C.'s metropolitan police department, extending a temporary 30-day takeover he initiated. Citing what he calls an 'out of control' crime problem, a claim D.C. leaders dispute, Trump signaled this could be a model for other Democrat-led cities. The unprecedented move to federalize a local police force on a long-term basis would require legislative approval, though the president suggested he could also act unilaterally by declaring a national emergency.</p>

          <p>President Trump's move to federalize Washington, D.C.'s police force is based on a depiction of the city as overrun by 'bloodthirsty criminals,' a narrative that contrasts sharply with official data. While the city saw a crime spike in 2023, federal statistics show violent crime has since dropped to a three-decade low, a fact highlighted by Mayor Muriel Bowser. This gap between public perception of rising crime and the statistical reality is a national trend, often influenced by partisan divides and used to justify tough-on-crime policies, according to data analysts.</p>

A claims reviewer will assign points based on the severity of the abuse, with acts like sexual assault receiving more weight, to determine individual compensation amounts.
