          <p>Indirect negotiations in Doha between Israel and Hamas for a new ceasefire and hostage release are reportedly on the verge of failure. Palestinian officials claim the Israeli delegation lacked the authority to make decisions on key issues, such as troop withdrawal and aid distribution, effectively stalling the process. Major disagreements persist, particularly over the mechanism for humanitarian aid delivery and the extent of the Israeli military's withdrawal from Gaza. Mediators warn that without significant US intervention to pressure for concessions, the talks could break down entirely, worsening the humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>British newspapers are covering a range of pressing national issues, highlighting a significant political rift between the Labour Party and the Unite union over strikes. Public support for a potential strike by junior doctors is reportedly low, causing a "generational rift" within the medical community. In economic news, the chancellor is planning new services for investors, while critics point to shrinking economic output. Other reports focus on water companies trialing "surge pricing" during summer months and public safety warnings for the ongoing heatwave.</p>

          <p>Among the victims of the catastrophic July Fourth flood in Kerrville, Texas, was Jane Ragsdale, the beloved owner and director of the Heart O' the Hills camp for girls. Ragsdale, who was in her late 60s, was a central figure in the community, known for her generosity, leadership, and dedication to educating generations of young women. Friends and residents remember her as an embodiment of the community's friendly spirit and a capable leader who would have been at the forefront of recovery efforts.

          <p>Chinese policy analysts are examining the growing alignment between parts of the U.S. tech industry and the "Make America Great Again" political movement. They note that this "uneasy alliance" is pushing for continued pressure to contain China's technological development and further decoupling in high-tech sectors. Some analysts express concern that U.S. tech leaders, through increased cooperation with the defense industry, could evolve into aggressive "tech hawks." However, they also speculate that internal tensions between the tech elite and the broader MAGA camp could ultimately undermine this political reshaping effort.</p>

The recording captures one pilot asking the other why he activated the cut-off, with the other denying he had done so. While the switches were moved back, the aircraft lost power and crashed.

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in central Gaza killed two young brothers and their teenage cousin as they waited for nutritional supplements outside a health clinic. Their mother, Iman al-Nouri, described the horror of finding her children after the strike, which also left her two-year-old son critically wounded. The U.S.-based aid group Project Hope, which runs the clinic, stated that 16 people were killed, including 10 children. The Israeli military said it targeted a "Hamas terrorist" and that the incident was under review, but the strike highlights the daily danger faced by civilians seeking basic necessities.</p>

          <p>King Charles hosted his first "Harmony Summit" at his Highgrove estate, bringing together Indigenous leaders, environmentalists, and philanthropists to celebrate his philosophy of living in harmony with nature. The event featured a fire ceremony led by an Indigenous Earth Elder and focused on the interconnectedness of all life. The King's long-held belief system, which was once considered an outlier, advocates for working with nature, protecting traditional skills, and rejecting unsustainable modern practices. A source close to the King described this philosophy as a central part of his eventual legacy, aiming to create a more sustainable world.</p>

          <p>The mayor of Perris, California, has issued a public warning urging residents to stay indoors and avoid unnecessary travel due to ongoing federal immigration enforcement operations in the region. In a video message, Mayor Michael Vargas advised residents to "remain calm, stay indoors when possible and know your rights." This warning reflects the heightened fear within Southern California's immigrant communities following an intensification of raids by the Trump administration. The city of Perris, where nearly 80% of the population is Hispanic or Latino, stated it is committed to the well-being of all its residents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A plan by the Czech Railway Authority to dismantle and replace Prague's historic Vysehrad railway bridge is facing significant criticism. The authority argues that the 123-year-old steel bridge is corroded and cannot handle projected increases in rail traffic, proposing a new, three-track bridge in its place. However, a coalition of architects, engineers, and preservationists, backed by a public petition and endorsed by Unesco, contends that the iconic landmark can be repaired for less money and with less disruption. They have proposed restoring the existing structure and building a slender, second bridge alongside it.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has laid off more than 1,300 employees as part of a sweeping reorganization plan by the Trump administration aimed at reducing its workforce. The cuts, which include 1,107 civil service and 246 foreign service staff, have been criticized by opponents who argue they will undermine U.S. diplomacy and national security. Many of the reductions targeted offices focused on refugees, human rights, and foreign assistance, including nearly all civil service officers in the bureau that handles refugee resettlement. The administration maintains the cuts are necessary to eliminate redundant offices.</p>

Satellite imagery shows dozens of buildings, including hotels and entertainment facilities, were erected in just 18 months. The project is part of leader Kim Jong Un's effort to boost tourism and is also seen as a way to strengthen ties with Russia, which has encouraged its citizens to visit.</p>

          <p>An intense and prolonged marine heatwave in the western Mediterranean Sea is raising alarm among scientists about its potential impact on marine life. In late June and early July, sea surface temperatures regularly exceeded 30°C, reaching six or seven degrees above normal in some areas. Experts note that such extreme heat, arriving much earlier than usual, can cause mass mortality events for species like seagrasses that form the foundation of the marine food web. This can have cascading effects on fish stocks and overall ecosystem health, highlighting the region's vulnerability as a climate change hotspot.</p>
