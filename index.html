          <p>The British and Irish Lions faced Argentina in their first match of the 2025 tour, resulting in a defeat for Andy Farrell's squad. Despite showing ambition and creating opportunities in attack, the Lions struggled with execution, committing numerous errors like offloads to the ground and inaccurate passes. Coach Farrell expressed his frustration, emphasizing the need for sharper play as they head to Australia. Two-time Lion Tadhg Beirne noted the team consists of world-class players, but cohesion was lacking in their initial performance, leading to compounded errors that hindered their desired pace of play. The team will need to improve its precision and teamwork to achieve better results in future matches.</p>

          <p>China's real estate sector is facing further challenges due to the country's shrinking population, intensifying an already prolonged downturn. Goldman Sachs estimates a significant decrease in demand for new homes in urban areas, projecting it to remain under 5 million units per year, a stark contrast to the 20 million units peak in 2017. This demographic shift is expected to reduce home demand by 0.5 million units annually in the 2020s and 1.4 million in the 2030s, as the population falls below 1.39 billion by 2035. Despite Beijing's efforts to incentivize child-bearing, pronatalist policies are unlikely to address the deep-rooted issues such as stagnant incomes, job instability, and a weak social security system.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration reportedly requested that Japan raise its defense spending to 3.5 percent of its gross domestic product, according to the Financial Times. This request, made by Elbridge Colby, U.S. undersecretary of defense for policy, angered Tokyo and led to the postponement of a planned high-level meeting with Washington.

          <p>A recent study indicates that visits by foreign tourists to locations related to manga and anime works in Japan have significantly benefited local economies. In 2024, approximately 3 million foreign tourists, or 8.1 percent of inbound visitors, visited places linked to anime or movies, a notable increase from 4.8 percent in 2016. Purchases of anime and manga-related goods totaled an estimated 54.3 billion yen last year, up 53 percent from 2016. This trend, known as "seichi junrei," highlights the growing soft power reach of Japanese pop culture and its positive impact on regional economies, although local governments must address overtourism issues.</p>

          <p>Due to surging rice prices, which have reached record highs, Japanese restaurants and food companies are increasingly turning to noodles as a cost-effective alternative. Antworks Co., which operates Densetsu no Sutadonya eateries, opened its first ramen noodle restaurant in Tokyo in May and plans to open three more by next February to diversify its operations. Similarly, Yoshinoya Holdings Co. is strengthening its ramen noodle business, aiming to balance ingredient costs and address saturation in the beef bowl restaurant market. This shift reflects consumers' sensitivity to rising food costs and the industry's adaptation to maintain affordability.</p>

          <p>Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to attack Iran has been met with mixed reactions, seen by some as a vindication of his long-held stance against Iran's nuclear ambitions. The attack, which included strikes on nuclear plants and assassinations of military figures, has led to ongoing exchanges of bombs and missiles between Israel and Iran. While a poll indicates strong support among Jewish Israelis for the attack, the conflict has caused civilian deaths and considerable damage. Netanyahu's actions are viewed by some as an attempt to rewrite his legacy after the Hamas attack in 2023, though critics question the political motivations behind the decision.</p>

          <p>Bayern Munich defeated Boca Juniors 2-1 in a Club World Cup match in Miami, with Harry Kane scoring and assisting in the victory.

          <p>Rhode Island's state House has passed legislation that would ban the sale and manufacturing of certain semiautomatic rifles, commonly referred to as assault weapons. The proposal now goes to Governor Dan McKee, who supports assault weapons bans. If signed into law, Rhode Island will join 10 other states with prohibitions on high-powered firearms. Critics argue the ban will not curb mass shootings and will only punish law-abiding citizens, while gun control advocates describe the bill as the "weakest assault weapons ban in the country" due to its lack of a possession ban.</p>
