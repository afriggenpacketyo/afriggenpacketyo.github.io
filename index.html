          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) released drone footage that they say shows armed individuals in Gaza shooting at civilians, countering claims that the IDF killed dozens of people collecting humanitarian aid. The IDF strongly denies firing on civilians near or within the aid distribution site, stating that initial inquiries suggest the reports are false. They assert cooperation with American and international aid organizations to facilitate aid distribution to Gazan residents, while also accusing Hamas of disrupting these efforts. IDF Spokesperson Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin urged the public not to believe rumors spread by Hamas, promising investigations into allegations. The situation remains tense as investigations continue amidst conflicting reports. The optimism score for this article is relatively low due to the conflicting reports and ongoing tensions.</p>

          <p>China refuted claims from Washington that it violated the Geneva trade agreement, accusing the U.S. of breaching the deal terms, signaling worsening relations between the two economic superpowers. The Chinese commerce department spokesperson stated that export restrictions on semiconductor design software and chemicals to China, as well as visa revocations for Chinese students, were undermining the deal reached in Geneva. In response to U.S. accusations that China violated the agreement, the spokesperson said Beijing had "strictly implemented and actively upheld" the agreements. Tensions between the U.S. and China extend beyond trade, with concerns raised about China's military pressure in the Indo-Pacific region.

Russia confirmed the attacks in five regions, labeling them a "terrorist act".

          <p>A Chinese national, Haoxiang Gao, who was charged with illegal voting at the University of Michigan, has fled the U.S., according to an FBI criminal complaint.

          <p>The New York Yankees prevented a series sweep by defeating the Los Angeles Dodgers 7-3 after Yoshinobu Yamamoto had a rare poor start. Yamamoto, who had been a consistent performer, struggled to find the strike zone, allowing the Yankees to score early runs.

Despite late home runs from Pages and Muncy, the Dodgers couldn't complete the comeback, resulting in a momentum-halting loss. This result indicates inconsistency in the Dodgers' performance.</p>

The MLSPA said the league has failed to bring forward a reasonable proposal, highlighting tensions between players and the league over financial distribution.

          <p>An attack near a food aid distribution center in the Gaza Strip resulted in the deaths of more than 50 people and injuries to scores, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry and witnesses. Witnesses reported gunfire from multiple directions, including naval warships, tanks, and drones. The Israeli military denied involvement, stating that its forces did not fire at civilians near or within the site. The U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) dismissed reports of deaths and injuries, while the U.N. and major aid groups have refused to work with the new system, citing violations of humanitarian principles. Given the violence and conflicting reports, the outlook is pessimistic.</p>

Universities UK found that institutions are reluctant to collaborate due to concerns about breaking business laws.

University budgets have been strained by a drop in international students and stagnant fee income, leading to course closures and job losses.

The law, intended to increase black ownership of land, has drawn criticism from President Donald Trump and some South African political parties. Legal experts say the law primarily applies to land needed for the "public interest" and is not aimed at productive agricultural land. The government hopes the law will make it easier and cheaper to restore land to black people dispossessed during white-minority rule, though the "political cost" may prevent its implementation.
