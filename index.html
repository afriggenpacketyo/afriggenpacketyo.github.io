        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scottie Scheffler secured his fourth major title with a commanding victory at The Open Championship, prompting widespread comparisons to a young Tiger Woods. The 29-year-old's win at Royal Portrush came 1,197 days after his first major, mirroring the exact timeline of Woods' first four major victories. Fellow golfers like Rory McIlroy and Xander Schauffele acknowledged Scheffler's current dominance as a level of performance not seen since Woods was in his prime, solidifying his status as the undisputed world number one. Despite his humble dismissal of the parallels, his consistent, machine-like play has established him as the new benchmark in men's golf.</p>

          <p>A nine-year-old girl from Canada was found dead in upstate New York after her father had initially reported her as kidnapped, prompting an Amber Alert. The body of Melina Galanis Frattolin was discovered about 15 miles from where her father, Luciano Frattolin, claimed she was abducted. New York State Police stated they identified inconsistencies in the father's account and timeline, leading them to believe no abduction occurred. The investigation is now focused on the father's role in his daughter's death, and authorities have assured the public there is no ongoing threat.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency is set to close its Office of Research and Development (ORD), the agency's main scientific research division. The Trump administration frames the move as a cost-saving measure to streamline operations and better focus on the EPA's core mission. The ORD provides the scientific basis for regulations on numerous environmental hazards. Critics, including Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups, have condemned the decision, warning that firing scientists and eliminating the office will have generational impacts on Americans' health and safety by crippling the agency's ability to use the best available science.</p>

          <p>A parenting expert, drawing on studies of over 200 parent-child relationships, argues that the single most important skill to teach a child is self-connection. This is defined as the ability to tune into one's own emotions, needs, and inner voice, which is foundational for resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence. The article suggests that common parental responses that dismiss a child's feelings can erode this connection over time. It provides practical advice, such as validating emotions and modeling self-awareness, to help parents foster this crucial skill and support their child's long-term mental health.</p>

          <p>Sean Stein, president of the US-China Business Council, describes the current environment for American businesses in China as walking a tightrope. In an interview, he explains that while a recent framework deal has temporarily paused further tariff escalations, the fundamental trade relationship remains tense and uncertain. He worries that the dialogue between the two nations is almost exclusively focused on tariffs, overlooking broader issues and creating an unpredictable situation for the more than 270 American companies his council represents. This narrow focus leaves businesses in a precarious position as they navigate the world's two largest economies.</p>

By offering market-rate returns, Miller hopes to attract for-profit developers to the affordable housing sector.

This action, the article suggests, sabotages Australia's goal of being seen as a reliable investment partner for China and plays into a narrative of geopolitical friction rather than cooperation.</p>

          <p>A protest outside a hotel in Epping, Essex, that is being used to house asylum seekers escalated into disorder, with demonstrators throwing bottles and smoke flares at police. Over 1,000 people gathered for the protest, which was organized following the arrest of an asylum seeker last week on suspicion of sexual assault. Chanting "send them home," some protesters clashed with a heavy police presence. Authorities made at least one arrest and had a special order in place authorizing them to require the removal of face coverings.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to block a deal for the Washington Commanders to build a new stadium in Washington, D.C., unless the NFL team changes its name back to the "Redskins." In a series of social media posts, Trump insisted that many people, including Native Americans, want the old name restored. The franchise dropped the name, widely viewed as a slur, in 2020 following pressure from corporate sponsors and activist groups. The team is currently negotiating for a return to the site of the old RFK Stadium, which sits on federal land.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has affirmed that August 1 is a "hard deadline" for new, higher tariffs on imported goods to take effect. While he noted that trade negotiations with other countries could continue past that date, they would have to begin paying the increased rates. Lutnick specified that many smaller countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Africa would likely face a baseline tariff of 10%. However, he stated that larger economies will be expected to either open their markets to U.S. goods or pay a higher tariff. (not investment advice)</p>
