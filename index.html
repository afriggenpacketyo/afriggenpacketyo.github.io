          <p>The design team behind China's J-36 stealth fighter is creating a computer system to aid pilots in landing the advanced jet on aircraft carriers, a highly challenging maneuver. The J-36, a tri-engine, tailless flying-wing aircraft, has drawn global attention for its stealth capabilities and potential for long-range strikes. A recent paper indicates that the design team is in the early stages of developing a naval variant suitable for China's growing aircraft carrier fleet, addressing the significant risks pilots face when landing a sixth-generation plane on a carrier. The system aims to mitigate these risks and enhance the operational capabilities of China's naval aviation (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has endorsed both Andy Biggs and Karrin Taylor Robson in the Republican primary for Arizona governor. This unusual move follows Trump's initial endorsement of Robson, which had already stirred controversy among his allies in the state. Biggs, a staunch Trump supporter, entered the race unexpectedly, prompting Trump to endorse both candidates. Robson expressed gratitude for Trump's support, while Biggs' campaign suggested Robson should reconsider her candidacy given the dual endorsement.

          <p>The Mexican government, led by President Claudia Sheinbaum, has requested that television stations cease airing a US immigration advertisement deemed discriminatory. The advertisement, featuring US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, warns against illegal entry into America and states that criminals will be hunted down. Sheinbaum criticized the clip for containing a discriminatory message that violates human dignity and could incite violence against migrants. In response, she proposed banning foreign governments from advertising on Mexican TV networks, highlighting growing concerns over US militarization of the southern border.</p>

          <p>The weakening US dollar is creating a mixed bag of opportunities and challenges for central banks worldwide, uncertainty surrounding US policymaking has triggered a flight from the dollar, leading to appreciation of other currencies like the Japanese yen and Swiss franc. While a weaker dollar can ease debt burdens and lower inflation for emerging markets, it also complicates export competitiveness and risks capital flight. Some central banks, like the ECB, are using this opportunity to cut rates, while others are hesitant due to inflation and debt concerns. The prevailing strategy appears to be avoiding a currency war to maintain economic stability (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Dropshipping businesses, which rely on sourcing products from China and selling them in markets like the US, are facing increased pressure due to rising tariffs and the elimination of the de minimis exemption.

Many dropshippers are shifting their focus to European markets to mitigate the impact of these changes.

          <p>The wife of detained Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil has accused federal immigration officials of intentionally denying her husband's request to attend the birth of their son. Noor Abdalla stated that ICE's decision was a deliberate attempt to make the family suffer and silence Mahmoud's support for Palestinian freedom. Khalil, a legal permanent U.S. resident, was arrested and is being held on grounds that he is a national security risk. Abdalla vowed to continue fighting for her husband's release.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has proposed a budget that would eliminate a nearly $1 billion financial gap by cutting over 2,700 city positions, with approximately 1,650 layoffs. The spending plan aims to address rising personnel costs and a slowdown in the local economy. While the Fire Department would see an increase in hires, many other agencies, including the LAPD, would face significant reductions. Union leaders have vowed to fight the layoffs, and the mayor is seeking state financial assistance to mitigate the impact of the budget cuts.</p>

The team also discovered structural and cellular differences between macaque and rodent claustrums, providing insights into the evolution of consciousness.
