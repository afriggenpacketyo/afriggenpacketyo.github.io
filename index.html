            <p>Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is facing a surge of espionage cases, revealing vulnerabilities in its counter-intelligence systems and raising concerns about Beijing's efforts to undermine the island. Several individuals closely associated with senior DPP politicians are under investigation for allegedly leaking classified information to mainland Chinese intelligence, fueling fears that Beijing's spy networks in Taiwan are becoming increasingly effective. The frequent surfacing of these cases suggests a well-developed system to lure Taiwanese individuals into espionage, posing a significant challenge to the government. Tensions across the Taiwan Strait have worsened since William Lai Ching-te took office as the island’s leader in May, further exacerbating the security concerns.</p>
