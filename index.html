          <p>A significant cyberattack targeting Collins Aerospace, a software provider, has caused widespread disruption at several major European airports, including Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin. The attack disabled the 'Muse' check-in and baggage system, forcing airlines to revert to manual processing with pen and paper, leading to hundreds of delays and cancellations. Brussels Airport has asked airlines to cancel half of their Monday flights as there is no clear timeline for a secure, functional system to be restored, and authorities are actively investigating the breach.</p>

          <p>Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut has accused President Donald Trump of using the full power of the federal government, including the Department of Justice and the FCC, to punish and silence his political opponents. Speaking on ABC News, Murphy described the current situation as one of the "most dangerous moments America has ever faced," comparing the actions to those of repressive authoritarian states. He called on Republicans to challenge the president's actions, which he argues represent a "massive, new contraction of speech," and has introduced a bill to create specific legal defenses for those targeted for political reasons.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an interview, IBM Vice Chairman and former National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn analyzed the Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut. He explained that while the Fed sets the overnight bank lending rate, this doesn't directly lower borrowing costs for consumers, which are tied to longer-term market rates. Cohn also discussed the cooling labor market, noting that companies are reducing labor costs to maintain profit margins amid rising input costs, a trend he sees across the board. He also commented positively on a new executive order imposing a significant fee for H-1B visas, suggesting it will ensure the program is used for genuinely high-skilled workers.

          <p>American runner Cole Hocker won the men's 5,000m gold medal at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo with a stunning final lap performance. Hocker was in 11th place at the bell but unleashed a devastating kick to overtake his rivals, finishing in 12 minutes and 58.30 seconds. The victory provided a sense of vindication for Hocker, who had been controversially disqualified from the 1500m event earlier in the championships for jostling.

This "sensing-transmission-control integration" aims to eliminate errors like missing bolts by creating a single, intelligent feedback loop for data collection, communication, and control.

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic suggests President Trump is facing growing political pressure due to a deteriorating economy and declining public support, creating urgency in his efforts to prosecute political rivals. Rising grocery prices, stalled job growth, and unpopular policies have contributed to a souring public mood, even among younger Republicans. This economic strain may be reducing public tolerance for corruption, with polls showing a majority of Americans now view the president as corrupt. The article posits that Trump's push for Attorney General Pam Bondi to act quickly stems from a need to consolidate power before potential losses in the 2026 elections.</p>

Development Minister Reem Alabali Radovan stated that this reduction means Germany is investing far less in international cooperation than is needed to address growing global crises. Aid organizations have warned the cuts will have drastic consequences, with one NGO estimating that the halving of German emergency aid could result in over 4 million people worldwide losing food assistance.

          <p>According to Elissa Epel, an expert on well-being and aging, chronic stress can significantly accelerate the aging process at a cellular level. Stress shortens telomeres, the protective caps on chromosomes, which naturally shrink with age but do so more rapidly under constant duress. However, Epel emphasizes that this damage is reversible through lifestyle changes that create an "anti-inflammatory" environment for cells. She recommends practices such as eating more fruits and vegetables, taking short meditative breaks, incorporating Omega-3s into one's diet, and prioritizing deep rest through activities like yoga or breathwork to help restore cells and slow down aging.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from her new memoir, "Softly, as I Leave You: Life After Elvis," Priscilla Presley provides a detailed and emotional account of August 16, 1977, the day Elvis Presley died. She describes the frantic phone call from Joe Esposito, her rush home, and the daze she felt upon learning the news. The excerpt details the scene at Graceland, the grief of Elvis's father Vernon, and the difficult experience of their daughter, Lisa Marie, who saw her father's body.

          <p>Turkey's primary opposition party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), has re-elected Ozgur Ozel as its chairman during an extraordinary congress. This move is seen as a strategic effort to shield Ozel and other senior party figures from an upcoming court ruling that could annul the results of his initial 2023 election. The court case, which government critics view as politically motivated, is part of a broader crackdown on the opposition by President Erdogan's government. By securing a fresh mandate, the CHP hopes to demonstrate to the court that Ozel has the party's unequivocal support.</p>

          <p>Neath Port Talbot council in Wales has implemented a voluntary ban on the use of plastic flying rings on its beaches to prevent harm to the local seal population. The circular toys pose a significant danger to young, curious seals, who can get the rings stuck around their necks, leading to severe injury, infection, and often death. The council's action follows similar moves by other local authorities and retailers across the UK who have stopped selling the products. The ban is part of a wider campaign calling for UK-wide legislation to protect the marine mammals.</p>

          <p>On the eve of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, Rabbi Angela Buchdahl explains the holiday's central theme of "Teshuvah," or "return." She describes this period not just as a time for individual resolutions, but as a season of communal atonement where congregations collectively take an accounting of their shortcomings. This act of communal confession, she argues, carries a fundamentally hopeful message: that people and societies can change for the better by returning to their "better selves." Rabbi Buchdahl suggests that this concept could be applied on a national level to address societal failings with shared responsibility and a focus on compassion.</p>

          <p>According to parenting expert Reem Raouda, children develop exceptional social skills not just from learning manners, but from an environment where emotional safety and authentic connection are modeled by their parents. Based on studies of over 200 parent-child relationships, she outlines nine key practices, including talking openly about feelings, modeling empathy in daily life, and validating a child's emotions. Other crucial behaviors involve treating mistakes as learning opportunities, teaching how to repair after conflict, and listening more than lecturing, all of which build a foundation for emotional intelligence and strong real-world relationships.</p>

This move comes as Gulf Arab states express growing concerns about the reliability of the United States as their primary security guarantor in the region. Analysts suggest that by signing the agreement, Saudi Arabia is diversifying its security relationships and "putting its eggs in different baskets."

          <p>As annual fees for premium travel credit cards rise, credit expert Brian Kelly of The Points Guy advises consumers not to automatically opt for no-fee cards, as they generally offer poor rewards. He highlights three common mistakes: choosing a card that doesn't match one's lifestyle, hoarding points instead of redeeming them, and failing to negotiate with the card issuer. Kelly suggests that users with large, unspent point balances may have the wrong card and warns that points can be devalued at any time. He also recommends calling the credit card's retention department to ask for discounts or bonus points before deciding to cancel or downgrade a card.</p>

          <p>The recent recognition of a Palestinian state by the UK, Canada, and Australia has highlighted the profound practical challenges to its viability, particularly the question of who would lead it. Palestine currently lacks a functioning, unified government, with the West Bank and Gaza Strip ruled by rival factions, Fatah and Hamas, respectively, for nearly two decades. Palestinian politics have stagnated, with no elections held since 2006, leaving the public cynical about the current leadership. While recognition is a powerful symbol, analysts note that without internal reconciliation and a clear path to governance, the vision of a viable state remains distant.</p>

The law includes exceptions for undercover operations, health protection, and tactical situations. This move is part of a broader package of bills aimed at protecting immigrant communities and is the latest instance of California challenging the Trump administration's immigration enforcement policies.</p>

          <p>Genetic analysis of two 7,000-year-old mummies discovered in a Libyan rock shelter has revealed they belong to a previously unknown human lineage. The remains are of female herders who lived during the "Green Sahara" period when the region was a humid savannah. Researchers were surprised to find that their DNA did not show the expected Sub-Saharan genes, but instead indicated they were part of a distinct North African group that diverged from other lineages much earlier. This finding suggests that pastoralism and farming likely spread through the region via cultural exchange rather than large-scale migration and genetic mixing.</p>

          <p>A new study has upended the long-held theory about the origin of Stonehenge's Altar Stone, a six-ton sandstone block central to the monument. By creating a chemical fingerprint from mineral grains within the stone, researchers have determined that it likely came from the Orcadian Basin in northeast Scotland, over 466 miles away. This contradicts previous research that pointed to a source in Wales. The discovery raises new questions about the capabilities of Neolithic societies, suggesting the existence of advanced marine transport methods and complex, long-distance trade networks to move such a massive object.</p>
