          <p>President Trump announced that the United States launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities in Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, calling it a "spectacular military success" aimed at destroying Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity. The strikes followed earlier Israeli attacks on Iranian nuclear sites and military targets, which began on June 13, prompting retaliatory missile and drone attacks on Israeli cities. Defense Department officials confirmed that American B-2 Spirit bombers were used to strike Fordo, while submarine-launched Tomahawk missiles targeted the Isfahan site. The U.S. reached out to Iran diplomatically, stating that the strikes were the extent of their planned actions and that regime change was not intended. </p>

          <p>Pentagon officials have provided details on Operation Midnight Hammer, the U.S. mission to bomb three nuclear sites in Iran, with Gen. Dan Caine describing it as the "largest B-2 operational strike in U.S. history." The mission involved seven B-2 Spirit bombers flying from Missouri to Iran, requiring multiple in-flight refuelings, and utilizing deception tactics and fighter jets to secure the airspace. The attack included the use of GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs) and Tomahawk cruise missiles, resulting in "extremely severe damage and destruction" to the targeted sites. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth hailed the operation as an "incredible and overwhelming success," emphasizing that it did not target Iranian troops or the Iranian people. </p>

Smith founded FedEx in 1973, pioneering a delivery system based on coordinated air cargo flights centered on a main hub, known as the "hub and spokes" system. FedEx became a global transportation and logistics company, averaging 17 million shipments per business day, and played a major role in the shift towards time-sensitive deliveries. Smith, a Marine Corps veteran, attributed his leadership skills and business acumen to his military experience rather than his education at Yale University. </p>

          <p>This article analyzes the Trump administration's actions regarding Black arts and culture, framing them as a response to the threat posed by Black cultural institutions to white cultural supremacy. The piece connects these actions to the legacy of the Black Arts Movement (BAM) and its emphasis on Black self-determination and cultural production. It argues that Trump's efforts to defund and control Black cultural institutions are driven by a fear of Black cultural power and its ability to challenge established power structures. The author suggests that the focus on diversity and inclusion efforts has overshadowed the more radical potential of Black artistry to dismantle myths of white superiority. </p>

          <p>The U.S. has bombed three of Iran's key nuclear sites in Fordo, Isfahan and Natanz, following Israeli strikes on Iran which have lasted for over a week, prompting a war between the two countries. U.S. President Donald Trump has claimed that the Iranian facilities were "completely and fully obliterated" in the attacks, claims that have yet to be verified. Iran's Atomic Energy Organization has confirmed the attacks, but insisted its nuclear program will not be stopped. There have been mixed reactions to the attacks from other countries, with several calling for a return to diplomacy rather than military action. </p>

          <p>Dozens of people were injured when a yacht struck a dock in the Hudson River near the Henry Hudson Parkway and West 125th Street in New York City. The 200-foot party boat, known as "Timeless," hit a pylon while attempting to dock near Riverside Park, causing passengers to be knocked off their feet. A total of 35 people suffered non-life-threatening injuries, with 22 of those individuals taken to local hospitals for treatment. The Coast Guard is investigating the incident, which occurred one month after a Mexican navy training ship struck the Brooklyn Bridge. </p>

          <p>President Trump says the US has carried out a "successful" bombing attack on three nuclear sites in Iran and said they have been "obliterated". Israel says they were in "full co-ordination" with the US in planning the strikes. Iranian officials have confirmed the facilities were struck but denied it had suffered a major blow. Gen Caine has said it will take some time to fully assess the extent of the damage caused by the US attack. Iranian officials are preparing their response, and international leaders have issued mixed reactions. </p>

          <p>Several players and an umpire fell ill during MLB games as a heatwave gripped much of the United States. Cincinnati Reds shortstop Elly De La Cruz and Seattle Mariners reliever Trent Thornton experienced heat-related issues, while an umpire had to be treated in the Mariners' dugout. Gametime temperatures were in the low 90s for games in St. Louis and Chicago, with Milwaukee's game in Minnesota played under an excessive heat warning. The Cubs set up cooling and misting stations throughout Wrigley Field to help fans cope with the heat. </p>

          <p>The article argues that the U.S. strike on Iran was the right decision, but criticizes the Trump administration for making it in the wrong way, without Congress and with questionable leadership. It highlights Iran's aggression and its pursuit of nuclear weapons, while also noting the potential dangers of Trump's unilateral war-making power. The author expresses concern over Trump's divisive leadership and the influence of reactionary elements within his administration. While the action may have positive consequences, it also raises concerns about the erosion of democratic norms and the potential for further conflict. </p>
