          <h2>Democrats Request Investigation into Potential Insider Trading Before Tariff Announcement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-28 15:25:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Democratic lawmakers, led by Sen. Adam Schiff and Rep. Mike Levin, are urging the White House to disclose financial transactions made before President Trump's tariff pause, expressing concerns about potential insider trading violations. The Democrats' letter highlights the absence of periodic transaction reports from White House officials since Trump took office, contrasting it with the previous administration's transparency. A White House spokesperson dismissed the concerns, suggesting Schiff investigate Nancy Pelosi instead. The letter comes after a surge in the stock market following Trump's announcement, raising suspicions about possible exploitation of non-public information. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. agriculture exporters are facing a 'full-blown crisis' due to the global backlash against President Trump's tariffs, with significant declines in Chinese buying of U.S. farm products. The Agriculture Transportation Coalition reports massive financial losses among its members, including canceled export orders and goods stranded in warehouses. The Port of Oakland warns that the tariff-induced downturn could jeopardize job stability and the region's economic health. China ranks as the port's top import trading partner and third export partner, representing 29% of Oakland's total trade volume.</p>

          <p>Representative Gabe Vasquez, a Democrat from New Mexico, defended his vote against the Laken Riley Act, which mandates the detention of illegal immigrants charged with violent crimes. Vasquez argued that due process is a fundamental American principle, drawing criticism from Republicans who accuse him of prioritizing criminal illegal aliens over the safety of New Mexicans. The Laken Riley Act was enacted following the murder of a nursing student by an illegal immigrant, sparking debate over immigration enforcement policies. The Trump administration has touted a significant increase in arrests following the law's implementation.</p>

          <p>Temu has introduced 'import charges' of approximately 145% on many items after President Trump's tariffs, significantly increasing prices for consumers. These charges, which began appearing recently, often exceed the cost of the products themselves. Temu attributes the price hikes to changes in global trade rules and tariffs, while competitor Shein has also raised prices but states that tariffs are included in the listed price. The import fees are eroding Temu's value proposition, which had attracted consumers with its low prices on various goods.</p>

          <p>Trump Coins, a commemorative coin venture launched by President Trump, attributes the rising value of gold to his return to the spotlight and economic policies. However, experts argue that the surge in gold prices reflects economic uncertainty caused by Trump's policies, particularly tariffs. They assert that gold's value typically increases during times of economic turmoil. Experts also suggest that Trump's policies have shaken confidence in the U.S. dollar and Treasury bonds, making gold a more attractive safe-haven asset. (not investment advice)</p>
