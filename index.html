            <p>As major tech companies like Tesla, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and Nvidia prepare for first-quarter earnings, they grapple with uncertainty stemming from President Trump's fluctuating tariff policies. These tariffs impact supply chains, ad spending, and consumer behavior, potentially affecting revenue and earnings. Tesla faces challenges with suppliers in Mexico and China, while Alphabet worries about the online ad market and cloud infrastructure costs. Meta is concerned about reduced ad spending, and Microsoft anticipates indirect impacts on its customer base. Apple faces significant exposure due to its reliance on Asian manufacturing, while Nvidia's AI server costs could rise due to tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Simone Biles's former coach, Aimee Boorman, disclosed that the gymnast suffered from the “twisties,” a condition causing disorientation in the air, prior to the 2016 Olympics. This revelation sheds light on Biles's earlier struggles with the condition, which severely impacted her performance at the Tokyo Games. Boorman notes that Biles experienced the twisties after the 2015 world championships, leading her to temporarily avoid twisting during routines. With support from her family and therapist, Biles regained her ability to twist in time for the 2016 Olympic trials.</p>

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 1,000 points, and the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 also saw significant drops. Powell has defended the Fed's independence and warned that tariffs could lead to inflation, creating a challenging scenario for the central bank.</p>

            <p>Companies are increasingly utilizing foreign trade zones (FTZs) and bonded warehouses to avoid paying tariffs imposed by President Trump. FTZs are designated sites where freight is not subject to U.S. duties or excise taxes until it enters the U.S. market. This allows importers and manufacturers to store goods indefinitely without paying duties, enhancing financial flexibility and improving cash flow. The National Association of Foreign Trade-Zones has seen a surge in membership, indicating growing interest in mitigating the impact of tariffs.

Experts argue that building "frientimacy" requires consistency, positivity, and vulnerability, elements often missing in superficial social events. Furthermore, the industry overlooks structural issues like affordability and mental health support that contribute to loneliness.</p>

            <p>King Charles has expressed his and Queen Camilla's "heavy hearts" following the death of Pope Francis, paying tribute to his "compassion" and "tireless commitment" to people of faith. The King noted that their sorrow was eased by the Pope's ability to share an Easter greeting before his passing. The King and Camilla met the pontiff on a state visit to Italy earlier this month, recalling their meetings with "particular affection." The Pope was a long-standing advocate for combating climate change and promoted unity in a changing world.</p>

            <p>China's commerce ministry has warned against trade deals that harm its interests, stating it will take "corresponding countermeasures" if any agreements are struck at the expense of China. This follows reports that the Trump administration aims to use tariff negotiations to isolate China. Trump has also raised the base tariff on Chinese imports to 145%, prompting reciprocal tariffs from China. The ministry emphasized that seeking tariff exemptions by harming others will ultimately hurt everyone involved.</p>

            <p>President Trump has escalated his pressure on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, calling him a "major loser" and demanding immediate interest rate cuts. Trump claims there is virtually no inflation and that the economy could slow down unless rates are lowered. His attacks come as his team explores the possibility of legally firing Powell before his term expires in May 2026. Experts suggest that any attempt to remove Powell would likely trigger a steep sell-off in U.S. equity markets.</p>

Similar savings are observed for other Tesla models, including the Model 3, Model X, and Model Y. The calculations were made using the Tesla charging calculator. (not investment advice)</p>
