          <p>The United States is undertaking a partial evacuation of its embassy in Baghdad, Iraq, due to increasing security risks attributed to heightened tensions with Iran. Non-essential embassy staff and their dependents are being removed as officials cite concerns about potential retaliation by Iran on US sites in Iraq, particularly in light of stalled nuclear program talks. The US Middle East envoy is still scheduled to meet with Iranian officials, and President Trump has reiterated the US stance against Iran developing nuclear weapons. This decision follows reports that Israel is prepared to launch an operation into Iran, further escalating regional uncertainties.</p>

          <p>Following two days of trade negotiations in London, US President Donald Trump announced a wide-ranging agreement with China, aiming to maintain the truce established after prior talks in Geneva. The deal purportedly addresses several contentious issues, including rare earth mineral shipments, student visas, and tariffs. While Trump declared the accord "done" on his Truth Social platform, Chinese representatives have remained reserved, stating they will submit a report for President Xi Jinping's approval. The specifics of the agreement and its long-term implications are still emerging.</p>

          <p>A U.S. nuclear weapons expert, Jeffrey Lewis, has shared satellite images of a suspected new uranium enrichment facility under construction in Yongbyon, North Korea. The location aligns with earlier observations by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The facility, located approximately 2 kilometers from the existing Yongbyon complex, features a central hall suitable for installing centrifuges, surrounded by office and support spaces. Comparisons with a 2002 image of the Kangson enrichment facility highlight similarities in layout and dimensions, suggesting advancements in North Korea's enriched uranium production capabilities.</p>

          <p>The Karen Read trial concluded with a defense expert, Dr. Andrew Rentschler, disputing the prosecution's theory that Read struck her boyfriend, John O'Keefe, with her SUV. Rentschler argued that O'Keefe's injuries were inconsistent with being hit by a vehicle traveling at the alleged speed, citing the lack of broken bones on his right arm. However, the prosecutor questioned the thoroughness of Rentschler's testing, noting the expert did not account for shattered taillight pieces found near O'Keefe. The jury will begin deliberations after closing arguments, potentially hinging on whose expert testimony they find more convincing.</p>

These restrictions span the entire semiconductor value chain, from design and manufacturing equipment to memory chips. While China has achieved breakthroughs through significant investment, it still lags behind industry leaders like Nvidia, whose GPUs remain the industry standard. Huawei's Ascend 910B GPU is closing the performance gap, but challenges persist in AI chip fabrication and access to advanced chip equipment, particularly lithography machines from ASML.</p>

          <p>South Korea's President Lee Jae-myung has ordered the cessation of loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts along the border with North Korea, fulfilling a campaign promise aimed at reducing cross-border tensions. In response, North Korea appears to have halted its own loudspeaker broadcasts targeting the South. The broadcasts, which included propaganda messages and K-pop music, had resumed in June 2024 after North Korea sent trash-filled balloons into the South. This move signals Seoul's intent to reopen communication channels with Pyongyang, though the path forward remains uncertain due to North Korea's continued rejection of diplomatic overtures.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced increased annual funding for the NHS in England by Â£29 billion, along with additional funds for defense and housing, outlining the government's spending plans until the end of the decade. The Spending Review also includes investments in artificial intelligence and transport projects, but entails budget cuts for departments like the Foreign Office and the environment. The government aims to provide security, economic growth, and a future-proof NHS, while the opposition criticizes the plan as a "spend now, tax later review". Housing and health are big winners, while some other departments face budget cuts.</p>

          <p>Immigration raids at a Los Angeles car wash and other locations have led to arrests and sparked protests, highlighting the Trump administration's intensified crackdown on undocumented migrants.

Protests have erupted across the city, with confrontations between demonstrators and federal agents, leading to hundreds of arrests and curfews.

This discovery, reported in The Astronomical Journal, helps modern astronomers narrow down the star's possible position.

This approach contrasts with the usual critique of short-termism in politics, but it requires patience from an electorate that has felt squeezed for years. The government is positioning this moment as a turning point towards national renewal, but its success hinges on the long-term impact of these investments.</p>
