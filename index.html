        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a tense Oval Office meeting, Donald Trump confronted Cyril Ramaphosa with contested claims about violence against white farmers in South Africa. Trump played a video falsely claiming rows of crosses marked graves of murdered white farmers, which was actually from a 2020 protest. He also repeated claims of "white genocide," unsupported by South African Police Service figures, which show murders in the farming community, but no racial breakdown. Trump showed footage of political rallies with participants singing "Kill the Boer," led by Julius Malema, who holds no official government position. The article clarifies these claims, providing context and factual data to counter misinformation.</p>

          <p>The House passed a tax bill that includes changes to the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), raising the cap to $40,000 for incomes under $500,000. This provision, enacted via the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017, previously had a $10,000 limit, and the new cap would phase out over $500,000. The SALT cap and income phaseout would increase annually by 1% from 2026 through 2033. The revised text would also reduce itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket, which could reduce the benefit of the higher SALT cap.</p>

Kneecap denies the offence, calling it "political policing," and says they have never supported Hamas or Hezbollah, nor would they incite violence against any individual.

Trump celebrated the bill's passage, highlighting provisions such as "No Tax on Tips and No Tax on Overtime" and tax deductions for American-made vehicles.

          <p>A pause on tariffs on Chinese goods has led to increased import orders from Asia, but retailers are still concerned about potential shortages. The CNBC Supply Chain Survey indicates that while some stalled orders have resumed, they are insufficient to eliminate retail shortage risks. Retailers report that even with reduced tariffs, import taxes remain high, and some freight was abandoned due to costs. This could lead to lower inventory, fewer product selections, and higher prices for consumers, with uncertainty remaining in business decision-making.</p>

          <p>Republicans in the House passed President Donald Trump's tax bill, but it faces a complex path through the Senate. The bill includes amendments designed to win over both moderates and conservatives, such as moving up the timeline for Medicaid work requirements and increasing the cap on SALT deductions to $40,000 for taxpayers reporting less than $500,000 in income. Democrats are vehemently opposed to the bill's cuts to the social safety net, while analysts worry about the potential for exploding federal deficits and weaker long-term fiscal health.

While the U.S. has paused higher "reciprocal" tariffs, a base levy of 10% remains in place.

          <p>Amidst political transitions and trade tensions, Alberta, a conservative Western province, is considering a referendum on seceding from Canada. Premier Danielle Smith is seeking leverage to renegotiate Alberta's relationship with the federal government, primarily to unshackle the province's oil industry from climate change regulations. The move is driven by long-standing grievances over Alberta's place in Canada's federal system and its vast oil-and-gas resources. While the likelihood of secession is slim, the referendum push is angering Indigenous people and posing a challenge for new Prime Minister Mark Carney.</p>

The bill pairs cuts to food assistance and health insurance for low-income Americans with even larger tax cuts for affluent ones. The minority party has complained that the majority is "jamming through" major legislation, and the House cemented the billâ€™s majority support with a series of last-minute changes whose effects have not been digested. The bill spikes the deficit, largely because it devotes more money to lining the pockets of lawyers and CEOs than it saves by immiserating fast-food employees and ride-share drivers.</p>

The report has generated pushback from Republicans and the agriculture industry over concerns about the focus on agricultural chemicals.

It claims that Bates, often the public face of defending Biden, did so without firsthand knowledge of the presidentâ€™s condition. The book has sparked intense reactions, with some criticizing the media's coverage of Biden's mental acuity and others pushing back against the book's framing.</p>
