          <p>A large-scale Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv resulted in at least 15 deaths and over 100 injuries, marking one of the most intense assaults on the capital since the start of the full-scale war. A drone strike hit an apartment block, destroying numerous flats, while Ukrainian officials reported that the country was targeted with 440 drones and 32 missiles. President Zelensky described the attack as one of the most terrifying strikes, with Russia claiming to have targeted Ukraine's military-industrial complexes. The strikes lasted over nine hours, forcing residents into underground shelters, and a 62-year-old US citizen was among those killed during the bombardment. Optimism surrounding the event is low given the high death toll and extensive damage.</p>

          <p>During a meeting with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the G7 Summit, President Trump displayed a trade agreement signed with the UK, accidentally dropping the document and initially misidentifying it as an agreement with the European Union. When questioned about the differences between this agreement and a previous one signed in May, Trump stated that there were not many significant changes. The White House clarified that the agreement was indeed with the United Kingdom, and provided additional details regarding steel and aluminum quotas. Trump praised Starmer's performance as Prime Minister, concluding the bilateral meeting on a positive note.</p>

          <p>A new book, *Apple in China*, explores how Apple's deep involvement in China revolutionized the country's manufacturing capabilities and economy, potentially altering the geopolitical landscape. Apple's partnership with Foxconn and other Chinese manufacturers led to the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and infrastructure in China, training millions of workers and contributing significantly to China's industrial base. The book raises questions about whether Apple's pursuit of profit inadvertently bolstered a major geopolitical rival, as China learned to emulate the Apple model with other American companies like Tesla. While this arrangement created wealth and cheaper electronics, it also made Apple heavily dependent on China's production capabilities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump left the G7 summit in Canada earlier than planned to address pressing issues in the Middle East, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. The change in schedule led to the cancellation of planned bilateral meetings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, as well as a press conference. Trump had earlier warned of an imminent evacuation of Tehran on social media. Prior to his departure, Trump indicated that Iran was interested in discussing de-escalation amid ongoing aerial attacks between Tehran and Israel.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has decided to reduce its government bond-buying program at a slower pace than initially planned, while maintaining its current interest rates. This decision reflects a cautious approach to normalizing monetary policy due to uncertainties surrounding trade and economic conditions, particularly in light of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies. BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda expressed concerns about the potential negative impact of Trump's tariffs on Japan's export-driven economy.

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of Health and Human Services, is under scrutiny for misrepresenting scientific findings and making slanderous claims about science and scientists, particularly in relation to vaccine policy. Kennedy summarily fired 17 public members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ACIP). He also misrepresented research on vaccines and appointed individuals with anti-vaccine records to the committee. These actions have been criticized for undermining the credibility of government recommendations on immunization and endangering public health.</p>

          <p>Unite Here Local 11, a hospitality union, is launching two ballot measures in response to efforts to repeal a city ordinance that would raise the minimum wage for Los Angeles hotel and airport workers to $30 an hour by 2028. One measure proposes raising the citywide minimum wage to $30 by 2028, while the other would require public votes on large hotel and event center projects. Union officials describe the measures as a response to business groups' criticism of singling out the tourism industry for wage increases. Business leaders warn that the proposals could lead to job losses and deter investment in the city.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of Donald Trump's immigration policies argues that mass deportations are ineffective and driven by a desire to instill terror, despite evidence that they harm the economy. Historical precedent, such as Operation Wetback in 1954, shows that mass deportations fail to stop illegal immigration and can lead to exploitation of workers and alienation within communities. The author contends that Trump's seemingly softening stance towards certain industries reveals an understanding of the economic disruptions caused by deportations. However, the underlying goal is to create fear and control, rather than improve economic conditions.</p>

Advocates argue that the gardens provide vital outdoor space and community benefits, especially for those in smaller apartments.
