        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's historically predictable four-year price cycle, which revolves around the 'halving' event, appears to be breaking down due to new market forces. The recent U.S. approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has introduced significant institutional investment, altering traditional dynamics and causing the cryptocurrency to hit a new all-time high before the halving, rather than after. Analysts suggest that increased market maturity, supportive regulation, and long-term holder accumulation are replacing the old rhythm with behavior more sensitive to macroeconomic trends. Consequently, the era of severe 80% price crashes may be over, though significant volatility is still expected. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump issued a strong warning to U.S. courts against any ruling that would block his administration's tariff policies, claiming the duties have had a 'huge positive impact' on the stock market. In a social media post, he argued that overturning the tariffs at this stage would be impossible to recover from and could trigger a severe economic downturn comparable to the Great Depression of 1929. The comments come as a federal appeals court considers legal challenges that argue the tariffs exceed emergency powers granted to the president.</p>

          <p>A deadline set by President Donald Trump for Russia to cease its war in Ukraine is set to expire, with markets watching to see if the White House will impose steep 'secondary tariffs' on Moscow's trade partners. Trump has made ending the war a key foreign policy goal but has grown frustrated with the lack of diplomatic progress, threatening duties of 'about 100%' on countries trading with Russia. Despite last-minute talks between U.S. and Russian officials, the outcome remains uncertain as key disagreements over territory and NATO ambitions persist.</p>

The demand follows a letter from Senator Tom Cotton raising concerns about Tan's investment ties to Chinese companies, including some allegedly linked to the Chinese military. In response, Intel's stock slipped, and the company released a statement from Tan affirming his commitment to U.S. national security and dismissing the allegations as 'misinformation' about his past roles.</p>

          <p>The UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) will take over an investigation into allegations that South Yorkshire Police officers sexually abused children in Rotherham during the 1990s and early 2000s. The decision follows a BBC report where five women, who were victims of grooming gangs, claimed they were also abused by officers. The move to an independent body was made in the interest of transparency after South Yorkshire Police faced criticism for initially investigating its own former officers, ensuring victims remain at the center of the inquiry.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has sided with the Trump administration, throwing out a district judge's criminal contempt order against federal officials regarding the deportation of Venezuelan migrants. The lower court judge, James Boasberg, had found probable cause that officials violated his order to halt the removals, which were carried out under the Alien Enemies Act. The 2-1 appellate decision represents a major legal victory for the administration, with the majority opinion stating the court's intervention would prevent extended conflict between the executive and judicial branches over foreign policy.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed revoking a 2009 'endangerment finding' that serves as the legal basis for regulating greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles. If passed, this would repeal all greenhouse gas standards for cars and trucks, significantly easing pressure on automakers to produce electric vehicles. Experts suggest this move would allow manufacturers to more closely align their vehicle offerings with the current pace of consumer EV adoption, though it would likely face significant legal challenges and would not drastically alter near-term production plans.</p>

          <p>The takeover battle for Assura, a major landlord for the UK's National Health Service, has intensified as the country's competition watchdog investigates a £1.7bn bid from rival Primary Health Properties (PHP). While that deal is under review, U.S. private equity firm KKR is actively lobbying Assura's board to accept its competing £1.696bn cash offer, arguing its bid faces no competition concerns. Assura's board continues to back the PHP offer, creating a high-stakes situation for the future ownership of hundreds of UK medical facilities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The price of U.S. gold futures surged to an all-time high after it was revealed that the United States would apply its 39% tariff rate to imports of 1kg and 100-ounce cast gold bars. This clarification from U.S. Customs is a major trade blow to Switzerland, which dominates the global gold refining industry and had seen a massive increase in exports to the U.S. as investors sought a safe haven. The Swiss precious metals association stated the tariff makes it 'economically unviable' to export these products to the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

This move runs directly counter to the strengthening global legal consensus, including a recent unanimous opinion from the International Court of Justice. The world court concluded that nations have a binding legal obligation to protect the climate system, framing the U.S. position as a stark and concerning outlier on the world stage.</p>

          <p>Shares of the salad chain Sweetgreen dropped over 25% after the company significantly cut its 2025 financial outlook for the second time in two quarters. The company cited a combination of headwinds, including a more cautious consumer, challenges with its new loyalty program, and the impact of tariffs on its costs. Sweetgreen now expects negative same-store sales between 4% and 6% for the full year and a lower restaurant-level profit margin, signaling significant operational and economic pressures.
