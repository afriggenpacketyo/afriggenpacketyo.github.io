          <p>A super PAC aligned with socialist New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, who has publicly stated that billionaires should not exist, has accepted a $250,000 donation. The contribution, its largest this cycle, came from Elizabeth Simons, the daughter of the late billionaire hedge fund manager Jamie Simons. This has drawn accusations of hypocrisy from political opponents, including former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who highlighted the contradiction between Mamdani's anti-billionaire rhetoric and his PAC's funding sources. The Mamdani campaign has not responded to inquiries about whether the funds would be returned.</p>

          <p>Coventry City Football Club has successfully purchased the Coventry Building Society Arena, its home stadium, from Frasers Group. Club owner Doug King described the acquisition as a pivotal moment, securing the club's long-term stability and future for generations of supporters. After years of uncertainty involving multiple stadium owners and home grounds since leaving Highfield Road in 2005, this move allows the club to control its own revenue streams and invest in facilities. The purchase, which includes the arena's hotel and casino, has been hailed as monumental by fans and former players.</p>

          <p>Manchester City was defeated 2-0 at home by Tottenham Hotspur, raising questions about manager Pep Guardiola's goalkeeping decisions. New signing James Trafford, who started over the long-time number one Ederson, had a difficult home debut, making a critical error that led to Tottenham's second goal. The loss highlighted the inexperience of City's young starting lineup and has intensified speculation about the team's goalkeeping situation, with Ederson linked to a move away and PSG's Gianluigi Donnarumma rumored as a potential replacement. Guardiola now faces a significant decision on who will be his primary goalkeeper for the season.</p>

          <p>The UK is expected to experience temperatures reaching 30C (86F) on the upcoming bank holiday Monday, continuing what is on track to be one of the hottest summers on record. The warm, sunny weather is attributed to the remnants of Hurricane Erin pushing tropical air towards the country. While the heat provides ideal conditions for events like the Notting Hill Carnival and Reading and Leeds festival, it will be short-lived. More unsettled weather, including wind and rain, is forecast to arrive on Tuesday and persist for the remainder of the week as the storm system moves over the British Isles.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has informed attorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, of its intent to deport him to Uganda. This development occurred after Abrego Garcia was released from a Tennessee jail, having declined an offer to be deported to Costa Rica in exchange for a guilty plea on human smuggling charges. His case gained prominence after he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March and subsequently brought back to the U.S. following a court order, only to be detained again.

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has revoked the security clearances of 37 former and current intelligence officials, including experts on Russian election interference. This action, coupled with a recent raid on former National Security Adviser John Bolton's home, is raising concerns about political retribution within the Trump administration. Critics suggest that these moves are part of an effort to de-politicize the intelligence community, but panelists on 'Washington Week' argue they create a sense of political retaliation. The decisions are being scrutinized for their potential impact on national security and the independence of intelligence agencies.</p>

          <p>A 53-year-old man, Mario Green, has been arrested in connection with the fatal shooting of his ex-wife at a Detroit hospital. The incident occurred Friday morning in the basement of Henry Ford Hospital, where the victim, Latricia Green, was an employee. The suspect allegedly shot her multiple times after a verbal altercation and fled the scene, prompting a large-scale manhunt. Police confirmed he was taken into custody without incident early Saturday morning. Records show the victim had filed for a personal protection order against her ex-husband about a month prior to the shooting, but it had not yet been served.</p>

          <p>After a five-year legal battle, a central Berlin street formerly known as 'Mohrenstrasse' (Moor Street) has been officially renamed 'Anton-Wilhelm-Amo-Strasse'. The new name honors Anton Wilhelm Amo, a Black German philosopher from the 18th century who was the first Africa-born scholar to earn a European doctorate. Activists had campaigned for decades to change the name, which has racist connotations linked to the enslavement of Africans in Prussia. The renaming, finalized on the International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade, is seen as a significant step in Germany's efforts to decolonize public spaces and acknowledge its colonial history.</p>

The defense argued that Kemp acted in self-defense after two men stole his truck, phone, and memorabilia, and then fired a shot at him first.

          <p>A massive landslide in Alaska's Tracy Arm fjord triggered a powerful tsunami, sending a wave over 1,400 feet up the opposite shore in a popular tourist area. Scientists and officials consider it a fortunate near-miss, as the event occurred early in the morning when the fjord was empty of tour boats and cruise ships. The incident highlights the growing risk of such events as climate change causes glaciers to retreat, potentially destabilizing mountain walls. Scientists are studying whether glacial 'de-buttressing' and thawing permafrost are increasing the frequency of these hazardous landslides in coastal regions.</p>

          <p>Market experts are expressing concern over a surge in retail investor funds flowing into speculative and high-risk exchange-traded funds (ETFs), such as single-stock and leveraged products. This trend is being viewed as a potential warning signal that the market may be overheating, drawing parallels to the retail-driven enthusiasm seen at the market top in 2020 and 2021. Data shows that while institutional investors dominate the overall ETF market, they are largely absent from these riskier categories, which are almost entirely owned by retail traders. The high volatility and complex nature of these products pose a significant risk to individual investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At least 25 people were killed in Gaza by Israeli strikes and shootings on Saturday, as the world's leading food security authority officially declared that famine is now present in Gaza City. The victims included displaced people sheltering in tents in Khan Younis and individuals seeking aid in northern Gaza. This formal famine declaration has intensified global calls for Israel to halt its offensive and allow more humanitarian aid into the besieged territory. Israel has denounced the report as a lie while continuing preparations for a major military operation in Gaza City, further complicating efforts for a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>The Texas Senate has passed a controversial Republican redistricting bill, sending the measure to Governor Greg Abbott, who has pledged to sign it swiftly. The proposal, which aims to create five new GOP-leaning congressional districts, was approved after a heated debate and a weekslong standoff in the House, where Democrats fled the state to deny a quorum. The mid-decade redistricting effort was encouraged by President Trump to help the Republican party secure its House majority ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Democrats have criticized the new map, arguing it dilutes minority voting power and have vowed to challenge its legality in court.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez, who are serving life sentences for the 1989 murders of their parents, have both been denied parole following separate hearings in California. The parole boards cited the brothers' behavior in prison as a key reason for the denials, rather than the original crimes. Details from the hearings revealed that Erik Menendez had been involved in fights, drug use, and possessed contraband, while Lyle was cited for anti-social traits like deception and rule-breaking, including a recent mobile phone violation. Both brothers expressed profound remorse for the killings, which they have long claimed were in self-defense against parental abuse.</p>

          <p>India's federal investigating agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), has initiated a criminal case against industrialist Anil Ambani and his company, Reliance Communications. The action follows a complaint from the State Bank of India, which alleges that the company defrauded the bank, resulting in losses of approximately $344 million. As part of the investigation, the CBI conducted searches at Ambani's residence in Mumbai and the offices of the now-insolvent company. A spokesperson for Ambani stated that he strongly denies all allegations and will defend himself against the charges of misusing and diverting bank funds.</p>

          <p>An investigation has found that users on the popular gaming platform Roblox are bypassing moderation systems to spread hate speech, including swastikas and racist slurs. In a popular game called 'Spray Paint!', players can graffiti hateful messages onto virtual walls, evading the platform's chat filters. This issue is part of a broader problem for Roblox, which faces numerous lawsuits over inappropriate content and child safety concerns, as over half of its user base is under 18. While Roblox states it has a 24/7 moderation system and takes swift action, critics and safety advocates argue that harmful content remains easily accessible to young players.</p>

Georgia Tech's strong focus on STEM fields likely contributes to the high median salaries its graduates command, solidifying its reputation as a top-value institution. The report highlights that while sticker price is a factor, a school's ability to provide a strong educational foundation for future success is a key component of its overall value.

          <p>College sports are undergoing a fundamental transformation as recent court rulings allow athletes to be compensated, moving the system away from its amateur roots. Over the past 75 years, college football and basketball have evolved into massive commercial enterprises, generating enormous revenue for universities. Now, with athletes able to receive payments from advertisers, fans, and their schools, the nature of their participation and the structure of collegiate athletics is being redefined. This shift is prompting discussions about the future of non-revenue-generating sports and whether student-athletes should be formally recognized as employees, which would mark the logical conclusion of this professionalization trend.</p>

After serving 40% of her sentence, she maintains that her right to free speech was violated, a sentiment echoed in a recent U.S. State Department report on UK speech restrictions.

After his progress with traditional therapy plateaued, the patient received the implant and has since regained significant movement and function.

Using legal structures like LLCs can shield the property from lawsuits and creditors.
