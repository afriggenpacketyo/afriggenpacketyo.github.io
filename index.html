          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, speaking in Ecuador, stated that the Trump administration intends to "wage war" on narco-terrorists, particularly those from Venezuela. He emphasized that these groups are terrorists, not just traffickers, and announced new designations for Ecuadorian gangs Los Choneros and Los Lobos as foreign terrorist organizations. This policy shift was underscored by a recent U.S. military strike on a cartel vessel off Venezuela, signaling a more aggressive, potentially lethal approach to combating the international drug trade. The U.S. is also committing funds and equipment to support Ecuador's efforts.</p>

          <p>Ford's large, gas-powered Expedition SUV is experiencing a significant sales surge, with August sales up over 53% year-over-year, marking a 21-year high for the model. This growth contrasts with the broader industry rush towards electric vehicles, indicating continued strong consumer demand for traditional internal combustion engine vehicles, particularly large family SUVs. While Ford's EV sales also saw an increase, the success of the high-profit Expedition highlights a segment of the market that remains robust. The trend suggests some consumers are still willing to make large purchases on gasoline vehicles despite higher fuel costs.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed an appeal to reinstate a nearly $500 million penalty against former President Donald Trump and his company, which was previously overturned. An appellate court had voided the fine, originally imposed by a trial judge for business fraud, ruling that it violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on "excessive fines." While the appellate court upheld the finding of fraud, it struck down the financial punishment. James is now taking the case to the New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, seeking to have the massive penalty restored.</p>

          <p>Residents of Gloucester, Massachusetts, are experiencing a pervasive "rotten egg" smell caused by a large amount of decaying invasive seaweed. The seaweed, identified as Heterosiphonia japonica, was pushed ashore and into a local estuary by the high winds and rough surf from the recent Hurricane Erin. As the seaweed decomposes without being washed back out to sea, it releases a strong, unpleasant odor. City officials have assured the public that while the stench is concerning, it is a natural process and is expected to dissipate gradually as the seaweed breaks down.</p>

          <p>During a Senate committee hearing, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. reiterated unsubstantiated claims about vaccines and defended recent changes to U.S. immunization policy. He expressed agreement with a new appointee who claimed mRNA vaccines cause "serious harm," a statement contrary to extensive scientific data confirming their safety and efficacy. Kennedy also clashed with senators over access to COVID-19 shots, arguing he is not limiting availability despite new FDA restrictions for healthy individuals. The testimony occurred amid a leadership shakeup at the CDC and accusations that the administration is politicizing public health agencies.</p>

The court heard that Hopper, who had performed hundreds of amputations professionally, intentionally used ice to freeze his own legs, leading to a "mysterious illness" that required their amputation below the knee. He then fraudulently claimed over £466,000 from insurers, stating the injuries were due to sepsis.

The decision has created uncertainty for companies, as the refund process is not guaranteed to be simple or automatic.

While the government has the final say on fee structures, the suggestion introduces a potential mechanism to incentivize better teaching.

          <p>Florida's Surgeon General, Dr. Joseph Ladapo, has announced the state's intention to abolish all vaccine mandates, including long-standing requirements for public school students. Ladapo called the current mandates "immoral" and stated that people have a right to make their own informed decisions about what to put in their bodies. The move, which would eliminate requirements for vaccines against diseases like measles and polio, has drawn sharp criticism from medical associations and public health experts. They warn that the policy is reckless and could lead to outbreaks of preventable diseases.</p>

          <p>Danish renewable energy company Orsted has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration after the Interior Department ordered it to stop construction on the Revolution Wind project. The offshore wind farm, located off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut, is 80% complete and has already received all necessary permits. Orsted's lawsuit calls the stop-work order unlawful and arbitrary, suggesting it is based on President Trump's well-known hostility towards wind power rather than the stated national security concerns. The company has invested $5 billion in the project, which now faces significant financial risk.</p>

          <p>A recent school shooting in Minneapolis highlights a disturbing trend where perpetrators seem to be performing for a specific online audience. The shooter's videos, filled with incoherent memes, racial slurs, and references to past killers, are part of a template designed to gain notoriety within morbid online communities that idolize violence. This article argues that treating these killers as puzzles to be solved misses the point; their primary goal is to become part of a "legacy of violence" and inspire the next attacker. The phenomenon is described as a "mass-shooter-creation machine," driven by a self-reinforcing fandom of terror.</p>

This move provides the U.S. with more tools to combat the groups, including intelligence sharing and the ability to take action against their finances and members. Rubio called the gang members "vicious animals" and linked the designation to a broader U.S. strategy to aggressively counter narco-terrorism in Latin America.

When questioned by senators, Kennedy stated flatly that Monarez was lying about the directive.

U.S. officials called the basis for the decision "illegitimate" and are engaging directly with the Norwegian government.

However, it cautions against viewing this as a monolithic "axis of upheaval," pointing out the limits and frictions within the relationships.

This move is part of the Trump administration's strategy to use notoriously harsh facilities to deter immigration, following similar initiatives at Guantánamo Bay.
