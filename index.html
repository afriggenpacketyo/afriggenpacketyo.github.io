        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to move forward with its contested plan for mass layoffs across the federal government, lifting a lower court's nationwide injunction. The ruling allows the resumption of workforce reductions at numerous agencies, part of a broader initiative to shrink the federal bureaucracy led by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Labor unions had challenged the move, arguing it unconstitutionally bypassed Congress's authority to structure and fund federal agencies. While the administration champions the decision as a victory for executive authority, opponents, including Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in her dissent, argue it greenlights legally dubious actions and puts essential public services at risk.</p>

          <p>Amid catastrophic flooding in central Texas that has claimed over 100 lives, the brother of former MLB pitcher Tyler Walker, along with his wife and son, have been reported missing. Mark Walker and his family were vacationing at a river house in Hunt, Texas, when the Guadalupe River flooded over the weekend. The family's mother expressed her distress, noting she last spoke to her son on Thursday before the disaster struck. This personal story highlights the widespread and tragic human impact of the severe weather event that has devastated multiple counties in the state.</p>

          <p>A team of volunteer firefighters and first responders from Acuña, Mexico, has crossed the border to assist in search and rescue operations following the deadly floods in Texas. The group, known as Fundación 911, is providing crucial support along the Guadalupe River, demonstrating a message of unity and cooperation amid ongoing U.S.-Mexico border tensions. Their leader emphasized that for firefighters, there are no borders when it comes to helping others in a crisis. U.S. Ambassador Ronald Johnson praised the effort, stating that the two nations are united as family, especially in times of need.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a plan to impose tariffs of up to 200% on pharmaceuticals imported into the United States, a move he stated would happen "very soon." However, he suggested that the industry would be given a grace period of about a year to a year and a half to onshore their manufacturing operations before the steep levies take effect. The pharmaceutical industry's largest lobbying group, PhRMA, has pushed back, arguing that such tariffs would be counterproductive, increasing costs and potentially leading to medicine shortages for patients.

          <p>The California School for the Deaf has agreed to a $14 million settlement with a former student who endured years of sexual abuse by a dorm attendant. The lawsuit detailed that the victim, who is deaf, was repeatedly subjected to sexual assault from the age of 10 and was threatened to ensure his silence. An investigation revealed that the convicted attendant, Ricardo Rose, had been the subject of numerous complaints over his 30-year tenure, which the school allegedly ignored. The settlement aims to provide the victim with resources to address the profound, lifelong impact of the abuse he suffered.</p>

The policy, which increases the state pension by the highest of inflation, wage growth, or 2.5%, is projected to cost £15.5 billion annually. The OBR report warns that the UK's public finances are in a vulnerable position due to rising age-related spending pressures and recent government reversals on planned spending cuts.

Using the recent Republican-led cuts to means-tested programs like Medicaid as a starting point, it challenges the simple narrative that universal benefits like Social Security are inherently safer from cuts. The analysis points to historical data showing significant growth in means-tested programs over the past few decades and suggests that a program's political strength may depend more on its beneficiaries, such as the elderly, than its universal nature.</p>

          <p>Consumers and restaurants in the U.S. are facing searingly high beef prices, which reached a record $5.98 per pound in May. The primary drivers of this surge are fundamental supply and demand issues, as a persistent American appetite for beef meets a shrinking national cattle herd. The number of beef cattle is at its lowest level since the 1960s, largely due to multi-year drought conditions that have reduced feedstock and forced ranchers to sell off their cows. Experts predict that prices will likely continue to rise and remain elevated for the next several years as the industry slowly works to rebuild herds.</p>

          <p>This review of the new James Gunn-directed "Superman" movie describes it as a deliberately lighter and more humorous departure from Zack Snyder's darker interpretations of the character. The film is positioned as an intentional throwback to the tone of the 1978 classic, which may please fans tired of grim superhero narratives but could disappoint others with its simplicity. The review notes that while the film has a playful tone and some effective humor, its visual effects can appear artificial. It also highlights the convincing performance of new lead David Corenswet and a strong, modern portrayal of Lois Lane by Rachel Brosnahan.</p>

          <p>Disneyland has announced that its popular Haunted Mansion attraction will close temporarily starting August 11 to prepare for its annual holiday transformation.

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that he is "not happy" with Russian President Vladimir Putin regarding the ongoing war in Ukraine, accusing the Russian leader of throwing "bulls---" at the United States. During a Cabinet meeting, Trump lamented the high weekly death toll from the conflict and suggested that Putin's niceties have proven to be meaningless. The comments came shortly after the Pentagon paused a weapons shipment to Ukraine, a move Trump claimed to have no knowledge of, before stating the U.S. would now send more weapons to help the country defend itself.</p>

          <p>This review praises the new James Gunn-directed "Superman" movie for its fresh and brilliant approach to the iconic character. Unlike previous films that isolate Superman as a lone god, this version places him in a world already populated with other superheroes, which helps to define his unique, earnest goodness. The film is described as consciously sincere and fun, moving away from the grim tone of recent DC films and embracing a whimsical, cartoon-like energy. The article argues that by having other characters, including his girlfriend Lois Lane, question his altruism, the film cleverly addresses and overcomes modern audience skepticism of such a purely good hero.</p>

Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy hailed the move as putting fans "back on the pitch at the heart of the game." An amendment to require more free-to-air Premier League matches was voted down.</p>

However, the article also emphasizes the critical trade-offs: CDs lock in a fixed rate but require funds to remain untouched, while high-yield savings accounts offer liquidity but have variable rates that are likely to change over time.

          <p>This article explores the increasingly radical and polarized discourse surrounding artificial intelligence, framing it as a conflict between two parallel universes: the believers and the atheists. It highlights the escalating rhetoric from AI proponents who see superintelligence as an inevitable, world-altering force, and from skeptics who dismiss the technology as an overhyped con. Using the story of a startup founder who unapologetically markets AI for "cheating," the article argues this polarization obscures more nuanced discussions about AI's real-world impacts on jobs, education, and society, turning the debate into a contest of faith rather than evidence.</p>

          <p>This article provides a guide for homeowners considering a no-closing-cost home equity line of credit (HELOC). It cautions that while these products eliminate upfront fees, the costs are typically absorbed by the lender and passed on to the borrower through higher interest rates or early closure penalties. Homeowners are advised to carefully calculate the break-even point to see if the long-term interest paid outweighs the initial savings. The article also notes that these HELOCs often come with stricter credit requirements and that reading the fine print on repayment penalties is crucial. (not investment advice)</p>
