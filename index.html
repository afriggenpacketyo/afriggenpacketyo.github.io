          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed former President Trump's comment that he isn't "the easiest guy to deal with," stating he hopes it's because he is tough on matters concerning Israel's future and security. In an exclusive interview, Netanyahu emphasized his responsibility to protect the Jewish state, referencing the long history of persecution and citing his actions against Iran as necessary for survival. Trump's full remark was complimentary, finishing with praise for Netanyahu's effectiveness, calling it what "makes him great" and acknowledging his "great job."</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that the next phase of the U.S.-brokered peace plan requires Hamas to disarm and demilitarize, echoing President Trump's warning that if they refuse, "we will disarm them." While expressing hope for a peaceful process, Netanyahu acknowledged the alternative could be violent, paraphrasing Trump's sentiment as "all hell breaks loose." The deal has already secured the release of all living Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, but the disarmament of Hamas remains a major unresolved issue in the broader plan for lasting peace.</p>

          <p>New Jersey Democratic gubernatorial nominee Mikie Sherrill is facing scrutiny for accepting over $25,500 in campaign donations from pharmaceutical companies linked to the opioid crisis, including AmerisourceBergen and Johnson & Johnson. The revelation comes as Sherrill has been actively criticizing her Republican opponent, Jack Ciattarelli, for his alleged ties to the same crisis through his former business. Ciattarelli's campaign has labeled Sherrill a hypocrite and threatened a defamation lawsuit over her claims, while Sherrill's campaign defended her record on fighting the opioid epidemic and called the focus on her donations a desperate attack.</p>

Photographer Wim van den Heever captured the shot after a decade of effort, using a camera trap to photograph the primarily nocturnal and solitary animal. The award, presented at London's Natural History Museum, highlights a collection of remarkable images from around the world celebrating nature. Other winning photographs showcase diverse subjects, from a beetle on a logged tree to moray eels scavenging at low tide.</p>

The White House Office of Management and Budget has stated the administration is preparing to endure the shutdown and will proceed with workforce reductions, including recent layoffs at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Officials are reportedly working on methods to pay federal law enforcement officers, following President Trump's earlier announcement that funds had been identified to pay military members during the stalemate.</p>

          <p>Samuel Lee Smithers, 72, was executed by lethal injection in Florida for the 1996 murders of Christy Cowan and Denise Roach. The two women were severely beaten and strangled before their bodies were found in a pond on a property where Smithers worked. This marks Florida's 14th execution of the year, a record since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976, with two more planned for the near future. The U.S. Supreme Court denied a final appeal that argued his age should make him ineligible for capital punishment.</p>

          <p>The Republic of Ireland achieved a crucial 1-0 victory against Armenia in their World Cup qualifying match, with the decisive moment occurring when Armenian captain Tigran Barseghyan was sent off for a headbutt.

          <p>As part of the ongoing U.S.-brokered peace deal, Hamas has handed over the remains of four more deceased Israeli hostages to the Red Cross for transfer to Israeli authorities.

While all 20 living hostages were returned by the deadline, the staggered return of the deceased has drawn criticism from Israeli officials, who consider it a violation of the agreement.

Kaiser Permanente has called the strike disruptive and offered a 21.5% pay raise, stating that the union's demands are economically unfeasible and would lead to higher healthcare costs for members.

          <p>Despite a record 582 gigawatts of new renewable energy capacity installed globally in 2024, the world is not on track to meet its climate targets, according to a report from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). The 15.1% growth falls short of the 16.6% annual increase required to achieve the goal set at COP28: tripling renewable capacity by 2030. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that the window to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius is rapidly closing.

          <p>The price of gold recently surpassed a historic high of $4,000 an ounce, marking its best performance since 1979, another period of high inflation and instability. This surge is driven by investors seeking a safe-haven asset amid global conflicts, a weakening U.S. dollar, and concerns over national debt. Central banks in emerging markets are also increasing their gold reserves to hedge against U.S. policy shocks. The simultaneous rise of both gold and the S&P 500 suggests a bifurcated market, with some investors betting on modern industry while others hedge against systemic collapse.

          <p>An opinion article explores the evolving identity of women in China, symbolized by the social media trend of urban professional women, or "Tracys," returning to their rural hometowns and temporarily reverting to their simpler "Cuihua" personas. This cultural phenomenon highlights a deeper transformation that has occurred since the 1950 Marriage Law, which first established gender equality as a legal principle. Despite decades of struggle and persistent societal challenges, the article argues that Chinese women are increasingly rewriting their own narratives and futures, navigating the complexities between traditional roles and modern ambitions.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has sided with a Michigan school district, ruling that it did not violate students' First Amendment rights by banning shirts with the political slogan "Let's Go Brandon." The phrase, a euphemism for an obscenity directed at then-President Joe Biden, was deemed vulgar by the school. In a 2-1 decision, the court majority stated that in a school setting, "vulgarity trumps politics," and that political speech does not grant students the right to use vulgarity, even if it is indirect. The dissenting judge argued that the phrase is political criticism without actual profanity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is experiencing a severe morale crisis following the layoff of 550 employees, representing over 10% of its workforce. The cuts are a response to ongoing federal budget uncertainty, particularly concerning the Mars Sample Return mission, and are not related to the current government shutdown. This recent reduction is part of a larger downsizing that has seen JPL's staff shrink by about one-third in the last two years. Employees describe the atmosphere as deeply unsettling, fearing the loss of scientific expertise and the potential impact on America's leadership in space exploration.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to terminate U.S. business with China related to cooking oil as a form of "retribution" for Beijing's refusal to purchase American soybeans. In a social media post, Trump labeled China's actions an "Economically Hostile Act" and suggested the U.S. could easily produce its own cooking oil. The move comes amid a protracted trade war that has seen China, previously the top buyer of U.S. soybeans, halt purchases since May. This latest threat has added to market volatility, causing the S&P 500 to dip after a series of fluctuating statements on U.S.-China trade relations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant disparity exists in how Americans perceive the economy, largely divided along income lines, according to JPMorgan's Cost of Living Survey. High-income consumers expressed substantially more confidence in their financial outlook, rating it a 6.2 out of 10 on average, compared to a 4.4 rating from low-income consumers. This "K-shaped" economic experience is further evidenced by the fact that nearly 60% of high-earners find it easier to cover monthly bills than a year ago, a sentiment shared by only 30% of low-earners. This gap highlights why affluent Americans continue to spend while others struggle with inflationary pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. has conducted another strike on a vessel off the coast of Venezuela, killing six people he identified as "narcoterrorists." This marks the fifth such operation since September, bringing the total reported death toll to 27, as the administration continues a military campaign against alleged drug cartels. The strikes are justified by the administration as part of a "non-international armed conflict," a designation that has drawn criticism from legal experts and neighboring countries. Critics suggest the operations are a political campaign to pressure Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.</p>
