          <h2>Trump Administration Reshapes Justice Department's Civil Rights Division</h2>

          <p>The Justice Department's civil rights division is experiencing a mass exodus as Trump administration officials aim to shift its focus away from traditional work, such as investigating police departments, to pursuing cases against the Ivy League and liberal cities. Over 100 lawyers are expected to resign, taking advantage of the administration's "deferred resignation program." Harmeet K. Dhillon, the new head of the division, welcomes the turnover, emphasizing the division's goal is to enforce federal civil rights laws, not promote what she deems "woke ideology."</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a new law that will deny asylum rights to individuals convicted of sexual assault offenses, regardless of their sentence length. This amendment to the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill aims to address concerns raised by cases like Abdul Ezedi, who was granted asylum despite being a convicted sex offender. The legislation also sets a 24-week target for asylum appeal decisions and introduces measures to combat fraudulent claims, including increased fines for immigration advisors. The Conservative party claims the measures are "too little, too late".</p>

          <p>The US's China policy under President Trump remains a mix of rhetoric, reaction, and escalation, creating uncertainty among allies and observers. Despite calling President Xi Jinping a "good friend," Trump has increased tariffs on Chinese imports, reigniting a trade war. US Vice-President J.D. Vance’s comment referring to the Chinese people as “peasants” has sparked outrage and raised questions about the administration’s judgment. The US Senate has yet to confirm an ambassador to Beijing, and without a clear mandate from the two presidents, any discussions would lack direction.</p>

          <p>A major power outage struck Spain and Portugal, causing widespread disruption by halting trains, subways, and traffic lights, as well as closing stores and canceling flights. Millions of people across the Iberian Peninsula were affected, and officials initially remained uncertain about the cause, though they ruled out a cyberattack. Electricity was gradually restored with the help of power funneled from Morocco and France, and authorities worked to fully resolve the issue. The event prompted emergency meetings among leaders in both countries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York suggests that a college degree may not always be worth the cost, especially as tuition continues to rise. While college graduates typically earn significantly more than those with only a high school diploma, factors like high out-of-pocket expenses, extended graduation timelines, and choice of major can diminish the return on investment. STEM majors generally yield the highest returns, while fields like fine arts and education offer the lowest. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court appears skeptical of a Minnesota school district's argument that students with disabilities must prove "bad faith" on the part of the school in order to prove discrimination. A family who sued the district argues that federal law requires only "deliberate indifference," a lower standard. Disability rights groups are concerned that if the court accepts the school district's argument, it could make it much harder for Americans with disabilities to bring court challenges.</p>

          <p>Flights from India to Europe and North America are experiencing delays and requiring fuel stops due to rerouting around Pakistan airspace amid rising tensions. Air India has added a fuel stop in Europe for flights to North America, adding up to four hours of travel time. IndiGo has suspended some flights to Central Asia because its planes can't make the longer trek. The airspace closure has caused disruptions for several airlines and passengers.</p>

          <h2>ICE Targets Unaccompanied Immigrant Children</h2>

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is reportedly seeking out unaccompanied immigrant children to deport or prosecute them or their sponsors. ICE is conducting "welfare checks" on children who arrived in the US alone, raising concerns about family separation. The ICE document shows officials are also gathering intelligence to see whether the children are a “flight risk” or a “threat to public safety” or whether they are viable to be deported. Critics argue that the operations are not benevolent and are criminalizing children and sponsors.</p>

          <h2>US and Mexico Reach Agreement on Screwworm</h2>

          <p>The United States and Mexico have reached an agreement on the handling of the New World screwworm pest, according to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins. The agreement comes after Rollins threatened to limit cattle imports from Mexico if the Mexican government did not take further action against the pest. The U.S. typically imports more than a million cattle a year from Mexico, and blocking imports would further tighten U.S. supplies.</p>
