          <p>Over 300 South Korean nationals were detained by ICE at a Hyundai-LG electric vehicle battery plant in Georgia for alleged visa violations, straining U.S.-South Korean diplomatic and economic ties. The large-scale immigration raid has drawn strong criticism from South Korean officials and public, who question the treatment of their citizens despite significant investment in the U.S. While the U.S. emphasizes legal immigration, South Korea seeks increased visas for skilled workers, highlighting a complex challenge. The incident underscores the delicate balance between immigration enforcement and fostering international economic partnerships, with both sides hoping for a resolution.</p>

          <p>The Labor Department's Office of Inspector General has launched an investigation into the Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) methods for collecting jobs and inflation data. This probe follows pressure from the Trump administration, which questioned the data's reliability after significant downward revisions to employment figures and the firing of the BLS Commissioner. The Inspector General will focus on challenges in collecting Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) data, as well as the process for reporting and revising monthly employment statistics. This review aims to address concerns regarding the accuracy and integrity of crucial economic indicators.</p>

          <p>UCLA backup quarterback Pierce Clarkson has been indefinitely suspended from the team following his arrest last week on an unspecified felony charge in California. Online jail records show a $30,000 bail, which he posted for release. While the exact charge remains undisclosed in public records, reports suggest it involves suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon, though not a firearm. The university's athletics department confirmed the suspension, pending the outcome of the legal process and an internal review. This incident marks a significant development for Clarkson, who is in his first season with the Bruins and has yet to make an appearance on the field.</p>

          <p>Three highly-regarded senior FBI agents, including former acting director Brian Driscoll, have filed a lawsuit accusing the Trump administration of a "campaign of retribution" against them. They allege being improperly fired for refusing to show loyalty to President Trump, thereby losing early retirement benefits. The lawsuit paints a picture of partisan and incompetent leadership within the FBI and Justice Department, willing to dismiss anyone who crossed the President. The agents claim their dismissals violated their constitutional rights to due process and free speech, underscoring significant concerns about political interference in national security agencies.</p>

          <p>The Universities of Kent and Greenwich are set to merge by autumn 2026, creating the UK's first "super-university" under the proposed name London and South East University Group. This move, welcomed by the Office for Students, aims to provide a stronger financial foundation amid economic challenges facing higher education, with many universities in deficit. While officials insist it's not a takeover, the University and College Union predicts job redundancies, particularly as Kent had faced financial difficulties. The new institution will serve nearly 50,000 students across existing campuses, with degrees still awarded in the individual university names.</p>

          <p>Oracle's stock surged by 40% on Wednesday, marking its most significant single-day gain since 1992, driven by exceptional demand for its cloud services. The company reported a staggering $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, a substantial increase from the previous year, propelling its market capitalization towards $1 trillion. This boom is attributed to its strategic position in the artificial intelligence sector, particularly its cloud infrastructure and access to Nvidia's GPUs. Analysts have expressed surprise and confidence, despite Oracle's slight miss on first-quarter revenue and earnings expectations, solidifying its role as a key AI enabler. (not investment advice)</p>

Scharf distinguished between the President's vocal opinions on interest rates and any actual impact on the Fed's autonomy, noting the central bank's leaders serve terms distinct from elected officials. Trump has frequently criticized the Fed and its Chair, Jerome Powell, for not lowering rates, even attempting to remove a Fed Governor.

While previous years saw similar slowdowns due to various factors, this year's situation is attributed to an early peak season front-loading caused by President Trump's tariff extensions, followed by a steady decrease in orders.

Experts attribute the rising costs to a lack of regulatory limits on ATM fees and banks compensating for lost revenue as consumers shift towards digital payments.

The trial revealed that Robert Park, against whom Ferns held a grudge for a road accident involving his disabled brother, planned the murder, with Platt carrying out the stabbing. The other two men assisted in the plot and as a getaway driver. All four received substantial jail sentences for the "targeted and pre-planned assassination."</p>

          <p>Poland, with support from NATO allies, scrambled warplanes to shoot down at least 19 Russian drones that violated its airspace during an attack on Ukraine, calling it an "act of aggression." This marks the first time NATO aircraft have engaged potential threats in allied airspace, demonstrating the alliance's resolve. Prime Minister Donald Tusk confirmed the downing of drones posing a direct threat, with no reported injuries. EU officials suggested the incursion was intentional, raising concerns about escalating Russian aggression. Poland has formally invoked Article 4 of the NATO treaty, underscoring the seriousness of the incident.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge has blocked President Donald Trump's attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, granting her a preliminary injunction. The judge ruled that Cook made a strong case that her removal violated the Federal Reserve Act's "for cause" provision, which is limited to conduct in office, not prior allegations like mortgage fraud that Trump cited. Cook, the first Black female Fed governor, denies wrongdoing. This decision upholds the Fed's independence and ensures Cook will participate in the upcoming meeting where an interest rate cut is expected. The Supreme Court is anticipated to have the final say on this unprecedented case.</p>

This move follows Joby's recent acquisition of Blade Air Mobility, which already operates helicopter and seaplane services. Passengers will soon be able to book flights directly through the Uber app in major global cities, though pricing and initial deployment locations are yet to be announced. This collaboration deepens a business relationship dating back to 2019, laying the groundwork for future electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicle services.</p>

Its success is largely driven by its food service business, particularly its popular made-from-scratch pizza, which often serves as a primary retail option in these "underserved" areas. The company recently reported strong fiscal first-quarter profits and inside sales growth. Casey's expansion strategy involves both building new stores and significant acquisitions, such as the $1.15 billion purchase of CEFCO Convenience Stores, despite increasing competition in the sector.</p>

          <p>Original Medicare, providing hospital and medical coverage for over 68 million retired Americans, has significant coverage gaps that often lead to unexpected out-of-pocket costs. Key exclusions include regular dental care, routine vision and hearing services, most outpatient prescription drugs, long-term care, and healthcare services received overseas. Additionally, certain preventive and alternative treatments may not be covered. With nearly 90% of beneficiaries supplementing their coverage, options like Medicare Advantage plans, which often bundle additional benefits, or Medicare Supplement (Medigap) plans, which cover out-of-pocket costs, are crucial for comprehensive health protection in retirement.

These minuscule specks are enriched with iron phosphate and iron sulfide, compounds often produced by microorganisms on Earth. While non-biological processes could also be responsible, the findings are significant enough to warrant further in-depth analysis, ideally with samples returned to Earth. However, the ambitious sample return mission faces uncertainty due to proposed budget cuts in President Trump's 2026 budget.</p>
