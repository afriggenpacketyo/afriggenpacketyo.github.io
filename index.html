          <p>Hurricane Erick rapidly intensified into a Category 3 major hurricane, posing a significant threat to Mexico's southern coast with destructive winds, flash floods, and storm surges. The storm's projected path includes the resort city of Acapulco, which was previously devastated by Hurricane Otis in 2023. Residents are taking precautions, recalling the unexpected intensity of Otis, while authorities are closing beaches and preparing shelters. Forecasters predict heavy rainfall and strong winds across several Mexican states, urging residents to heed government instructions and seek shelter. Optimism is low given the potential for devastation and the memories of past storms.</p>

The Disability Insurance fund is expected to be able to pay full benefits through at least 2099.

The remaining carbon budget to maintain a 50% chance of staying below 1.5C has shrunk to 130 billion tonnes of CO2. The current rate of warming is approximately 0.27C per decade, much faster than anything in the geological record. While the rate of emissions increases appears to be slowing, the scientists emphasize the importance of rapid and stringent emissions cuts.</p>

NICE concluded that the drugs were a poor use of taxpayer money and could lead to cuts in other services. The drugs slow the disease's progression but do not reverse it, potentially delaying the transition from mild to moderate dementia by a few months. Campaigners expressed disappointment, while some dementia experts supported the decision due to the drugs' high cost and modest benefits.</p>
