          <p>The National Air Traffic Controllers Association is directing its members to continue working during the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, despite going unpaid, warning of potential termination for non-compliance. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy acknowledged a slight increase in sick calls, which could lead to flight delays, and expressed concern for worker morale. Air traffic controllers are classified as essential workers, guaranteed back pay once funding is restored, but the situation highlights the hardships faced by federal employees during the impasse. A nationwide shortage of controllers has already contributed to airport delays.</p>

          <p>A deadly tornado that struck Enderlin, North Dakota, in June has been reclassified as an EF-5, the highest rating, by the National Weather Service, making it the first such twister in the U.S. in 12 years. The tornado, which had wind speeds exceeding 210 mph, caused three fatalities, extensive tree damage, and derailed train cars, including one thrown over 475 feet. It carved a 12-mile path of destruction and destroyed a farm, with one building's foundation swept clean. This severe weather event underscores the destructive power of extreme natural phenomena.</p>

This comes shortly after news of her split from husband Keith Urban after 19 years of marriage, with Kidman filing for divorce citing "irreconcilable differences." Sources close to the couple indicated the separation was "inevitable," as they had reportedly been living apart for some time. The event marks her first major public outing since the divorce announcement.</p>

          <h2>Los Angeles to Increase Parking Meter Rates and Extend Paid Hours</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles is implementing higher parking costs, raising meter prices by 50 cents per hour across its 35,000 paid spaces, effective by the end of October. The City Council also approved charging for parking on Sundays and extending paid hours until midnight in nightlife areas and 8 p.m. elsewhere. City transportation officials argue these changes will boost vehicle turnover, aiding local businesses, while also generating an estimated $14.4 million for the financially struggling city. Several neighboring cities have also recently increased their parking rates.</p>

          <p>U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, issued a temporary restraining order blocking the deployment of 200 California National Guard members to Portland, Oregon. The judge found no evidence that recent protests necessitated federalized troops, arguing such deployment without state consent risked sovereignty and inflamed tensions. This ruling came as Illinois and Chicago also filed a lawsuit to prevent a similar deployment to their city. President Trump, who is expected to appeal, stated he would consider invoking the Insurrection Act if courts or local officials impede his troop deployments.</p>

          <p>Avi Schiffmann, CEO of Friend, a company selling a $129 wearable AI companion, is embracing the widespread backlash against his NYC subway ad campaign. The ads, which imply AI superiority over human friends, have been heavily vandalized, a reaction Schiffmann claims was part of his strategy for "mindshare." Despite the product's flaws, high running costs, and only about 1,000 activations, Schiffmann, known for creating viral COVID-19 and Ukraine refugee websites, likens his AI pendant to a therapist, best friend, or even "talking to a god," amidst broader societal concerns about AI companionship.</p>

          <p>Metropolitan Police have dismantled an international gang suspected of smuggling up to 40,000 stolen mobile phones from the UK to China in the past year. The operation, triggered by a victim tracing a stolen iPhone, led to 18 arrests and the discovery of over 2,000 devices. The gang reportedly targeted Apple products for their profitability, with street thieves paid up to £300 per handset and devices selling for up to £4,000 in China. This crackdown addresses a significant rise in phone thefts in London, with police intensifying efforts despite budget cuts.</p>

Critics argue this trivializes the serious impact of the shutdown on federal workers and public services, exacerbating divisions rather than fostering governance.
