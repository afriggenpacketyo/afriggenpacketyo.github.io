        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The North Carolina legislature passed a new congressional map favoring Republicans, targeting Democratic Rep. Don Davis's district. Democrats plan to sue, alleging the map dilutes Black voters' power and violates voting rights. Republicans aim to gain an additional seat, bringing their total to 11 out of 14 congressional seats. The redraw is part of a broader GOP effort to maintain control of the House in the upcoming midterms, following similar actions in Texas and Missouri, with California Democrats attempting to counteract this trend. The political climate in North Carolina remains competitive, with Republicans controlling both U.S. Senate seats despite the state having a Democratic governor, lieutenant governor, and attorney general. Optimism is tempered by the contentious nature of redistricting and its potential impact on fair representation.</p>

          <p>Tesla reported a 12% increase in third-quarter revenue, ending two quarters of decline, but earnings missed analyst estimates, causing a stock dip. Net income decreased by 37% due to lower EV prices and increased operating expenses related to AI and R&D projects. The quarter was also impacted by the expiration of federal tax credits for electric vehicles, which had boosted sales earlier. Tesla aims to begin volume production of the Cybercab, Semi trucks, and Megapack 3 in 2026, with Cybercab production expected to start in the second quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to demolish the White House East Wing to construct a $300 million ballroom funded by private donors. The project, initially said not to interfere with the existing structure, now involves complete demolition, affecting First Lady Melania Trump's offices and the visitor's office. Historic groups have criticized the lack of public review, while opinions among tourists are divided. The administration argues the ballroom will enhance the White House's ability to host major events, but Democrats question the potential benefits for donors. The project is part of a series of changes made to the White House under the Trump administration.</p>

The agreement requires UVA to provide relevant data quarterly through 2028, with the university president personally certifying compliance. The move follows the resignation of UVA's president due to pressure from the Justice Department, which accused him of failing to end DEI practices. Columbia and Brown universities have also signed similar agreements to restore federal funding, reflecting a broader effort by the Trump administration to reform higher education according to its vision.</p>

OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, has said that the company needs capital to build AI that can do science, and that it is nice to show people cool new tech/products along the way, which may explain the shift.</p>

Adults with gum disease may be more likely to have signs of damage to the brain's white matter than people without gum disease.

Taking care of your mouth, including brushing, flossing, and regular dentist visits, decreases the risk.</p>
