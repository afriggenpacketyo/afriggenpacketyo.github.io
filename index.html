        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles is experiencing widespread protests following a series of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations, leading to a tense standoff between demonstrators and authorities. President Trump threatened federal intervention if local officials couldn't manage the situation, prompting California Governor Newsom to accuse the federal government of escalating tensions. The protests, sparked by ICE raids in multiple districts, involved hundreds of demonstrators blocking streets, setting fires, and clashing with law enforcement. Several officials have spoken out about the immigration operations and the subsequent protests, including criticism from L.A. Mayor Karen Bass and responses from White House staff and law enforcement agencies, showcasing the deeply divided opinions on the matter, with authorities making arrests for obstruction and promising further enforcement actions. The events underscore the ongoing conflict between federal immigration policies and local community concerns. Optimism around the situation is low given the escalating tensions.</p>

          <p>A Macau-based conglomerate, HN Group, is developing a luxury senior housing project in Zhuhai's Hengqin district, targeting affluent Hong Kong retirees. The Serensia Woods community aims to capitalize on the shortage of high-end retirement options in Hong Kong, offering a 133-room hotel, residential towers, wellness centers, and a spa. With Hong Kong's aging population, the project seeks to provide a professional care level absent in most at-home retirement situations. The development, costing 2 billion yuan (US$278.4 million), hopes to attract those who can afford average prices starting at HK$10 million, offering a compelling alternative to traditional retirement living.</p>

          <p>Following the Noto Peninsula earthquake, Japan is confronting the critical issue of sanitation during disasters, revealing that the nation is underprepared for maintaining toilet facilities when water and electricity are disrupted. Councilor Tsuyoshi Yamahana witnessed firsthand the unsanitary conditions at a train station after the quake, highlighting a problem that can lead to disease outbreaks and deter people from drinking enough water. Experts emphasize the need for better education on using portable toilets, as many residents are unfamiliar with them. Efforts are underway to teach elementary school students how to use these facilities to prevent future "toilet panic" and safeguard public health during emergencies, thus potentially saving lives in the long run.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European startup scene is currently debating the merits of adopting China's "996" work culture, which involves working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week, as some venture capitalists push for increased work hours to compete globally. However, many European founders and VCs are resisting this pressure, arguing that it glorifies overwork rather than smart work and clashes with European values and regulations. Critics contend that Europe's most successful companies have thrived through sustainable innovation cultures, not excessive work hours, and that aggressive funding and resources are more critical for the continent's startup ecosystem. There are also concerns that adopting such a culture could lead to decreased retention and a revolving door of talent, ultimately harming productivity and innovation.</p>

          <p>De Kai, an AI scientist, suggests that instead of viewing AI development as a competition, it should be approached as an "AI climate change challenge," which requires a paradigm shift where people "parent" AI systems. De Kai argues that since AI learns by absorbing online human interactions, it is crucial to be conscientious about the influences surrounding these systems. In his new book, *Raising AI: An Essential Guide to Parenting Our Future*, De Kai emphasizes the importance of being good role models for AI, as the systems are essentially learning from us. This concern is not new to De Kai, who has been advocating for AI ethics for many years, including serving on Google's short-lived AI ethics council.</p>

Pinta, who worked in agriculture in Israel, was taken from Kibbutz Nir Oz and his body was found in the Rafah area based on intelligence from the hostage task force. The army said he was abducted by the Mujahideen Brigades, the same group responsible for the abduction and killing of Shiri Bibas and her two children. This operation occurred amidst ongoing military campaigns in Gaza, where hospital officials reported numerous casualties, and the retrieval underscores the ongoing efforts to account for hostages taken during the conflict.</p>

          <p>Italy is holding a referendum on whether to halve the time required to apply for citizenship from 10 years to five, a move that has polarized the country. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni opposes the referendum, calling the current citizenship law "excellent" and urging Italians to abstain from voting, while advocates argue the reform would integrate long-term foreign residents who contribute to the country. The referendum aims to address Italy's shrinking and aging population by speeding up citizenship for legal workers and their children, potentially affecting up to 1.4 million people. However, critics argue it undermines Italian identity, highlighting the sensitive issue of who gets to be Italian amidst ongoing debates about immigration.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is planning to introduce a new registration system designed to encourage citizens to maintain strong ties with rural areas facing depopulation, with a goal of enlisting over 10 million users in the next decade. This initiative is a key part of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's efforts to revitalize regional areas and reverse the trend of people moving to major cities like Tokyo. The program involves a smartphone app where users can register with local governments, receiving information on local events and services, but it is unclear whether the program will offer more tangible benefits. The government also aims to promote living and working in multiple areas to encourage city dwellers to relocate to rural parts of the country, though some officials have criticized the plan as lacking novelty.</p>

Sovereignty, the Kentucky Derby winner, skipped the Preakness Stakes, becoming the first horse to win the Derby and Belmont without running in the Preakness since 1995. The race, shortened to 1 1/4 miles, saw Journalism finish second, with Baeza in third, mirroring the Derby results, and jockey Junior Alvarado celebrated his first Belmont Stakes win. The victory underscores Sovereignty's dominance and creates a notable rivalry with Journalism, who won the Preakness, setting the stage for potential future matchups.

          <p>Zambia is working to revive Sona, an ancient writing system from the Chokwe, Luchazi, and Luvale people, which was nearly erased by colonialism. The writing system consists of geometric patterns used on sand, cloth, and bodies, conveying mathematical principles, cosmic references, and instructions on community life. Originally taught and maintained by women, Sona is being rediscovered through research and the knowledge of surviving community elders. The Women's History Museum of Zambia is leading the effort to document and archive women's histories and indigenous knowledge, aiming to piece together a fragmented cultural heritage disrupted by colonial influences.</p>

          <p>A salmonella outbreak linked to August Egg Company in California has sickened at least 79 people across multiple states, leading to hospitalizations. The company voluntarily recalled 1.7 million dozen eggs sold under various brand names due to potential contamination. The recalled eggs were distributed in California, Nevada, and seven other states, with specific sell-by dates, and health officials have identified two illness sub-clusters linked to eggs served at restaurants. Consumers are advised to discard or return the recalled eggs, as symptoms of salmonella include diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps.</p>

          <p>The escalating conflict between Donald Trump and Elon Musk is exacerbating budget uncertainty at NASA, which faces significant cuts. The agency's proposed budget slashes funding for science projects by nearly half, potentially halting 40 science missions. Trump has threatened to withdraw federal contracts from Musk's SpaceX, a crucial partner for resupplying the International Space Station and future Moon and Mars missions. Experts warn that this uncertainty is negatively impacting the human space program, as long-term planning and cooperation are undermined, potentially shifting NASA's focus to lunar and Martian missions at the expense of other planetary and Earth observation programs.</p>

          <p>A parenting expert shares five essential insights gleaned from interviews with parents of high-achieving children and over 100 experts. These include fostering optimism, tailoring motivational approaches to individual children, recognizing learning opportunities in everyday tasks, cultivating a genuine love for knowledge, and motivating children with love rather than being a coach or critic. The expert emphasizes that academic strengths alone are insufficient without a sense of possibility and that parents should support their children's growth by exposing them to opportunities and allowing their own desires to drive them. The article suggests a shift towards fostering a love of learning and curiosity, particularly in the wake of the pandemic.</p>

The EU is considering standardizing sizing for free underseat baggage on EU airlines, potentially impacting UK passengers traveling to or from EU destinations. This move follows complaints of passengers being caught out by varying rules, leading to unexpected fees and humiliating experiences. Consumer groups argue for fairer and more consistent hand luggage rules to avoid surprises at the airport, while airlines maintain their policies comply with the law and keep fares low.</p>

Early data suggests that these pills can replace harmful gut bacteria with a mix of healthy bacteria, potentially clearing drug-resistant superbugs from the bowel. The pills are being tested on patients who had drug-resistant bacteria, showing promising signals that they could tackle the rising scourge of superbugs. The study also indicates that the therapy can diversify the array of gut bacteria, which is a sign of good health.</p>
