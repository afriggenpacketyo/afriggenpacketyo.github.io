          <p>In the Women's Cricket World Cup, Australian leg-spinner Alana King achieved the best bowling figures in the tournament's history, taking seven wickets for just 18 runs. This record-breaking performance led to a swift collapse for South Africa, who were bowled out for only 97 runs. Australia easily chased the target, winning by seven wickets with more than half their overs to spare. The decisive victory secures Australia's position at the top of the group stage table and sets up a semi-final clash against India, while South Africa will face England in their semi-final match.</p>

          <p>A vibrant 1943 Picasso portrait of his muse and partner, Dora Maar, has been sold for approximately $37 million at an auction in Paris. Titled "Bust of a Woman with a Flowered Hat (Dora Maar)," the painting had been in a private family collection since 1944 and was hidden from public view for over eight decades. The work captures a poignant moment towards the end of Picasso and Maar's tumultuous relationship, with experts noting its remarkably preserved, vivid colors. The sale price surpassed expectations and marked the highest amount paid for an artwork at a French auction this year.</p>

          <p>Overnight Russian missile and drone attacks have resulted in at least four deaths and 20 injuries across Ukraine. In the capital city of Kyiv, a ballistic missile strike killed two people and wounded thirteen, while two others were killed in the Dnipropetrovsk region where residential buildings were damaged. Ukraine's air force reported intercepting most of the 62 drones and nine missiles launched. Following the assault, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy renewed his urgent appeal for more Western air defense systems, specifically U.S. Patriot systems, to protect Ukrainian cities from such attacks.</p>

          <h2>Report Indicates Over a Third of Manhattan Condo Resales in Past Year Resulted in a Loss</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent analysis reveals that more than one-third of Manhattan condo apartments resold between mid-2024 and mid-2025 were sold for a loss. This trend highlights a decade of stagnant pricing in the New York City market, a stark contrast to the significant home price increases seen across most of the United States. The report from Brown Harris Stevens notes that when accounting for inflation, transaction costs, and renovations, the actual losses for sellers are likely even higher. However, the luxury segment, specifically properties over $10 million, has continued to see profits, driven by cash buyers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the arrest of two former NBA players in a rigged poker scheme allegedly involving La Cosa Nostra crime families, Meyer Lansky II, grandson of the infamous mobster, offered his perspective. He suggested that athletes, being natural risk-takers with significant adrenaline and wealth, can be drawn to gambling and the perceived power associated with mafia affiliations. Lansky II noted that money, power, and fame can make individuals feel invincible, leading them to engage in illicit activities. The article highlights that sports have historically been a target for the mafia due to the relative ease of fixing events compared to casino gambling.</p>

          <p>An opinion article critiques President Trump's sudden decision to demolish the 123-year-old East Wing of the White House to construct a new $300 million ballroom. The author argues the move, executed without submitted plans, reflects a disregard for history and norms, driven by personal desire and ego. The project is reportedly funded by private donors, including major tech and defense corporations, raising questions about influence and corruption. The author speculates that such a large-scale project could also signal Trump's potential intent to challenge presidential term limits and remain in office beyond his second term.</p>

          <p>Despite a significant drop in the number of active serial killers since their peak in the 1970s, public fascination with them persists, fueled by social media rumors and popular entertainment. Authorities in cities like Austin, New York, and Boston have recently had to debunk online theories about serial killers being active in their areas. Experts attribute the real-world decline in such crimes to factors like fewer hitchhikers, the advent of cellphones, and advancements in DNA technology. The article suggests that while the actual threat has diminished, the idea of the 'monster' serves a societal purpose, allowing for projections of societal fears and debates on human nature.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused the United States of "fabricating a new war" following the deployment of the USS Gerald R.

President Trump has accused Maduro of leading a drug-trafficking organization, fueling fears in Venezuela that the military buildup is a precursor to a regime change effort.

The election follows a tense period in which two of Ouattara's main rivals, Tidjane Thiam and former president Laurent Gbagbo, were barred from running, leading to protests and arrests. With a heavy security presence deployed, there are concerns about potential unrest in a country still marked by past election violence.</p>

          <p>Georgia's State Security Service has arrested three Chinese citizens in the capital city of Tbilisi for attempting to illegally purchase two kilograms of uranium. The suspects allegedly planned to pay $400,000 for the nuclear material with the intention of smuggling it to China via Russia. According to authorities, the operation was coordinated by other members of the criminal group from China. The security service released video footage of the detention, stating that the individuals were apprehended while negotiating the details of the illicit transaction. The identities of the suspects have not yet been disclosed.</p>

          <p>A recent report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) claims that far-left terrorist plots outnumbered far-right ones in the first half of 2025, a reversal of long-standing trends. This conclusion has ignited a debate among counterterrorism experts, many of whom argue the data set is too small to be conclusive and criticize the methodology for categorizing incidents. The discussion highlights the inherent complexities and subjectivity in tracking domestic terrorism, as there is no single official database. Critics worry the report could be misinterpreted, while also noting the more striking finding was a significant decline in right-wing attacks.</p>

          <p>China's near-total control over the global supply chain for rare earth elements, which are critical for high-tech, energy, and defense industries, remains a major vulnerability for Western economies. Beijing recently tightened its export controls on these materials, escalating trade tensions and prompting concerns about supply disruptions for products like electric vehicles and advanced electronics. Despite past efforts, the U.S. and Europe have made little progress in reducing their reliance on China. Establishing independent supply chains is hampered by the high environmental costs, technical complexity, and massive investment required for mining and processing these essential minerals.</p>

          <p>A recent Charles Schwab survey found that 45% of investors are interested in alternative investments like private equity and real estate, moving beyond traditional stocks and bonds. Financial advisors suggest that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offer a practical and liquid way to gain exposure to these less-traditional asset classes. Unlike direct private investments that often have long lockup periods, alternative ETFs can be traded freely. This approach aligns with a broader trend, as investors have poured over $1 trillion into ETFs this year, with significant flows into gold and crypto products. (not investment advice)</p>

In her victory speech, she called for the party to be "bolder" and pledged to be an ally to leader Keir Starmer while also bringing critical voices to the forefront of party discussions.</p>

The president's decision, which he said was based on being asked "very nicely" and on the advice of "friends," averted a crisis but also highlighted what the author describes as a capricious and alarming method of governance. While the immediate threat of a federal surge is gone, the article notes that the decision was based on personal relationships rather than policy or data, leaving the city vulnerable to future unpredictable interventions.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the progressive Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, has been the target of numerous racist and Islamophobic attacks from political opponents. Independent candidate and former governor Andrew Cuomo recently implied on a radio show that Mamdani, who would be the city's first Muslim mayor, would cheer for another 9/11-style attack. This follows a pattern of bigotry that includes manipulated images and ads from Cuomo's campaign, as well as incendiary comments from other political figures.

          <p>California has passed a new law, effective January 1, that will allow the year-round hunting of non-native mute swans. Wildlife officials argue the measure is necessary to protect the state's fragile wetlands, as the large, aggressive birds consume vast amounts of aquatic vegetation and displace native waterfowl. Mute swans, originally introduced from Eurasia as ornamental birds, have proliferated and can significantly degrade habitats. While conservation groups supported the bill as a tool to manage a problematic invasive species, some animal advocacy organizations have condemned the law as inhumane and a move to appease the hunting industry.</p>

The decision was made after non-lethal methods, such as hazing, failed to deter the attacks.

Louisiana, which expanded Medicaid in 2016, saw its uninsured rate drop, but the new law's work requirements and funding changes could reverse these gains, potentially causing over 300,000 to lose coverage. In impoverished communities like East Carroll Parish, Louisiana, where over 60% of residents rely on Medicaid, the cuts threaten access to essential healthcare.
