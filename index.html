          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has fully divested its stake in Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD, a 17-year investment that concluded earlier this year. BYD publicly acknowledged the sale, expressing gratitude to Buffett and Charlie Munger for their long-standing belief and support in the company, while emphasizing that buying and selling stocks is a normal part of investment. Despite a recent 6% drop in BYD shares in Hong Kong and a cut to its 2025 sales target, the company highlighted that Buffett realized a profit of 20 times his initial capital. Concurrently, Berkshire Hathaway is expanding its portfolio, having increased its holdings in several Japanese "trading house" stocks, with stakes in Mitsui and Mitsubishi now exceeding 10%.

          <p>Grammy-nominated singer Florence Welch has disclosed she underwent emergency life-saving surgery in August 2023 after experiencing an ectopic pregnancy. She unknowingly suffered serious internal bleeding while performing on stage at a festival, describing the experience as her closest brush with death. Following a miscarriage, Welch was diagnosed with a ruptured fallopian tube, necessitating immediate surgery to remove the organ. Ectopic pregnancies, where a fertilized egg implants outside the womb, occur in about one in 90 UK pregnancies and can become life-threatening if undiagnosed, often requiring urgent surgical intervention to prevent severe complications.</p>

          <p>Amber Smith, wife of former country music star Granger Smith, has revealed the harrowing details of her husband's near-suicide attempt in 2019, following the tragic drowning of their three-year-old son, River. In her forthcoming memoir, Amber describes Granger, overwhelmed by grief and alcohol, placing a Glock 9mm into his mouth. He later confessed how close he was to pulling the trigger, recalling tormenting visions of River's final moments. Granger, who has since become a minister, attributes his survival to a spiritual awakening, crying out to Jesus, which prompted him to turn to faith and ultimately retire from his music career. The couple has since dedicated themselves to advocating for children's water safety.</p>

To overcome this, the institution is actively promoting digital exhibitions, high-quality replicas, and photo displays for museums worldwide, pending state approval. This innovative approach aims to share Sanxingdui's rich cultural heritage and archaeological discoveries with a broader global audience, fostering international understanding and appreciation for its unique collection through modern technological solutions.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth to deploy "all necessary troops" to Portland, Oregon, and other ICE facilities, authorizing "Full Force" against alleged threats from "antifa" and domestic terrorists. Oregon Governor Tina Kotek and Portland officials swiftly pushed back, asserting there is "no need for military troops" in the city and warning against any federal takeover as a "threat to communities across Oregon." Separately, Trump is scheduled to meet with top congressional leaders on Monday to address the looming government funding deadline, following a previously canceled meeting and ongoing Democratic demands for bipartisan negotiations to avert a shutdown.</p>

          <p>This opinion article proposes that a potential return of Donald Trump to power could signal a significant shift, leading to the end of ideology in US-China relations. It suggests a "reverse convergence" where the US might adopt a more pragmatic approach to political legitimacy and issues of war and peace, mirroring China's stance, rather than the long-held Western fantasy of China converging with liberal democratic values. The author critiques traditional convergence theory for oversimplifying social change and underestimating power dynamics. This perspective implies a departure from previous diplomatic frameworks, potentially reshaping global interactions between the two superpowers.</p>

          <p>Widespread United Nations sanctions against Iran have officially been reimposed, marking the first time in a decade such measures are active, after last-ditch nuclear talks with Western powers failed. Britain, France, and Germany triggered the "snapback" mechanism at the UN Security Council, citing Iran's alleged violations of the 2015 nuclear deal and lack of transparency regarding its nuclear program. The sanctions will freeze Iran's overseas assets, halt arms deals, and penalize ballistic missile development. In response, Tehran recalled its ambassadors to the three European nations for consultations, maintaining that the re-imposition of international sanctions is "unfair, unjust, and illegal."</p>

This trial explores future food sources and innovative climate change mitigation strategies, particularly the potential for cultivating rice on peat soils in Cambridgeshire. Flooding these soils could effectively lock away greenhouse gases, offering a solution to emissions from drying peatlands. While currently a risky commercial crop, researchers believe rice could become a widely viable crop in the UK within the next decade if average temperatures continue to rise.</p>

David Ellison's Skydance recently acquired Paramount, gaining control of CBS, and the family is reportedly preparing a bid for Warner Bros. Discovery.

She hopes this incident prompts improved security at ICE facilities and challenges the government's characterization of the victims as "criminal illegal aliens."</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's increasingly unfiltered and combative public statements suggest he feels more invincible than ever, according to this article. From claiming to have "found an answer on autism" to expressing hatred for opponents at a memorial service, Trump's rhetoric consistently pushes boundaries and challenges conventions. He effectively leverages professional disapproval as a sign of authenticity, framing inconsistencies as strategic genius rather than liabilities. His strong reaction to former FBI Director James Comey's indictment further reinforces his image as someone operating above normal political and legal consequences, projecting an aura of untouchability across various public and international forums.</p>

          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy's forthcoming book, "Life, Law, & Liberty," offers rare insights into his 30-year tenure, during which he was often the pivotal swing justice. Kennedy asserts, "The cases swung, not me," as the court grew more conservative, and expresses deep concern over the current state of American discourse and the tone of some Supreme Court opinions. He reveals how his views evolved on issues like same-sex marriage, influenced by the plight of children with gay parents, and abortion, where he balanced moral opposition with constitutional liberty. The article also details his reconciliation with Justice Scalia and his rejection of strict originalism.</p>

          <p>A deadly shooting at a Dallas ICE field office resulted in one death and two critical injuries, with all victims identified as detainees. The shooter, 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, died from a self-inflicted wound, and evidence suggests an anti-ICE motive, including "ANTI ICE" engraved on shell casings. The deceased detainee was Norlan Guzman-Fuentes from El Salvador, while the injured were Miguel Angel Garcia-Hernandez from Mexico and Jose Andres Bordones-Molina from Venezuela. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem condemned the attack as motivated by hatred, blaming anti-ICE rhetoric, and ordered immediate increases in security at ICE facilities nationwide.</p>

          <h2>Collagen Supplements for Skin Aging: Efficacy Debated by Dermatologists</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article investigates the efficacy of collagen supplements in reducing signs of skin aging, a popular but debated topic among consumers and clinicians. While some users report benefits like brighter skin, thicker hair, and stronger nails, consultant dermatologists express skepticism about oral collagen's ability to effectively reach and impact skin cells. Conflicting research findings exist, with industry-funded studies suggesting positive effects, while independent studies often show no significant impact. Experts generally recommend marine collagen over vegan options but emphasize that sunblock, a healthy diet, and avoiding smoking are far more effective strategies for maintaining overall skin health.</p>

          <p>Bali, long celebrated as a tropical paradise, is increasingly facing disillusionment among tourists and suffering from the severe impacts of overtourism, transforming into a congested reality of crowds, traffic, and rampant construction. The idealized image promoted on social media often clashes starkly with the island's environmental strain, recently highlighted by deadly floods exacerbated by poor waste management and unchecked urban development. Locals lament the erosion of traditional culture and natural beauty as tourist hotspots expand into once-serene areas. While authorities are now restricting new construction and promoting sustainable tourism, many believe these interventions are "too little, too late" for the "crucible of overtourism."</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto, now a powerful Category 5 storm, is swirling north of the Caribbean and could potentially interact with another developing system in the western Atlantic, a rare meteorological phenomenon known as the Fujiwhara effect. This occurs when two storms merge or spin around a common center, with the outcome dependent on their comparative strength. While Humberto is expected to remain offshore, the second system, tropical depression Imelda, is forecast to strengthen into a tropical storm and approach the southeastern US coastline early next week, bringing a threat of heavy rainfall.

          <p>President Donald Trump posted an AI-generated cartoon image on Truth Social depicting him pointing his finger and shouting "YOU'RE FIRED!" at Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. This latest public criticism follows Trump's repeated attacks on Powell for his cautious approach to interest rates, despite the Fed recently lowering them for the first time this year. Firing a Fed chair would be an unprecedented act in US history, and a recent Supreme Court decision suggests the president lacks the unilateral authority to do so. Economists and investors fear such a move could severely compromise the Fed's independence and potentially destabilize financial markets.</p>
