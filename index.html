          <p>In the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, Andrew Cuomo conceded to Zohran Mamdani after initial results showed Mamdani leading with 44% of the vote. Cuomo acknowledged Mamdani's effective campaign, particularly among young voters, but hinted at a potential independent run in November. Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, focused on a progressive platform centered around economic issues, including rent freezes and fare elimination for buses. Despite Cuomo's concession, the race will proceed to a ranked-choice count due to no candidate securing over 50% of the vote, with final results expected in mid-July.</p>

          <p>Antoinette Lattouf, an Australian journalist, won her case against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), with a court ruling that she was unfairly dismissed over a social media post about the war in Gaza. The court found that the ABC sacked Lattouf for reasons including her opinions on the Israeli military campaign in Gaza, after she shared a Human Rights Watch post accusing Israel of war crimes. The ABC has since apologized for how it handled the matter, saying it had "let down our staff and audiences." Lattouf was awarded damages, and her dismissal had triggered public outrage and raised questions over the broadcaster's independence and support for culturally diverse staff.</p>

          <p>Steve Witkoff, Special Envoy to the Middle East, asserted that the ceasefire between Israel and Iran is holding, emphasizing that "no one's shooting at each other." He dismissed the notion that Iran could resume its nuclear enrichment program within months as "not even conceivable." Witkoff condemned the leak of an initial intelligence assessment suggesting that U.S. strikes only set back Iran's nuclear program by a few months, labeling it "treasonous." This assessment contrasts with President Trump's claim that the strikes "completely destroyed" Iran's nuclear program.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom and Democratic lawmakers reached a tentative agreement on a $321 billion state budget, contingent on the Legislature passing a housing reform proposal. The deal addresses a $12 billion budget deficit through borrowing, reserves, and funding shifts, reflecting resistance to Newsom's proposed cuts. A key component involves overhauling environmental regulations to accelerate housing construction, with Newsom pushing for exemptions to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The budget also includes changes to Medi-Cal funding and preserves funding for film and television tax credits, while anticipating future financial challenges and potential federal funding losses.</p>

This contrasts with President Donald Trump's claims that the strikes "fully obliterated" Iran's nuclear program.

          <p>Satellite imagery from Maxar Technologies reveals significant damage to key Iranian nuclear sites, including Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan, following U.S. airstrikes. The images show craters along access roads and entrances to tunnel complexes at Fordow, and damage to surface structures at Isfahan. At Natanz, craters believed to be caused by U.S. ordnance are filled and covered with dirt. IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi confirmed that key buildings and underground systems at all three sites were hit, with American officials claiming the strikes have severely set back Iran's nuclear program.</p>

          <p>The New York City mayoral primary is a battle between state assemblyman Zohran Mamdani and former Governor Andrew Cuomo, seen as a proxy war for the Democratic Party's internal divisions. Mamdani, a democratic socialist, focuses on affordability with proposals like free public buses and rent freezes, while Cuomo emphasizes experience and public safety. Mamdani has gained support from younger, left-leaning voters, while Cuomo leads among older New Yorkers and black voters. The outcome is being closely watched nationally as a test for the Democratic Party's messaging.</p>

          <p>An initial classified assessment found that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months, according to sources familiar with its contents. The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) assessment said the strikes caused the entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities, including Fordo, to be sealed off. The assessment also indicates some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was moved before the strikes, and provides a range of possibilities for how long it will take for Iran to regain access to the underground facilities, ranging from a few months to less than a year.</p>
