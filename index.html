          <p>Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy has stated that the BBC's license fee is becoming increasingly 'unenforceable' due to fewer people paying it, raising questions about its long-term viability. Nandy highlighted concerns about enforcement practices, particularly targeting vulnerable women, and expressed openness to exploring alternative funding models. While ruling out general taxation, she suggested a subscription model could be considered, emphasizing the need for public input to create a fairer and more sustainable system. The BBC acknowledges the need for reform and looks forward to engaging with the government on the next Charter review to secure its future.</p>

          <p>The Chinese embassy in Washington has refuted claims made by US President Donald Trump that China and the US are engaged in tariff negotiations. The embassy described Trump's assertions as 'purely misleading,' emphasizing that no consultations or negotiations on tariffs have taken place, nor has any agreement been reached. Trump had stated in an interview and before Pope Francis' funeral that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping regarding tariffs, promising to disclose details later. This denial marks another instance of conflicting narratives between the two nations regarding trade relations.</p>

          <p>Chris Eubank Jr. and Conor Benn both made weight for their middleweight contest at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, following Eubank's initial fine for being slightly over the limit. Both fighters were subject to a rehydration clause, ensuring they remained under 12st 1lb on the day of the fight. This match comes over 30 years after their fathers' famous rivalry, with their scheduled 2022 fight canceled due to Benn's failed drugs test. Eubank, typically a higher weight class fighter, faces welterweight Benn in what is expected to be a lucrative bout for both.</p>

          <p>A third round of talks between Iran and the United States regarding Tehran’s nuclear activities has commenced in Oman, raising hopes for a new agreement to prevent further conflict in the Middle East. President Trump has expressed optimism about reaching a deal with Iran, noting his previous abandonment of the 2018 nuclear agreement. The negotiations aim to reshape regional and global security by reducing the potential for a US-backed Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear facilities and preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, with the added possibility of easing American sanctions and attracting foreign investment to Iran.</p>

          <p>Ten years after Freddie Gray's death sparked unrest, his neighborhood of Sandtown-Winchester in Baltimore continues to face significant challenges, including a shuttered recreation center symbolizing persistent struggles. Despite promises of investment and change from political leaders, many commitments have not materialized, leading to waning attention and a sense of disillusionment. While some progress has been made, such as a consent decree addressing disproportionate policing of Black residents, the community still struggles with issues like addiction and lack of resources. Activists and community leaders are working to create hope and revitalize the neighborhood, with plans for a new recreation center by 2027.</p>

          <p>Employee cuts at the Social Security Administration (SSA) are leaving remaining workers overwhelmed and struggling to keep up with public demand, according to Jessica LaPointe, a field office employee in Wisconsin. The Trump administration's efforts to reduce the federal government workforce have resulted in significant staff reductions at the SSA, impacting service delivery and increasing wait times for phone services. Advocates warn that these cuts amount to a reduction in services, as benefits delayed are effectively benefits denied. The agency plans to reassign workers from headquarters and regional offices to frontline roles, but concerns remain about the loss of expertise and knowledge.</p>

          <p>Federal judges in Maryland, New Hampshire, and Washington, D.C., have blocked the Trump administration's efforts to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in schools.

The judges cited concerns about academic freedom, the vagueness of the administration's definition of 'DEI programs,' and the potential chilling effect on teachers.

A palaeontologist believes the fossils, approximately 140 to 180 million years old and containing ammonites, were likely brought to the garden from Dorset by collectors or builders. Elliott, an aspiring palaeontologist, is thrilled by his finds, inspiring him to continue his fossil hunting endeavors.</p>

          <p>England's key battles to secure a Grand Slam in the Women's Six Nations 2025 will depend on their tactical kicking game against France. France's attacking flair and dangerous backs require accuracy from the boot to win the territorial battle and shut down opportunities. Scrum-half Pauline Bourdon Sansus and fly-half Carla Arbez pose significant threats, and England's tactical shift towards Saracens fly-half Zoe Harrison aims to exploit space behind France's back three. Former England fly-half Katy Daley-Mclean emphasizes the importance of a long kicking game to pressure France and dominate territory.</p>

          <p>President Trump has pardoned Paul Walczak, a Florida health care executive whose mother, Elizabeth Fago, was involved in efforts to publicize Ashley Biden's diary. Walczak was recently sentenced to 18 months in prison and ordered to pay nearly $4.4 million in restitution for tax crimes. His mother, a Republican donor, was contacted during the 2020 campaign by someone possessing Ashley Biden's diary, which contained sensitive information. The pardon has raised questions given the connection to efforts to undermine Joseph R. Biden Jr.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Louisiana has expressed concern over the Trump administration's deportation of a 2-year-old U.S. citizen to Honduras, stating that it occurred 'with no meaningful process' and against the wishes of her father. Judge Terry A. Doughty questioned why the child, V.M.L., was sent to Honduras with her mother despite the father's emergency petition to prevent her deportation. Asserting that it is illegal and unconstitutional to deport a U.S. citizen, Judge Doughty has scheduled a hearing to investigate the circumstances surrounding the deportation.</p>
