          <p>UK Member of Parliament Diane Abbott has been suspended from the Labour Party following an investigation into recent comments she made regarding racism. The controversy stems from a BBC interview where she stated she did not regret her 2023 remarks that appeared to downplay antisemitism compared to racism based on skin color. As a result of the suspension, Abbott, the longest-serving female MP, will now sit as an independent. The party leadership has refrained from commenting further while its internal investigation is active.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are struggling to pass a $9 billion spending cuts package requested by President Trump, as the effort has been complicated by internal party divisions over the Jeffrey Epstein files. Democrats on the House Rules Committee have pushed for amendments to force the release of the Epstein documents, leveraging the controversy to stall the rescissions bill. With a critical legislative deadline looming, the debate highlights a rift within the Republican base, pitting fiscal priorities against demands for transparency in the Epstein case. Speaker Mike Johnson defended his members, stating they are trying to proceed with their work.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has acknowledged that European nations have been "free-riders" on U.S. defense spending in the past but asserts that they are now increasing their contributions. In a BBC interview, Merz stated that Russia's war in Ukraine serves as a significant threat to European peace and freedom, necessitating greater military investment. He is working to boost defense ties with the UK and France, forming a triangular alliance to focus on security and economic growth. Merz noted that while he and President Trump are coordinating on Ukraine, the U.S. is turning its focus to Asia, reinforcing the need for European self-reliance.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of people participated in marches and rallies across all 50 U.S. states to protest the Trump administration and honor the legacy of civil rights icon John Lewis. The "Good Trouble Lives On" events, held on the fifth anniversary of the late congressman's death, advocated for voting rights and social justice. Organizers demanded an end to administration policies they say target minority groups and slash social programs. The protests, inspired by Lewis's call to make "good trouble, necessary trouble," included voter registration drives, teach-ins, and vigils across more than 1,500 locations.</p>

          <p>Cristosal, El Salvador's most prominent human rights group, has announced it is shutting down its in-country operations due to escalating threats from President Nayib Bukele's government. The organization, which has documented abuses for 25 years, cited legal harassment, espionage, and defamation campaigns as making it unsafe to continue its work. Cristosal's leadership stated the arrest of one of its activists was a "breaking point," forcing them to choose between "exile or prison." The group will now operate from neighboring Guatemala and Honduras, joining a growing number of journalists and activists who have fled the country.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein, a move that follows intense political pressure. The directive came shortly after a Wall Street Journal report detailed a "bawdy" birthday note allegedly from Trump to Epstein in 2003, which included a crude drawing and a message about "wonderful secrets." Trump has vehemently denied the letter's authenticity, labeling it a "hoax" and threatening to sue the newspaper. This development escalates the ongoing controversy surrounding the Epstein case files.</p>

The two-time major champion later downplayed the incident, admitting he also had a bad swing but used the moment to release tension.

          <p>China has unveiled a new military drone that takes off and lands vertically on its tail, similar to a rocket, before transitioning to horizontal flight. The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), developed by the state-owned Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group, was recently tested for reconnaissance and situational awareness in a mountainous region. Its design, which resembles the U.S. military's MQ-35 V-BAT, allows for high-speed flight without the need for a runway, offering significant deployment flexibility. The drone's intelligent control system also demonstrated autonomous capabilities like route planning and threat avoidance.</p>

          <p>The state of California has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for canceling $4 billion in federal funding for its high-speed rail project. The suit, filed by the state's attorney general, claims the decision was arbitrary, politically motivated, and an abuse of discretion that will cause significant economic harm. Governor Gavin Newsom characterized the move as a "political stunt to punish California" and an attack on jobs in the Central Valley, where construction is underway. The administration cited budget shortfalls and missed deadlines in a compliance review as the basis for terminating the funds.</p>

Despite the cooling, this marks the 39th consecutive month that inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target.

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency after experiencing mild swelling in his lower legs. The announcement followed public speculation prompted by photographs showing bruising on his hand. A physician's note described the condition as benign and common for individuals over 70, stating there was no evidence of more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis or heart failure. The bruising was attributed to tissue damage from frequent handshaking combined with aspirin use, with the president's overall health described as excellent.</p>

          <p>Five migrants deported from the U.S. to Eswatini under a third-country agreement are being held in solitary confinement for an indefinite period, according to a government spokesperson. The men, convicted of serious crimes including murder and sexual assault of a child, were sent to the southern African nation because their home countries would not accept them. This action is part of the Trump administration's controversial policy of sending deportees to countries with which they have no ties. Human rights reports have cited credible accounts of torture and cruel punishment in Eswatini's prison system.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This political analysis explores the context behind Diane Abbott's recent suspension from the Labour Party, arguing the party had little choice to maintain consistency. It traces the issue back to her 2023 letter and her recent interview statement of "no regret" for the comments that led to her initial suspension. The article posits that under Keir Starmer's leadership, which has been defined by a zero-tolerance approach to antisemitism following the Corbyn era, any perceived wavering would undermine his core pledge. Her lack of regret for the original remarks effectively forced the party's hand.</p>

          <p>CBS has announced it will cancel "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert" in May 2026, ending the franchise due to financial pressures and a challenging advertising market in late-night television. Colbert, who has hosted the top-rated show for a decade, announced the news to a surprised audience, clarifying that he is not being replaced and the entire show is going away. The decision highlights a dramatic shift in media consumption, as younger audiences increasingly watch short clips online rather than full broadcast shows. The move comes as parent company Paramount Global awaits approval for a sale expected to bring more cost-cutting.</p>

          <p>Beef prices in the United States have reached record highs, with the average price of ground beef climbing to $6.12 per pound in June. Experts attribute the steady rise to a shrinking national cattle herd, which is at its lowest level since 1951 due to factors like long-term drought and high feed costs. The situation is exacerbated by a ban on cattle imports from Mexico due to a parasite outbreak and the potential impact of widespread tariffs on beef imports. With strong consumer demand during grilling season, analysts do not expect significant price relief for consumers in the near future.</p>

Although Abbott beat revenue and earnings expectations, investors were disappointed by the tightening of its full-year guidance, causing shares to fall over 8%. Ford attributed the revised forecast to weaker-than-expected performance in its diagnostics business in China but emphasized that the fundamentals of the company remain strong.
