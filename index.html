            <p>The Virginia Department of Health (VDH) has confirmed the state's first measles case this year, involving a child under four who recently traveled internationally. Health officials are working to identify potential exposures, emphasizing that the MMR vaccine is the best defense against the highly contagious disease. This case arrives amid measles outbreaks in eight other states, highlighting the importance of vaccination, especially for international travelers and infants too young to be vaccinated. Symptoms of measles include fever, runny nose, and a characteristic rash that appears several days after initial symptoms.</p>

            <p>Two Pentagon officials, Dan Caldwell and Dan Selnick, were fired after being suspended earlier in the week as part of an investigation into unauthorized disclosures. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's chief of staff initiated the probe, which includes the possibility of polygraph tests to identify leakers. Caldwell, Selnick, and another official, Colin Carroll, released a joint statement expressing disappointment and denying any wrongdoing, claiming they were not informed of the specifics of the investigation. The investigation began the same day that the Pentagon denied Elon Musk was coming to the Pentagon for a classified briefing on war plans with China, but officials say the investigation is looking at more than just one story.</p>

            <p>Aditya Wahyu Harsono, an Indonesian student and father, was detained by ICE at his Minnesota hospital workplace after his student visa was secretly revoked. His attorney claims the revocation was based on a minor graffiti conviction from 2022, typically not a deportable offense, and that the government revoked his visa without notice. Harsono is also a supporter of humanitarian relief for Gaza, raising concerns about potential targeting based on his activism. His wife and infant daughter, who has special needs, are reportedly distraught, and efforts to pay his bond were blocked by DHS appeal. This case is part of a larger wave of student visa revocations under the Trump administration.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily halted the deportation of Venezuelans detained in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. This decision followed an emergency appeal by the ACLU, arguing that the administration was moving to deport individuals without due process. The ACLU cited concerns that the detainees, accused of gang affiliation, could face harsh imprisonment in El Salvador. The White House defended its actions, claiming the detainees were "foreign terrorists," while the ACLU celebrated the court's intervention to protect the detainees' rights.</p>

            <p>With trade tensions ongoing between the US and China, the upcoming Asean summit in Kuala Lumpur could provide an opportunity for both nations to engage in negotiations. Despite President Trump's apparent unwillingness to compromise on tariffs, Asean's convening power could offer a face-saving solution. While Trump has exempted some electronics from tariffs, this may not be enough to persuade China to engage, so Asean should leverage its convening power to invite Trump and Xi – or key officials in their administrations – to Kuala Lumpur so they can talk it out.</p>

            <p>Israeli strikes in Gaza have resulted in over 90 Palestinian deaths in the last 48 hours, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The strikes have intensified as Israeli troops aim to pressure Hamas to release hostages and disarm. Among the deceased are women and children, some of whom were sheltering in designated humanitarian zones. Aid groups have raised concerns about malnutrition and dwindling food supplies in Gaza, while the Israeli Prime Minister stated that Israel will not end the war until Hamas is destroyed and all hostages are returned.</p>
