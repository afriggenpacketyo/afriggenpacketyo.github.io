          <p>The opening of the HS2 high-speed rail line is anticipated to be delayed beyond 2033, marking another setback for the project that has already faced numerous scaling back and delays. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander is expected to inform Parliament that delivering the railway line on schedule and within budget is not feasible, attributing the cost increases of £37 billion between 2012 and the general election last year to Conservative governments. The original plan for HS2 involved creating high-speed rail links between London and major cities in the Midlands and North of England to reduce journey times and expand railway capacity, but the Birmingham to Manchester leg was canceled in 2023 due to escalating costs. Two reports into HS2 are set to be released to address what went wrong and learn lessons for future infrastructure projects, with the remaining project cost estimated between £45bn and £57bn. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Sean "Diddy" Combs' sex trafficking trial in New York City continues with jurors viewing explicit videos allegedly used to blackmail women. Prosecutors argue Combs produced and saved these videos as potential blackmail material to ensure the women's silence, while Combs' attorneys claim the videos show consensual participation in the orgies, called "freak-offs" or "hotel nights." Judge Arun Subramanian issued a stern warning to lawyers on both sides for allegedly violating a strict gag order, threatening sanctions for any leaks of non-public information. The prosecution is using the testimony of a special agent to show how Combs allegedly used his business empire to covertly run a criminal enterprise, with evidence presented of Combs' company bank accounts being used to pay for personal expenses and airline tickets for women. Defense lawyers plan to present a brief case to bolster their claims that the sex parties involved consenting adults and that Combs never engaged in sex trafficking.</p>

          <p>Aerial attacks between Israel and Iran have persisted for five days following Israel's surprise operation targeting Iran's nuclear program, which resulted in the destruction of key facilities and the deaths of nuclear scientists and military leaders.

President Donald Trump has increased speculation about potential U.S. involvement, warning Iran's supreme leader that he is an easy target and that America's patience is wearing thin, while also calling for Tehran's unconditional surrender. The U.S. president stated that America now has complete and total control of the skies over Iran and that Iran's defensive equipment does not compare to American-made technology.</p>

          <p>England forward Alessia Russo expressed her preference to avoid social media during major tournaments due to the potential harm from online abuse, citing personal experiences and the importance of focusing on team goals. Her comments align with similar sentiments from other Lionesses teammates, including Grace Clinton and Lauren James, who have also faced online abuse. Russo emphasized that the opinions of teammates, coaches, and family are the most important, and staying away from social media helps her maintain focus, and she aims to support younger players in dealing with online negativity. Other players like Kiera Walsh and Lucy Bronze also shared their experiences with social media's negative aspects, highlighting the balance between its benefits and drawbacks.</p>

The meeting occurs against a complex geopolitical backdrop, including the impact of President Trump's tariffs and the Israel-Iran conflict, which could destabilize the global energy picture.

          <p>Sayed Naser, an Afghan man who worked with U.S. troops in Afghanistan, was detained by ICE after attending a mandatory immigration hearing in San Diego, despite being legally paroled into the U.S. in 2024. Naser served as a civilian interpreter for the U.S. military from 2015 to 2018 and has a pending Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) case, but was taken into custody after a DHS lawyer stated his case was "improvidently issued." Advocates argue that "improvidently issued" is becoming a catch-all justification for detaining asylum-seekers, with #AfghanEvac advocating for U.S. wartime allies, and Naser's lawyer expressing shock at the increase in ICE arrests outside immigration hearings. The Trump administration has also terminated Temporary Protected Status for Afghans and instituted a travel ban on nationals from Afghanistan and 11 other countries, raising concerns about the safety of Afghan allies.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department experienced a reduction of 4,000 employees through the Trump administration's downsizing initiative, resulting in an estimated savings of $470 million. Further reductions are planned, including 1,500 positions in the FBI, raising concerns about the impact on safety in U.S. communities. Former officials and law enforcement analysts have expressed concerns that the cuts are draining the Justice Department of experienced agents and leaders, undermining long-term effectiveness and investigative capacity. The agency also plans to shutter the Community Relations Service, founded during the civil rights era to prevent and resolve racial and ethnic tensions, with former officials criticizing the decision as detrimental during times of growing tension.</p>

The GENIUS Act sets requirements for full reserve backing, monthly audits, and anti-money laundering compliance, while also granting broad authority to the Treasury Secretary.

          <p>Former Senator Bob Menendez reported to the Federal Correctional Institution in Pennsylvania to begin serving an 11-year sentence following his conviction on federal bribery charges. Menendez was convicted of accepting bribes in exchange for political favors, including protecting business owners and meeting with Egyptian officials, with FBI agents finding $480,000 in cash and gold bars in his home. He resigned from the Senate a month after his conviction, maintaining his innocence and claiming he was targeted due to his opposition to President Obama's Iran and Cuba policies.

          <p>The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments regarding President Trump's decision to deploy federal troops to Los Angeles, questioning both the decision and the court’s right to review it. The administration argued that the president has nearly unlimited discretion to deploy the military on American streets, while California officials argued that this interpretation is dangerously broad and risks harm to American democratic norms. The Trump administration claimed troops were deployed to ensure immigration enforcement, while state and local officials said the move was unjustified and political. The court's decision is expected to influence future interpretations of presidential power, with the issue likely to reach the Supreme Court.</p>

The bomb is specifically designed for use against underground targets protected by thick concrete, and only the U.S. military has access to it and the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber required for delivery. The U.S. has remained noncommittal about possible involvement, while the IAEA has warned about the dangers of attacks on nuclear facilities.</p>

          <p>New Yorkers will use ranked-choice voting in the upcoming Democratic mayoral primary, allowing them to rank their top five candidates. If no candidate receives over 50% of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and subsequent rounds count voters' second-choice votes. This system has led to unusual alliances, with some candidates cross-endorsing each other to prevent former Gov. Andrew Cuomo from winning. The election board expects to provide preliminary totals for first-choice votes on June 24, with fuller results reported on July 1 due to the complexity of tabulating ranked-choice ballots.</p>

ByteDance told the White House that China would no longer approve the deal until trade and tariff issues were resolved, and Trump has expressed confidence that China will eventually sign off on an agreement.

The Senate Finance Committee released legislative text tackling issues like Medicaid and clean energy tax credits, aiming to make the 2017 Trump tax cuts permanent. The Senate version would boost the debt limit by $5 trillion, up from the House's $4 trillion figure, and includes different provisions for state and local tax deductions (SALT), taxes on tips and overtime, and green energy rollbacks. The Senate bill would match some elements of the House version by implementing work requirements for Medicaid, while also lowering provider tax in states that expanded Medicaid.</p>
