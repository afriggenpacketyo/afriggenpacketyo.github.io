          <p>A former sanitation worker at India's Dharmasthala pilgrimage center has alleged a shocking cover-up of hundreds of murders and sexual assaults, primarily involving women and minor girls, spanning nearly two decades. He claims he was coerced into secretly disposing of bodies, some showing clear signs of sexual assault and violence, near the Nethravathi river. This disturbing confession prompted the Karnataka government to launch a Special Investigation Team, leading families of missing individuals to demand renewed probes into long-unresolved cases. The revelations have ignited widespread public debate and calls for accountability, as authorities delve into these grave allegations.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's Starlink satellite internet service suffered a significant, multi-hour network outage on Thursday, affecting over 60,000 users globally. The disruption occurred shortly after T-Mobile officially rolled out its Starlink-powered satellite service, designed to extend mobile connectivity to remote areas without traditional cell towers. While Musk apologized and confirmed service restoration later that day, T-Mobile stated its new service operated normally without any network impacts. This incident underscores the inherent challenges and complexities involved in maintaining large-scale satellite internet infrastructure and its integration with mobile networks.</p>

          <h2>Niger Faces Worsening Conditions Two Years Post-Coup Amidst Military Rule and Human Rights Concerns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two years after the 2023 coup, Niger remains under military rule, with conditions reportedly worsening for many citizens. General Abdourahmane Tchiani's government, which seized power citing insecurity and Western influence, has significantly restricted civil society, causing job losses in NGOs and increased youth unemployment. Human rights organizations report ongoing crackdowns on freedom of expression and arbitrary detentions of former government officials, without due process. Niger's withdrawal from ECOWAS and the military leader's declared five-year term indicate that a return to civilian democratic rule is unlikely in the foreseeable future, deepening the regional political divide.</p>

          <p>Germany's postal services, primarily Deutsche Post and DHL, are facing a significant surge in customer complaints, with nearly 23,000 reports in the first half of the year, marking a 13% increase. Customers are increasingly frustrated by issues such as damaged parcels, incorrect deliveries, and substantial delays, as seen with dead insect larvae and lost mobile phones. Unions attribute these problems to ongoing restructuring and announced job cuts, including an additional 8,000 positions by year-end. While the company cites heatwaves and union walkouts, critics argue these issues stem from prioritizing cost savings over service quality, leading to a record year of complaints.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron's decision to formally recognize Palestine as a state at the upcoming UN General Assembly is intensifying diplomatic pressure on the UK. While France hopes this move will create momentum for a two-state solution, Britain has traditionally held that recognition should be part of a final peace settlement, not a precursor. The UK government now faces growing calls from its own Members of Parliament and international partners to align with France, despite concerns about potentially upsetting key allies like the United States and Israel. This development highlights a significant divergence in European policy on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

Trump described the meeting as positive, interpreting Powell's comments about the economy's strength as a signal for impending monetary easing, despite the Fed's previous caution regarding inflation. While the White House continues to advocate for a review of the central bank's management, Trump has softened his stance on Powell's position. However, futures markets indicate low expectations for an immediate rate cut, with a potential move not anticipated until September. (not investment advice)</p>

Social factors like changes in status and loss contribute to its onset. Treatment options include medication and psychotherapy, though medication for older adults requires careful consideration due to potential interactions. Challenges in research, such as excluding vulnerable patients from trials, hinder progress in understanding and treating this complex condition.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has escalated his long-standing "media war" by filing a $10 billion libel lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal and its owners, including Rupert Murdoch. The suit targets a story detailing an alleged sexually suggestive birthday note Trump sent to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003. This aggressive action aligns with Trump's broader strategy of using legal means to challenge media outlets he perceives as critical, aiming to discredit their reporting and control public narratives. The lawsuit also led to Journal reporters being barred from a presidential trip, signaling a continued effort to restrict independent press access.</p>

          <p>LaQuayia "LQ" Goldring, 35, has received a life-saving kidney transplant after enduring a decade on dialysis, just days after her story was featured on "CBS Sunday Morning."

This marks her second transplant, having first undergone one as a teenager after cancer caused her kidneys to fail. She plans to continue advocating for living donations, emphasizing their critical importance and the significantly improved outcomes they offer for patients awaiting organ transplants.</p>

          <p>The UN's human rights chief, Volker Turk, has strongly criticized the UK government's proscription of Palestine Action under counter-terrorism legislation, deeming it "disproportionate and unnecessary." The ban, which criminalizes membership or support for the group, followed activists claiming responsibility for significant damage to military aircraft. Turk argues that the UK's broad definition of terrorism, encompassing property damage, misuses the gravity of terrorism and infringes upon international human rights law concerning freedom of expression and assembly. The decision is currently being challenged in the High Court, as arrests related to the ban continue across the country.</p>

          <p>Thailand's acting Prime Minister has warned that escalating border clashes with Cambodia, which have resulted in at least 16 deaths and tens of thousands displaced, could intensify into "war." The fighting, now involving heavy weapons and spreading across multiple locations, has seen both nations accuse each other of initiating hostilities and targeting civilian areas. Cambodia alleges Thailand used banned cluster munitions. Despite international appeals for an immediate ceasefire, Thailand insists on bilateral resolution, rejecting third-party mediation. The UN Security Council is expected to meet to address the intensifying, century-old territorial dispute.</p>

          <p>Actress Sarah Jessica Parker shared her early career experience of meticulously making $40 last for three days, emphasizing the profound importance of financial security. After moving out at 18 with limited savings, she learned to budget judiciously while navigating auditions, recognizing the "security in being able to pay your bills." Financial experts suggest that for freelancers or gig workers with unpredictable incomes, a "bucketing strategy"—allocating percentages of earnings to essentials, savings, and discretionary spending—is more effective than strict daily rationing. Building an emergency fund and actively seeking income growth opportunities are crucial for long-term financial stability.</p>

          <p>British fashion retailer River Island faces a critical High Court ruling on restructuring plans, proposing to close 33 UK stores and seek rent reductions at 71 others. The company attributes its substantial financial losses to increased online shopping and escalating operational costs. Intense competition from online giants like Shein and Temu, coupled with an expensive, outdated store portfolio, has severely challenged the brand. While River Island expresses confidence in its plan, experts suggest it requires more time and a significant rebranding effort to regain customer loyalty and ensure long-term viability.</p>

          <p>A National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) report concluded that excessive moose meat and improperly secured antlers caused the 2023 plane crash that killed Eugene “Buzzy” Peltola Jr., husband of then-Alaska congresswoman Mary Peltola. The pilot, flying alone, exceeded the plane's maximum certified gross weight by nearly 120 pounds and had antlers tied to a wing strut, significantly degrading flight performance. Investigators stated these factors led to a loss of control shortly after takeoff, causing the fatal wreck. Peltola Jr., a former Bureau of Indian Affairs director, initially survived the impact but succumbed to his injuries hours later.</p>

This makes CDs an appealing option for savers looking to lock in strong returns that outpace inflation, especially as short-term CDs currently offer better rates than longer terms due to an inverted yield curve.
