          <p>President Trump's ambitious plan for a new US missile defense system, dubbed the "Golden Dome," is drawing both support and criticism. Modeled after Israel's Iron Dome, the system aims to protect against aerial threats, including those from outer space, at an estimated cost of $175 billion. While the Pentagon cites growing threats from Russia and China as justification, critics question the project's feasibility and cost. The Chinese Foreign Ministry has already condemned the plan, raising concerns about its impact on global strategic stability. Canada has expressed interest in potentially collaborating on the project.</p>

          <p>The Enhanced Games, an event promoted as "Olympics on Drugs" and supported by the Trump family, is moving forward despite widespread condemnation. Organizers claim that Greek swimmer Kristian Gkolomeev has broken the 50-meters freestyle world record using performance-enhancing drugs, though this is not recognized by any official sporting body. The Enhanced Games promises substantial cash prizes for winners and record-breakers, attracting investors like Donald Trump Jr. Critics, including the World Anti-Doping Agency, decry the event as a dangerous spectacle that sacrifices athlete health for entertainment.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-22 06:02:36 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Higher-than-expected government borrowing in April has increased the likelihood of tax increases in the autumn, according to financial experts. Borrowing reached £20.2bn, exceeding the previous year's figures and raising concerns about Chancellor Rachel Reeves' ability to meet spending and borrowing rules. Economists predict weaker economic growth will further strain government finances. The Prime Minister's recent decision to partially reverse cuts to winter fuel payments adds to the Chancellor's dilemma. Some economists suggest the government may need to spend more on defense, further increasing the pressure for tax rises. </p>

          <p>A High Court judge has temporarily blocked the UK government from finalizing a deal to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. The injunction was filed by two Chagossian women who seek to return to the islands, particularly Diego Garcia, which houses a UK-US military base. The proposed agreement would allow the UK and US to continue using the base for 99 years, but Chagossians would still be prevented from returning. The UK government defends the deal as necessary for national security, while representatives of the Chagossian community express outrage and a sense of exclusion from the negotiations.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is considering reusing soil removed from areas around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant at the prime minister's office and other government facilities in Tokyo. This move aims to set a precedent for soil recycling outside Fukushima Prefecture, following local opposition to demonstration projects in Tokyo. The soil, deemed safe by the Environment Ministry, would be used for flowerbeds and other purposes. The initiative is part of Japan's broader effort to reduce the total amount of contaminated soil requiring disposal after the 2011 nuclear disaster.</p>

          <p>A global bond sell-off is accelerating due to fiscal concerns heightened by Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating and President Trump's tax bill. Investors are repricing long-end risk, with the U.S. 30-year Treasury yield breaking above 5%. The sell-off follows an exodus from American assets in April, reflecting declining confidence in U.S. assets. Unlike previous sell-offs where investors sought refuge in Japanese and German bonds, this time investors are exiting bonds across major markets.</p>

          <p>President Trump confronted South African President Cyril Ramaphosa with claims of white farmers being killed and "persecuted" during a White House meeting. Trump presented a video featuring opposition chants and images he claimed were burial sites of white farmers, prompting Ramaphosa to defend his government's policies. The meeting, intended to improve trade relations, took an unexpected turn as Trump pressed Ramaphosa on the issue of white "genocide" in South Africa, claims that have been widely discredited. The event has sparked controversy and criticism, with some describing it as an attempt to humiliate the South African president.</p>

          <p>Brazilian police investigating a Russian spy ring have uncovered a puzzling detail: seemingly authentic birth certificates used by deep-cover operatives. Forensic analysis suggests the documents are not forgeries, leading investigators to consider a Cold War-era plot. The theory is that K.G.B. operatives may have filed birth certificates for fictitious newborns, anticipating future spies would claim them. This would represent an extraordinary level of long-term planning, though some intelligence experts remain skeptical.</p>

          <p>Kim Jong Un expressed outrage after witnessing the failed launch of North Korea's newest warship, vowing to punish those responsible. The incident involved a malfunction causing the destroyer's stern to slide prematurely into the water, damaging the hull. Kim blamed the failure on carelessness and irresponsibility, ordering the vessel's restoration by late June, though analysts deem this unrealistic. The launch failure represents a setback for North Korea's naval modernization efforts, raising questions about the country's shipbuilding capabilities.</p>

He contrasts this with Souter, who valued his life beyond the court and understood the importance of allowing the next generation to take its turn.

The program that would give each newborn a special savings account pre-loaded with $1,000 was initially called “money account for growth and advancement,” aka MAGA, Trump’s longtime slogan. But this week, Republicans changed it to the “Trump Account” as they tried to push their “big beautiful bill” through the House.
