          <h2>Parenting Expert Recommends Teaching Children Self-Connection as a Crucial Life Skill</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 18:05:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A child psychology expert, drawing from studies of over 200 parent-child relationships, argues that self-connection is the most vital skill for a child's success. This skill, which involves understanding one's own emotions and needs, fosters emotional resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence. The article suggests practical parenting shifts, such as validating feelings instead of dismissing them and allowing children age-appropriate autonomy to build their inner voice. These small changes can help prevent anxiety and insecurity in adulthood by reinforcing a child's sense of self-worth.</p>

          <p>In an exclusive interview, Sean Stein, president of the US-China Business Council, outlines the precarious position of American businesses operating in China. He suggests that the current 90-day pause on new tariffs is likely to be extended, as a return to high tariffs is undesirable for both nations. Stein notes that while China has taken steps to restrict fentanyl precursors, the US has yet to reciprocate by lowering related tariffs, a move that could help normalize trade relations. The business community remains concerned that diplomatic discussions are overly focused on tariffs, neglecting other critical economic issues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Legal Expert Explains Next Steps for Guantanamo 9/11 Cases Following Canceled Plea Deals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 17:57:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent cancellation of plea deals for the defendants in the 9/11 military tribunals at Guantanamo Bay has created significant legal uncertainty. Georgetown University Law professor Stephen Vladeck explains the current status of these high-profile cases. The collapse of the proposed agreements, which would have averted death penalty trials in exchange for life sentences, sends the legal process back to a more contentious and prolonged phase. This development reopens complex questions about military commissions and the long-delayed pursuit of justice for the victims of the attacks.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died in a tragic accident at a medical facility on Long Island, New York, after being pulled into a running MRI machine. The man was reportedly wearing a heavy, 20-pound metallic chain used for weight training when he entered the imaging room. The powerful magnetic force of the machine drew him in, resulting in a fatal medical episode. This incident highlights the critical safety protocols required around MRI machines, which can turn any magnetic metal object into a dangerous projectile.</p>

The new watchdog will have legal powers to protect customers in disputes with water companies, bringing the sector in line with other utilities.</p>

The piece highlights that while Chinese media focused on the benefits of the visit, Australian media and opposition figures were more critical. The author contends that by threatening to force the sale of the Chinese-leased Port of Darwin, Albanese is undermining his own message that Australia is a reliable place for Chinese investment.

          <p>President Trump has threatened to block a deal for the Washington Commanders to build a new stadium in Washington, D.C., unless the team reverts to its former name, the Redskins. In a series of statements, Trump urged the NFL team to change its name back, claiming there is significant public demand for the original name. The Commanders are hoping to build a new stadium on the federally-owned site of the old RFK Stadium, a complex deal that requires governmental cooperation. Trump also called for the Cleveland Guardians baseball team to return to their former name, the Indians.</p>

          <p>Officials in Texas have significantly reduced the number of people listed as missing following the devastating floods on July 4, from 160 down to just three. The flash floods, which killed 135 people, prompted a massive search and rescue operation in and around Kerrville. The city manager reported that countless hours of investigative work by thousands of federal, state, and local officials led to the verification that most of the missing were safe. Efforts are now focused on reuniting these individuals with their families while continuing to support those still awaiting news.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy described his week at the Open Championship as having 'everything I wanted... apart from a Claret Jug,' after finishing tied for seventh at his home course of Royal Portrush. Unlike his isolated approach in 2019, McIlroy embraced the home crowd's adulation, an experience he found deeply emotional. He acknowledged that his play was inconsistent and that eventual winner Scottie Scheffler was simply better than the rest of the field. McIlroy said he felt immense gratitude and pride to represent his home country and hopes to have future opportunities to compete for the title at Portrush.</p>

          <p>In a recent podcast appearance, author Michael Wolff discussed his observations from his time in the Trump White House while writing his book 'Fire and Fury.' Wolff noted that many of President Trump's female staffers seemed to fit a specific physical mold, which he described as having long hair, skirts above the knee, and high boots. He further commented that these staffers, past and present, bore a resemblance to Melania Trump. Wolff pointed to individuals such as Hope Hicks and Alina Habba as examples of this perceived pattern among the women working in Trump's inner circle.</p>

He indicated that smaller nations in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Africa would likely face a baseline tariff of 10%, while larger economies would either open their markets or pay a higher rate.
