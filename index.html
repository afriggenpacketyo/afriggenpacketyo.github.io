          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-01 11:11:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A clinical trial has demonstrated that a new blood test can detect drug-defying breast cancers at an early stage. The study found that women were able to switch drugs without needing to wait for traditional scans that show cancer progression, ultimately improving their quality of life. This early detection allows for more timely adjustments in treatment plans, potentially leading to better outcomes for patients with aggressive forms of breast cancer. The ability to make quicker treatment decisions based on blood test results can reduce unnecessary exposure to ineffective drugs and minimize the time spent on treatments that are not working. The study highlights the potential of blood tests to revolutionize cancer treatment monitoring and improve patient care.</p>

The floods, described as the worst in the area in 60 years, swept through towns after torrential rain, leading to widespread destruction. Rescue efforts have ceased as authorities believe no one could still be alive, and efforts are now focused on preventing disease outbreaks. The National Emergency Management Agency has begun distributing relief packages to affected residents, but the floods have also damaged roads and bridges, impacting the local economy.</p>

          <p>Ukraine claims a drone attack deep inside Russian territory destroyed 40 military bombers, an operation allegedly supervised by President Zelenskyy and taking over a year and a half to execute. The attack targeted airfields in regions far from Ukraine, marking the first time a Ukrainian drone has been seen in the Irkutsk region. This occurred as Kyiv announced a Russian military strike killed at least 12 soldiers at an army training site, and explosions caused two bridges to collapse and derail two trains in western Russia, resulting in casualties. Zelenskyy announced a delegation would attend face-to-face talks with Russian representatives in Istanbul, prioritizing a ceasefire and the return of prisoners and abducted children.</p>

          <p>An Israeli attack near a food aid distribution center in the Gaza Strip resulted in the deaths of more than 30 Palestinians and wounded scores of others, according to Gaza health officials and witnesses. Witnesses claim Israeli forces fired on crowds awaiting aid, while the Israeli army stated it was unaware of injuries caused by Israeli fire within the aid distribution site and is reviewing the matter. This incident occurred as ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas faltered, with both sides blaming each other for the lack of progress. The U.N. agencies and major aid groups have refused to work with the new system, saying it violates humanitarian principles because it allows Israel to control who receives aid and forces people to relocate to distribution sites, risking yet more mass displacement in the territory.</p>

          <p>Former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is on trial in absentia, accused of crimes against humanity during last year's uprising against her rule. The trial, conducted by the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT), focuses on her government's crackdown on the protest movement. Prosecutors accuse Hasina of directing the violent crackdown and ordering the killing of a student protester, with charges including abetment, incitement, and failure to prevent mass murder. Hasina claims the charges are politically motivated, and her party has been banned pending the trial's outcome.</p>

Despite the penny's inefficiency and the fact that it costs more to produce than it is worth, Salie argues that it holds a unique place in American culture. She notes the penny's connection to Lady Liberty and President Lincoln, as well as its role in idioms like "a penny for your thoughts." Salie suggests that the penny's disappearance will represent the loss of a tangible piece of history in an increasingly virtual world.</p>

Philippine Secretary of National Defence Gilberto Teodoro Jnr asserted that the Philippines, a U.S. treaty ally, is not merely a pawn without strategic agency. Despite concerns over China's pursuit of superpower status, ASEAN nations seek to diversify trade ties and maintain their own strategic interests, rather than being fully aligned with either great power.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's moves to restrict Chinese students' access to U.S. education are causing uncertainty among families in China, leading many to reconsider their children's academic futures.

A recent announcement that the U.S. would revoke visas for Chinese students with ties to the Communist Party or those studying in “critical fields” has further fueled these concerns.

The expert emphasizes that trust is built through small, consistent actions and open communication, creating a safe space for children to share their thoughts and emotions.
