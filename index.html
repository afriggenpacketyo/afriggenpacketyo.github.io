          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has charged two Chinese nationals in California for illegally shipping millions of dollars worth of advanced AI chips to China. The individuals allegedly used their company, ALX Solutions, to export controlled technology, including Nvidia's H100 GPUs, without the necessary licenses. They reportedly concealed the shipments by routing them through Malaysia and Singapore. This case highlights the growing U.S. effort to restrict China's access to sensitive semiconductor technology and the methods used to circumvent these export controls.</p>

Currently the largest fire in the state this year, it is only 9% contained and threatens over 800 structures, forcing evacuations in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. At least three people have been injured, and over 1,900 personnel are battling the blaze. Officials warn that a warming and drying trend expected later in the week could intensify fire behavior.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced the termination of approximately $500 million in federal funding for 22 mRNA vaccine development projects. The canceled projects, mostly for COVID-19 and flu vaccines, involved companies like Pfizer and Moderna. Kennedy stated that HHS determined mRNA technology poses more risks than benefits for respiratory viruses, a move that has drawn sharp criticism from leading infectious disease experts. Critics argue the decision is not based on scientific evidence and will leave the nation more vulnerable to future pandemics.</p>

          <p>Lebanon's government has directed its army to create a plan to ensure only state institutions possess weapons by the end of the year, effectively aiming to disarm the militant group Hezbollah. This decision follows a November 2024 ceasefire agreement and significant pressure from the United States. The plan is to be presented to the Cabinet by the end of August for approval. However, a Hezbollah leader has already stated the group will not disarm while facing ongoing Israeli attacks, creating a significant obstacle to implementation.</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced second-quarter financial results that surpassed revenue expectations but fell short on earnings per share, causing its stock to decline in extended trading. The company's data center segment, which includes its AI chips, saw a 14% revenue increase, though sales to China were impacted by U.S. export controls. CEO Lisa Su expressed confidence in the competitiveness of AMD's new AI chips against rivals like Nvidia and noted strong growth in the client and gaming segment. For the upcoming quarter, AMD projects sales of $8.7 billion, which is above analyst forecasts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has filed a lawsuit with the state's Supreme Court seeking to oust Democratic legislator Gene Wu, whom he labels the "ringleader" of a walkout. Over 50 Democratic lawmakers fled Texas to prevent a quorum, thereby blocking a vote on a Republican-led plan to redraw congressional maps. Abbott argues their absence constitutes an abandonment of office, justifying their removal. In response, Wu stated that denying a quorum is a fulfillment of his constitutional duty to oppose a plan he considers harmful to democracy.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from reallocating over $4 billion in FEMA funds intended for natural disaster mitigation. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from 20 states, which argued that the administration unlawfully terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The judge stated that the reallocation could cause "irreparable harm" to flood-prone areas and that he was unconvinced Congress intended for the funds to be repurposed. The administration had previously called the program "wasteful."</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has decided not to pursue the death penalty against three high-profile accused Mexican drug cartel leaders, including Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada and Rafael Caro Quintero. Caro Quintero is accused of orchestrating the 1985 murder of a DEA agent. The decision is notable given President Trump's calls for capital punishment for drug traffickers. Since Mexico has abolished the death penalty, it typically extradites citizens only on the condition that they will not be executed, a factor that may have influenced the decision.</p>

          <p>New Jersey has reached a historic $2 billion settlement with chemical producers DuPont, Chemours, and Corteva over pollution from "forever chemicals" (PFAS) and other contaminants. The deal, the largest single-state environmental settlement in U.S. history, resolves claims tied to four industrial sites. The companies will pay $875 million in damages and fund over $1.2 billion for cleanup efforts. The settlement addresses decades of pollution from the toxic chemicals, which do not break down easily and are linked to serious health problems.</p>

          <p>A large wildfire is raging in the Corbieres hills of southwestern France, having burned over 11,000 hectares and injured at least nine people, one critically. The fire has forced the partial evacuation of villages and campgrounds in the Aude department. Authorities have closed a section of the A9 motorway, a major route connecting France and Spain, due to the blaze. Over 1,200 firefighters are battling the flames, but officials state that unfavorable weather conditions, including strong winds and dry terrain, are causing the fire to spread very quickly.</p>

          <p>A BBC Verify analysis has found that Russia has more than doubled its missile and drone attacks on Ukraine since President Trump took office in January, despite his calls for a ceasefire. The data, based on Ukrainian Air Force reports, shows a sharp increase in munitions launched compared to the final six months of the previous administration. This escalation has occurred alongside two temporary pauses in U.S. military aid to Ukraine and a significant ramp-up in Russian drone and missile production. Critics suggest the administration's actions may have emboldened Moscow.</p>

          <p>New research from Rwanda suggests that social relationships between female mountain gorillas are more significant than previously believed. A 20-year study revealed that when a female gorilla moves to a new social group, she will intentionally seek out and join other females she already knows, even if they have been apart for years. This behavior highlights the importance of these same-sex bonds, which can provide crucial social benefits and protection for new arrivals in a group's hierarchy. The findings offer new insights into the evolutionary roots of social movement and relationships.</p>

          <p>Despite significant technological advances, a notable portion of the public remains skeptical about the accuracy of weather forecasts. Meteorologists explain that challenges like "Chaos Theory," where tiny initial errors can lead to vastly different outcomes, make perfect prediction difficult, especially for small geographic areas. The communication of complex data into a simple forecast also creates perceived inaccuracies. The future of forecasting lies in AI, which can process historical data rapidly, and in providing "impact-based" forecasts that explain what the weather will mean for people's daily lives.</p>

Zara, which has since removed the images, stated that both models had medical certificates confirming they were in good health.

Unlike Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland where such support is standard, a study found only about one-fifth of English councils offer similar aid, creating a "postcode lottery." With uniform costs averaging over £340, many families struggle with the expense, turning to uniform banks for help. The charity argues that a consistent, national approach is needed to ensure no child is disadvantaged.</p>
