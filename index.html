          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has strongly criticized UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, along with the leaders of France and Canada, accusing them of siding with Hamas and being on the "wrong side of humanity". This rebuke follows condemnation from the UK, France, and Canada regarding Israel's expanded offensive in Gaza, which they deemed "disproportionate". Netanyahu's remarks also come in the wake of a deadly attack on Israeli embassy staff in Washington, with the suspect reportedly shouting "free Palestine" during the arrest. The UK armed forces minister defended the UK's position, emphasizing Israel's right to self-defense within international law and the need for aid to reach suffering Gazans. </p>

          <p>Harvard University sued the Trump administration following the Department of Homeland Security's decision to block the university from enrolling international students, a move seen as retaliation for Harvard's exercise of its First Amendment rights. The lawsuit accuses the administration of a ‚Äúcampaign of retribution‚Äù and claims the decision would erase a quarter of Harvard's student body. Harvard President Alan Garber condemned the action as unlawful and unwarranted, emphasizing the destabilizing impact on the university's existence and the futures of thousands of students and scholars. The suit also claims that the administration failed to explain why Harvard's response to a previous request for information was deemed insufficient. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to impose a 50% tariff on goods imported from the European Union, citing stalled trade talks and long-standing trade deficits. Additionally, Trump warned Apple that a 25% tariff would be applied to iPhones not manufactured in the United States. These announcements mark an escalation of trade tensions, with Trump aiming to boost U.S. manufacturing and protect domestic jobs. The prospect of higher tariffs has rattled world leaders and negatively impacted stock markets, raising concerns about the increased cost and difficulty for businesses to sell goods in the U.S. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Five years after George Floyd‚Äôs murder sparked nationwide protests, this New York Times article examines the limited impact of policing reforms across the United States. Despite states and cities enacting policies such as banning chokeholds and mandating body cameras, killings by police officers have actually increased, rising from just over 1,000 in 2019 to around 1,200 in 2024. The article notes that federal investigations and consent decrees have waned under the Trump administration, and that public sentiment has shifted toward prioritizing crime reduction over reform. Experts suggest that deeper systemic issues, including racial disparities and economic inequalities, contribute to the problem, requiring more comprehensive solutions than mere policy adjustments. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The New York Times editorial board critiques Republican efforts to undermine Obamacare by restricting Medicaid access through work requirements, a move projected to deprive 7.7 million Americans of health insurance by 2034. The editorial argues that health care should be universally accessible and that work requirements have historically proven ineffective, primarily creating bureaucratic hurdles rather than increasing employment. Citing examples like Arkansas' failed work requirement program, the board emphasizes that such measures often strip eligible individuals of coverage due to paperwork issues, with little impact on workforce participation. The editorial advocates for policies that make health insurance more affordable and widely available to boost labor force participation. </p>

          <p>China is strongly protesting the new US restrictions on Chinese-made microchips, reflecting Beijing's determination to resist further concessions in its technology and trade disputes with Washington. The US recently announced a global ban on advanced AI-powered chips made by Chinese companies, prompting China to threaten punishment for those enforcing the ban. This firm response indicates China's growing confidence in challenging Washington on trade and technology, aiming to pressure the US to reconsider the chip rules. Analysts suggest that Beijing's reaction is partly due to the timing of the ban during a 90-day trade truce. </p>

          <p>An international study refutes the theory that COVID-19 originated from a lab leak in Wuhan, China, instead tracing the virus to bat populations in northern Laos and southwest China's Yunnan province. Researchers analyzed 167 bat coronavirus genomes, concluding that the virus's most recent ancestor circulated five to seven years before the pandemic. These findings contradict claims by the White House, which has asserted a Chinese lab leak as the "real source" of the pandemic. The study examined sarbecoviruses, including those responsible for SARS and COVID-19, and found that the original SARS-CoV-1 circulated in western China shortly before the 2002-2004 outbreak. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study reveals that clownfish are shrinking in response to severe heat waves, potentially as an adaptation to survive hotter ocean temperatures. Scientists in Papua New Guinea measured clownfish during a heat wave in 2023 and found that individual fish shrank over mere weeks, with those that shrank having a higher chance of survival. While the exact mechanism of shrinking is unknown, researchers believe it may help clownfish meet their energy requirements in a hot climate. The study adds complexity to the narrative of ocean degradation, indicating a rapid adaptation to climate change in clownfish. </p>

          <p>Charles Leclerc topped the timesheets in the first practice session at the Monaco Grand Prix, despite expressing concerns about his Ferrari's performance. Leclerc, the reigning Monaco champion, complained about the car's behavior but still managed to outpace Max Verstappen by 0.163 seconds. The session was marked by an incident where Leclerc collided with Lance Stroll, damaging the Ferrari's front wing and causing Stroll to retire with rear suspension damage. The session was also notable for strong performances from Lando Norris and Alex Albon. </p>

          <p>Ukraine and Russia were set to take part in a major prisoner swap on Friday, described as the biggest since the start of the full-scale Russian invasion in 2022. However, there was no confirmation from either side, and Ukrainian military sources told news agencies only that the process was under way. US President Donald Trump earlier posted his congratulations on his Truth Social platform, claiming that the swap was complete and that "this could lead to something big???". Officials from both countries agreed to exchange 1,000 prisoners of war each, during otherwise fruitless peace negotiations in Istanbul a week ago. </p>

          <p>Ukraine and Russia are reportedly poised to conduct a significant prisoner exchange, potentially the largest since the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion in 2022. Unconfirmed reports suggest that the exchange, involving 1,000 prisoners from each side, could span three days along the Ukrainian-Belarusian border. The agreement was reached during recent peace negotiations in Istanbul, although the talks yielded no progress toward a ceasefire. Despite the lack of official confirmation, the potential swap offers a glimmer of hope amid the ongoing conflict. </p>

This could result in AI systems pursuing their own unfathomable aims, potentially leading to catastrophic outcomes.
