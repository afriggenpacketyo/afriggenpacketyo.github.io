          <p>The UK government has disclosed a secret scheme that relocated 4,500 Afghans to the UK following a significant data breach in February 2022. This breach, which exposed details of nearly 19,000 applicants, came to light when some information appeared on Facebook in August 2023. A super-injunction had previously prevented public disclosure, leading to a "scrutiny vacuum" according to a High Court judge. The scheme, costing £400 million so far, aims to address risks posed to those whose information was compromised.</p>

          <p>Several U.S. states, including Arkansas, are considering legislation to ban or make optional the addition of fluoride to public drinking water. This practice, ongoing since the 1940s and lauded by the CDC as a public health achievement, is now facing renewed scrutiny. Opponents cite a 2024 NIH report linking high fluoride levels to lower IQs in children, though this was based on levels twice the recommended limit. Dental associations maintain that fluoride is safe and effective in preventing tooth decay.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a new tariff deal with Indonesia, stating that the U.S. will lower its threatened tariffs on Indonesian goods to 19%. In exchange, Trump claims American firms will receive "full access" to the Indonesian market. As part of the agreement, Indonesia has also reportedly committed to purchasing $15 billion in U.S. energy, $4.5 billion in agricultural products, and 50 Boeing jets. However, Indonesian officials have not yet confirmed the terms, and the reported figures are lower than those previously anticipated in a trade deal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korea has commenced a retrial for Kim Jae-gyu, the former spy chief who assassinated President Park Chung-hee in 1979. Kim was executed for insurrection, but his family is now fighting to clear his name, arguing he was a patriot who aimed to usher in democracy. The court agreed to the retrial based on new evidence of torture during his original proceedings. This case reopens a deeply polarizing chapter in South Korean history, prompting a re-evaluation of both Kim's motives and Park's authoritarian legacy, especially in light of recent democratic challenges.</p>

          <p>President Trump has accused Senator Adam Schiff of mortgage fraud, alleging that Schiff misled lenders about his primary residence to secure a cheaper mortgage. Trump cited a Fannie Mae investigation, though a memo from investigators did not use the word "fraud." Schiff vehemently denied the claims, dismissing them as a "baseless attempt at political retribution" and a distraction from the ongoing controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein files. This accusation marks the latest in a series of personal attacks between the two political adversaries.</p>

Bondi previously stated such a list was on her desk, but later clarified she meant a "file."
