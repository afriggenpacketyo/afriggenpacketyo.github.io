          <p>News of a U.S. agreement with China to temporarily reduce tariffs for 90 days sent stocks soaring. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average saw significant gains, providing relief to tech companies at risk of retaliatory Chinese tariffs. Starting May 14, both countries will lower tariffs, with the U.S. tariff on Chinese imports dropping to 30% and China's rate on American goods down to 10%. Investors remain cautiously optimistic, focusing on whether this temporary fix can become a lasting agreement, as tech, retail, and travel companies saw widespread gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced that a new software update prevented a third radar outage at Newark airport following a telecommunications line failure. The update ensured the backup system worked when the primary line failed, averting potential disruptions. Duffy criticized the Biden administration for not adequately equipping the air traffic control facility in Philadelphia, where Newark air traffic controllers were moved last year. He also outlined plans to replace the nation's outdated air traffic control system, including installing new high-speed data connections and replacing radars.</p>

          <p>This article discusses Attorney General Pam Bondi's approach to her role, characterized by a willingness to execute White House directives and prioritize President Trump's agenda. It highlights her focus on pleasing the MAGA base, such as with the release of the "Epstein Files," and her close coordination with the West Wing. Critics argue that Bondi's actions represent a departure from previous Justice Department heads who valued institutional independence. The article suggests her role is more of a surrogate, ceding authority to other empowered players within the administration.</p>

          <p>Jon Voight and Sylvester Stallone joined labor unions and major studios in a letter to President Trump, requesting expanded tax incentives for film and television productions. The letter thanked Trump for supporting the industry and emphasized the need to increase domestic film and television production to bring back American jobs. The coalition seeks to revive section 199 of the tax code, expand section 181, and restore the section 461 ability to carry back net operating losses. This comes after Trump's tariff proposal on foreign film production sparked confusion in the entertainment industry.</p>

          <p>A survey by the China General Chamber of Commerce – USA revealed that half of Chinese companies operating in the United States plan to shift emphasis away from investments due to Trump administration tariff policies. While a recent agreement temporarily lowered tariffs, the survey indicated that many companies intend to reduce their U.S. investments, with some planning to suspend or withdraw most investments. The survey included companies across various sectors, with financial companies taking the largest share.

This delay is the latest in a series of setbacks for Newark, including recent radar outages. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy blamed the Biden administration for "bungling" the move of air traffic controllers from New York to Philadelphia, and announced plans to reduce the number of flights at the airport to mitigate delays.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's decision to impose and then reduce tariffs on Chinese products, highlighting both the power and limitations of U.S. trade policy. The tariffs disrupted global trade but did not appear to result in major concessions from Beijing beyond a commitment to further talks. The agreement to reduce tariffs was seen by some as a retreat, raising questions about whether the trade disruptions were worthwhile. While the decision provides a reprieve for businesses, it also underscores the uncertainty weighing on U.S. firms.</p>

          <p>Many millennials and Gen Zers are struggling to achieve financial security, even with growing net worths on paper. Experts say that young people today are living in two separate economies, with the middle class becoming increasingly unattainable for them. Rising costs for housing, healthcare, and insurance, coupled with increased responsibility for retirement funding, contribute to the problem. Structural issues, rather than lifestyle choices, are largely to blame, making it harder for young people to save for traditional markers of success.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of major toy makers rallied after the U.S. and China agreed to temporarily reduce tariffs. The agreement will pause most tariffs and other trade barriers for 90 days, including reducing the 145% levy President Trump had in place on Chinese imports to 30%. Companies like Mattel, Hasbro, Jakks, and Funko saw significant gains, though most are still trading below their April 1 closing prices. The toy industry is heavily reliant on supply chains in China, making toy makers vulnerable to trade policy changes.</p>

          <p>Several major UK Pride organizations have suspended the involvement of political parties in their events to show solidarity with the transgender community. This decision follows a Supreme Court ruling that clarified existing equality laws, defining the term "woman" in the Equality Act as referring solely to biological women. The Pride groups are calling for full protections under the Equality Act, access to NHS gender-affirming healthcare, reform of the gender recognition certificate process, and sustainable funding for trans-led services. Some lesbian groups welcomed the Supreme Court ruling, while LGBT+ Lib Dems criticized the blanket suspension.</p>
