          <p>This article examines the state of the Black Lives Matter movement five years after George Floyd's murder, noting a significant backlash and a shift in racial discourse. The movement's momentum has slowed, with initiatives rolled back and a rise in what the article terms 'white grievance' politics. While some lasting impacts of the movement remain, such as police body cameras and enhanced data collection on police brutality, the article suggests that the resurgence of old power structures is intentional. Despite challenges, the article acknowledges the enduring influence of Black activism on American democracy.</p>
