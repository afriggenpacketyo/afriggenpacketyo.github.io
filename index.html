          <p>A shooting incident at the Mango nightclub in Birmingham has left four people wounded, with one man reported to be in critical condition. West Midlands Police responded to the scene early in the morning and have since arrested three individuals in their 20s and 30s on suspicion of violent disorder. Authorities have cordoned off Bristol Street, a major route into the city, and are appealing to the public for any information, including dashcam or mobile phone footage from witnesses inside or near the venue.</p>

          <p>The U.S. President has issued an executive order introducing a substantial $100,000 annual fee for companies applying for H-1B visas on behalf of skilled foreign workers. This new policy, intended to curb perceived abuse of the program, has drawn criticism from immigration lawyers and business groups who argue it will stifle American competitiveness and price out small businesses. Supporters believe it will encourage the hiring of American workers, though the move has created uncertainty for current visa holders and companies like Amazon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German cities, including Berlin and Cologne, are preparing for large-scale demonstrations this weekend, with conflicting protests scheduled regarding the country's abortion laws. The "March for Life," organized by anti-abortion groups and supported by some Catholic bishops, is expected to draw thousands, while counter-protests advocating for liberalized laws are also planned. Simultaneously, climate activists from "Fridays for Future" are organizing rallies in 70 cities to protest government energy policies they deem insufficient to combat climate change.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has exposed a deep societal divide in understanding the event, a gap largely amplified by social media. While initial videos of the shooting spread rapidly, the context and motive became battlegrounds for competing political narratives, with influencers on both the right and left offering conflicting theories. This fragmentation is exacerbated by platform algorithms that reward rapid, extreme takes over nuanced information, leading to separate realities for different online communities even as official charging documents provide a more complex picture of the killer's motivations.</p>

          <p>American water treatment facilities are facing a growing number of severe cyberattacks from foreign entities, including recent incidents linked to Iranian and Russian hackers. These attacks have disrupted operations in states like Pennsylvania and Texas, raising concerns about the vulnerability of the nation's critical infrastructure. In response, a new initiative called Project Franklin is pairing cybersecurity experts from the DEF CON community with operators of small, under-resourced water systems to help them implement basic security measures and defend against sophisticated digital threats.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Neuroscientist Tom Bellamy's new book, "Smitten," delves into the concept of "limerence," a term for romantic obsession characterized by intense emotional highs and lows. Bellamy explains that while this infatuation is a natural part of early love, it can become a form of addiction if a healthy bond doesn't form, leading to anxiety and craving. The article outlines strategies from the book for breaking free from unhealthy limerence, such as limiting contact with the person and reframing daydreams to focus on negative outcomes or memories to diminish the perceived reward.</p>

          <p>Female artists in Turkey are facing increasing legal pressure from the government, with the new girl band Manifest being the latest target of an investigation for "indecent and immoral acts." This follows a pattern of actions against other prominent female musicians and screenwriters, often initiated by pro-government media and social media campaigns.

The party now faces the challenge of converting its increased parliamentary presence into sustained political relevance by expanding its policy platform beyond key campaign issues and defining a clear message for voters.</p>

Some studies suggest frequent AI users report higher burnout rates, as the time saved is often filled with more work, and the continuous mental engagement with AI tools can be exhausting.

          <p>Many individuals who have achieved significant and rapid weight loss using injections like Wegovy and Mounjaro are now facing the challenge of dealing with excess, loose skin. This unintended consequence has dented the self-confidence of some, who feel their appearance does not match their improved health. Plastic surgeons explain that surgery is the only effective option for removal, but these body contouring procedures are rarely covered by the NHS and can be prohibitively expensive, forcing patients to save for years, take out loans, or consider cheaper but potentially riskier surgery abroad.</p>

          <h2>Parents Increasingly Opting Out of School WhatsApp Groups</h2>

          <p>As a new school year begins, some parents are choosing to leave school-related WhatsApp groups due to the high volume of messages, competitive parenting, and unnecessary anxiety they can generate. While the groups can be useful for reminders and organizing, they often become forums for polarized opinions and can place the burden of school communication disproportionately on one parent. Experts advise setting personal boundaries for engagement, as these informal communication channels can sometimes create more stress and background noise than they alleviate for families.</p>

          <p>Early in-person voting has commenced in Virginia's closely watched gubernatorial election, a contest between Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears and former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger. The race is being viewed as a key referendum on the Trump administration's policies, particularly federal workforce cuts that have significantly impacted the state's large number of government employees. Spanberger is campaigning against these policies, while Earle-Sears is aligning herself with the economic record of the state's popular term-limited Republican governor. (not investment advice)</p>
