        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump, alongside Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, toured a new, controversial migrant detention center in the Everglades, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz." The facility, rapidly constructed at a remote airport, is intended to house thousands of individuals for processing and deportation, a move officials hope will encourage "self-deportation." Critics, including environmental groups and a Democratic gubernatorial candidate, have condemned the site as a "callous political stunt" and filed lawsuits to block its operation pending environmental review. The isolated location is being touted by proponents for its natural security features, including surrounding treacherous terrain and wildlife.</p>

          <p>Kouri Richins, a Utah mother who wrote a children's book on grief after her husband's death, is now facing 26 new charges, including mortgage fraud, money laundering, and forgery. Prosecutors allege she began stealing from her husband, Eric Richins, in 2019 and used fraudulent documents for real estate dealings. The new charges add to the existing accusation that she murdered him in March 2022 with a fentanyl-laced cocktail. The documents claim this was part of a broader pattern of unlawful activity that also included defrauding a friend and falsely claiming insurance benefits.</p>

          <p>An NYU Stern School of Business professor suggests that job seekers can cut through corporate platitudes by asking one specific question during an interview: "What kind of person should not work at this company?" This question often elicits honest, unrehearsed answers that reveal a company's true values regarding work-life balance, collaboration, and workplace environment. The article advises asking this question near the end of the interview process, after an offer is made, to avoid defensiveness. The goal is to help individuals find a job that aligns with their personal values, which many people struggle to articulate clearly.</p>

          <p>With many high-interest certificates of deposit (CDs) opened in 2023 and 2024 now maturing, savers face a changed economic landscape with lower available rates. This article advises accountholders to act strategically to continue maximizing their returns in a climate of anticipated interest rate cuts. Key recommendations include preventing automatic rollovers into lower-yield accounts, actively shopping for the best available rates, particularly at online banks, and considering long-term CDs to lock in current rates for several years. This proactive approach can help savers navigate the shifting interest rate environment effectively. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Yale Budget Lab analysis concludes that the Republican "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" would financially harm the lowest-earning American households while benefiting the wealthiest. The report projects that the bottom 20% of households would see an average annual income reduction of 2.9%, primarily due to sharp cuts in Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Conversely, the top 20% would experience an average income increase of 2.2%, driven by the extension of 2017 tax cuts. This analysis aligns with other nonpartisan findings that the bill's net effects are regressive. (not investment advice)</p>

The bill now returns to the House, where its passage is uncertain due to a razor-thin GOP majority and objections to the Senate's amendments.

Even after the investigation cleared her of any misconduct, the family alleges Northwestern refused to restore her lab and funding, effectively blocking her from rebuilding her career.

Beyond logistical issues, there is a growing safety concern over GPS jamming and spoofing near conflict zones, which can interfere with aircraft navigation systems.

          <p>This article investigates and finds no evidence for a viral online claim that bodies found on the shores of Spain's Balearic Islands belong to migrants deported from the United States. The claim connected images of shackled individuals on a US deportation flight in January 2025 with separate reports from June about bound bodies washing ashore in Spain. Spanish authorities are investigating the deaths, which they suspect are linked to human smuggling from North Africa, a common and dangerous migration route. There is no evidence of US deportation flights to Spain, and a White House spokesperson called the claim "obviously false."</p>

          <p>An Afghan man named Sayed Naser, who worked as an interpreter for the U.S. military, was detained by ICE agents immediately after a mandatory immigration hearing in San Diego. Naser, who entered the U.S. legally on parole and has a pending Special Immigrant Visa application, was placed in expedited removal proceedings. Advocacy groups have condemned the action, stating Naser followed all legal processes and faces certain death if returned to Afghanistan. This case highlights a reported increase in courthouse arrests by ICE and occurs amid policy shifts terminating protections for many Afghans who aided the U.S.</p>

          <p>In an effort to attract foreign investment amid widespread international sanctions, Russia has created a new type of investment account that guarantees the ability to withdraw funds. A decree signed by President Vladimir Putin establishes "In" accounts where foreigners can invest in various assets. This move follows the freezing of billions in Western assets in special "type-C" accounts after the invasion of Ukraine. The finance ministry has indicated that these new, more lenient rules on capital controls are intended to be available to investors from all countries, not just those Russia deems "friendly."

          <p>A recent study published in Frontiers in Psychology suggests a possible connection between diet and dream quality, with some participants reporting that dairy products led to worse sleep and nightmares. The research, based on surveys of over 1,000 college students, found that 22% of those who felt food affected their dreams attributed nightmares to dairy. The study's authors theorize this could be linked to gastrointestinal distress from lactose intolerance disrupting sleep. While acknowledging potential biases, the findings support the notion that food-induced physical symptoms during sleep can negatively impact the dreaming experience.</p>

          <p>According to the mortgage lender Nationwide, UK house prices fell by 0.8% in June, marking the most significant single-month decline since February 2023. This drop may be a reflection of weaker demand following recent changes to stamp duty tax thresholds, which made property purchases more expensive for many. Despite the monthly fall, the annual growth rate stood at 2.1%, though this is the slowest pace in nearly a year. Economists suggest this market softness is likely temporary, expecting activity to rebound due to supportive factors like low unemployment and potential future interest rate cuts.

One primary option is hospital charity care, as federal law requires nonprofit hospitals to offer free or discounted care to patients who meet certain income criteria based on federal poverty levels. For those who don't qualify, debt settlement with a debt relief company can reduce balances, though it may impact credit. As a final resort, filing for Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy can eliminate or reorganize overwhelming medical and other unsecured debts.</p>
