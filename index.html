          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 00:00:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in Nature Communications reveals that multinational enterprises were responsible for approximately 25% of all corporate carbon emissions in China over a 20-year period. Researchers from institutions in China and the UK highlighted that these foreign-owned firms represent a significant, yet often overlooked, factor in carbon inequality. The study also noted a geographical disparity, with China's eastern coastal regions reaping more economic benefits while the central and western regions shouldered a greater environmental burden, raising new questions about carbon responsibility.</p>

          <p>Cambodia has launched its first direct air shipments of durian to China, establishing a new air corridor for fresh fruit between the two nations. An initial two-tonne shipment arrived in China's Henan province, marking durian as the fifth Cambodian fresh fruit approved for direct import into the Chinese market. This development, part of what some call 'durian diplomacy,' highlights growing agricultural trade and customs efficiency between the countries. However, some industry insiders express caution regarding the commercial competitiveness of Cambodian durians compared to established suppliers.</p>

          <p>In a significant collaboration with the Trump administration, Mexico has extradited 26 prominent cartel members to the United States to face justice. The group includes leaders from powerful organizations like 'Los Cuinis' and figures linked to the Sinaloa Cartel, wanted for crimes including drug trafficking and murder. This action represents a milestone in the U.S. Justice Department's priority to dismantle dangerous drug cartels. The transfer proceeded after the U.S. agreed not to seek the death penalty, marking the second major extradition of cartel figures in recent months.</p>

          <p>This article provides an exhaustive timeline of the Karen Read case, from the death of Boston police officer John O'Keefe in January 2022 through the legal proceedings and public fallout. It details the prosecution's claims that Read hit O'Keefe with her SUV and left him to die, contrasted with the defense's argument of an elaborate cover-up and framing by law enforcement. The timeline covers key evidence, witness testimonies, the first trial ending in a hung jury, the subsequent retrial, and the final verdict where Read was acquitted of the most serious charges.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet in Anchorage, Alaska, to discuss pathways to ending the war in Ukraine. The meeting follows a deadline Trump set for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face increased U.S. sanctions, though no ceasefire was reached. The White House has framed the summit as a 'listening exercise' for the president, while Trump himself called it a 'feel-out meeting.' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is not expected to attend but will reportedly meet virtually with Trump and European leaders beforehand.</p>

Mayor Muriel Bowser has strongly criticized the action as an 'authoritarian push,' while also stating her focus is on utilizing the federal officers to help get illegal guns off the streets.</p>

          <p>Kim Keon Hee, the wife of South Korea's impeached former president Yoon Suk Yeol, has been arrested on multiple charges including stock fraud, bribery, and influence peddling. The 52-year-old former first lady, who has denied the allegations, was taken into custody after extensive questioning, with prosecutors citing fears she might destroy evidence. The charges include receiving luxury items like Chanel bags and a diamond necklace as bribes. Her arrest follows the ouster of her husband, who faces his own trial for attempting to impose martial law.</p>

However, a new study highlights a stark disparity in progress, as survival rates for some of the deadliest cancers, such as pancreatic, oesophageal, and lung cancer, have seen little improvement. For pancreatic cancer, the 10-year survival rate remains below 5%. Experts attribute the overall success to advances in treatment and earlier detection for cancers like breast and melanoma, but warn that the gap between the best and worst survival rates has widened.</p>

          <p>A new Siena Institute poll indicates a significant lead for Democratic socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race, placing him 19 points ahead of former Governor Andrew Cuomo. The poll shows Mamdani with 44% of support among registered NYC voters, followed by Cuomo at 25%, who is running as an independent. Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, also running as an independent, trails with only 7%. Despite Mamdani's lead, prominent centrist Democrats have not yet endorsed him, and the poll suggests he has a negative impression among voters outside the city.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has informed the Smithsonian Institution of its plan to conduct a wide-ranging review of its 19 museums to ensure exhibits are 'patriotic' and align with an executive order to eliminate 'divisive or anti-American ideology.' According to a White House letter, the review aims to ensure content reflects 'unity, progress, and enduring values' ahead of the nation's 250th anniversary in 2026. The move will scrutinize everything from exhibition text to curatorial processes, raising concerns about political influence over the world's largest museum and research complex.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office has announced the expansion of live facial recognition (LFR) technology, rolling out 10 new surveillance vans across seven police forces in England. The technology, which scans faces in public and compares them against wanted lists, is intended to help locate suspects for serious crimes like homicide and sexual offenses. While the government touts the technology's success in making arrests in London, civil liberties groups like Big Brother Watch have condemned the move as an 'alarming' expansion of the surveillance state without a proper legal framework in place.</p>

Offensive coordinator Greg Roman noted that Allen's presence creates flexibility and strengthens the offense. The two receivers participated in their first full 11-on-11 session together, with both expected to be versatile and key components of the offensive scheme.</p>

The issue, which affected about 9,200 households, was caused by a faulty, 57-year-old valve that became stuck in a nearly closed position. After a complex repair process, water flow was restored, and subsequent tests confirmed its safety. The DWP is advising residents to flush their pipes and is offering a $20 credit to affected customers for the inconvenience.</p>

This admission follows a 2022 report commissioned by France, which detailed how French colonial troops used mass displacement and supported brutal militias to suppress the independence movement.

          <p>Health experts are warning of an increased risk of infections from Vibrio vulnificus, a so-called 'flesh-eating' bacteria, as rising ocean temperatures allow it to thrive in new regions. The bacteria, which enters the body through open wounds or consumption of raw seafood, can be deadly, killing one in five infected individuals. Cases are now being reported further north in the U.S., including in the Carolinas, Connecticut, and New York. The danger is particularly heightened during hurricane season, which can spread the warm, coastal waters where the bacteria lives.</p>

          <p>Peach harvests in California's Central Valley are down by as much as 30% this year, a problem attributed to warmer winter weather linked to climate change. Stone fruit trees, including peaches, require a certain number of 'chill hours' below 45 degrees to regulate their growth, but inconsistent cold this past winter disrupted their cycle. This has led to smaller crops and higher prices for consumers across the country. Farmers are facing significant threats to their livelihood, with some growers reporting a total loss of their crop for the season.</p>
