          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 03:14:20 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent review in the UK has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) be retitled as "assistants" to avoid confusing patients. The review also suggests standardized uniforms and badges to clearly distinguish them from doctors, and states they should not be diagnosing patients. This follows tragic incidents, such as the death of Emily Chesterton, who was misdiagnosed by a PA she believed was a doctor, sparking a debate on the roles and responsibilities of these healthcare positions. The British Medical Association, however, believes the recommendations should have been more stringent.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of semiconductor equipment giant ASML fell by 6.5% after the company, despite beating second-quarter earnings expectations, could not confirm growth projections for 2026. The Dutch firm cited increasing uncertainty from macroeconomic and geopolitical developments as the primary reason for its cautious outlook. While AI-related demand remains strong, the company's third-quarter revenue forecast missed analyst expectations, and it narrowed its growth guidance for 2025. This uncertainty reflects broader challenges facing the semiconductor industry, including US tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has modified its stance on transgender workplace discrimination, now allowing some complaints to move forward. Under new guidance, cases involving hiring, firing, or promotion will be processed, a change from a previous policy that halted such claims. However, these cases will face a higher level of scrutiny, requiring final approval from the acting EEOC chair, Andrea Lucas. Critics argue that while this is a minor improvement, it does not fix a legally improper situation at the agency.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a preliminary trade deal with Indonesia that includes a 19% tariff on Indonesian exports to the United States. In exchange, Trump stated the U.S. would gain full market access and that Indonesia committed to purchasing $15 billion in U.S. energy, $4.5 billion in agricultural products, and 50 Boeing jets. While Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto confirmed a positive call with Trump, he did not immediately confirm the specific terms of the deal, which follows a pattern of Trump's recent trade negotiations.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's annual inflation rate unexpectedly climbed to 3.6% in June, surpassing economists' forecasts and increasing pressure on households. The rise was primarily driven by motor fuel and food prices, according to the Office for National Statistics. This development complicates the Bank of England's upcoming interest rate decisions, as it balances fighting stubbornly high inflation with supporting an economy that unexpectedly contracted in May. Despite the inflation data, many economists still predict a rate cut in August to stimulate growth. (not investment advice)</p>

The author argues that Trump was convinced to act not by a moral or strategic imperative, but because European NATO allies effectively demonstrated they would cover the costs, making them a more valuable "client" than Russia. The alliance remains fragile, dependent on Trump's perception of who is paying the bill.</p>

          <p>Nicholas Burns, the former U.S. ambassador to China, stated that he believes Washington and Beijing are on a "creeping path towards some kind of a deal" to resolve their trade disputes. Speaking at the Aspen Security Forum, Burns gave rare praise to the Trump administration's tariff strategy. He argued that despite the tensions, the symbiotic economic relationship and strong self-interest on both sides will ultimately guide them toward reaching a trade agreement.

          <p>A court in South Korea has begun the historic retrial of Kim Jae-gyu, the director of the KCIA who assassinated authoritarian President Park Chung-hee in 1979. Kim was executed for treason, but his family has long fought for a retrial, arguing his actions were not a coup attempt but a patriotic act to prevent a bloodbath and restore democracy. The case forces a re-examination of a pivotal, and still deeply polarizing, moment in the nation's turbulent path to democracy.</p>

          <p>Analysts project that China's imports of naphtha will reach a record high in 2025, driven by the launch of new petrochemical plants and strategic caution regarding U.S. supplies of propane and ethane. Caught in the U.S.-China trade war, Chinese cracker operators are diversifying their feedstock sources, increasing demand for naphtha from varied suppliers. This robust demand from China is expected to provide significant support for Asian refiners' profit margins throughout the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pop Mart, the Chinese toy company behind the viral Labubu dolls, has announced it expects its profits for the first half of the year to soar by at least 350%. The company attributes the massive growth to the global popularity of its characters, which are often sold in "blind boxes," and an increasing share of revenue from overseas markets. The elf-like Labubu dolls have become a sensation, fueled by celebrity endorsements and a thriving resale market where their value can skyrocket.</p>
