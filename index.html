          <p>A 911 call has been released detailing a medical emergency experienced by Gregg Popovich at a San Antonio restaurant last month, prior to his retirement from the Spurs. The caller reported that Popovich had fainted and was initially unresponsive, later updating that he was "barely responding." Popovich, who had been recovering from a stroke earlier in the season, reportedly did not suffer life-threatening injuries and was alert upon entering the ambulance. He retired shortly after this incident, transitioning to president of basketball operations after coaching the Spurs for nearly three decades and leading them to five NBA Championships.</p>

          <p>The UK government is preparing for a contentious Spending Review, with insiders describing the process as "ugly" due to significant budget constraints. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to outline spending plans to 2029, prioritizing health and defence while other departments face potential cuts. Despite overall government spending increasing, day-to-day spending on public services like police and education is expected to be squeezed, leading to tensions among ministers. The review aims to balance fiscal responsibility with the need to deliver on long-term infrastructure projects, but some worry about the impact on essential public services and the Prime Minister's key policy missions.</p>

Trump's approach to the Middle East, including negotiations with Iran and cease-fire agreements in Gaza and Yemen, has diverged from Netanyahu's agenda. While the U.S.-Israel alliance is not in crisis, Trump's willingness to prioritize U.S. goals over Israeli concerns signals a fundamental change in the relationship.

          <p>This article discusses the potential impact of President Trump's proposed tax bill on the clean energy sector in the United States. The bill seeks to terminate key tax credits that have supported the growth of solar and wind power, potentially reversing the progress made under the Inflation Reduction Act. Experts warn that the legislation could lead to significant job losses, increased electricity costs, and a decline in clean energy deployment. While some Republican senators have expressed reservations about the bill, its passage could severely hinder the U.S.'s transition to clean energy.</p>

The bill, described as "the most consequential legislation that any party has ever passed," was made public just hours before the vote, with a pivotal hearing beginning at 1 a.m. Critics argue that the GOP's aggressive approach fits a pattern of exceeding past transgressions, while Republicans justify their actions by pointing to Democrats' previous actions.

European politicians expressed disappointment, with the French trade minister emphasizing the need for de-escalation while remaining ready to respond.

          <p>Chinese scientists have achieved a significant breakthrough in underwater communication, enabling error-free acoustic data transmission across 600km of ocean, the distance between Taipei and Okinawa. The team developed a self-tuning system capable of mapping signal clusters in noisy environments without prior knowledge of seabed topography. This advancement could pave the way for real-world applications in long-range undersea messaging, with potential implications for both civilian and military operations. The feat marks a significant step forward in overcoming the challenges of underwater communication, including signal scattering and ambient noise.</p>
