          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has publicly placed the responsibility for ending the war on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ahead of their meeting. In a social media post, Trump suggested Zelenskyy could end the conflict "almost immediately" and implied that Ukraine should concede on its ambitions for NATO membership and the recovery of Crimea. These comments align with Kremlin demands and set a contentious tone for the upcoming high-stakes peace negotiations in Washington.</p>

          <p>Swiss watchmaker Swatch has apologized and removed a global advertisement after it caused significant backlash among Chinese consumers. The ad featured a model making a "slanted eye" gesture, which is widely considered a racist caricature of Asian people, leading to calls for a boycott on Chinese social media. Despite the apology, many critics remain unsatisfied, highlighting a pattern of Western brands facing censure in China for perceived cultural insensitivity.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the Atlantic season, has regained strength to become a powerful Category 4 storm while churning north of the Caribbean. With maximum sustained winds of 130 mph, the storm is prompting tropical storm warnings for the Turks and Caicos and the southeast Bahamas. While not expected to make direct landfall on the U.S. East Coast, its large size is forecast to generate life-threatening surf and rip currents along the Southeast seaboard.</p>

Topics range from the waning appeal of learning Mandarin in the West to the surprising international success of "ugly-cute" toys like Labubu. These reports suggest that while China is investing heavily in cultural exports and think tanks to shape its international narrative, it also faces challenges from its global image and a perceived need to relax its grip on cultural exchange.</p>

          <p>Zimbabwe is experiencing a dramatic spike in malaria cases and deaths this year, a crisis that experts link to significant cuts in U.S. aid under the Trump administration. The funding withdrawal debilitated a key mosquito surveillance program, leading to a resurgence of the once-contained disease "with a vengeance," according to one health official. Without sufficient resources for preventative measures like mosquito nets, the nation is struggling to control the outbreak, which is exacerbated by climate change creating more favorable breeding conditions for mosquitoes.</p>

          <p>A court-ordered ban on feeding pigeons in public spaces in Mumbai has ignited a conflict between animal lovers, health activists, and civic authorities. The ban was implemented due to health concerns over diseases linked to pigeon droppings, but it has angered protesters, including members of the Jain community who consider feeding birds a pious act. The debate highlights the tension between public health, cultural heritage, and religious practices in the densely populated Indian city, with officials now considering alternatives like controlled feeding times.</p>
