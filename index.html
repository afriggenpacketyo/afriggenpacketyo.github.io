            <p>President Trump's administration is set to impose a 104% tariff rate on China, a move described as "reciprocal" to correct trade imbalances. The president claims the tariffs will prompt negotiations and boost the U.S. economy. However, the announcement has already led to significant losses in the stock market, raising concerns about potential economic fallout. China has vowed to retaliate, setting the stage for a potentially damaging trade war.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration the ability to resume deportations of Venezuelan migrants who are suspected of gang membership under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, while clarifying that those facing removal are entitled to judicial review. The court's decision comes amid rising tensions between the president and the judiciary, with Justice Sotomayor dissenting, arguing that the administration is ignoring the rule of law. The ruling also specifies that detainees must receive notice of their impending removal and have the opportunity to seek habeas relief in the proper venue. Mr. Trump praised the ruling as a victory for border security, while the ACLU expressed disappointment but acknowledged a victory in requiring advance notice for those facing deportation.</p>

            <p>The Alien Enemies Act of 1798, originally intended for wartime, is being used by President Trump to deport Venezuelan migrants suspected of gang affiliation, sparking legal challenges. The Supreme Court has allowed deportations to resume but requires judicial review for those affected. The act, part of the Alien and Sedition Acts, has been invoked three other times in U.S. history, including during World War I and World War II. Critics question the legality of its current application, arguing that a criminal gang does not constitute a 'foreign nation or government' engaging in an 'invasion'.</p>

            <p>U.S. stocks experienced a significant sell-off after the Trump administration announced it would impose a 104% tariff on Chinese goods, reversing earlier gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite all declined sharply due to fears about the economic impact of the tariffs. Economists warn that the tariffs could lead to higher inflation and potentially stall U.S. economic growth, increasing the risk of a recession. Investors are also closely watching upcoming corporate earnings reports and inflation data for further market cues. (not investment advice)</p>

Councilman Paris Gray, the bill's sponsor, emphasizes that access to menstrual products is a matter of public health and personal hygiene, not a luxury. The proposal aims to codify existing practices by Mayor Brandon Scott's administration and positions Baltimore as a leader in menstrual equity.

            <p>President Trump and Speaker Johnson are pushing for the passage of a budget resolution crucial for extending tax cuts, but face opposition from House Republicans who believe it doesn't cut enough spending. The resolution, essential for implementing Trump's agenda, aims to address border security, defense, energy, and tax priorities. However, disagreements persist over the level and areas of spending cuts, creating hurdles for its adoption. The budget plan serves as the initial step in the reconciliation process, bypassing the Senate's 60-vote threshold, but it doesn't resolve fundamental disagreements on spending.</p>

            <p>As Tesla shares continued to decline, CEO Elon Musk escalated his attacks on President Trump's trade advisor, Peter Navarro, labeling him a "moron" and "dangerously dumb." The feud stems from Navarro's claim that Tesla is more of a car assembler than a manufacturer. Musk's outburst reflects the tension within Trump's administration over the implementation of widespread tariffs. Tesla's stock has been significantly impacted, contributing to a substantial loss in value for Musk.</p>

The study also found poor hygiene habits, sugary drink consumption, and stress contributing to the dental issues. Researchers are calling for a multi-factor approach to address the problem, including greater education and routine dental care for players. Some players have reported dental pain and infections preventing them from training.</p>

            <p>California legislators are introducing a series of bills to protect immigrants from President Trump's aggressive policies, including potential enforcement raids at schools and hospitals. The proposals aim to provide legal representation for unaccompanied children, restrict ICE access to school grounds and records, and require schools to notify students and parents when immigration officers are present. The legislative package also includes measures to protect workers and street vendors, and to maintain funding for Medi-Cal, the state's healthcare program for low-income residents.</p>

He argues that investors lack confidence due to the unpredictable nature of Trump's policies. The market's initial surge and subsequent decline in response to tariff news illustrates this volatility.</p>

            <p>President Trump's trade policies are creating confusion and uncertainty. A day of geopolitical swings ended with the White House announcing additional tariffs on Chinese imports would go into effect on Wednesday. In the morning, Trump seemed to attempt to accommodate Beijing, posting that China "wants to make a deal, badly, but they don’t know how to get it started." The administration's rapid shifts about its tariffs program risks fuelling inflation and a global trade war.</p>
