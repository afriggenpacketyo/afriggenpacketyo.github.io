          <p>Iran summoned France's envoy in Tehran to protest against what it considers "insulting" remarks made by the French foreign minister after Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi won the Palme d'Or at Cannes.

Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson Mohammad Tanhaei labeled Barrot's comments as "blatant interference" in the country's internal affairs. Panahi, who has faced imprisonment and bans for criticizing the Iranian establishment, secretly filmed his award-winning film in Iran.</p>

          <p>Individuals and organizations aligned with President Trump are requesting that law firms fulfill their commitments to provide nearly $1 billion in pro bono legal work, made in exchange for being spared from executive orders that could have crippled their businesses.

Some veterans have been directly contacting firms like Paul Weiss for help with issues ranging from rental leases to medical benefits. The law firms are now navigating how to satisfy their pro bono commitments to Trump while maintaining their autonomy and not alienating their staff. </p>

          <p>Aston Villa has lodged a formal complaint with the PGMOL, the referees' governing body, following a controversial decision by referee Thomas Bramall in their 2-0 defeat against Manchester United. The incident occurred when Bramall incorrectly blew his whistle for a foul against Villa, nullifying a potential goal and preventing VAR intervention. Villa's director of football operations, Damian Vidagany, expressed the club's dissatisfaction with the appointment of an inexperienced referee for such a crucial game. The loss meant Aston Villa missed out on Champions League qualification.</p>

Johnson insisted that Medicaid was not cut, but rather the bill targets "fraud, waste and abuse."

          <p>Federal judges are contemplating shifting their security personnel away from the Department of Justice to establish their own armed security force. This proposal arose from concerns that the Trump administration might not adequately protect judges, particularly after Trump's criticisms of court rulings against his policies. The current system relies on the U.S. Marshals Service, managed by the Justice Department, and some judges fear political interference. The idea involves bringing the Marshals Service under the direct control of the Chief Justice, ensuring judicial independence from potential executive overreach.</p>

The piece suggests that the court's decisions risk assimilating a "move fast and break things" ethos into constitutional law, potentially undermining the rule of law.</p>

          <p>A second major power outage in two days hit southeastern France, this time in the city of Nice, after an electrical facility was damaged by suspected arson. The mayor of Nice blamed "malicious acts," and a criminal investigation has been opened. Approximately 45,000 households were left without electricity, and the city's trams stopped running. The police are investigating whether this incident is connected to a similar power outage that disrupted the Cannes Film Festival, which authorities believe was also a criminal act.</p>

          <p>The husband of a Palestinian doctor in Gaza, whose nine children were killed in an Israeli strike, remains in critical condition, according to the hospital treating him. The doctor's colleague says his life remains in danger after sustaining significant injuries to his brain, lungs, arm, and kidney. An Israeli strike killed nine of the couple's ten children and left him and the couple's 11-year-old son injured. The Israeli military has said the incident is under review, while the Red Cross reported that two of its staff were killed in a strike on their home in Khan Younis.</p>

She warned that the Israeli blockade has created a catastrophe for the 2.3 million Palestinians living there, with 500,000 people on the verge of famine. McCain also disputed claims that Hamas is looting aid trucks, attributing it instead to the desperation of starving people.

          <p>A police officer in Dalton, Georgia, resigned after wrongfully arresting an undocumented teenager, Ximena Arias-Cristobal, leading to her detention in a federal immigration jail. The officer, Leslie O’Neal, pulled Arias-Cristobal over for an alleged traffic violation, which was later dropped. The arrest led to national attention and criticism, with some calling for her deportation and others supporting her release. Arias-Cristobal, who was brought to the U.S. at age four, was released after paying a bond, and a GoFundMe campaign for her legal defense raised over $90,000.</p>

          <p>The Cannes 2025 red carpet saw changes to the dress code, prohibiting nudity and voluminous gowns. Nudity is prohibited "for decency reasons" while voluminous outfits are not permitted because they "hinder the proper flow of traffic of guests and complicate seating in the theater." While the sheer look was probably on its way out already, the no-big-trains rule, on the other hand…was not really followed to the letter. Another star of this year's festivities was Elle Fanning, who closed down the festival in a voluminous Cinderella gown by Chanel.</p>

          <p>Despite pledging to halt public financing for fossil fuels, Japan remains a major investor in oil and gas projects, particularly overseas liquefied natural gas (LNG) development. Japanese public financial institutions provided $93 billion for oil and gas projects between 2013 and 2024, with $56 billion allocated to LNG. Critics argue that Japan's promotion of LNG as a "transitional fuel" is a form of greenwashing, as LNG can have higher emissions than coal when processing and shipping are considered. Japan also launched the Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC) with partner countries in Asia to provide a platform for cooperation on "net zero emissions in the Asia region."</p>

          <p>An expert describes the concept of "emotionally safe parenting," which prioritizes attunement to a child's emotional needs and building resilience through open communication. This approach emphasizes accepting a child's emotions without judgment, responding without shaming, and viewing misbehavior as a signal for support. Emotionally safe parents focus on inner healing and self-awareness to create an environment where their child feels safe expressing their authentic self. Practicing this style involves doing inner work, seeing behavior as a signal, setting boundaries with empathy, and preventing shame from taking place.</p>
