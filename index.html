          <p>The Trump administration has ordered an immediate ban on new international students and exchange visitors at Harvard University. The proclamation cites national security concerns, alleging that Harvard maintains links with foreign countries, particularly China, which poses a threat to the US. The administration claims that foreign adversaries exploit access to American higher education to steal technical information, exploit research, and spread false information. The ban is effective immediately and will last for at least six months, further straining relations between the US and China as trade negotiations remain stalled. The move is expected to face legal challenges and has been criticized as an attack on academic freedom.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has signed a proclamation suspending travel to the U.S. for citizens from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. Citing national security interests, the proclamation states that these countries lack sufficient vetting processes to detect potential safety or terrorism threats. The policy also partially restricts entrance for nationals of Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. The ban, set to take effect on June 9, mirrors a similar policy from 2017 that was later ended by President Biden, but this new policy is facing criticism for targeting Muslim-majority and predominantly Black and brown nations.</p>

          <p>A lawyer representing families of victims from the 2018 Lion Air crash has criticized the deal between Boeing and the US Justice Department as "morally repugnant," arguing it allows Boeing to avoid true criminal accountability. The deal involves Boeing paying $1.1 billion to avoid prosecution over two fatal 737 Max crashes that killed 346 people, including $444.5 million to the families of crash victims. The agreement also allocates $455 million towards improving Boeing's compliance, safety, and quality programs, with the company committed to fulfilling its obligations. The victims' families will have the chance to appeal this deal when it is considered by a federal judge, with the lawyer believing the current payout is insufficient.</p>

          <p>Trump's recent travel ban has faced criticism from diverse ideological quarters, with Congresswoman Judy Chu calling it "bigoted and Islamophobic." Immigration analyst Alex Nowrasteh from the Cato Institute highlighted that terrorists from the banned countries have killed only one person on US soil since 1975. Oxfam America warned that the ban represents a return to policies of fear and discrimination, targeting Muslim-majority countries and nations with predominantly Black and brown populations. These criticisms underscore concerns about the ban's impact on American values and its potential to perpetuate harmful stereotypes and religious intolerance.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has signed a proclamation restricting foreign student visas at Harvard University for an initial six months, citing national security concerns. Trump claims Harvard's connections with China and alleged radicalism make it an unsuitable destination for foreign students and researchers. Harvard has denounced the proclamation as an illegal retaliatory step, asserting it will continue to protect its international students. The administration has been engaged in a tense standoff with Harvard, freezing billions in grants and proposing to end its tax-exempt status, prompting legal challenges from the university. This latest action targets Harvard's approximately 7,000 international students.</p>

A U.S District Judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from eliminating the Job Corps program while the case plays out. The temporary restraining order was issued after Job Corps contractors sued the Trump administration Tuesday arguing the Labor Department violated federal law by shutting down the Job Corps centers, arguing the White House does not have the power to dismantle a program established and funded by Congress. Republican and Democratic lawmakers have denounced the move to suspend operations, calling it illegal.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily barred the Trump administration from deporting the wife and five children of Mohamed Soliman, the Egyptian national accused of attacking demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado. Judge Gordon Gallagher cited the potential for irreparable harm if deportation occurred without due process, scheduling a hearing for June 13. Lawyers for the family argued that punishing individuals for the crimes of relatives violates the foundations of a democratic justice system. Soliman's family entered the United States in August 2022 and has been living in Colorado Springs, with Soliman applying for asylum shortly after their arrival.</p>

Somalia, on the other hand, pledged to work with Washington on security issues, with Ambassador Dahir Hassan Abdi stating that Somalia values its relationship with the United States. Trump's ban targets 12 countries and partially restricts travel from seven others, citing national security concerns.</p>

          <p>The future of high-stakes negotiations over Iran's nuclear program remains uncertain as the U.S. and Iran publicly clash over the terms of an interim agreement proposed by the Trump administration. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, slammed the proposal, vowing that Iran would not agree to stop enriching uranium on its own soil. The Iranian foreign minister, Seyed Abbas Araghchi, succinctly underscored Iran's terms in a post on X shortly after the Ayatollah's speech, writing "no enrichment, no deal." The article suggests that optimism among both U.S. and Iranian officials appears to have cooled in recent days.</p>
