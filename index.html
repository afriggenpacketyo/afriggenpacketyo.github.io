          <p>A theft charge against Parviz Jafari, accused of stealing flowers from Ozzy Osbourne tributes in Birmingham, was dropped after prosecutors learned a security guard permitted him to take them. Jafari, from West Bromwich, appeared briefly in court where he was informed of his release. The charge stemmed from reports of theft among thousands of tributes left following Osbourne's death from a reported heart attack. The Crown Prosecution Service determined there was no realistic conviction prospect as dishonesty couldn't be proven, and Osbourne's family had previously viewed the tributes after a public procession.

          <p>Topshop will return to physical retail spaces in 2026 through a partnership with John Lewis, five years after closing all UK stores following the collapse of Sir Philip Green's retail empire. The brand, now owned by Asos, will be available in 32 John Lewis locations, with Topman in six stores, marking a significant comeback for the fashion retailer. John Lewis hopes the partnership will attract new customers, while Topshop aims to re-establish its presence nationwide and potentially open standalone stores in the future. The brand struggled during the pandemic and failed to adapt to changing shopping habits, but this move is seen as a strategic opportunity for both retailers. </p>

          <p>Russia launched a large-scale attack on Ukraine, deploying over 500 drones and missiles, which prompted NATO aircraft in Poland to scramble in response. Ukraine's air force reported shooting down a majority of the drones and some missiles, but impacts were recorded across multiple regions, resulting in at least one death and damage to civilian infrastructure. President Zelenskyy condemned the attacks as demonstrative and indicative of Russia's impunity due to insufficient international pressure on its war economy. The incident underscores the ongoing conflict and the continued disregard by Russia for international efforts to halt the war, while Ukraine is also expanding its own long-range strike capabilities into Russia. </p>

She is calling for transparency from the Trump administration and encouraging other survivors to come forward. Lacerda met with Congressional lawmakers alongside other survivors of Epstein, emphasizing the need for transparency so that she and other victims can begin to heal from the abuse they suffered. </p>

While this "China model" faces criticism in the West regarding labor rights and environmental protection, it is gaining support in the Global South. Diplomats are currently forging a master plan with the aim of reforming "global governance."</p>

          <p>Ruben Loftus-Cheek discusses his return to the England national team after a nearly seven-year absence, marked by a ruptured Achilles tendon in 2019. He admits to having "completely forgot" about playing for England during his time away, focusing on club football with AC Milan. Loftus-Cheek credits his recovery to self-drive and the support of those around him, and he is familiar with England boss Thomas Tuchel from their time at Chelsea. He is hopeful that his versatility will be an asset as he tries to secure a spot in the World Cup squad next year. </p>

          <h2>Democrats' Messaging Problem Rooted in Failure to Define Conflict</h2>

          <p>This article argues that the Democratic Party's messaging problem stems from a failure to define the dominant conflict in American politics. The author contends that Democrats have accepted a losing political battle by defending the status quo against populist insurgency. The article suggests that Democrats need to identify real contradictions and start new fights, potentially by focusing on the theme of "builders vs. extractors." By reframing the conflict, Democrats can create new alliances and challenge the existing political order. </p>

          <p>The site of Hitler's former bunker in Berlin, now a parking lot, has become an unlikely tourist attraction, drawing visitors to contemplate its dark history. After WWII, Soviet forces attempted to destroy the bunker, and East German authorities later buried it to prevent it from becoming a shrine. Despite the site's lack of visible markers, tourists are drawn to it, reflecting the concept of "dark tourism." The story of the Führerbunker highlights Germany's struggle to confront its past and the challenges of managing sites associated with Nazi perpetrators. </p>
