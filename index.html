          <p>Four top partners at Paul Weiss, including prominent Democratic lawyer Karen Dunn and former Mueller prosecutor Jeannie Rhee, are leaving the firm to start their own law firm. This move follows criticism of Paul Weiss for reaching a deal with President Trump to avoid an executive order that would have restricted its business. The deal, brokered by firm chairman Brad Karp, has been widely criticized by associates, other firms, and Democrats, as Karp has been a major fund-raiser for Democrats and previously opposed Trump. The departing partners did not address the controversial deal in their email to colleagues, expressing gratitude for their time at the firm.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Shrinks National Security Council in Foreign Policy Shakeup</h2>

          <p>President Trump has ordered significant cuts to the White House National Security Council, dismissing numerous policy experts. The goal is to reduce bureaucracy and duplication, with most parts of the operation shifting back to their home departments and agencies. After the cuts, the NSC will be approximately the same size it was at the end of Trump's first term. Trump has leaned more on Secretary of State Marco Rubio and others in his cabinet for foreign policy decisions, rather than relying on recommendations from the NSC.</p>

          <p>The use of facial recognition cameras run by a private organization in New Orleans helped lead to the recapture of one of the jail escapees. The New Orleans Police Department's partnership with Project N.O.L.A. has raised constitutional and privacy issues, with the ACLU calling it a radical and dangerous escalation of surveillance. Critics are concerned that citizens are not aware they are being scanned by these cameras. The use of live facial recognition raises constitutional and privacy issues and "is a radical and dangerous escalation of the power to surveil people as we go about our daily lives."</p>

          <p>Marco Rubio, serving as both secretary of state and national security adviser, announced a significant restructuring of the National Security Council (NSC), reducing its staff by at least half. The changes involve reassigning officials to other agencies and placing others on administrative leave.
