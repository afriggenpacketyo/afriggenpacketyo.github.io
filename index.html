          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to end the war with Russia "almost immediately," setting conditions that Ukraine should not join NATO or regain Crimea. These comments were made just before a high-stakes meeting in Washington, where Zelenskyy is joined by several European leaders, including those from France, Germany, and the UK. The European contingent is reportedly attending to present a united front, supporting Ukraine's position and ensuring that a lasting peace is negotiated, rather than one based on immediate territorial concessions under pressure.</p>

          <p>A 47-year-old man from Liverpool has been banned from all football stadiums in the United Kingdom after being arrested for racially abusing Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo during a Premier League match at Anfield. The game was briefly stopped after Semenyo reported the incident to the referee. Following the police action, Semenyo posted on social media, thanking his teammates, Liverpool players, and officials for their professional handling of the situation and for how the "entire football family stood together," turning a negative event into a moment of solidarity.</p>

The update also includes terms born from post-pandemic work culture, such as "mouse jiggler," a device used to simulate computer activity during remote work.

          <p>An opinion article critiques President Trump's "Golden Dome" missile defense plan, comparing it to the strategically flawed Maginot Line of the 1930s. The author contends the system, with an estimated cost of $175 billion, is an unwise allocation of defense funds that may not be effective against modern, evolving threats like advanced missiles and drone swarms. The piece suggests this massive expenditure ignores historical lessons and that the funds could be better applied to more adaptable and proven defense priorities, much like the recalibration of missile defense after Reagan's "Star Wars" proposal.</p>

          <p>An American-Israeli researcher has proposed that 3,800-year-old Proto-Sinaitic inscriptions found in the Sinai desert may contain the earliest known written mention of Moses. The etchings, which predate the earliest parts of the Bible by centuries, are being re-analyzed and could potentially be read as "This is from Moses" and "Declaration of Moses." If verified through peer review, this discovery would provide significant historical context, linking a Mosaic figure to Semitic laborers who resisted the worship of the pagan goddess Ba`alat at the ancient mining site.</p>

          <p>A fisherman in Minnesota has likely solved a missing person case from nearly 60 years ago after his sonar device detected a submerged vehicle in the Mississippi River. Authorities successfully recovered a 1960s-era Buick that contained human remains. The car's vehicle identification number matched that of a car belonging to Roy Benn, who was reported missing in 1967. Officials believe the remains are his, bringing a potential resolution and sense of closure to his family after decades of uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. Attorney General William Barr is scheduled for a closed-door deposition with Congress regarding his personal and unusual involvement in the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's 2019 death. Lawmakers are expected to question Barr about his hands-on role, including his review of jail surveillance footage and his public statements that no one entered Epstein's cell area. This renewed scrutiny comes after a CBS News analysis identified inconsistencies between Barr's description of the video and the footage itself, raising new questions about the circumstances of Epstein's death in federal custody.</p>

          <p>A column by John Ganz critiques the data-driven "popularism" strategy within Democratic politics, which advises candidates to focus on poll-tested, broadly popular issues. Ganz contends that polling is often flawed and that this over-reliance on data stifles bold, visionary leadership, resulting in uninspiring campaigns and contributing to electoral defeats. The author argues that instead of being constrained by potentially misleading numbers, Democrats should make stronger moral and imaginative appeals to voters, citing the grassroots energy of figures like Bernie Sanders and AOC as a more effective model.</p>

          <p>Retail investors who used the fintech platform Yieldstreet, which marketed itself with the tagline "Invest like the 1%," are now confronting huge or total losses on numerous real estate projects. A CNBC review of deals from 2021-2022 revealed that over $370 million was invested in 30 projects that have since seen $78 million in defaults, with many more on a "watchlist." The sharp downturn is attributed to rising interest rates and adverse market conditions, leaving customers who sought to diversify away from the stock market with their money locked up and little chance of recovery.</p>

          <p>Norway's massive $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund has announced its divestment from eleven Israeli companies, citing ethical concerns linked to the war in Gaza. This move amplifies the momentum of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement and signals growing international financial pressure on Israel. While analysts suggest the immediate economic impact on Israel may be limited, they caution that the decision could set a dangerous precedent, potentially triggering a wider wave of divestment and sanctions if other influential institutions and countries decide to follow suit.</p>

          <p>President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops and federal agents in Washington, D.C., is entering its second week, drawing sharp criticism that he is militarizing law enforcement based on false pretenses. Critics argue the move is an authoritarian overreach, pointing to official data showing that crime in the city has plummeted to a 30-year low. The administration defends the action as necessary to restore order, but has provided no clear exit strategy or plan for the vulnerable populations being displaced by the crackdown, escalating tensions with local city leaders.</p>

          <p>Despite the Trump administration's confident assertions that its broad-based tariffs will trigger a renaissance in U.S. manufacturing, many economists remain skeptical. Experts argue that the president's erratic and constantly changing trade policies, combined with the increased production costs for American companies, will likely harm manufacturing competitiveness and reduce employment. They contrast this unfocused approach with the Biden administration's targeted industrial policies for strategic sectors like semiconductors and electric vehicles, suggesting Trump's strategy is less likely to spur the necessary long-term investment for a major resurgence.</p>
