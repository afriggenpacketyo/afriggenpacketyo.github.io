          <p>A significant police manhunt has been initiated for Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, an Ethiopian asylum seeker who was mistakenly released from prison where he was serving a sentence for sexual assault. Kebatu, who arrived in the UK on a small boat, had been jailed for 12 months for an attack on a 14-year-old girl in Epping. The erroneous release has prompted a widespread alert and a major law enforcement operation to locate and re-apprehend him, raising serious questions about procedural failures within the prison system.</p>

          <p>A French court has imposed a rare whole-life sentence on Dahbia Benkired, 27, for the sexual assault and murder of 12-year-old Lola Daviet in Paris, a case that has deeply shocked the nation. Benkired, an Algerian immigrant under a deportation order, will serve a minimum of 30 years, marking the first time a woman in France has received this maximum penalty. The sentence is typically reserved for the most severe crimes, such as those committed by serial killers and terrorists, highlighting the brutality of the 2022 murder.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has pleaded not guilty to federal bank fraud charges in Norfolk, Virginia, with a trial date set for January 26. The indictment alleges she misrepresented the use of a home she purchased to secure a more favorable mortgage rate, saving approximately $19,000. James and her legal team argue the charges are a form of political retribution and selective prosecution, vowing to seek a dismissal based on the allegedly improper appointment of the interim U.S. attorney overseeing the case.</p>

These efforts, which are facing legal challenges over racial bias and procedural authority, introduce significant volatility into the political landscape, as their ultimate electoral outcomes remain uncertain in a shifting political environment.</p>

          <p>Ethiopia's media authority has suspended nine correspondents from the German international broadcaster Deutsche Welle (DW), accusing the outlet of unbalanced and conflict-aggravating reporting. This action is part of a wider crackdown on press freedom in the country, which has seen a surge in journalist detentions and the weaponization of media laws to silence independent voices. Press freedom advocates have condemned the move as an act of censorship, expressing concern that the government is tightening its control over the narrative ahead of the 2026 general election.</p>

The removal of the banner, associated with his now-surrendered membership in the Order of the Garter, reflects mounting pressure for him to lose further privileges.</p>

          <p>The recently reported rise in the annual inflation rate to 3.0% has introduced new complexity into the outlook for mortgage interest rates. While the Federal Reserve is still widely expected to cut its benchmark rate to address a softening labor market, persistent inflation above the 2% target could make the central bank more cautious. Lenders may be hesitant to fully pass on small Fed cuts to consumers if inflation continues to rise, creating a volatile environment where waiting for lower mortgage rates could be a risky strategy for potential homebuyers.

          <p>Six men have been sentenced to prison for carrying out an arson attack on a London warehouse that was providing aid to Ukraine, an act the court described as a "planned campaign of terrorism" for the Russian state. The ringleader, Dylan Earl, was recruited by the Wagner Group, a Russian mercenary organization proscribed as a terrorist group by the UK. The March 2024 fire in Leyton caused £1.3 million in damage and was part of a series of missions Earl was planning on behalf of his Russian handler.</p>

          <p>The average transaction price for a new car in the U.S. reached a record high of $50,080 in September, according to Kelley Blue Book. This milestone was driven by strong sales of more expensive electric vehicles, a rise in luxury car purchases, and the impact of tariffs. For a vehicle at this price point, a typical buyer with a 60-month loan would face a monthly payment of around $796 before factoring in additional costs like fuel and insurance, which could push the total monthly expense over $1,200.</p>

          <p>A viral social media chart claiming the UK has the highest rate of sexual assault in Europe is highly misleading, according to a fact-check analysis. The data is not comparable across countries due to vast differences in legal definitions, reporting practices, and how crimes are counted. For instance, the UK's broader, consent-based laws and its practice of recording each transgression in a group assault as a separate offense inflates its numbers relative to other nations. Criminologists suggest that victim surveys provide a more accurate measure of prevalence than police-reported crime statistics.</p>

          <p>While there is no fixed minimum amount that triggers a lawsuit from a debt collector, legal action becomes more likely for debts ranging from $1,000 to $5,000. The decision to sue depends on factors like the size of the debt versus legal costs, the type of debt, and state-specific laws governing small claims courts. Consumers facing overwhelming debt are advised to communicate with creditors early, as ignoring collection attempts increases the likelihood of a lawsuit. Options like debt management programs or settlement can help resolve debt before it escalates to court.</p>

He argues that horror, like fairy tales, provides a crucial space to explore internal conflicts and existential questions safely. Del Toro sees the story's power in its tragedy, which requires no villain, only an uncaring creator and a creature burdened with a lonely existence. He connects its themes to his own work, viewing both Frankenstein and Pinocchio as essential stories of fathers, sons, and the search for truth.</p>
