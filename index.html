          <p>India's foreign ministry has responded to threats of increased tariffs from the U.S., stating it feels unfairly targeted for its Russian oil purchases. Officials pointed out that both the U.S. and EU engage in significant trade with Russia, arguing India's imports are a matter of national necessity to ensure energy stability. The statement follows former President Trump's accusations that India is profiting from discounted Russian oil, a practice New Delhi claims was previously encouraged by the U.S. to stabilize global markets.</p>

          <p>A recent report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas highlights the increasing impact of artificial intelligence on the U.S. labor market, attributing over 10,000 job cuts to AI adoption in the first seven months of 2025. The technology sector has seen the most significant layoffs, with AI reshaping hiring practices and reducing the availability of entry-level corporate roles. While AI is a notable factor, the report also cites federal spending cuts and trade tariffs as more immediate drivers of the 806,000 private-sector job losses announced this year.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has stated he is prepared to "fight fire with fire" against Republican-led redistricting efforts in Texas, promising to pursue similar partisan measures if the Texas plan proceeds. This response comes as dozens of Texas Democratic lawmakers fled the state to prevent a vote on a new congressional map that could add five GOP seats. The escalating conflict has drawn in other states, with Newsom asserting that any Republican gains in Texas would be "neutered" by retaliatory gerrymandering in California, framing the issue as a national political battle.</p>

Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) engineers are working to restore power, while Network Rail addresses numerous incidents on train lines caused by winds that reached up to 90mph.</p>

          <p>The Gifford fire in central California has burned over 72,000 acres in the Los Padres National Forest, prompting evacuation orders and threatening more than 450 structures. As of Monday evening, the blaze was only 5% contained, with over 1,000 firefighters battling the flames in challenging, rugged terrain. Officials report three injuries, including a motorist who suffered burns, and warn that hot, dry weather forecasted for later in the week could exacerbate fire conditions and facilitate its rapid growth.</p>

          <p>Following a federal appeals court order, U.S. border agents have been directed to stop deporting migrants under the Trump administration's sweeping asylum ban. The court ruled that while the government can pause access to the asylum system, it cannot ignore other laws protecting migrants from being sent to places where they face persecution or torture. This move effectively reopens humanitarian protection pathways that had been closed, ending a policy credited by the administration for a significant drop in illegal border crossings.</p>

Trump's support for the "HOTTEST ad out there" contrasted it with what he termed "woke" advertising, and his comments contributed to a significant surge in the retailer's stock price.

          <p>The Old San Ysidro Church in Corrales, New Mexico, a landmark built in the 1860s, is undergoing its most significant restoration project to date. Managed by the Corrales Historical Society, the project involves stripping the walls down to the original adobe bricks to repair damage and ensure the building's stability for future generations. The restoration also provides a rare opportunity to upgrade the electrical system and install modern heating and cooling, preserving a building considered the historic heart of the village.</p>

          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society shows a significant rise in early-stage colorectal cancer diagnoses among people aged 45 to 49, which is linked to an increase in screenings for this age group. Following recommendations to lower the screening age to 45, testing rates for this demographic jumped 62% between 2019 and 2023. Researchers called the findings promising, as earlier detection improves treatment outcomes, though they noted that screening rates for younger adults remain suboptimal and inequitable across different demographics.</p>

In interviews, the legislators framed their quorum-breaking action as a necessary defense of democracy against a "particularly egregious" gerrymandering proposal. While Governor Greg Abbott has threatened them with civil arrest, the Democrats are holding firm, arguing their protest is a constitutional tool to make "harmful legislation less dangerous" for their constituents.</p>

In a draft letter, the lawmakers argue that the current tragic conflict highlights the overdue need for Palestinian self-determination and national rights to be upheld. The letter suggests a viable state would need to recognize Israel and ensure its security, a move that comes as several key U.S. allies have also recently pledged to support Palestinian statehood.</p>

The blaze, located near an old warehouse, prompted the closure of both lanes of the Honoapiʻilani Highway to allow for firefighting efforts and due to heavy smoke. The Maui County Fire Department reported that the fire was slowly being contained, asking motorists to continue avoiding the area while crews worked to fully control the situation.</p>
