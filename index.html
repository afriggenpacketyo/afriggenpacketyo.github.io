          <p>Overnight into Monday, aerial attacks between Israel and Iran continued, marking the fourth day of strikes following Israel's Friday attack. The IDF reported it is actively striking surface-to-surface missile sites after a surprise Israeli strike hit the heart of Iran's nuclear program, reportedly killing several nuclear scientists and high-ranking military leaders. A U.S. official stated that the United States did not provide any military assistance or have any involvement in Israel's Friday strike, though President Trump indicated potential involvement. The ongoing exchange of attacks highlights the rapidly escalating tensions between the two nations. Optimism surrounding a de-escalation in the near future is minimal.</p>

          <p>Asian shares displayed mixed performance as escalating tensions between Iran and Israel led to a surge in oil prices, raising concerns about disruptions to crude oil supplies.

The rise in oil prices impacted companies reliant on fuel, such as cruise operators and airlines, while benefiting U.S. oil producers and defense equipment manufacturers.

          <p>Palestinians in Gaza are facing severe hunger, exacerbated by violence at newly established US-backed aid distribution points. Israeli forces have killed numerous civilians while they attempt to secure food for their families, turning aid points into "death traps." The distribution process is chaotic, with people forced to scramble for scattered supplies, lacking prioritization for vulnerable individuals. The article contrasts this with the more structured and dignified aid system previously operated by UNRWA, where food was distributed by trusted community members. The current situation is described as humiliating and far from humanitarian.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that ice jams will become more frequent in the Yellow River's estuary by the end of this century due to global warming. As warmer weather breaks up ice upstream, it drifts downstream and refreezes, leading to ice jam formations. These jams can cause destructive flooding, damaging downstream communities, wildlife, and infrastructure. Researchers analyzed 160 years of ice jam flood dynamics, finding that climate warming is shifting the hotspots downstream, exacerbating the risk in Chinese coastal cities.</p>

MPs will vote on measures aiming to cut the benefits bill by Â£5 billion by 2030, including making it harder for disabled people with less severe conditions to claim Personal Independence Payment. Starmer emphasized that the current system is not working for those needing support or taxpayers, and reform is essential. The government aims to address these issues through the Welfare Reform Bill.</p>

          <p>Members of a family who run a formerly Michelin-starred restaurant in western Japan have been arrested for ignoring an order to temporarily shut down the establishment following a food poisoning outbreak. Hirokazu Kitano, his son Hirotoshi Kitano, and his wife Noriko are accused of violating the Food Sanitation Act. The restaurant received a suspension order after 33 customers experienced vomiting and diarrhea, with norovirus detected. Subsequent investigations revealed the business continued selling bento boxes during the initial suspension.</p>

Bishop William Morgan translated the book during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I as part of an effort to make scriptures accessible in local languages. The Bible, which has been kept in Westminster Abbey's library collection, will be on public display at St Davids Cathedral in Pembrokeshire from June 17 to July 9. The book is notable for its good condition, as other copies were frequently used.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts predict that up to 100 truckloads of Scotland's waste will be transported to England daily following the implementation of a landfill ban at the end of the year. The Scottish government acknowledges a shortage of incinerators to handle the extra demand, leading to "bridging contracts" with English waste operators. While the ban aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from landfill sites, the short-term impact will be increased emissions from transporting waste. The long-term strategy focuses on reducing household waste and increasing recycling rates, though recycling rates have seen minimal improvement in the past decade.</p>

          <p>Israel's actions in Gaza have damaged its international reputation, and the recent attack on Iran is seen as a belated and dangerous attempt to restore it. The conflict has exposed Israel's intentions and brought Iran and its proxies into play as defenders of Palestinian rights. Justifications for Israel's actions have been stretched beyond plausibility, and trust has been broken by Prime Minister Netanyahu, who is using the war to bolster his political career. The strike on Iran is viewed as an attempt to reset the narrative and regain support from allies, despite the risk of further escalation.</p>

          <p>Analysts warn that Donald Trump's "revenge tax" could threaten foreign investment into the United States. The provision allows the U.S. to impose higher taxes on foreign individuals, businesses, and investors connected to jurisdictions with "unfair foreign taxes" on U.S. entities. Max Yoeli of Chatham House suggests this move could alienate foreign investors and undermine the U.S.'s openness.
