          <p>Republican lawmakers are strongly condemning the nationwide "No Kings" protests, labeling them as "Hate America" rallies fueled by the far-left. Party leaders, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, argue that Democrats are prolonging the government shutdown to appease this activist base. They suggest that Democratic leaders are hesitant to compromise on a funding deal before the protests conclude for fear of facing an "angry mob." This rhetoric frames the demonstrations not as legitimate dissent but as a partisan obstacle to governing.</p>

          <p>China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, has signaled a desire to mend relations with Canada during a meeting with Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand in Beijing. Wang stated that China is prepared to restart dialogue at all levels and work towards rebuilding trust, describing the visit as a potential "fresh start." This development suggests a significant diplomatic shift aimed at moving past recent tensions. Analysts view this as a pragmatic move by Ottawa, creating an opportunity to restore stability to the bilateral relationship.</p>

          <p>The first T20 match between England and New Zealand in Christchurch was abandoned due to rain, preventing New Zealand from starting its chase. Before the weather interruption, England had posted a score of 153-6 on a challenging pitch. All-rounder Sam Curran was the standout performer for England, scoring an unbeaten 49 runs to help his team recover from a difficult position at 81-5. The washout marks a frustrating start to the white-ball series for both teams.</p>

His body was subsequently taken into Gaza. This confirmation follows the release of his daughter, Nili, during a truce last year. Mr. Margalit is the 10th deceased hostage to be repatriated, with ongoing controversy over Hamas's failure to return all bodies as stipulated in the ceasefire agreement.</p>

          <p>Prince Andrew has announced he is giving up his titles, including the Duke of York, following intense pressure over his association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. In a personal statement, he explained the decision was made in consultation with the King to prevent the continued accusations from distracting from the Royal Family's work. While he will remain a prince, he will no longer use his titles or honours and his public role will be further diminished. The move comes as a posthumous memoir from accuser Virginia Giuffre is set to be published.</p>

          <p>Nexperia, a Dutch semiconductor firm owned by China's Wingtech Technology, has reportedly suspended salary payments and blocked system access for its employees in China. According to local media, the Chinese unit expressed its shock and disappointment in a letter to customers, citing "ruthless suppression" from its European headquarters. This action represents a significant escalation in a growing political and corporate dispute between the Netherlands and China, reflecting broader tensions in the global technology sector.

Protesters like James Phipps, a 75-year-old union member and civil rights veteran, are motivated by issues such as healthcare access and immigration policies, drawing parallels between current events and past struggles for justice.</p>

Santos, who had served less than three months for wire fraud and identity theft, was described by Trump as having been "horribly mistreated." The commutation, which removes all remaining fines and supervision, was praised by some Republican allies but drew sharp criticism from Democrats and the New York Republicans who had led the effort to expel Santos from Congress.

Crucially, three-quarters of the cancers found were types that currently have no routine screening programs, such as pancreatic and ovarian cancer.

          <p>A weekend holiday trip inadvertently saved Charlotte Morjaria's life after a minor accident led to the discovery of a cancerous tumor. The 31-year-old from Newport went to the hospital believing she had a broken rib after being playfully picked up during a game. A precautionary CT scan revealed a large, cancerous mass on her kidney, of which she had been completely unaware. Following the diagnosis of a rare kidney cancer, she underwent surgery to have the kidney removed and is now cancer-free, crediting the "drunken mishap" for her life-saving diagnosis.</p>

          <p>A dramatic increase in overseas orders is fueling a hiring boom among Chinese energy storage companies, which are actively seeking executives to manage their international operations. In the first half of this year, Chinese firms secured nearly 200 overseas orders, a year-on-year surge of over 220 percent. This growth, driven primarily by demand from the Middle East, Australia, and Europe, has created a highly competitive job market for professionals with experience in the sector. The trend underscores China's growing dominance in the global renewable energy supply chain.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is facing widespread criticism for comments he made linking large-scale deportations to a "problem in the cityscape." Opposition parties, including the Greens and the Left Party, have condemned the remarks as racist and discriminatory, demanding a public apology. Critics argue the vague wording implies that the presence of immigrants or people of diverse backgrounds is itself a problem. While some conservative allies have defended him, the comments have ignited a fierce debate about immigration, integration, and political rhetoric in Germany.</p>

The Olympic bronze medallist feels less pressure this year compared to the lead-up to the 2024 Paris Olympics, which she found mentally and physically taxing. Potter is also drawing motivation from the recent tragic death of her friend and fellow triathlete, Sam O'Shea, stating it has given her a renewed perspective on the privilege of being able to compete.</p>

          <p>Finland's President, Alexander Stubb, has stated that Donald Trump is the "only one who can force" Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table to end the war in Ukraine. In an interview with the BBC, Stubb argued that what is needed is the threat of a "stick" rather than the promise of a "carrot" to compel Russia to seek peace. His comments provide an external diplomatic perspective on Trump's potential role in the conflict, suggesting that the US president's approach could be more effective at advancing peace negotiations than previous efforts.</p>

          <p>Antony Easton discovered a suitcase belonging to his late father that unraveled a hidden family history, revealing they were descendants of a wealthy Jewish family in pre-war Germany. The contents led him on a decade-long investigation, uncovering a multi-billion-pound fortune in steel, property, and art that was stolen by the Nazis. While most of the family's assets cannot be reclaimed, the investigation has led to the successful restitution of several valuable paintings. The journey has allowed Easton to reconnect with his family's past and ensure their story is passed on to a new generation.</p>

          <p>Chen-ning Yang, a Nobel Prize-winning theoretical physicist considered one of the giants of the 20th century, has died in Beijing at the age of 103. He is best known for the Yang-Mills theory, a set of equations developed with Robert Mills in 1954 that described the workings of the fundamental forces of nature. This groundbreaking work provided the mathematical foundation for the Standard Model of particle physics, which remains the cornerstone of our modern understanding of the subatomic world. His contributions are often ranked in importance alongside those of Albert Einstein.</p>
