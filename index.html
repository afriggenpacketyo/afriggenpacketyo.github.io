          <h2>India and Pakistan Trade Accusations After Ceasefire Agreement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-10 16:52:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite agreeing to a ceasefire, India and Pakistan have accused each other of violations, raising concerns about the fragility of the agreement. India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri reported "repeated violations" following explosions heard in Indian-administered Kashmir. Pakistan's foreign ministry, while committing to the ceasefire, cited violations by India. The recent military confrontation between the two rivals has been described as the worst in decades, initiated by India's strikes in response to a militant attack in Pahalgam, though Pakistan denies involvement. The situation remains tense, with both sides urging restraint and communication to address any issues with the ceasefire's implementation.</p>

          <p>A girls' track meet in California was disrupted by a political rally protesting the participation of a trans athlete in girls' sports. Three Christian high schools had previously challenged the California Interscholastic Federation's (CIF) policy allowing biological males to compete in girls' sports, citing unfairness and hostility towards religious schools. Athletes, parents, and officials voiced concerns about lost opportunities and an uneven playing field for female athletes. The CIF is currently under investigation by the U.S. Department of Education for potential Title IX violations, while a majority of California residents reportedly oppose biological male trans athletes competing in women's sports.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has directed federal agencies to cease estimating the economic damage caused by climate change when developing policies and regulations, except when legally mandated. This move effectively shelves the "social cost of carbon," a metric used for over two decades to weigh the costs and benefits of policies limiting carbon pollution. Critics argue this decision ignores the scientific and economic realities of climate change, potentially leading to the rollback of environmental regulations. This policy shift could face legal challenges from environmental groups, arguing the administration is failing to adequately consider climate change impacts.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer described the Kyiv ceasefire talks as a "significant moment" in efforts to resolve the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, while acknowledging it is not the end of the process. A virtual meeting of the "coalition of the willing" involving around 30 global leaders reaffirmed the call for Russia to agree to a 30-day unconditional ceasefire, threatening "massive" sanctions for non-compliance. The UK prime minister noted unprecedented unity among allies and said material progress was made during the meeting. The Kremlin reacted cautiously, accusing European leaders of confrontational remarks and insisting that arms shipments to Ukraine must cease before any ceasefire.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's efforts to pass crypto legislation are being hampered by concerns over his personal cryptocurrency ventures, leading to the rejection of the GENIUS Act. Lawmakers cited conflicts of interest arising from Trump's meme coin, $TRUMP, and his family's crypto venture, World Liberty Financial. Critics have labeled these ventures a "pay-for-play scheme" that erodes public trust. Despite the crypto lobby's support for Trump's campaign, the president's pursuit of personal profits is creating impediments to long-awaited advancements in the crypto industry, potentially impacting legislative achievements and the reputation of the U.S. crypto industry on the world stage.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is facing criticism and the potential for President Trump's "Too Late" label due to the complex economic challenges of balancing full employment and low inflation. Economists suggest Powell is in a no-win situation given volatile policies, particularly Trump's tariffs, which threaten both growth and inflation. Trump has been pressuring the Fed to cut rates, but Powell has dismissed the idea of pre-emptive cuts, citing a "solid" economy and labor market. The Fed's history of being slow to act in the face of economic shifts suggests it may miss this call as well, leading to potential economic consequences.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that tin mined in Cornwall and Devon, England, around 3,300 years ago was traded to ancient kingdoms in the East Mediterranean. This discovery establishes that Britain was a crucial supplier of goods and materials to neighboring nations during the Bronze Age. The research puts to rest centuries of speculation about how tin used in Bronze Age communities found its way into Eurasia. The study analyzed tin ores and artifacts from shipwrecks and across Europe, demonstrating the volume and consistency of the tin trade and transforming our understanding of Britain's social and economic relationships with distant societies.</p>

          <p>A 4.1 magnitude earthquake struck near Greenback, Tennessee, rattling homes and waking residents as far away as Atlanta and western North Carolina. While there were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries, the USGS received over 23,000 reports from the public. Earthquakes are not uncommon in the region, with the Eastern Tennessee seismic zone being one of the most active in the Southeast. The region's geology allows seismic waves to spread more efficiently, causing earthquakes to be felt over a larger distance.</p>

          <p>Google has reached a settlement in principle with the state of Texas, agreeing to pay $1.375 billion over allegations that the company violated users' data privacy. The agreement resolves two lawsuits covering three products, with Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton stating that Google secretly tracked users' movements, searches, and biometric data. Google said the settlement addresses claims related to Incognito mode, location history, and biometrics, without admitting any wrongdoing. The settlement does not require product changes, as Google claims to have already updated the relevant policies.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has directed the Department of Homeland Security to add at least 20,000 officers to enforce his deportation policies. The order aims to incentivize undocumented immigrants to self-deport, offering government-funded flights and an "exit bonus." The administration is also pursuing multiple pathways to force undocumented immigrants to leave the US, including the use of local and state law enforcement and the National Guard. Some of these deportation methods have faced legal challenges and been blocked by federal courts.</p>
