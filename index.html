        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Versant, the newly formed spinoff of Comcast's NBCUniversal cable networks, has filed to go public on the Nasdaq under the ticker "VSNT." Regulatory filings reveal a consistent decline in the company's financial performance, with revenue dropping from $7.8 billion in 2022 to $7 billion last year, and net income also falling. This move is seen as a strategy by Comcast to isolate its declining traditional cable assets, such as USA and CNBC, from its more profitable streaming and internet businesses. The new entity will now focus on adapting these legacy brands to a media landscape increasingly dominated by streaming platforms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>English forward Marcus Rashford, currently on loan at Barcelona from Manchester United, demonstrated a significant return to form by scoring two goals in a Champions League match against Newcastle. After a challenging period at his home club and an injury-shortened loan at Aston Villa, Rashford's performance has renewed optimism about his career. His two goals, a header and a powerful long-range strike, secured a 2-0 victory for Barcelona and were praised by both his coach and football analysts. The display suggests that the 27-year-old may be finding redemption and rediscovering his top-tier talent under Barcelona's management.</p>

          <p>According to a source familiar with a House Oversight Committee interview, Hunter Biden was involved in discussions regarding presidential pardons during the final stages of his father's term in the White House. The information emerged from a closed-door testimony by Jeff Zients, a former Biden administration official, who reportedly told investigators that Hunter attended some meetings on the subject with White House aides. This revelation is part of a broader Republican-led investigation into the former president's use of an autopen for official signatures, including for clemency orders. It remains unclear what influence Hunter had in these discussions, including regarding his own controversial pardon.</p>

          <p>Legendary late-night host David Letterman has strongly condemned ABC's decision to suspend "Jimmy Kimmel Live!," calling the move "ridiculous" and a submission to an "authoritarian criminal administration." Speaking at The Atlantic Festival, Letterman argued that media companies should not fire individuals out of fear or in an attempt to appease political pressure. He drew parallels to the recent cancellation of Stephen Colbert's show, suggesting a trend of "managed media" that is harmful to free expression. Letterman confirmed he has been in contact with Kimmel, who he says is in good spirits despite the controversy surrounding his suspension.</p>

          <p>Legal scholars and First Amendment experts are expressing alarm over potential government overreach, termed "jawboning," following the suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" by ABC. The network's decision was preceded by public statements from FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, who suggested the agency could take action against the network if it did not address Kimmel's controversial monologue. Experts argue this creates a direct line between government pressure and the suppression of constitutionally protected speech, setting a dangerous precedent. The situation is intensified by the fact that station owner Nexstar, which first pulled the show, is currently seeking FCC approval for a major merger.</p>

          <p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has been assigned a U.S. Secret Service protective detail, according to multiple sources. This security enhancement follows the recent killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which has intensified concerns about the safety of high-profile public figures. While it is uncommon for a press secretary to receive a dedicated security detail, it is not without precedent, as former press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was temporarily assigned one in 2018. The decision comes as Congress considers additional funding to increase security for officials in both the executive and judicial branches of government.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are projected to surpass 4 million in home attendance for the first time in the franchise's history, a significant milestone reflecting the team's sustained success and star power. Having led Major League Baseball in attendance every year since 2013, the team's popularity was further boosted by the addition of superstar Shohei Ohtani. This achievement underscores the Dodgers' robust financial health, with strong ticket revenue complementing a lucrative local television deal. The consistent fan support provides the team with a distinct home-field advantage and the financial resources to maintain a high-payroll, competitive roster.</p>

          <p>A new Los Angeles County policy is drawing criticism from oversight officials and civil rights advocates, who claim it is an attempt to muzzle criticism and limit transparency. The rule requires watchdog commissions, such as those overseeing the county jails and the Sheriff's Department, to submit all public communications for review and approval by the Board of Supervisors' executive office. County officials state the policy is meant to ensure consistent messaging and prevent misinformation, but critics argue it will have a chilling effect on independent oversight. The Civilian Oversight Commission's chair called the policy "caustic" and vowed that the commission would not be gagged.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's economic policies in his second term represent a significant shift from traditional Republican pro-market principles, embracing a more interventionist "state capitalism." This approach combines conventional GOP policies like tax cuts with historically unconventional actions such as protectionist tariffs and taking government equity stakes in major tech companies like Intel. Analysts describe the doctrine not as a coherent strategy but as a series of ad hoc, transactional deals that prioritize an "America First" nationalism over globalism. This has created profound market uncertainty, as success becomes increasingly tied to political favor rather than predictable rules and competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission has filed a lawsuit against Ticketmaster and its parent company, Live Nation, alleging they engage in "illegal" ticket resale tactics that harm consumers. The suit, joined by seven states, accuses the companies of tacitly collaborating with scalpers to unlawfully purchase tickets and inflate profits, effectively "triple dipping" by collecting fees from brokers and consumers across primary and secondary markets. The FTC claims these practices cost fans millions of dollars annually and frustrate artists' efforts to keep ticket prices affordable. The agency is seeking an injunction to halt these practices and enforce fair market competition.</p>
