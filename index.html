            <p>The wife of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, had filed a protective order against him in 2021 due to domestic violence allegations. The case was dismissed after she didn't appear for a hearing, and they reconciled. Despite a Supreme Court ruling to facilitate his release, Abrego Garcia remains in a Salvadoran prison, with the Salvadoran president refusing to return him to the U.S. The Department of Homeland Security alleges he is a member of MS-13, a claim his family denies.</p>

Specktor reflects on the loss of ambiguity and strangeness in contemporary filmmaking, contrasting it with the more convention-breaking films of the past. He also explores his own creative journey as a writer seeking to preserve subtlety in a culture that often favors simplicity.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court is set to hear a case, Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board vs. Drummond, that could determine whether states are required to fund religious charter schools. The case hinges on whether the Free Exercise Clause of the 1st Amendment compels states with secular charter schools to fund religious ones as well. This case is being seen as an originalist moment of truth, as historical precedent suggests that states routinely denied funding to religious charter schools in the antebellum period, without any legal challenges.</p>

Zillow predicts a slight decrease in home prices in the L.A.-Orange County metro area by March 2026 due to rising inventory, and a potential recession could further depress prices (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>The escalating trade war between the U.S. and China carries profound risks, potentially destabilizing the world economy, triggering a global recession, and undermining the U.S.'s global standing. Economists warn that Trump's tariff policies could harm the U.S. economy and jeopardize its future as a high-tech hub. Tariffs on Chinese goods could raise prices on household items, disproportionately affecting the poor. The situation could lead countries to trade without the U.S., marginalizing the U.S. and increasing China's influence.</p>

            <p>A conservative movement is pushing for deregulation of the American day care system, prioritizing less expensive home-based programs and de-emphasizing professional credentials. This approach contrasts with traditional efforts to expand government support for day care centers. The debate is fueled by concerns about affordability and accessibility, as well as differing views on the role of government in child-rearing. The tragic death of a baby in an unregulated day care in Idaho has highlighted the potential risks of this approach, raising questions about safety and quality control.</p>
