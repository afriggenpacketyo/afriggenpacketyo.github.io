He addressed concerns about negative impacts on U.S. companies like Apple and automakers, arguing the long-term goal of boosting American workers outweighs short-term corporate profit reductions. Greer also explained the use of tariffs as a tool for geopolitical leverage, citing actions against Canada and Brazil for reasons beyond trade deficits, including foreign policy and national security concerns.

          <p>After more than three decades, the unsolved 1991 murders of four teenage girls in an Austin, Texas, yogurt shop may see a breakthrough due to advanced DNA technology. A male DNA profile found on one of the victims, which previously exonerated four initial suspects, remains a key piece of evidence. Despite a promising but ultimately failed match with an anonymous FBI sample in 2017, investigators remain hopeful. With a limited amount of the original sample remaining, authorities are waiting for forensic science to improve further to conclusively identify the perpetrator.</p>

          <p>Investigators and defense attorneys continue to focus on two unidentified men who were seen in the Austin yogurt shop shortly before the 1991 murders of four teenage girls. Multiple witnesses described the men, who reportedly did not buy anything, as looking out of place and whispering conspiratorially. Despite extensive efforts, including hypnosis, these individuals were never identified and never came forward, raising strong suspicions they may have been the perpetrators. This theory persists as a significant lead in the haunting, unsolved case, especially after DNA evidence failed to link previously charged suspects to the crime.</p>

Violante was shot on his first date with Stacy Moskowitz, who died from her injuries, leaving him permanently blinded. Denaro was shot in the head but survived, though his military career was derailed. Both men recall the city-wide fear and their personal struggles to rebuild their lives after the random, brutal violence.

While the school district claims the position formalizes existing security and supports broader safety initiatives, critics note the job description focuses almost exclusively on protecting the superintendent. The move comes as Reid faces scrutiny over various school district scandals and policies.</p>

          <p>In a rare interview, convicted serial killer David Berkowitz discussed his life and the 1976-77 murder spree that terrorized New York City. Now in his 60s, Berkowitz claims he was serving a "demonic entity" and that his actions were a "break from reality," expressing regret for the pain he caused. He describes his current life in prison as a born-again Christian, working in the library and ministering to other inmates.

          <p>Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer is facing backlash for replacing a clean energy advocate on the state's public services commission with an appointee seen as an industry ally. Environmental groups allege the move was influenced by utility giant DTE Energy, which was reportedly unhappy with former commissioner Alessandra Carreon's stances against rate hikes and in favor of renewable energy. The new appointee, Shaquila Myers, previously worked for a pro-business legislative leader, raising concerns that the commission will become more favorable to utility interests.

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the Trump administration is using immigration enforcement to build an authoritarian regime, funded by a new law allocating $170 billion to the Department of Homeland Security. The author contends that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) already operates with unconstitutional cruelty, and this massive budget increase will lead to more abductions, family separations, and violent crackdowns on dissent. The article warns that the militarization seen in communities like Los Angeles will become widespread, impacting all Americans, not just immigrants.

The article argues that these actions, combined with the forced displacement and destruction of infrastructure, amount to the systematic dismantling of Palestinian life.

The dismantling of USAID and populist-driven budget cuts in Europe have created a significant funding vacuum for global development, threatening progress on health and poverty. Spain has pledged to more than double its aid budget by 2030, driven by long-standing public support for such initiatives.

          <p>An amber weather warning has been issued for most of Scotland as Storm Floris is expected to bring unusually strong winds to the UK on Monday. The Met Office warns of a danger to life from potential damage to buildings and falling trees, with gusts of 70mph expected inland and up to 90mph in exposed coastal areas. A less severe yellow warning is also in place for northern England, north Wales, and Northern Ireland. The storm's timing is notable as trees are in full leaf, making them more susceptible to damage, which could lead to power disruptions and travel chaos.</p>

The claims were reportedly first raised in a legal letter in March on behalf of a former celebrity contestant, and it is alleged that the drug use was widely discussed among the show's cast and crew. This probe follows a series of recent controversies surrounding the program's talent and comes after the BBC implemented new welfare measures last year.

          <p>A new study led by Chinese and Canadian researchers suggests that earthquakes play a crucial role in sustaining life in Earth's deep biosphere, where an enormous amount of microbial life exists in extreme isolation. The research posits that seismic activity creates fractures in rocks, releasing hydrogen gas through chemical reactions with water. This hydrogen then serves as a vital energy source for deep-dwelling microbes, allowing them to survive in environments devoid of sunlight and oxygen. This discovery helps explain how the vast, hidden ecosystems deep within the planet are powered, connecting geological forces directly to biological survival.</p>

Faced with a disorderly collection of New England militias, the Virginia gentleman had to overcome his own prejudices and forge a unified, disciplined American army. By implementing structure, promoting talented men like Nathanael Greene and Henry Knox regardless of their background, and demonstrating steady leadership, he laid the foundation for eventual victory. The article argues that this quiet, foundational work reveals Washington's true greatness and character, which are essential to understanding American independence.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Board of Immigration Appeals has ruled that gender, even combined with nationality, cannot be used to define a “particular social group” for refugee protection. This decision effectively reverses decades of legal precedent that allowed women and girls fleeing gender-based violence, such as domestic abuse or female genital cutting, to seek asylum in the U.S. Critics argue the ruling is a major setback for human rights, returning to an era where such violence was dismissed as a private matter. The move is seen as part of a broader assault on both women's and immigrants' rights, and is expected to be challenged in federal courts.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's escalating trade war and new tariffs on numerous countries, the U.S. economy has remained surprisingly resilient, with Wall Street stock indices near record highs. Factors contributing to this stability include investor expectation of eventual trade deals, a lack of widespread retaliation from other nations, and proactive stockpiling by U.S. companies. However, warning signs are emerging, such as a recent rise in the unemployment rate and slower underlying GDP growth. While an economic hurricane may have been avoided for now, the high tariff rates still pose a significant threat to businesses and consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of demonstrators, including WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, marched across the Sydney Harbour Bridge for a pro-Palestinian protest, calling for a ceasefire and increased humanitarian aid for Gaza. The event, dubbed the "March for Humanity," went ahead despite initial police opposition after the NSW Supreme Court authorized it, citing the urgency of the humanitarian situation. Protesters, many with families, chanted and carried signs amid a heavy police presence. The march caused significant traffic disruption and highlighted growing pressure on the Australian government to take a stronger stance on the conflict.</p>

          <p>This article provides a detailed player-by-player rating for the British and Irish Lions following their 2-1 series victory over Australia. While the Lions secured the series win, the performance was not consistently dominant, with the Wallabies winning four of the six halves of rugby played. Standout performers for the Lions included Tadhg Beirne, Tom Curry, and Maro Itoje, who were crucial to the team's success. The analysis reflects on a tour where the Lions showed moments of brilliance and strong team cohesion but were ultimately challenged by an undercooked yet resilient Australian side.</p>

          <p>The Krasheninnikov Volcano on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted for the first time since the 15th century, sending an ash plume six kilometers into the sky. Experts suggest the eruption may be linked to a massive 8.8 magnitude earthquake that struck the region last week. Following the eruption, another strong 7.0 magnitude earthquake hit the nearby Kuril Islands, prompting tsunami warnings for parts of the peninsula. The remote region is located in the volatile "Pacific Ring of Fire," known for frequent seismic and volcanic activity, but Russian authorities state there is no immediate threat to populated areas.</p>

          <p>Chile is experiencing a dramatic decline in its birth rate, which has fallen to just over one child per woman, a rate lower than Japan's and well below population replacement levels. This trend, driven by the high cost of living and increased educational and career opportunities for women, may foreshadow demographic shifts in the U.S., where fertility rates also recently hit a record low. While progressive leaders in Chile view the change as a result of hard-won women's rights, conservatives express alarm about an aging, shrinking population. The rapid transformation poses significant challenges for social systems like pensions and labor markets.</p>

          <p>This article outlines five key reasons why semiconductor giant Nvidia is likely to continue outperforming the market, despite its stock already surging 866% over the past three years. The company's strength lies in its unrivaled leadership in AI chip design, with a market share between 70% and 95%, and staggering growth in sales and earnings. Furthermore, stable, long-term leadership from CEO Jensen Huang, a still-expanding AI data center market, and continued investment in future technologies like robotics and autonomous vehicles position Nvidia for sustained success in the evolving tech landscape.

          <p>The Trump administration is taking a more aggressive approach to collecting an estimated $23 billion in Social Security overpayments owed to the government. Reversing a Biden-era policy, the Social Security Administration has increased the garnishment rate on benefits for overpaid recipients from 10% to 50%. This change, which began in July, could affect over a million beneficiaries who were overpaid due to agency errors or their own failure to update income information. The article notes that affected individuals have legal options to request a waiver or a reduction in the recovery rate based on financial hardship. (not investment advice)</p>

According to the regional governor, debris from a drone struck a fuel tank, igniting a blaze that required over 100 firefighters to control. This was reportedly one of several Ukrainian drone attacks over the weekend targeting Russian energy infrastructure in retaliation for Moscow's ongoing bombardment of Ukraine's power grid. Russia's defense ministry stated it intercepted 93 Ukrainian drones overnight, while Ukraine reported shooting down 61 of 83 drones and missiles launched by Russia.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to introduce a new criminal offense targeting individuals who create and share social media content advertising illegal Channel crossings. The proposed law, part of the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill, could result in prison sentences of up to five years for those promoting services that facilitate illegal immigration, such as selling fake passports or promising illicit work. Home Office analysis indicates that around 80% of migrants arriving by small boat used social media to contact people-smuggling gangs.
