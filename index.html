          <h2>New BBC Documentary Investigates Abuses Within Defunct Jesus Army Cult</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 20:29:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new two-part BBC documentary explores the extensive history of abuse within the now-disbanded Jesus Army cult. The film's director, Ellena Wood, interviewed over 80 survivors, revealing widespread trauma from physical and sexual assault that the church's leadership allegedly covered up for years. The investigation highlights the psychological manipulation that kept members entrapped, comparing it to domestic abuse compounded by the loss of one's entire community and belief system. The article details the profound and lasting impact on victims, many of whom were children subjected to beatings and systemic abuse in the group's communal homes.</p>

          <p>A stabbing incident at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan, resulted in eleven people being hospitalized. Authorities have taken a suspect into custody and stated that the attack appears to have been random, with the victims not being predetermined. The suspect was reportedly armed with a folding knife, and the incident began near the store's checkout area. State and federal law enforcement, including the FBI, are involved in the investigation, and officials have asked the public to avoid the area while they continue their work.</p>

          <p>An American Airlines flight bound for Miami was evacuated on the runway at Denver International Airport following a landing gear incident during takeoff. All 173 passengers and six crew members were safely removed from the Boeing 737 MAX 8, some using emergency slides, as smoke was seen billowing from the aircraft. The fire department later confirmed they extinguished a fire, which the airline attributed to a maintenance issue with a tire. While five people were evaluated for minor issues at the scene, operations at the airport have since returned to normal.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has begun airdropping humanitarian aid into Gaza and announced plans for humanitarian corridors in response to growing international pressure over a severe hunger crisis. This action comes amid reports of starvation-related deaths, including that of a five-month-old infant, and warnings from the UN of an impending famine. While Israel states there is no limit on aid trucks, the UN and other groups report that military restrictions and looting hamper distribution efforts. Critics, including UNRWA's chief, argue that airdrops are an inefficient distraction and that only lifting land-based restrictions can address the man-made hunger crisis.</p>

Critics argue that using a flawless, non-human model reinforces unrealistic and narrow ideals of beauty, undermining years of progress toward diversity and inclusivity. The company behind the AI model defends its work as a supplementary marketing tool, not a replacement for human models. However, the incident raises concerns about the mental health effects of such imagery and the lack of clear labeling regulations for AI-generated content.</p>

          <p>For the first time, scientists have discovered nanoplastic particles in human brain tissue, raising serious concerns about their long-term health effects. Research from the University of New Mexico found that the quantity of plastic in the brain could be equivalent to the size of a plastic spoon, with higher amounts found in individuals with dementia. These microscopic particles, which originate from discarded plastic, enter the body through food, water, and air. Ongoing clinical studies are linking nanoplastics to a range of health issues, including heart disease, diabetes, and hormonal problems, prompting calls for action on plastic pollution.</p>

Judge, who leads the major leagues in several offensive categories, received a PRP injection and is expected to be out for 10 to 14 days.

          <p>With the intense emotional highs and lows of tournament football, experts are providing tips on how fans can manage the physical and psychological effects of stress. Psychologists explain that major matches trigger hormonal responses, including rushes of adrenaline and cortisol, which can elevate heart rates and impact behavior even after the game. To cope, they advise getting good rest, having a clear plan for match day, eating well, and engaging in physical movement to release energy. The article suggests reframing the nervous energy as part of an enjoyable, communal experience that allows for healthy emotional expression.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in several decades, with average July temperatures running below normal and daytime highs struggling to pass the mid-60s. Meteorologists attribute the chilly, gray weather to a misplaced high-pressure system, which has allowed a low-pressure system to dominate, leading to persistent cloud cover. This pattern has also increased coastal upwelling, where strong winds bring cold, deep ocean water to the surface, further cooling the air. While some residents enjoy the temperate weather, experts caution that the region's hottest days often occur in September and October.</p>

          <p>Opposition lawmakers in Taiwan have successfully survived a national recall vote, allowing them to retain their controlling majority in the legislature and continuing the country's political gridlock. The recall campaign was initiated by groups who accused the opposition parties of being "pro-China" and undermining national security. Since the 2024 elections, the opposition has stymied President William Lai's agenda, blocking appointments and cutting budgets. The failure of the recall effort means the current political stalemate, which has at times led to physical altercations in parliament, is likely to persist until the next election.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed how a convicted fraudster, James Kenny, orchestrated a plan for a massive, non-existent music festival in Wales. The "Monmouth Rising" festival was billed as a 45,000-capacity event with headliners like The Killers and Pulp, but was built on a foundation of lies. Kenny deceived employees, suppliers, and the local community with false claims of major investors and government backing, operating from his mother's kitchen. The scheme unraveled when payments failed to materialize and forged documents were discovered, leaving many unpaid and highlighting the vulnerabilities within the festival industry.</p>

He targeted them because of their Islamic faith. The brutal attack drew global attention and heightened fears of anti-Muslim hostility in the U.S. A CAIR-Chicago representative commented that while the "depraved killer has died, the hate is still alive."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump's use of broad tariff powers is facing a critical legal test in a federal appeals court. The lawsuit challenges his authority to impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the foundation for many of his recent trade actions, including duties on Canada, Mexico, and China. A lower court already ruled that Trump exceeded his authority, though that decision was paused pending appeal. If the courts ultimately rule against him, it could invalidate numerous trade deals and tariffs enacted during his administration. (not investment advice)</p>

During the visit, Modi announced a $565 million credit line and inaugurated several India-funded infrastructure projects. The diplomatic effort is seen as a strategic move by India to counteract China's growing influence in the geopolitically important Indian Ocean region.</p>

          <p>England's cricket team faces uncertainty over the fitness of its captain, Ben Stokes, ahead of the final day of the fourth Test against India. Stokes, who has a history of injuries, did not bowl on day four after feeling "a bit stiff and sore," according to the team's assistant coach. The all-rounder had scored a century earlier in the match but appeared weary in the field, raising concerns about his ability to contribute with the ball as England pushes for a victory. His availability is crucial, as he has been England's most consistent bowler throughout the series.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has drawn criticism for his non-committal response when asked if he would consider pardoning convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. Trump stated, "It's something I haven't thought about," a reply that one CNN analyst called an answer to "the easiest question in human history." Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence for her role in helping Jeffrey Epstein sexually abuse underage girls. Trump's ambiguous stance has fueled speculation and comes amid increasing pressure for him to address his past association with the disgraced financier Epstein.</p>

Director Gurinder Chadha confirmed that she is developing a follow-up, inspired by the recent success and visibility of women's football, such as the England Lionesses. The 2002 film, which starred Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley, was a cultural phenomenon credited with inspiring a generation of female athletes. Chadha is unsure if the new installment will be a film or a TV series but hopes to reunite the original cast for a 2027 release.</p>
