        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union has fined Apple $571 million and Meta $228 million for breaching the Digital Markets Act, which requires Apple to allow developers to inform customers of alternative offers outside its App Store. Apple plans to appeal, arguing the EU is unfairly targeting them and forcing them to give away technology for free. Meta was fined for illegally requiring users to consent to sharing data or pay for an ad-free service, responding to Meta's paid subscription tier. The EU is assessing Meta's new free personalized ads service, and the decision risks potential retaliation from U.S. President Donald Trump, who has previously imposed tariffs on EU goods.</p>

          <p>A magnitude 6.2 earthquake struck Istanbul, Turkey, causing widespread concern and prompting residents to evacuate buildings, though initial reports indicated no significant damage or injuries.

          <p>The anti-abortion movement is increasingly embracing fetal personhood and punitive measures, with legislation introduced in several states that would treat fetuses as people and potentially charge women who have abortions with homicide. This shift comes after the overturning of Roe v Wade, emboldening the movement to prioritize fetal rights over public opinion and democratic norms. "Abortion abolitionists" advocate for punishing women who seek abortions as murderers, marking a departure from mainstream "pro-life" positions. The movement's reliance on courts rather than voters allows it to ignore unpopular implications of fetal personhood, such as restricting IVF.</p>

          <p>The article examines the question of whether courts can force a president to comply with their rulings, especially in light of the Trump administration's defiance of court orders. While courts have coercive powers, their effectiveness depends on democratic cultural norms and the vigilance of the American people. Historically, presidents have complied with court orders due to a shared commitment to self-government under a constitution, but the current administration has shown a willingness to twist court orders to its advantage. The article suggests that public opinion and clear directives from the courts are crucial for ensuring compliance.</p>

The probe centers on the Mediheal Group clinics, which are accused of coordinating an international network of organ donors and recipients. Vulnerable Kenyans and individuals from other countries were allegedly exploited for kidney donations, while recipients from Israel and Germany paid large sums for the transplants. Kenyan authorities have suspended kidney transplant operations at Mediheal Group clinics and are seeking information from the public.</p>

          <p>The UK government borrowed more than expected, placing pressure on public finances as Chancellor Rachel Reeves seeks a trade deal with the US to avoid import taxes. Borrowing reached £151.9bn, increasing concerns that Reeves may need to cut public spending or raise taxes to adhere to borrowing rules. The IMF forecasts lower UK growth for 2025, citing tariffs and rising inflation. The government aims to reduce waste and prioritize economic growth amidst these challenges.</p>
