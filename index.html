          <p>China is broadening its efforts to establish a new academic field aimed at eradicating Western biases in ethnic studies, as the government seeks to reinforce a unified national identity. The State Council has approved 15 additional universities to offer programs in "community for the Chinese nation," a concept promoted by President Xi Jinping. This interdisciplinary field integrates Marxist theory, philosophy, history, ethnology, and sociology to create a cohesive narrative around Chinese national identity and counter perceived Western influences in academic research and teaching.</p>

          <p>A parenting coach who has studied over 200 children identifies the phrase "You're okay" as a potentially harmful response to a child's emotional distress. The coach argues that this phrase can invalidate a child's feelings, teach them to suppress emotions, and create a sense of conditional love. Instead, parents are encouraged to acknowledge and validate their children's emotions, allowing them to process and regulate their feelings in a healthy manner. The coach emphasizes the importance of emotional safety and unconditional support in fostering a child's mental well-being.</p>

          <p>The US and Iran have begun negotiations in Oman over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program. The talks aim to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of some economic sanctions. President Trump has threatened airstrikes if a deal isn't reached, while Iranian officials warn they could pursue nuclear weapons. The outcome of the talks could have significant implications for regional stability and the future of the Iran nuclear deal.</p>
