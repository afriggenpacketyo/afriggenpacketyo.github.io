        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Actress Sydney Sweeney has returned to social media after a three-week silence following a mixed public response to her American Eagle ad campaign. The campaign, which played on the words "genes" and "jeans," was criticized by some for having alleged racial undertones, while others defended it as a rejection of "woke" advertising. In response to the controversy, American Eagle stated the campaign was always intended to be about their denim products. Public relations experts cited in the article suggest the controversy is unlikely to harm Sweeney's career and may even increase her visibility, drawing parallels to historically provocative and successful ad campaigns from other brands.</p>

          <p>San Bernardino police are investigating an incident where a federal immigration agent discharged their firearm at a vehicle during a targeted enforcement operation. The driver claimed he was unaware they were officers and fled after they broke his window and shot at him, while a DHS spokesperson stated the driver attempted to run down two CBP officers. The incident has drawn criticism from an immigrant justice group, which called it an abuse of power and released video of the encounter. Local police later located the man but cited the California Values Act, which prohibits assisting with federal immigration enforcement, and left the scene.</p>

          <p>Dan Tana, the founder of the renowned West Hollywood Italian restaurant that has been a favored spot for celebrities for decades, has passed away at the age of 90 in Belgrade, Serbia. Originally a professional soccer player from the former Yugoslavia, Tana opened his namesake restaurant in 1964, creating a late-night dining haven for Hollywood's elite. The establishment became famous for its clubby atmosphere, classic red-sauce dishes, and discreet service to stars like Elizabeth Taylor and George Clooney. Though Tana sold the restaurant in 2009, it has remained an enduring Los Angeles institution, celebrated for its history and timeless charm.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A planned visit by United States trade representatives to New Delhi has been called off as trade relations between the two countries continue to sour. The cancellation comes as President Trump has imposed a cumulative 50% tariff on Indian exports, one of the highest rates for any U.S. trading partner, partly as a penalty for India's purchase of Russian crude oil. India has responded by calling the tariffs unfair, particularly as the U.S. and E.U. continue their own trade with Russia. The U.S. remains India's largest single export partner, making the stalled negotiations significant for the Indian economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Erin has intensified to become the first hurricane of the Atlantic season, briefly reaching Category 5 status before weakening slightly to a Category 4 storm. The National Hurricane Center forecasts that it will remain a major hurricane through the middle of next week, currently lashing Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands with heavy rain and strong winds. While the storm is expected to track between Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast without making landfall, it will likely generate large waves and life-threatening rip currents from August 20 to 27. Coastal areas, particularly North Carolina's Outer Banks, are on alert for significant beach erosion.</p>

          <p>A long-standing traffic engineering guideline known as the "85th percentile rule" is facing increased scrutiny as cities and states prioritize pedestrian safety over vehicle speed. The rule suggests that speed limits should be set at the speed that 85% of drivers travel at or below, effectively letting the fastest drivers determine the legal limit. Critics argue this creates a dangerous feedback loop where speeding leads to higher limits, especially in urban areas with high pedestrian activity. In response to rising traffic fatalities, some states, with encouragement from the Federal Highway Administration, are adopting new models that consider a street's context and the safety of all road users, not just drivers.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed a new method to make biological tissues, including brains, transparent for scientific study, producing exceptionally clear and accurate three-dimensional images. The technique preserves the organ's original structure and enhances the brightness of fluorescent dyes used to highlight specific cells and molecules. By preparing what they describe as "ionic glassy tissue," the method creates a highly transparent solid state at low temperatures. This state not only allows for vivid imaging but also maintains the tissue's structural integrity, enabling long-term storage for future analysis and offering a clearer view of the organ's inner workings.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 6-0 victory over the San Diego Padres, reclaiming sole possession of first place in the National League West. The Dodgers' win was significantly aided by a series of mistakes from the Padres, including three runners caught stealing by catcher Will Smith in the first two innings alone. Padres' starting pitcher Dylan Cease struggled with control, issuing multiple walks that led to an early 3-0 Dodgers lead. A costly two-run error by center fielder Jackson Merrill further extended the Dodgers' advantage, sealing a sloppy performance by San Diego that allowed Los Angeles to clinch the head-to-head season series.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are developing a concept for a hypersonic drone carrier featuring an innovative single, rotating "scissor wing" inspired by a past NASA design. This unique configuration allows the wing to sit perpendicular to the fuselage during takeoff for maximum lift, then pivot as speed increases. At transonic speeds, it swings to a 45-degree angle to mitigate shock waves, and at hypersonic speeds of Mach 5, it aligns parallel with the fuselage, turning the entire aircraft into an efficient "waverider." This adaptable design aims to overcome the traditional compromise between low-speed efficiency and high-speed performance, potentially enabling a new class of advanced aircraft.</p>

The article suggests that repressed emotions and a lifetime of conforming to societal expectations can lead to a breaking point. Key triggers include a history of always being "good" and losing one's identity, perfectionism as a response to trauma, having poor personal boundaries from a parentified childhood, being in an abusive marriage, or experiencing a recent significant loss.

President Zelensky is scheduled to meet with President Trump in Washington D.C. on Monday.</p>

          <h2>COVID-19 Cases Surge in U.S. Southwest as Students Return to School</h2>

          <p>The Southwestern United States is experiencing the nation's highest COVID-19 positivity rates, reaching 12.5% as students return to classrooms. This spike is attributed to the new, highly contagious "Stratus" variant, which now accounts for two-thirds of virus variants detected in U.S. wastewater. The surge coincides with a change in CDC guidance, no longer recommending updated COVID shots for healthy children, a policy shift driven by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. This decision has been challenged in a lawsuit by major medical organizations, who argue it contradicts the scientific consensus that boosters significantly reduce the risk of hospitalization and death.</p>

          <p>Thorne Island, a derelict 19th-century Napoleonic fort off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales, has been renovated into a unique £3 million party and event space. Purchased in 2017 for £555,000 by a former software CEO, the historic building had been abandoned for 17 years and lacked basic utilities. After a challenging five-year restoration project that involved housing workers on-site and flying in materials by helicopter, the fortress now features 40 beds, en-suite bathrooms, and its own nightclub. The owner hopes the unique, off-grid location will be used for everything from tourist attractions to large-scale music events, leveraging its isolation and history.</p>

          <p>With food prices rising, parents are employing meticulous planning and creative cooking to manage the cost of feeding children during the six-week school summer holidays. The article highlights several strategies, including stocking freezers with reduced-price "yellow sticker" items, batch cooking meals, and organizing the fridge to ensure food with the nearest use-by date is used first. Some parents also rely on community pantries that provide surplus food for a small fee. These tactics help families stretch their budgets, especially since subsidized school meals are unavailable and children's snacking increases while they are at home, adding financial pressure during the holiday period.</p>

          <h2>U.S. State Department Halts Medical Visas for Gazan Children After Far-Right Campaign</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 19:58:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. State Department has announced a halt to all visitor visas for individuals from Gaza, a program often used to bring critically ill or injured children to the U.S. for medical treatment. The decision followed an online pressure campaign by Laura Loomer, a far-right influencer who falsely characterized videos of injured children arriving for care as "Islamic invaders." In response, Loomer celebrated the decision, while humanitarian groups like the Palestine Children's Relief Fund condemned it as "dangerous and inhumane," warning it will have a devastating impact. The move is being reviewed by the State Department, but it has already drawn sharp criticism for yielding to online disinformation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has stopped issuing all visitor visas for people from Gaza, pausing a critical pathway for injured and ill children to receive lifesaving medical treatment abroad. The State Department announced the halt in order to conduct a "full and thorough review" of the procedures for issuing temporary medical-humanitarian visas. The policy shift was preceded by a series of critical social media posts from far-right activist Laura Loomer, who took credit for the decision. Humanitarian organizations have strongly condemned the move, highlighting the collapsed medical infrastructure in Gaza and warning that the suspension will have a devastating impact on children in need of care.</p>
