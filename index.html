        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Richard Grenell, appointed by President Trump to lead the Kennedy Center, has alleged financial improprieties, including '$26 million in phantom revenue,' and plans to refer the matter to federal prosecutors. Kennedy Center officials attribute deficit figures to a review undertaken by the center’s new chief financial officer, Donna Arduin. The upcoming season will feature some big names in theater and dance, but will also include nonunion casts for some touring Broadway shows, a move touted as providing more options for audiences. Artists have been divided about performing at the center since Trump's takeover after purging its formerly bipartisan board. </p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has released its preliminary findings on the Mexican navy ship Cuauhtémoc's collision with the Brooklyn Bridge. The investigation focuses on the ship's acceleration just before the crash, with investigators examining engine status, potential failures, and crew interviews. The ship, carrying 277 people, reportedly increased speed to six knots before hitting the bridge, resulting in two fatalities and numerous injuries. Homeland Security responded to Senator Schumer's concerns about potential Coast Guard staffing shortages by stating that the VTS was fully functional during the incident. </p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has struck trade deals with the European Union and the United States, showcasing Britain's negotiating agility in a volatile market. However, the deals' limited scope and terms reflect Britain's diminished position post-Brexit, requiring politically sensitive concessions. To secure these agreements, Britain allowed European trawlers to fish in its waters and granted greater access to American agricultural products. While the deals offer some benefits, such as reduced tariffs on British luxury cars and streamlined airport access for travelers, they underscore the challenges of operating as a midsize economy between larger trading blocs. </p>

Netanyahu responded by saying the three leaders had offered a "huge prize" for Hamas in the Gaza war.

          <p>Simon Daniel, an 18-year-old Cal State Fullerton student, drowned during a fraternity trip to Lake Havasu after being swept away by strong currents. Daniel and five others were swimming in the Copper Canyon area when they encountered hazardous conditions due to recent rainfall. Rescue teams recovered his body the following morning, and a candlelit vigil was held in his memory. Both Cal State Fullerton and UC Santa Barbara are offering crisis counseling services to help students cope with the sudden deaths of Daniel and Tanner Prentiss, a UC Santa Barbara student who also recently drowned. </p>

The rate cuts came as state-backed commercial lenders reduced their deposit rates, paving the way to lower key lending rates. Capital Economics forecasts further rate cuts by year-end.
