          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military launched airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, including Fordo, Natanz, and Esfahan, confirming that all planes had safely exited Iranian airspace after a successful attack. The strikes involved a full payload of bombs dropped on the primary site, Fordo, which is considered critical to Iran's nuclear program due to its underground location and heavy defenses. Trump stated that this action was a historic moment and urged Iran to end the war, signaling a potential turning point in the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel. The U.S. had reached out to Iran diplomatically to assure them that regime change was not planned, and Israel was alerted ahead of the strikes. The Iranian state media acknowledged the attacks on all three nuclear sites, marking a significant escalation in the region. Optimism is tempered by the potential for Iranian retaliation and further regional instability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article analyzes the potential risks and implications of the U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear facilities ordered by President Trump, questioning whether the 'two-week deadline' for negotiations was a deceptive tactic. Iran had previously warned of retaliation if the U.S. joined Israel in attacking its territory, raising concerns about further escalation. The article considers whether the strikes will force Iran to make concessions or if they will lead to a larger conflict, potentially dividing Trump's base, and highlights the domestic political concerns and international security questions raised by the attack. The success of the strikes in destroying the heavily fortified Iranian nuclear research facilities remains to be seen, adding to the uncertainty surrounding the situation.</p>

          <p>Congressional leaders expressed varied reactions to President Trump's announcement of a U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear sites, with Republicans largely praising the move and Democrats questioning the president's authority. Senator Lindsey Graham called it "the right call," while House Speaker Mike Johnson endorsed the strikes as a "decisive" action to prevent terrorism. Conversely, Democrats like Hakeem Jeffries criticized Trump for misleading the country and risking a potentially disastrous war in the Middle East, emphasizing the need for congressional authorization and a full briefing. Senator Bernie Sanders condemned the strikes as unconstitutional, highlighting the division in Congress over the president's unilateral military action.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's successful strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities were likely achieved through misdirection and deception, with the announcement coming abruptly after indications of a two-week delay. Fox News reported that the movement of B-2 stealth bombers towards Guam was likely a misleading tactic to suggest the decision had been postponed. The article details how the element of surprise and the control of information played a crucial role in the operation's success. The strikes followed heightened concerns about Iran's nuclear program after stalled negotiations with the U.S., and Israel's preemptive strikes on Iran's nuclear and missile infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Financial and corporate analysts have given their perspectives on the U.S. attack on Iranian nuclear sites. Mark Spindel of Potomac River Capital anticipates initial market alarm and higher oil prices due to uncertainty. Jamie Cox of Harris Financial Group suggests oil prices will level out as Iran loses leverage for a peace deal. Mark Malek of Siebert Financial believes the action will be positive for the stock market if it is a one-time event, though the Strait of Hormuz remains a risk. Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital notes the added risk to energy prices and potential impact on inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump contradicted his Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, stating that she was "wrong" in her assessment that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon. This disagreement occurred as the White House indicated that Trump would decide within two weeks whether to join Israel in strikes on Iran. Gabbard had testified in March that the U.S. intelligence community did not believe Iran was building a nuclear weapon, but Trump asserted that Iran was "very close to having one." The president had been briefed on the risks and benefits of bombing Fordo, Iran's most secure nuclear site.</p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from making drastic cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation. Judge Indira Talwani struck down a policy change that could have stripped universities of tens of millions of dollars in research funding, arguing the move threatened critical work in technology fields. The ruling addressed "indirect" costs, such as building maintenance and computer systems, which the Trump administration sought to cap at 15% of direct research costs. The University of California estimated the change would have cost it nearly $100 million a year.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) bomb and the B-2 Spirit bomber, which could be used to strike Iran's Fordo nuclear facility. The MOP is a 30,000-pound bomb designed to attack deeply-buried facilities and hardened bunkers, capable of penetrating up to 200 feet underground before exploding. The B-2 Spirit is the only aircraft in the U.S. Air Force equipped to carry and deploy the MOP due to its weight and stealth capabilities. The use of these weapons has been debated, with some suggesting they could be crucial for destroying Iran's nuclear program, while others view it as a provocative move.</p>

          <p>Iran's Fordo nuclear facility has long been a focus of international concern due to its underground location and suspected role in clandestine efforts to develop nuclear weapons. Buried deep in a mountain, Fordo is considered by many analysts to be a key site for a potential nuclear weapons "breakout" program. Experts have noted that Fordo has always been assumed to be an enrichment plant with military purposes due to its machinery and the installation of advanced centrifuges capable of enriching uranium to higher purity levels.</p>
