          <p>In a recent episode of "Saturday Night Live," Prince Harry and Meghan Markle became the target of a joke during the "Weekend Update" segment, highlighting their estrangement from the royal family. Colin Jost quipped about a new trade deal with the U.K., suggesting Britain's demand was to keep Harry and Meghan in the U.S. This jab follows Prince Harry's expressed desire for reconciliation with his family, despite ongoing disagreements and public disclosures about royal life. Royal expert Hilary Fordwich notes Prince William's focus remains on protecting the monarchy amidst Harry's public criticisms. Fox News is the source for this article.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have filed new charges against Oren, Tal, and Alon Alexander, prominent real estate moguls, including additional counts of alleged sexual assault, one involving a minor. The charges are part of a superseding indictment, with six alleged victims now forming the basis for the criminal accusations. The Alexander brothers are accused of luring women to nightclubs and parties, then drugging and sexually assaulting them. Attorneys for the brothers maintain their clients' innocence, noting their willingness to take polygraph examinations. The case has sent shockwaves through New York's real estate community, where the Alexander Group was known for brokering multimillion-dollar deals.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese authorities have sparked controversy by removing the ‚ÄúHan‚Äù category from the demographic groups listed on the Executive Yuan's official information page. The change, which categorizes Han Chinese as ‚Äúother population,‚Äù is seen as an effort by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party to distance Taiwan from mainland China and promote the island‚Äôs indigenous identity. Critics, including the KMT, have slammed the move as a denial of history. Previously, the page stated that Han Chinese constituted the largest ethnic group, accounting for 96.4% of Taiwan's total population.</p>

The first step would be a rollback of tariffs to around the original 34 percent level. Yao also suggests the U.S. might demand China buy more American goods as part of any negotiation.</p>

          <p>Japan's universal health care system, known for ensuring affordable medical care, is facing strain due to a shrinking workforce and aging population, which is now entangled in political maneuvering ahead of key elections. Analysts warn that turning the health insurance system into a political issue could undermine its stability and erode public trust. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government seeks funds for child-rearing steps partly from medical system savings, but faced backlash for proposing increased burdens on patients with high medical costs. The government has frozen the hikes following criticism, pushing the deadline for a new plan to after the upper house election.</p>

The USDA said cases have surged in parts of Central America and are now being detected in some "remote farms" in Mexico. The ban will continue on a "month-by-month basis, until a significant window of containment is achieved," according to the USDA.

Both drugs led to substantial weight loss, but Mounjaro's 20% weight reduction, after 72 weeks of treatment, exceeded the 14% from Wegovy, according to the trial's findings. Researchers who led the trial said both drugs had a role, but Mounjaro may help those with the most weight to lose. Both drugs trick the brain into making you feel full so you eat less and instead burn fat stored in the body - but subtle differences in how they work to explain the difference in effectiveness.</p>

          <p>A 14th-century Buddhist statue, stolen in October 2012 and taken to South Korea, was returned to a Japanese temple, ending a dispute that had contributed to bilateral friction. The statue, owned by Kannon Temple on Tsushima, a Nagasaki Prefecture island, was handed over in South Korea to people representing the Japanese temple. In 2023, South Korea's Supreme Court ruled in favor of Kannon Temple's ownership. The return procedures were completed in January.</p>

A French neuroscientist, Gregoire Courtine, and a Swiss neurosurgeon, Dr. Jocelyne Bloch, have developed something they call a digital bridge. The digital bridge actually circumvents that injury, and sends signals wirelessly from the brain to the intact, healthy part of the spinal cord on the other side of the injury to enable a person to move or have other critical functions.</p>
