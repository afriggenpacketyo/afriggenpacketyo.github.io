        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Russia has strongly criticized the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement, attributing Tehran's non-compliance to former President Trump's decision in 2018. This accusation came as the U.K., France, and Germany triggered a "snapback mechanism" to reimpose U.N. sanctions on Iran, following its reported breaches of the deal, including vastly exceeding enriched uranium limits. Russian officials dismissed the European move as an escalatory step, accusing Western nations of resorting to "blackmail and threats" rather than genuine diplomacy. Despite years of ongoing diplomatic efforts that Iran rejected, Russia and China proposed a six-month extension to the agreement's timeline, a measure unlikely to gain Western support given past non-compliance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Carolina officials have requested the Supreme Court intervene to fully enforce a state law that links school funding to a policy prohibiting transgender students from using restrooms aligning with their gender identity. This emergency appeal follows a federal appeals court ruling that blocked enforcement of the policy against a specific transgender high school student, John Doe, citing a previous binding decision in a similar case. The state argues its policy does not classify or discriminate on the basis of sex and reflects the will of its General Assembly, aiming to restore the status quo and protect student privacy during ongoing litigation. This legal battle underscores the contentious national debate over transgender rights and school policies.</p>

          <p>Home equity loan interest rates have fallen to their lowest point in 2025, averaging 8.22%, making them competitive with HELOCs. This article explores whether now is a good time for homeowners to consider these loans, highlighting benefits such as record-high home equity levels, fixed rates offering protection against market uncertainty, and potential tax deductions for eligible home repairs. However, it also cautions that home equity loans use the home as collateral, emphasizing the risk of foreclosure if not repaid. Consulting with a financial advisor is recommended to assess individual circumstances and navigate the nuances of the product (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Robin Westman, 23, has been identified as the suspect in the Minneapolis Catholic school shooting that tragically killed two children and injured 18 others, dying by self-inflicted gunshot wound at the scene. Investigators revealed Westman harbored intense hatred towards various groups and was obsessed with previous mass shooters, aiming for personal notoriety through the attack. Evidence includes YouTube videos and journals with disturbing writings, weapon doodles, and references to killing, along with a hand-drawn layout of the church. Police confirmed Westman previously attended the school and their mother worked there, noting all three firearms used were legally purchased recently.</p>

          <p>Amazon is expanding its same-day delivery service to include fresh groceries for Prime members in over 1,000 cities, aiming to enhance convenience and compete with traditional grocers. This strategic move leverages existing fulfillment hubs, retrofitting them with temperature controls and specialized training for perishable items.

          <p>A North Carolina election official, James Yokeley Jr., has resigned following his arrest for allegedly placing illicit drugs into his two granddaughters' ice cream. The incident came to light when Yokeley himself flagged down an officer, claiming the girls found pills in their Dairy Queen ice creams, though they did not ingest them. Subsequent investigation, including video footage, allegedly showed Yokeley, who was acting as their guardian, placing pills containing MDMA and cocaine into the desserts. He faces charges of contaminating food or drink with a controlled substance and felony child abuse, with the motive remaining under investigation.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security is relocating detainees from Florida's "Alligator Alcatraz," a controversial state-run immigration detention center, after a federal judge ordered parts of the facility dismantled. The judge's ruling halted new construction and barred further detainee transfers, siding with environmental activists and citing allegations of inhumane conditions, including lack of water and unsanitary food. DHS criticized the "activist judge" and affirmed its commitment to mass deportations, stating it would continue fighting to remove "the worst of the worst." This move is part of a broader Trump administration initiative to expand immigration detention capacity by partnering with Republican-led states.</p>

          <p>The Department of Transportation (DOT) announced it will reclaim direct management of Washington D.C.'s Union Station, a major transportation hub and national landmark, from a local nonprofit and Amtrak. Citing disrepair and safety concerns, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated the move aims to restore the station and make it safe at a fraction of the cost, with changes expected by September. While the federal government already owns the building, this shift signifies increased control amidst the Trump administration's broader efforts in D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser supports the federal intervention, acknowledging the city's inability to fund the station's estimated $8 billion in necessary repairs and hoping for a full transformation.</p>

          <p>The "No Sex for Fish" group of Kenyan women, who pioneered economic independence by owning boats to avoid transactional sex for fish, now faces precarious survival. Six years after their initial success, members are struggling with the aftermath of devastating floods that destroyed homes and boats, and new anxieties over U.S. aid cutbacks affecting the supply of vital anti-retroviral drugs for HIV-positive members. Despite U.S. assurances, reduced drug distribution periods and severe financial hardship are causing fear and anxiety among the women.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article clarifies whether reverse mortgages affect Social Security and Medicare benefits, a common concern for seniors seeking additional retirement funds. It states that reverse mortgages do not directly reduce standard Social Security retirement benefits or Medicare eligibility, as these are not means-tested based on assets. However, caution is advised for those receiving need-based programs like Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Medicaid, as large, unspent lump-sum withdrawals could potentially impact eligibility for these programs by exceeding asset limits. Consulting a financial advisor and a HUD-approved housing counselor is recommended to navigate these nuances effectively (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Reform UK leader of Nottinghamshire County Council, Mick Barton, has banned reporters from the Nottingham Post and its online arm, Nottinghamshire Live, citing "consistently misrepresenting our policies, actions or intentions." The ban, which includes BBC-funded journalists, stems from a disagreement over a story about local government reorganization and claims of potential councillor suspensions. While reporters can still attend public meetings, the council will cease sending press releases and interviews. Critics, including the Liberal Democrats, condemned the move as a "dangerous and chilling" attack on the free press, echoing concerns about attempts to stifle accountability and transparency in local governance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores poetry as a powerful, analog solution for mindful living, arguing that its capacity to immerse readers in the present moment offers a deeper payoff than modern wellness technologies. It highlights the work of poet Linda Gregg, whose style is described as both restrained and exuberant, drawing from the "resonant sources" of human experience. Through an analysis of Gregg's poem "The Last Night in Mithymna," the article demonstrates how poetry, by focusing on sensory details and subtle observations, can cultivate self-awareness and bring readers into a state of contentment. The deliberate absence of verbs in much of the poem creates a sense of stillness and presence for the reader.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines has agreed to a $79 million settlement in a federal lawsuit after a 2020 incident where one of its planes dumped 15,000 gallons of jet fuel over Cudahy, California, drenching schoolchildren at Park Avenue Elementary. The flight, en route to Shanghai, was forced to return to LAX due to a malfunction and exceeded its maximum landing weight, leading pilots to jettison fuel over populated areas. Dozens of children and 40 people were treated for exposure. Delta, while not admitting liability, settled to avoid trial, with the funds distributed to affected property owners and residents, providing compensation for the traumatic event.</p>

          <p>A Trump administration border advisor, Tom Homan, announced that federal authorities plan to "ramp up" immigration raids in Los Angeles and other "sanctuary cities," with Chicago likely being the next target. This follows thousands of arrests in Southern California since June and ongoing legal battles over the constitutionality of such raids. Homan stated that ICE is considering using a naval base near Chicago as a hub for enforcement operations, emphasizing a "large contingent" of agents. This policy reflects the administration's aggressive stance on illegal immigration, despite claims from cities like Chicago of declining overall crime rates and a federal judge's temporary restraining order on roving raids.</p>

          <p>President Trump's attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has initiated an unprecedented legal battle, challenging the President's executive authority and potentially heading to the Supreme Court. Cook, appointed by President Biden for a 14-year term, is suing over her removal, arguing that alleged mortgage fraud claims are pretextual and do not meet the "for cause" standard required by the Federal Reserve Act. The White House defends the firing as lawful, aiming to fill the seat with someone aligned with the President's agenda.

          <p>New research confirms that the polluted Tijuana River is causing severe air pollution, exposing nearby communities to high levels of toxic hydrogen sulfide gas, which smells like rotten eggs. The study, published in Science, recorded hourly averages up to 70 times California's safety standard, particularly at night, leading to residents' complaints of headaches and respiratory issues. This pollution stems from untreated sewage and industrial waste entering the river from Tijuana. Researchers advocate for immediate measures like upgrading the Saturn Boulevard river crossing and providing gas-scrubbing air filters to protect residents, especially children, from the hazardous "cocktail of many, many chemicals."</p>
