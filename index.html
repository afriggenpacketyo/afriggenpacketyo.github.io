          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein who died by suicide, has expressed shock at President Trump's recent comments. Trump stated that Epstein had "stolen" Giuffre and other employees from his Mar-a-Lago club. The family's statement questions what the president knew about Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell's activities and calls for more answers regarding their sister's exploitation. The White House has defended the president's remarks, stating he was answering a reporter's question and had previously banned Epstein from his club.</p>

          <p>English pace bowler Chris Woakes is expected to be sidelined for the rest of the decisive fifth Test match against India after sustaining a shoulder injury. The incident occurred on the first day of the match at The Oval while he was attempting to stop a boundary. Woakes, who had been the only England pace bowler to play in every Test of the series, left the field in significant discomfort. The injury is a major setback for an already depleted English bowling attack and raises concerns about his future in international cricket.</p>

The company's cloud unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and its advertising business both showed strong performance. However, the company's stock fell in after-hours trading due to a weaker-than-expected operating income forecast for the upcoming quarter.

The company's Mac and Services divisions also saw substantial growth, though iPad and wearables sales experienced a decline.

The new facility will have a seating capacity of 650, eliminating the need for temporary tents for large state dinners and other formal events.

          <p>An opinion article argues that recent changes to federal student loan programs under the Trump administration's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" will negatively impact students pursuing professional degrees. The new law caps federal loans for professional schools at $50,000 per year, which is insufficient to cover tuition and living costs at many institutions like law and medical schools. The author, a law professor, fears this will prevent many working-class students from entering these fields, exacerbating shortages of doctors and lawyers. The article suggests California could counteract this by expanding its own state-level student loan programs.</p>

          <p>Several elite universities, including Columbia and Brown, have entered into settlement agreements with the Trump administration to resolve allegations of civil rights violations and restore withheld federal funding. These deals require the universities to make significant policy changes, such as cutting DEI programs, altering admissions policies, and cracking down on student protests. Free speech advocates express concern that these agreements compromise academic freedom and set a dangerous precedent for higher education nationwide. The administration is currently investigating over 100 other universities for similar issues, suggesting more such settlements may follow.</p>

The reversal came after days of large-scale protests across Ukraine, led primarily by young people who feared the law would jeopardize the nation's path toward European Union integration. The original bill would have given the presidentially-appointed general prosecutor control over high-level corruption cases. The swift U-turn by the government highlights the influence of public pressure and the critical importance of anti-corruption reforms for maintaining Western financial support during the war.</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced plans to expand its trading app to include a variety of new asset classes for U.S. users in the coming months. The new offerings will feature tokenized real-world assets, including stocks, as well as derivatives and prediction markets, transforming the platform into an "everything exchange." This strategic move places Coinbase in more direct competition with platforms like Robinhood and Kraken, which already offer similar tokenized products outside the U.S. The expansion aligns with CEO Brian Armstrong's goal of making Coinbase a top financial services app within the next decade.

          <h2>Scientific Study Reveals Potatoes Evolved from an Ancient Tomato Ancestor</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell has traced the origin of the potato to an unexpected ancestor: the tomato. Researchers say the modern potato evolved around nine million years ago through a hybridization event between a wild, non-tuber-producing potato species and an ancient tomato. This interbreeding provided a crucial gene from the tomato that enabled the potato to form its starchy tubers. By analyzing hundreds of genomes of cultivated and wild potatoes, scientists have solved the long-standing puzzle of how the popular vegetable acquired its most defining characteristic.</p>

          <p>A historical essay in The Atlantic traces the origins of the modern attention economy back to the rise of the cheap, daily newspaper in the 19th century. The article argues that this period created the first true marketplace for attention, with an endless cycle of spectacle and sensation that reshaped how people engaged with the world. Critics of the era, like Henry David Thoreau, expressed anxieties about the decline of deep thought and the rise of miscellaneous minds, concerns that echo today's debates about social media and AI. The essay reflects on whether current technology represents an endgame where the work of the human mind becomes redundant.</p>
