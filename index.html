          <p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan has expressed his disgust following a BBC report exposing severe misconduct by Metropolitan Police officers, including sexism, racism, and excessive force. The mayor affirmed his support for Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley's efforts to reform the force and remove unfit officers, emphasizing that such behavior has no place in policing. The Home Secretary and other officials have also called for urgent investigations and the use of new powers to dismiss officers guilty of gross misconduct, aiming to restore public trust. The revelations have prompted widespread condemnation and calls for immediate, decisive action to address the systemic issues.</p>

          <p>A 20-story residential building in the Bronx's Mott Haven neighborhood experienced a partial collapse after a suspected boiler room explosion. The blast, which occurred as the heating system was being activated, tore away a corner of the high-rise, sending debris onto the street below. Miraculously, no injuries or fatalities were reported among the building's approximately 3,500 residents. Officials have evacuated 38 apartments as a precaution while engineers assess the building's structural integrity, though residents have raised concerns about pre-existing issues like mold and leaks. The incident is under investigation, with city records showing active violations for unsafe facades at the building.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old girl is facing DUI charges in Arizona after crashing a stolen pickup truck while driving at over 100 mph with an 11-year-old passenger. The incident occurred early Tuesday on I-40 in Flagstaff when the driver lost control, hit a guardrail, and flipped the vehicle multiple times. Both children were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries. A blood test revealed the driver's blood alcohol concentration was 0.183, more than double the legal limit for an adult. The Arizona Department of Public Safety highlighted the extreme danger of underage drinking and driving while sharing images of the severely damaged truck.</p>

          <p>An Amtrak train carrying 218 passengers and crew struck a disabled semi-truck near Lompoc, California, resulting in four injuries and a significant fuel spill. The collision occurred when the northbound train, traveling from Los Angeles to Seattle, hit the truck which was obstructing the tracks. The truck driver sustained major injuries, while three train passengers had minor injuries. The crash caused the truck to spill approximately 3,600 gallons of diesel fuel, prompting a response from hazardous materials teams. The train remained upright, and passengers were safely evacuated to buses while authorities investigate the incident and manage the cleanup.</p>

          <p>Despite gold prices reaching record highs, consumers in Hong Kong and mainland China are adapting their purchasing habits, particularly for traditional wedding jewelry. The price of gold has surged over 48% this year, following a significant increase in the previous year, pushing the cost of items like dragon and phoenix bracelets to new levels. Retailers like Chow Tai Fook have observed that consumers are gradually accepting the higher prices, driven by cultural obligations and the necessity of purchasing for upcoming ceremonies. This trend indicates a resilient demand for gold in the region, even in the face of unprecedented market conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

According to his agent, Cruz had asked them to move to avoid getting wet, and any spraying was incidental as he turned to ask them to stop recording him.</p>

          <p>In response to the U.S. administration's declared "war on drug cartels," Ecuador has significantly increased its law enforcement operations to combat trafficking networks. Although not a drug producer, Ecuador is a key transit country, and its government is cooperating closely with the U.S., which is providing resources, technology, and planning a new military base in the country. This partnership has led to a surge in police raids aimed at disrupting the drug supply chain from the lowest levels up. The intensified local efforts are part of a broader geopolitical strategy to curb the flow of narcotics to the United States and other regions.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order establishing that any armed attack on Qatar will be considered a threat to the peace and security of the United States. The order authorizes the use of all necessary measures, including military force, to defend Qatar's interests. This unprecedented security guarantee follows a recent Israeli airstrike in Doha that targeted Hamas leaders and unintentionally killed a Qatari serviceman, an act for which the Israeli Prime Minister later expressed regret. The move solidifies the strategic alliance between the U.S. and Qatar, which hosts the largest American military base in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government has shut down after Congress failed to pass a funding extension before the October 1 deadline, furloughing hundreds of thousands of workers. The impasse stems from a dispute between Republicans and Democrats over including an extension of Affordable Care Act health insurance tax credits in the funding bill. Democrats have refused to support a "clean" temporary funding measure without addressing the expiring subsidies, while Republicans insist that healthcare should be negotiated separately. With both parties holding firm and neither side's proposal able to secure the necessary votes in the Senate, federal agencies have been forced to halt all non-essential functions.</p>

          <p>The city of Huntington Beach, California, has officially declared itself a "non-sanctuary" city, a move that directly opposes the state's policies limiting local law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration agents. Led by Mayor Pat Burns, the city council unanimously approved the initiative, which serves as a statement of intent to assist agencies like ICE. While California's "sanctuary state" law restricts such cooperation, the declaration aligns Huntington Beach with a growing number of local jurisdictions nationwide pushing back against these policies. The move highlights the deep political divisions over immigration enforcement between state and local governments.</p>

          <p>An attorney has alleged that the U.S. government deported at least two of his clients to Iran without due process, putting them at risk of persecution. The individuals, who had entered the U.S. to claim asylum, reportedly disappeared from the ICE detainee tracking system before being removed from the country without notice. One of the deportees is a Christian convert whose asylum claim was denied and whose wife and newborn child remain in the U.S. The lawyer called the action "unconscionable," stating that it returns vulnerable people who stood up against the Iranian regime directly into its hands, contradicting stated U.S. foreign policy goals.</p>

The case was notable for its extreme violence, which included Pike carving a pentagram into the victim's chest. Pike's attorneys argue that her mental health issues and young age at the time of the crime would likely have prevented a death sentence today, while the victim's family supports the execution.</p>

Among the Q3 leaders were mobile ad tech company AppLovin, data storage firms Western Digital and Seagate, and Warner Bros. Discovery. Cramer suggested that while these stocks remain a good place to be, the most significant upward movements for the year may be behind them. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A nutritional expert clarifies common myths about cooking oils, emphasizing that no single oil is perfect for all purposes. Contrary to some claims, common vegetable and sunflower oils are healthy choices for cooking, as they are low in saturated fats and high in essential polyunsaturated fats. Modern margarines are also a healthy option, as harmful trans fats have been largely eliminated from their production. For frying, the oil's smoke point is crucial; while extra virgin olive oil is best for dressings, basic olive oil can be used for shallow frying, and oils like sunflower or vegetable are better for high-temperature deep frying.</p>

An analysis shows that 21 of Russia's 38 large refineries have been hit since January, with attacks soaring in August and September. The strikes, some targeting facilities deep within Russian territory, have forced at least 10 refineries to suspend operations, impacting both civilian fuel supplies and military logistics. While the full effect on Russia's war-funding oil revenues is unclear, the campaign appears to be successfully disrupting the domestic fuel market and applying economic pressure on Moscow.</p>
