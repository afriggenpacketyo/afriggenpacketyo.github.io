          <p>An attack occurred outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in Manchester, England, during the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur. A suspect reportedly drove a vehicle toward a crowd before stabbing multiple people, injuring at least four individuals. According to local media and police reports, armed officers responded to the scene and shot the suspect, who did not manage to gain entry into the synagogue building itself. The incident prompted a major emergency response, with officials reassuring the public that the immediate danger had passed while advising people to avoid the area. The attack is currently under investigation by Greater Manchester Police.</p>

          <p>The United States federal government has entered its second day of a shutdown after lawmakers failed to agree on a new spending plan. The White House has indicated that mass layoffs of federal workers are imminent, a departure from the typical practice of temporary furloughs. Both Republicans and Democrats are blaming each other for the impasse, with Democrats seeking guarantees on healthcare funding and Republicans pushing for a temporary stop-gap measure. The shutdown threatens to furlough around 750,000 non-essential federal workers and could cost the U.S. economy billions in lost output if it continues for an extended period.</p>

          <p>Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev asserted that the tokenization of real-world assets, such as stocks and real estate, is an unstoppable trend that will eventually encompass the entire financial system. Speaking at a conference in Singapore, Tenev described the movement as a 'freight train' and predicted most major markets will establish a regulatory framework for tokenized assets within the next five years. He highlighted Robinhood's own success in offering tokenized U.S. stocks in Europe as an example of the growing demand. Tenev believes this technology will merge traditional finance with cryptocurrency, offering greater market efficiency and accessibility globally. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The chief executive of Tesco, Ken Murphy, has publicly warned the UK government against levying additional taxes on retailers in the forthcoming November budget. He stated that the industry has already absorbed substantial new operating costs this year, including higher National Insurance contributions and minimum wage increases, declaring that 'enough is enough.' His comments were made as the supermarket giant upgraded its annual profit forecast, expecting adjusted operating profits between £2.9 billion and £3.1 billion. The Unite union criticized the company, accusing it of profiting from the cost-of-living crisis while workers struggle financially.</p>

          <p>The Czech Republic is facing a potential significant political shift as it heads into parliamentary elections, with polls indicating a move toward right-wing populism. The current liberal-conservative coalition government, led by Prime Minister Petr Fiala, is trailing behind the ANO party, headed by populist ex-premier Andrej Babis. President Petr Pavel has expressed deep concern over the state of democracy, warning against efforts to change the system.

          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown entered its second day, the Trump administration escalated its rhetoric by threatening permanent layoffs of federal workers, referring to it as an opportunity to clear out 'dead wood.' The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director, Russell Vought, reportedly informed Republican lawmakers that firings could begin within a day or two. This represents a significant departure from previous shutdowns, where employees were typically furloughed temporarily. The administration has also moved to cancel billions in funding for energy and infrastructure projects in states with Democratic senators, intensifying the political pressure amid the funding impasse.</p>

          <p>Christian Stracke, President of investment firm PIMCO, has warned of growing 'cracks' in the corporate direct lending market, contrasting it with the healthier asset-based finance sector. He noted a concerning rise in 'Payment-in-Kind' interest, where struggling corporate borrowers defer cash interest payments, effectively borrowing more from their lenders. Stracke attributes this divergence to post-2008 financial crisis trends, where consumers deleveraged while corporations increased their leverage. He suggests that corporate borrowers face a trade-off between more flexible but costly private debt and cheaper but harder-to-renegotiate public debt, signaling potential problems in credit markets.

          <p>Berlin authorities are set to impose heavy fines on residents who leave unwanted items on the street, a practice known as 'zu verschenken' (to gift). While the tradition is a beloved part of the city's informal circular economy, officials argue it has led to excessive illegal dumping, costing the city over €10 million in cleanup last year. Fines will be significantly increased, with penalties for leaving out clothes or dishes rising to €300 and for dumping appliances reaching up to €15,000. Sustainability advocates worry the crackdown is short-sighted and could lead to more usable goods being thrown in bins rather than being reused.</p>

A new kickoff formation has dramatically reduced touchbacks and increased returns, while a change in how kicking balls are handled may be contributing to longer and more accurate field goals. Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio noted that kickers now use 'K' balls prepared in-house, predicting a 70-plus yard field goal will be made this season. The changes have also led to a rise in blocked kicks, adding another layer of strategy and chaos to the game.</p>

          <p>Waking up with a sore back, neck, or shoulders can often be attributed to improper sleep posture, which causes muscle tension and inflammation overnight. Medical experts recommend maintaining a neutral spine alignment, similar to standing posture, with ears, shoulders, and hips in a straight line. To achieve this, individuals may need to adjust their pillows and mattress or use smaller pillows to support gaps under the knees or between the legs. Sleeping on one's stomach is generally discouraged as it can strain the neck, while back and side sleeping are preferred for better spinal support and reduced morning pain.</p>

Air traffic controllers are deemed essential and must work without pay during a shutdown, creating significant financial and mental stress.

          <p>Ukraine has significantly escalated its drone strikes against Russian oil refineries in recent months, leading to fuel shortages and price hikes in various parts of Russia. An analysis found that 21 of Russia's 38 large refineries have been hit since January, with attacks in August and September reaching a new high. The strikes have forced at least 10 refineries to suspend operations, impacting both civilian fuel supplies and military logistics. Verified videos show long queues at gas stations, and some independent retailers have reportedly shut down, indicating the campaign is successfully disrupting Russia's domestic energy market.</p>

After several days of peaceful rallies, the protests have escalated, with reports of vandalism and clashes with security forces, who have arrested hundreds of people across more than a dozen cities.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung has issued a formal apology for the widespread fraud and human rights abuses that occurred within the country's poorly managed foreign adoption programs. The apology follows a truth commission report which found the government responsible for allowing agencies to falsify records and, in some cases, remove children from their birth families to reduce welfare costs, particularly during the 1970s and 1980s. President Lee offered a 'heartfelt apology' to adoptees and their families, acknowledging the government's failure to prevent the abuses. The apology coincides with South Korea's ratification of the Hague Adoption Convention.</p>

Additionally, a route that allowed refugees to automatically bring close relatives to the UK will be permanently scrapped. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated the changes mean settlement will no longer be a 'golden ticket' and must be earned through contributions to the country. The new rules will require applicants to learn English, have a clean criminal record, and volunteer. Critics, including the Refugee Council, argue the policy will not deter arrivals but will push more people toward smugglers.</p>

While BYD still dominates the market, its slowdown contrasts sharply with smaller EV upstarts like Leapmotor and Xpeng, which posted record-high monthly delivery numbers.
