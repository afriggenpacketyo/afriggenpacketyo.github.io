        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced new sanctions targeting Russia's two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, along with their subsidiaries, in an effort to pressure Moscow to end the ongoing war in Ukraine. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized that these companies finance the Kremlin's military actions, urging an immediate ceasefire. This move follows a significant escalation in Russian attacks across Ukraine, which tragically resulted in at least six deaths, including a mother and her two young daughters. The article details President Trump's continued frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin's unwillingness to negotiate a settlement, despite international coordination on weapon deliveries to Ukraine. These sanctions, unveiled during NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte's visit, aim to force Russia to the negotiating table, though earlier peace talks were shelved due to lack of progress.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S.-based ocean carrier, Atlantic Container Line (ACL), faces an estimated $34 million annual tariff bill due to new port fees enacted by the Trump administration's U.S. Trade Representative. The company was reclassified under Section 301 program terms, with fees now based on net tonnage capacity for roll-on/roll-off vessels, despite containers comprising the majority of their freight. ACL's CEO, Andrew Abbott, warns that these substantial tariffs could force the company to relocate operations, severely impacting U.S. manufacturers and exporters who rely on their specialized service. The article details the bureaucratic blind spot that led to this reclassification, and the USTR's current refusal to alter the program rules, leaving ACL in a precarious position.</p>

          <p>Maine Democratic Senate candidate Graham Platner, endorsed by Senator Bernie Sanders, has issued an apology for a skull-and-crossbones tattoo resembling a Nazi SS symbol. Platner stated he acquired the tattoo in 2007 while in the Marine Corps, claiming ignorance of its historical connotations, and has since covered it. Despite calls from a Democratic rival to withdraw, Platner is committed to staying in the race. The article notes additional controversy surrounding deleted social media posts where he allegedly mocked military sexual assault victims and made racially-charged comments. Platner maintains his life is dedicated to anti-fascism and views the controversy as an attempt by "establishment" forces to undermine his campaign.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) asserts that England's support system for children with special educational needs (SEND) is fundamentally flawed and requires a major overhaul. The report advocates for more comprehensive and easily accessible support within mainstream schools, reducing reliance on lengthy assessment processes. This article includes personal accounts from students like Evie, who faced significant challenges accessing appropriate education due to complex disabilities and a lack of suitable specialist placements. The IPPR recommends a new statutory layer of "Additional Learning Support" in mainstream schools, managed by schools with increased funding and staff training.</p>

Nick Lai, head of auto research in Asia-Pacific at JPMorgan, suggests a more than 50% chance of year-on-year slippage, as meaningful demand may have been brought forward by the existing incentives.

This article highlights the judicial system's division over whether the president's factual assertions for deployment must be provably true, with some judges calling presidential claims "untethered to the facts."

          <p>The International Chess Federation (Fide) is investigating former world champion Vladimir Kramnik for his public attacks on American grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky, whose sudden death at 29 has shocked the chess world. Kramnik had repeatedly accused Naroditsky, without evidence, of online cheating, which Naroditsky admitted took a toll on his mental well-being. This article highlights the outpouring of grief and anger from the chess community, with figures like Magnus Carlsen condemning Kramnik's "horrible" conduct and calling for Fide to address the climate of suspicion in online chess. Fide's CEO's controversial remarks questioning support for Naroditsky have further intensified the backlash, raising questions about the federation's credibility.</p>

          <p>The ongoing demolition of the White House East Wing for President Trump's privately funded ballroom project is highlighted as an example of his administration's governance style, characterized by a lack of public review and rapid, irreversible changes. This article explains that neither of the usual commissions involved in White House alterations have reviewed the plans, despite the East Wing being a key piece of American history. The destruction of this historic structure, without public input, is presented as part of a broader pattern of "blitzkrieg evisceration" of agencies and institutions. The article emphasizes that it is far easier to destroy than to restore, making this significant alteration to the nation's most famous building permanent.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown has entered its 22nd day, making it the second-longest federal funding lapse in the nation's history, with no immediate end in sight. The shutdown stems from a standoff between Senate Democrats and Republicans, with Democrats refusing to pass a short-term funding bill without additional spending on Affordable Care Act tax credits. This article highlights that both of the two longest shutdowns have occurred during President Trump's time in office, underscoring persistent political gridlock. Republicans accuse Democrats of holding the government hostage, while Democrats call for President Trump to engage directly in negotiations to resolve the impasse.</p>

          <p>Global oil prices, specifically Brent crude, surged by approximately 5% after the Trump administration imposed new sanctions on Russia's two largest crude companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced the sanctions, citing Moscow's lack of serious commitment to a peace process in Ukraine and emphasizing the need for an immediate ceasefire. This article highlights the immediate market reaction, with Brent rallying to $64.35 per barrel, reflecting the significant impact of geopolitical events on energy markets. The Treasury Department stated these measures aim to harm the Kremlin's ability to fund its war against Ukraine, signaling a direct economic consequence of the geopolitical actions.

          <p>The U.S. gross national debt has surpassed $38 trillion for the first time, a milestone exacerbated by the ongoing government shutdown. Experts warn that shutdowns disrupt economic activity, delay fiscal decisions, and increase costs, with the Peter G. Peterson Foundation noting the debt's accelerating pace, reaching this figure just two months after hitting $37 trillion. This article highlights concerns from economists and credit rating agencies, as interest payments on the debt are projected to soar from $4 trillion to $14 trillion over the next decade, potentially undermining investor confidence. Major credit rating agencies have already lowered the U.S. rating, reflecting growing fiscal instability. (not investment advice)</p>

China aims to cut emissions by 7-10% from peak levels by 2035 and increase non-fossil fuels in its energy mix to over 30%, focusing on wind and solar power. Driven by data on rising climate risks like floods and heatwaves, Beijing is re-engineering urban landscapes with an emphasis on resilience. The article suggests that China's transformation towards green and low-carbon energy makes economic sense, positioning it as a leader in addressing global climate challenges while urging the international community to "stay focused on the right direction."</p>

          <p>Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has called for Prince Andrew to give evidence before MPs regarding his lease of Royal Lodge, seeking greater transparency into royal finances and the independently-run Crown Estate. This request follows increased scrutiny of Prince Andrew after he relinquished royal titles due to his links with Jeffrey Epstein. The article reveals that Andrew has paid only a token annual rent on the property, having made large upfront payments totaling about £8m for renovations, effectively buying out future rent obligations for a 75-year lease. Critics, including Baroness Margaret Hodge, argue this arrangement appears to be a "rotten deal" for taxpayers due to a lack of transparency.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines posted a surprise profit for the third quarter, exceeding earnings estimates, and forecasts record revenue for the final three months of the year. This positive outlook is attributed to strong travel demand and higher fares, with unit revenue expected to rise by 1% to 3% for the fourth quarter. Despite cutting its full-year profit forecast earlier in the year, Southwest reaffirmed that outlook, signaling confidence in its current trajectory. The airline is also implementing strategic changes, such as abandoning its longtime open seating policy, to boost sales and better compete with rivals, with initial sales impact expected in the first quarter.

Recent incidents include a Trump nominee withdrawing over racial slurs and Nazi references, and Young Republican officials making offensive jokes. The piece highlights a "foolishness about what one puts in writing" and a hubris regarding communication system reliability. The author suggests that group chats foster an eagerness to outdo friends in bigotry and points to immaturity and incompetence among inexperienced staffers. Despite these fiascos, a perceived lack of consequences often reinforces a sense of impunity.</p>

This article highlights ongoing questions about the legal rationale and constitutionality of these strikes, with Senator Mark Kelly noting congressional concerns about the administration's justification. At least 34 people have been killed in these U.S. operations, which the Trump administration justifies by claiming a "non-international armed conflict" with cartels due to the deaths caused by narcotics.</p>

This article highlights Gamble's criticism of "adversarial approaches" in public debate and his belief that the inquiry, a generational opportunity, is being undermined. Survivors like Jess, who was sexually assaulted as a child, expressed deep shock over candidates with policing or social work backgrounds leading the probe, fearing a lack of accountability from systems that previously failed them.</p>
