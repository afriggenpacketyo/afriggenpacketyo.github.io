          <p>A control tower breakdown at Paris Orly airport caused the cancellation of approximately 130 flights, impacting thousands of passengers. The DGAC civil aviation authority attributed the disruption to a failure of the air traffic control systems at the Orly tower, leading to a significant reduction in flight capacity. An aviation source cited a radar breakdown as the cause of the airport chaos, affecting flights across France, other European destinations, and North Africa. The airport spokesman said about half the 130 cancelled flights were departures and half incoming flights.</p>

          <p>Todd S. Purdum reflects on Desi Arnaz's contributions to diversity and inclusion in Hollywood, highlighting how he challenged racial stereotypes and transformed the television industry. Arnaz, a Cuban immigrant, insisted on playing Lucille Ball's husband on "I Love Lucy," breaking new ground and becoming a beloved figure. His success led to technical innovations and a business model that persisted for decades, making Desilu Productions the largest studio in Los Angeles.

          <p>President Trump's Middle East diplomacy has largely sidelined Israel, as demonstrated by his engagement with Syria's new leader and focus on deals with Gulf States. This shift signals a change from decades of U.S. foreign policy where Israel held a central role. Trump's actions, including lifting sanctions on Syria and pursuing deals with Iran and Yemen, reflect a new dynamic where Israel is more of an afterthought. This has raised concerns in Israel, particularly regarding the approach to Iran and the handling of regional conflicts.</p>

She argues that the increasing popularity of country music has prompted many artists from other genres to test the waters, and those artists need to decide whether they will embody the exclusionary whiteness of Nashville or the reparative multiracialism that has emerged in recent years. The article highlights how aesthetic authenticity and the historical racial coding of country music influence which artists are embraced by the industry.</p>
