          <p>The half-century-old t-shirt brand Comfort Colors, owned by Gildan, is experiencing a surge in popularity, particularly among Gen Z consumers. Valued for its vintage aesthetic, comfort, and perceived sustainability, the brand has seen approximately 40% year-over-year growth, significantly boosting Gildan's activewear sales. Its success is driven by its prevalence in college bookstores, souvenir shops, and as merchandise for musical acts and social groups. Despite being owned by a large corporation, many consumers perceive Comfort Colors as a more independent, 'homey' brand, contributing to its loyal following and market outperformance.</p>

          <p>Amid macroeconomic uncertainty and potential interest rate cuts hinted at by the Federal Reserve, top Wall Street analysts are recommending several dividend-paying stocks for stable income. EOG Resources is noted for its potential free cash flow growth following a major acquisition, leading to a raised dividend. Coterra Energy is favored for its attractive valuation and strong capital returns potential, despite some caution in near-term estimates. AT&T is also highlighted as a top pick, with analysts expecting strong operating performance and growth in its wireless and broadband segments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As Medicare's open enrollment period continues through December 7, beneficiaries are advised to carefully review their options, as a federal government shutdown may cause delays in accessing information. Experts suggest waiting to finalize decisions until the government reopens to ensure all questions can be answered, particularly as plan coverages, costs, and provider networks can change annually. This year, more details are available about Medicare Advantage plans' supplemental benefits and provider networks. It is crucial for enrollees to compare traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage plans to find the best coverage for their healthcare needs and prescription drugs.</p>

          <p>China's Minister of Transport, Liu Wei, has called for a global effort among shipping companies and port operators to defend free trade against what he termed US "unilateralism and protectionism." His remarks follow the Trump administration's imposition of significant port fees on Chinese-built and operated vessels, a move that prompted Beijing to enact retaliatory fees on US ships. Liu asserted that China's response was necessary to protect its shipping industry's interests. The escalating trade tensions are raising concerns about potential disruptions to international supply chains and the broader global economy.</p>

          <p>Retired FBI agents who investigated the 1993 World Trade Center bombing have condemned New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani for campaigning with Imam Siraj Wahhaj. Wahhaj was named an unindicted co-conspirator in the 1993 attack and has a history of defending convicted terrorists. The agents described Mamdani's association with the controversial cleric as ignorant of history and a poor choice for a political endorsement. Muslim scholars and reformers also expressed concern, stating that Mamdani's embrace of Wahhaj normalizes an extremist ideology and sidelines moderate Muslim voices in the community.</p>

          <p>A "48 Hours" contributor investigating the 2023 murder of Washington, D.C. photographer Joe Shymanski found herself in a surreal situation, as the case led back to her small Pennsylvania hometown. The victim's ex-wife, Heather Snyder, was a former high school classmate of the reporter, and her boyfriend, Brandon Holbrook, was the prime suspect. Holbrook was later convicted of the murder, though his defense questioned why Snyder was not more thoroughly investigated. In an exclusive interview, Snyder denied any involvement and addressed suspicions from the victim's family, stating she invoked her Fifth Amendment right at trial on legal advice.</p>

          <p>The Louvre Museum in Paris remained closed on Sunday after a robbery occurred at its opening, during which jewels of "inestimable" value were stolen. According to French Interior Minister Laurent Nunez, at least three suspects entered the Apollon Gallery, possibly using construction equipment, and fled on motorcycles in a heist that lasted about seven minutes. No injuries were reported, but the incident prompted a significant police response and an ongoing investigation. The theft has drawn attention to security at one of the world's most famous cultural institutions, which hosts millions of visitors annually.</p>

          <p>Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, once a staunch MAGA loyalist, has recently diverged from the Republican party on several key issues, earning praise from some unlikely Democratic allies. She has criticized funding for Ukraine, described Israel's actions in Gaza as "genocide," and sided with Democrats on releasing Jeffrey Epstein-related files and extending Affordable Care Act subsidies. While her voting record remains largely aligned with Donald Trump, her independent streak is seen by some as a populist move to represent her constituents' interests over party loyalty. Others speculate it could be a reaction to being discouraged from pursuing higher office.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article proposes that Democratic-led states should resist the Trump administration's punitive actions through a strategy of "fiscal disobedience." The author argues that since blue states contribute a majority of federal tax revenue, they could create state-administered escrow accounts to hold these funds until the federal government ceases what is described as unconstitutional targeting of Democratic jurisdictions. This act of civil disobedience would not be a refusal to pay taxes but a conditional remittance to force a constitutional confrontation over federal power. The author suggests this could shift the political struggle from unilateral federal domination to a coordinated anti-fascist federalism.</p>

          <p>The rapid growth of pickleball, now played by nearly 20 million Americans, has led to a significant increase in related eye injuries, according to a study in JAMA Ophthalmology. Researchers estimate that cases of corneal abrasions and other eye trauma rose by about 405 incidents annually between 2021 and 2024, with adults over 50 being the most affected group. The study's authors are calling for standardized guidelines for protective eyewear, which can prevent up to 90% of sports-related eye injuries.

          <p>According to neuroscientist Dr. Charan Ranganath, human memory is fundamentally misunderstood as a passive storage system for past events. Instead, he argues that memory is an active resource our brains use to make sense of the present, plan for the future, and construct a personal narrative. Forgetting is as crucial as remembering, as it helps filter out irrelevant details, while emotion prioritizes what gets stored. This perspective reframes memory's purpose from perfect recall to shaping our identity and decisions, explaining why our recollection of an event, rather than the experience itself, often determines our long-term satisfaction.</p>

Lowering the evidence bar further risks approving ineffective or unsafe treatments, eroding public trust, and leaving patients with false hope.

His experience reflects the harsh impact of economic malaise on workers in tourism-dependent industries, forcing him to cut back on expenses and worry about his financial stability.</p>

          <p>NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), a historic leader in space exploration, is facing a severe crisis after laying off over 550 employees, part of a larger workforce reduction over two years. The layoffs are a direct result of congressional funding cuts to its flagship Mars Sample Return mission, which suffered from budget overruns and timeline issues. Morale at the Southern California lab has plummeted amid the uncertainty, with staff reporting poor communication from leadership. The institution now confronts the challenge of recovering its standing and finding a new path forward, potentially by increasing its defense work.</p>

          <p>This opinion article posits that the escalating, tit-for-tat technological conflict between the United States and China is no longer a temporary issue but a systemic feature of the global landscape. For decades, the world operated under a US-centric tech order dominated by companies like Microsoft, Google, and Apple. Now, each nation is leveraging its strategic advantages—China with its control over rare earths and the US with its powerful sanctioning capabilities—to test the other's limits. This rivalry is fundamentally reshaping global technology systems, moving away from a single, integrated order toward a more fractured and competitive environment.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian forces have reportedly struck a major gas processing plant deep inside Russia, in the Orenburg region, approximately 1,700 kilometers from Kyiv. The attack on the facility, described as the world's largest of its kind, caused a fire and partial damage, according to the regional governor. This strike is part of Ukraine's escalating campaign since August to target Russian energy infrastructure, aiming to disrupt fuel supplies and reduce Moscow's revenue for its war effort. The attack follows a recent large-scale Russian assault on gas facilities in eastern Ukraine, as both sides continue to exchange drone strikes.</p>

Two conference safety team members, Richard Knipel and Andrew Lih, quickly intervened and disarmed Weston before police arrived, preventing any injuries. Weston now faces charges of criminal possession of a weapon and reckless endangerment. The conference canceled its events for the day but resumed the following day.</p>

The protests were largely peaceful, featuring creative elements like inflatable animal costumes and musical performances.

          <p>A long-running investigation, aided by secret filming from a 2016 BBC Scotland documentary, has led to the conviction of 14 people in a £28 million timeshare fraud. The scheme, run by the company Sell My Timeshare (SMT), defrauded over 3,500 victims, mostly elderly individuals desperate to exit their timeshare contracts. Victims were subjected to high-pressure sales meetings and tricked into buying useless "credits," losing thousands of pounds while remaining locked into their original contracts. The convictions mark a significant victory for the victims, with the man behind the company, Mark Rowe, sentenced to seven-and-a-half years in prison.</p>

          <p>Fred Done, co-founder of the betting company Betfred, has warned that a significant increase in the UK's gambling tax could force the closure of all 1,287 of its high street shops, putting 7,500 jobs at risk. The warning comes as Chancellor Rachel Reeves considers raising taxes on the industry, with some proposals suggesting a levy as high as 50%. Done stated that even a smaller increase to 35-40% would eliminate profitability and compel a shutdown. The industry argues that higher taxes would push customers to unregulated offshore betting sites, while proponents claim it could raise billions for public services.</p>

Analysts suggest these relationships provide North Korea with diplomatic legitimacy and potential avenues to bypass international sanctions, as countries like Vietnam and Laos can serve as corridors for illicit goods or sources of foreign revenue through overseas workers.</p>

Through extensive sand control and afforestation efforts in the Baijitan National Nature Reserve, authorities have stabilized vast areas of drifting sands that once threatened the regional capital, Yinchuan, and the vital Yellow River. The project has transformed over 45,000 hectares, with only a small portion of the original dunes now preserved for research.

The Spanish Footballers' Association (AFE) coordinated the symbolic protest, citing a lack of transparency and dialogue from the league. While television broadcasts attempted to obscure the protests, players and coaches have voiced their belief that moving a league game abroad distorts the competition.</p>
