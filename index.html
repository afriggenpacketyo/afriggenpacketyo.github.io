            <p>British tennis player Harriet Dart publicly apologized after asking the umpire to tell her French opponent, Lois Boisson, to put on deodorant during their match at the Rouen Open. Dart, who lost the match, made the comment during a changeover in the second set. She later expressed regret for her "heat-of-the-moment" remark, emphasizing her respect for Boisson and her commitment to learning from the incident. Boisson humorously responded on Instagram, suggesting a collaboration with a deodorant company.</p>

            <p>A federal judge has ordered expedited discovery in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador. The judge emphasized the urgency of the situation, stating that every day Abrego Garcia spends in prison causes irreparable harm. The Trump administration has stated they will facilitate Abrego Garcia's return if he arrives at a port of entry, but claim they cannot forcibly extract him from El Salvador. Abrego Garcia's attorneys argue the administration is not taking sufficient steps to comply with court orders.

            <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked President Trump's executive order targeting Susman Godfrey, the law firm representing Dominion Voting Systems. The order aimed to restrict the firm's access to government buildings and contracts due to their representation of Dominion in election-related lawsuits. The judge deemed the order a "shocking abuse of power" based on a personal vendetta that chills the firm's speech and advocacy. Trump's administration has been pressuring law firms and universities, with some firms agreeing to support causes favored by the president.</p>

            <p>President Trump's handling of the Kilmar Abrego Garcia case, where a man was wrongly deported to El Salvador, is seen as an authoritarian political performance. Trump and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele were dismissive of the court order requiring Garcia's return. This incident highlights Trump's admiration for strongmen like Bukele and Viktor Orbán, showcasing a blend of showy displays of power and subtle legal manipulations. The author argues that this unstable mixture could inflame American resistance to Trump's policies and potentially safeguard American democracy.</p>

            <p>A new CDC study indicates that 1 in 31 children, or more than 3%, have been identified with autism, marking a significant increase. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

CDC scientists suggest the rise reflects improved screening and access to autism services. The study also notes higher autism prevalence among Asian, Black, and Hispanic children compared to White children, potentially due to disparities in preterm birth and lead poisoning.</p>

These actions are viewed as an attempt to punish dissent and set an example for others. The administration is also rewarding loyal allies and targeting law firms that have opposed Trump's interests.

            <h2>Army Libraries Target DEI-Focused Books for Removal</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-15 16:34:26 EDT</div>

            <p>A senior Army official has ordered Army libraries, including West Point, to remove books that promote DEI, gender ideology, and critical race theory. The directive aims to eliminate materials that "subvert meritocracy and unity." However, all Army libraries were subsequently instructed to only "flag" books rather than remove them, pending a final decision by top Army officials. The move follows a similar removal of books from the U.S. Naval Academy's library, sparking concerns about censorship.</p>

Balmer's social media posts showed critiques of both Trump and Biden. Authorities have not disclosed a motive for the alleged arson, but the incident follows a series of attacks targeting US political figures.</p>

            <p>The Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts faces an uncertain future following a takeover by the Trump administration. The center's long-serving president was fired, and the new administration is shifting programming to prioritize profit-making and American ideals. This has led to cancellations from diverse groups and a focus on celebrating Christmas. Despite the changes, Mark Morris' potentially controversial ballet, "Moon," premiered as planned, offering a moment of wonder and escape from Washingtonian reality. The article questions whether the Kennedy Center can maintain its artistic integrity amidst these changes.</p>

            <p>A civil case brought by four women against Andrew Tate is believed to be a legal first, according to a barrister for his accusers. The women accuse Tate of rape, assault, and coercive control between 2013 and 2015. The case argues that coercive control amounted to "intentional infliction of harm." Tate denies the claims, calling them "gross fabrications." The women are seeking damages, and a trial could be held in early 2027. Proving intentional infliction of harm could lead to additional damages.</p>

            <p>U.S. stocks closed down slightly on Tuesday as investors reacted to ongoing uncertainty about President Trump's tariff plans. Trump signaled a willingness to ease some tariffs but also impose new ones. The U.S. has received about 15 proposals for trade agreements. Markets in Europe traded higher, while markets in China showed less enthusiasm. Trump's administration said many consumer electronics would be exempt from his wide-ranging reciprocal tariffs.
