            <p>Manchester United suffered a 0-1 defeat to Wolves, highlighting their ongoing struggle to score goals, a concern voiced by manager Ruben Amorim. Despite the team's overall scoring struggles, Amorim is committed to working with Hojlund, emphasizing that the team's scoring issues are not solely his responsibility. The manager pointed to young players like Tyler Fredricson and Harry Amass as positives from the game, while acknowledging the team's need for significant improvement and a plan for the future. Amorim also noted the impact of Vitor Pereira at Wolves, contrasting it with United's current situation. Optimism score: 50</p>

Van Hollen emphasized the importance of upholding Abrego Garcia's constitutional rights, arguing that infringing upon one person's rights threatens the rights of all Americans. Despite the Trump administration's claims, Van Hollen stated that no evidence has been presented linking Abrego Garcia to MS-13 or any terrorist activity.

            <p>Senator Amy Klobuchar stated that the US is approaching a constitutional crisis and called for the Supreme Court to hold Trump administration officials in contempt for ignoring an order to facilitate the return of Kilmar √Åbrego Garc√≠a from El Salvador. She suggested appointing a special prosecutor to charge officials responsible for the deportation or refusal to facilitate his return. Klobuchar's comments followed Justice Samuel Alito's dissenting opinion on a decision to block deportations of Venezuelans, with Alito criticizing the majority's decision as hasty and without sufficient explanation.

The report claimed that troops opened fire believing they were facing a threat, with the IDF asserting that six of the casualties were Hamas members.
