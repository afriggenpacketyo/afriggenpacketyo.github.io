          <p>At a recent summit, NATO members agreed to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP by 2035, a goal strongly supported by the United States. However, the article examines the significant financial challenges this poses, especially for debt-laden nations like Spain, which has already negotiated a form of exemption. Experts highlight the political difficulty of prioritizing military budgets over social services and warn of economic risks such as increased national debt and inflation. This situation underscores the conflict between enhancing European security and maintaining fiscal stability within the alliance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>London's Southend Airport has suspended all flights indefinitely following a crash involving a small aircraft, which witnesses described as erupting into a "fireball" upon impact. The 12-meter plane, operated by the Dutch company Zeusch Aviation, crashed shortly after taking off for the Netherlands. Emergency services have secured the scene, and the Air Accident Investigation Branch has launched a formal investigation into the cause of the tragic incident. The number of casualties has not been officially confirmed, but the event is being treated as fatal.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has addressed U.S. fears about his company's technology aiding China's military, stating that Beijing cannot rely on American chips due to potential restrictions. In a recent interview, he argued that U.S. export controls have been counterproductive, hindering the goal of establishing American technology as the global standard by limiting access to half of the world's AI developers in China. Huang's comments come as he navigates the delicate relationship between Washington and Beijing, attempting to maintain market access while complying with evolving U.S. regulations.</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy expanded by 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, narrowly avoiding a technical recession following a contraction in the first quarter. This growth, which exceeded analysts' forecasts, was largely driven by a 5.5% year-over-year increase in the manufacturing sector, possibly due to businesses accelerating exports amid trade uncertainties. Despite this positive performance, the Ministry of Trade and Industry remains cautious, citing significant global economic risks for the latter half of the year and announcing new business support grants.

          <p>A team of archaeologists has unearthed multistory tower houses in the lost Egyptian city of Imet, located in the Nile Delta. Using remote sensing and satellite imagery, researchers identified the dense architectural remains, which date back to the Ptolemaic Period around 332 B.C. These structures, supported by thick foundation walls, suggest the city was a thriving, densely populated urban center. The excavation also revealed granaries and a ceremonial road, providing new insights into the urban planning, religious life, and economic activity of ancient Egypt.</p>

However, analysts note that today's economic environment is vastly different, characterized by a larger role for private firms, weaker overall growth, and limited government fiscal space. These factors will make it more challenging for Beijing to regulate disorderly, low-price competition and guide the exit of outdated production capacity. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has stated that the fuel control switches on Boeing aircraft are safe, despite them being a focus in the investigation of a fatal Air India crash. A preliminary report on the disaster, which killed 260 people, noted the switches moved to a "cut-off" position and referenced a 2018 FAA advisory that recommended inspections. However, the FAA clarified that it does not consider the issue an unsafe condition warranting a mandatory directive, a position it has communicated to global aviation authorities.</p>

          <p>Restorers at Hungary's 1,000-year-old Pannonhalma Archabbey are undertaking a massive project to save 100,000 books from a severe drugstore beetle infestation. The tiny insects, attracted to the starch-based adhesives in the handbound volumes, have burrowed into a significant portion of the library's collection. To eradicate the pests, the books are being placed in an oxygen-free nitrogen environment for six weeks. Officials believe climate change may have contributed to the problem, as warmer temperatures allow the beetles to reproduce more frequently.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle (EV) brands like BYD, XPeng, and MG have rapidly captured approximately 10% of the new car market in Norway, the world's most EV-friendly country. This growth is driven by competitive pricing and advanced technology, posing a challenge to established players like Tesla. Unlike the U.S. and E.U., Norway has not imposed tariffs on Chinese EVs, making it a key entry point and a "laboratory" for these brands to establish a foothold in Europe. The trend indicates a significant shift in the European automotive landscape.</p>

          <p>A BBC Panorama investigation has revealed questionable practices at two of the UK's largest estate agencies, Connells and Purplebricks. An undercover reporter at Connells found evidence of staff favoring buyers who used in-house mortgage services, a practice that could disadvantage sellers by sidelining potentially higher offers from other buyers. At Purplebricks, a whistleblower alleged that properties were deliberately overvalued to win business, with staff later incentivized to persuade sellers to reduce their asking prices. Both companies have responded to the allegations, defending their commitment to fair practices.</p>

The woman, who had falsely told her GP she was pregnant, was arrested at Gatwick Airport, and subsequent DNA tests proved she and her husband were not the baby's biological parents. An investigation uncovered forged hospital documents and evidence of a financial transaction, revealing what experts call a worrying trend of child trafficking, sometimes linked to so-called "baby factories" in West Africa.</p>
