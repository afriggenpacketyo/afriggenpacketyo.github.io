          <p>The leaders of France, Germany, Britain, and Poland made a joint visit to Kyiv to demonstrate their support for Ukraine and to encourage Russia to agree to a 30-day cease-fire. This marks the first time these four European nations have traveled together to Ukrainian soil. The visit occurs after President Putin welcomed leaders from China and Brazil to Moscow, showcasing a non-Western world order. The European leaders reiterated their backing for President Trumpâ€™s call for a peace deal and urged Russia to cease obstructing efforts for lasting peace, aiming to ensure Ukraine's prosperity within its recognized borders. They also plan a virtual meeting with other Western leaders to discuss a "coalition of the willing" to secure Ukraine post-conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Xi Jinping has been strategically positioning China to dominate global supplies, aiming to deter foreign powers from disrupting China's access to essential resources. Since 2020, China has ramped up exports and solidified its position as the world's leading manufacturing base, supported by significant lending to industrial borrowers. China has also introduced economic warfare tactics, such as export controls on critical minerals, to counter tariffs imposed by the United States. The looming threat of empty store shelves and higher consumer prices in the U.S. is pressuring the Trump administration, highlighting the extent of global reliance on Chinese goods and potentially cleaving the world into competing spheres of influence. The article notes that even if Xi ends up having to back down first, he could spin a tactical retreat as a win over Mr. Trump.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has temporarily halted the Trump administration's plans to restructure government agencies and implement mass layoffs, stating that the government overhaul was not authorized by Congress. Judge Susan Illston issued a 14-day pause, siding with unions and local governments who filed a lawsuit. The ruling prevents the administration from eliminating duplicate roles, automating tasks, and closing field offices without congressional approval. The plaintiffs argued that the administration's actions have caused chaos and disrupted critical services. A hearing is scheduled for May 22 to consider a longer preliminary injunction.</p>

The spacecraft, weighing approximately 1,050 pounds and equipped with a protective heat shield, has a chance of surviving its descent.

          <p>Top officials from the United States and China are meeting in Geneva to address escalating trade tensions that threaten global commerce. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will engage with a Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier He Lifeng. The goal is to de-escalate the dispute, potentially through scaling back tariffs, though prospects for a major breakthrough are uncertain. President Trump suggested lowering tariffs to 80%, signaling a potential shift, but the overall outlook remains complex.</p>

          <p>Yvette Cooper, the Home Secretary, is preparing to introduce new measures to reduce UK net migration, which stood at 728,000 last year. The proposals include requiring employers to invest in UK skills before hiring overseas workers and restricting visa applications from nationalities deemed likely to overstay or claim asylum. Migrants may also face longer waits before applying for permanent residency, and tougher English language requirements could be implemented. The government is reviewing how the 'right to a family life' is applied in immigration cases, potentially leading to changes in legal interpretations.</p>

          <p>Newly released documents from a federal investigation into New York City Mayor Eric Adams detail key moments in a corruption case that has roiled the city. The investigation, which began in August 2021, focused on the mayor's fundraising and connections to the government of Turkey. Federal agents considered seizing the mayor's electronic devices at the New York City Marathon but instead approached him the next night. The documents suggest that Adams may have obstructed efforts to obtain his personal cellphone, and he was also being investigated for witness tampering, though charges were later dropped.</p>

Mandelson noted ongoing discussions regarding the UK's Digital Services Tax, clarifying that its abolishment was not part of the current agreement. Despite differing political styles, Mandelson highlighted the effective working relationship between Prime Minister Starmer and President Trump in defending their respective national interests.</p>

This expansion of immigration enforcement involves deputizing state and local law enforcement and contracting with other federal agencies. The administration is also promoting 'self-deportation' by offering financial assistance to migrants who voluntarily leave the country. Migrants who do not comply could face fines, wage garnishment, and confiscation of property.</p>
