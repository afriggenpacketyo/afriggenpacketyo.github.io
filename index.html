          <p>Moscow held an expansive Victory Day military parade marking the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany, showcasing military hardware and personnel. The event aimed to instill national pride and demonstrate Russia's strength to both allies and adversaries, with attendees including foreign dignitaries and military personnel from allied nations. Despite the impressive display, the article notes that it masked Russia's difficulties on the battlefield in Ukraine and economic challenges due to Western sanctions. The author reflects on the historical significance of World War II for Russia and its use in contemporary propaganda.</p>

          <p>A recent government survey in Japan indicates that approximately 39% of the population experiences feelings of loneliness, a figure that has remained consistent since 2021 despite the implementation of a law aimed at addressing isolation. The survey also explored the correlation between smartphone usage and loneliness, finding that individuals who spend more than eight hours a day on their devices are more likely to report feeling lonely. Bereavement of a family member was cited as the most frequent factor contributing to loneliness, followed by living alone and health issues.</p>

          <p>Tensions between India and Pakistan have escalated into a significant military conflict, marked by missile strikes and increased use of drones after a terrorist attack in Kashmir. Both sides have accused each other of initiating attacks, targeting air bases and missile storage facilities, leading to heightened regional instability. Diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the situation have been largely unsuccessful, with both countries ignoring calls for restraint from the international community. The article highlights the potential for further escalation and the use of drone warfare as a concerning development in the long-standing conflict.</p>

          <p>Pakistan's armed forces announced they retaliated against India, targeting military sites after India allegedly fired missiles at three of its air bases, an escalation between the two nuclear-armed neighbors. According to Pakistan, the Indian missiles targeted Nur Khan air base in Rawalpindi, Murid air base in Chakwal city, and Rafiqui air base in the Jhang district. Pakistan's army spokesman, Lt. Gen.

The spacecraft, designed with a heat shield, may partially survive its descent, though the risk of injuries on the ground is considered low.

The union supports proposals to reduce short sentences and strengthen community orders but stresses the need for sufficient resources to ensure successful implementation and prevent increased pressure on the service. The Institute for Fiscal Studies reports a 12% budget decrease for prisons and probation, adjusted for inflation, between 2007 and 2024.</p>

The quarantine, effective through October 31, covers the entire California coastline and warns against consuming non-commercially harvested mussels. These toxins are produced by algae blooms, which shellfish consume, leading to the accumulation of biotoxins in their tissue.

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, was released from ICE custody after a federal judge in Vermont ordered her release on bail. Ozturk was detained in March after her visa was revoked by the Trump administration due to a column she co-wrote in her student newspaper criticizing the university's response to resolutions approved by the Tufts Community Union Senate. Judge William Sessions slammed the government for not producing any evidence against her, saying that the process by which she was placed in immigration detention “raises very significant due process concerns”. The ACLU is representing Ozturk.</p>

He suggests that allowing DOGE members to govern the CPSC would compromise the agency's product safety functions.

          <p>Traffic at the port of Long Beach, the busiest port in the western hemisphere, is down by a third compared to last year, due to President Trump's new tariffs policy.

A toy warehouse owner is struggling to afford the tariffs and may have to raise prices, while a party shop owner has empty shelves due to the high cost of importing from China.
