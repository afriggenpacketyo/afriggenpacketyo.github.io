          <p>The Russell 2000 index, a benchmark for small-cap stocks, officially entered bear market territory, declining over 20% from its November high.  This downturn follows President Trump's aggressive tariff implementation, impacting companies heavily reliant on foreign goods and exacerbating economic slowdown concerns. Experts predict further downside, especially if the Federal Reserve doesn't intervene with interest rate cuts, but anticipate a potential market rebound later in the year.</p>
