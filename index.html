          <p>A powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's eastern coast has triggered tsunami waves in the Pacific. Waves have already reached Japan's coast, prompting widespread concern. Tsunami Warnings are in effect for Hawaii and parts of Alaska, while a Tsunami Advisory has been issued for the entire U.S. West Coast and British Columbia. The situation is developing as authorities monitor the potential impact on coastal regions.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has announced it will formally recognize a Palestinian state by September unless Israel takes significant steps to end the conflict in Gaza. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated the move is intended to advance a two-state solution, which he described as being under threat. The conditions for Israel include agreeing to a ceasefire and allowing unrestricted humanitarian aid. The decision has drawn criticism from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called it a reward for terrorism.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency announced a proposal to revoke its 2009 "endangerment finding," the scientific basis for regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. Administrator Lee Zeldin described the move as a major deregulatory action, claiming it would save Americans billions annually by repealing emissions standards for vehicles and other sources. Critics have condemned the proposal, citing the overwhelming scientific evidence of climate change's threats and warning of severe public health and environmental consequences.

          <p>California's Attorney General Rob Bonta has proposed a "legal pathway" for Democrats to bypass the state's independent redistricting commission and present new congressional maps directly to voters. The move is framed as a countermeasure to potential Republican-led redistricting efforts in other states ahead of the midterm elections. Bonta suggested the state legislature could draw new maps and call a special election for voter approval. Republicans have criticized the proposal as an undemocratic power grab that would undermine the will of voters who established the independent commission.</p>

          <p>A sexual assault charity in Brighton, UK, at the center of a legal dispute over its gender inclusion policy has announced a new service exclusively for biological women. The decision comes after a woman sued the Survivors' Network because she felt unsafe in a support group that included a trans woman. In a joint agreement to settle the lawsuit, the charity will now run a new pilot group for biological women alongside its existing, trans-inclusive meetings. The move follows a UK Supreme Court ruling on single-sex services.</p>

          <p>The U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles has moved to dismiss charges in two high-profile cases shortly after the Trump administration extended the term of U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli. One case involves Andrew Wiederhorn, a Trump donor and ex-CEO of the company owning Fatburger, accused in a $47 million loan scheme. The other involves an L.A. County sheriff's deputy already convicted of excessive force. Critics allege the dismissals are politically motivated, as the prosecutor in the Wiederhorn case was previously fired at the White House's behest.</p>

          <p>A recent American Eagle ad featuring actress Sydney Sweeney has ignited a significant online controversy over its meaning. The ad, which plays on the words "jeans" and "genes," shows Sweeney discussing traits passed down from parents while modeling blue jeans. Some critics interpreted the ad's language about her "genes" as a coded reference to eugenics or white supremacist ideology. Conversely, right-wing commentators used the outrage to portray their opponents as overly sensitive. The incident highlights how cultural content is filtered through polarized lenses, creating self-perpetuating online discourse.</p>

The 27-year-old shooter, a former high school football player, requested his brain be studied for the degenerative disease, which is linked to repeated head trauma. CTE can cause mood swings, dementia, and violent behavior, but can only be diagnosed posthumously.
