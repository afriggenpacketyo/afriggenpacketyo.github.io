        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ten prisoners escaped from the Orleans Parish Jail in New Orleans, prompting a manhunt and raising questions about security lapses and potential inside assistance. The inmates broke out of their cell, removed a toilet from the wall to create an opening, and left taunting messages for the sheriff's office. One inmate was quickly apprehended, and officials believe the escape required help from within the facility, leading to an internal investigation and suspensions of sheriff's office employees. The escape has drawn criticism from local officials, who are concerned about the lack of immediate public notification and the potential danger to witnesses in the inmates' cases. </p>

          <p>Leaked audio from former President Joe Biden's interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur reveals Biden admitting he kept a classified document related to Afghanistan after his vice presidency, purportedly "for posterity's sake." Biden initially claimed he didn't recall why he had the document, which was found in his lake house library. The audio also contains moments where Biden appeared confused, struggling to remember dates such as his son's death and when he left office. The House Judiciary Committee had sued for the audio's release, arguing it provided important context to Hur's report, which described Biden as an "elderly man with a poor memory." </p>

          <p>Nissan Motor Co. is reportedly considering closing two plants in Kanagawa Prefecture, near Tokyo, as part of its restructuring plans. The potential closures involve Nissan's main Oppama plant, a pioneer in electric vehicle production, and the Shonan plant of its Nissan Shatai Co. unit, which builds commercial vehicles. These two plants account for approximately 30 percent of Nissan's domestic production capacity. The company announced earlier this week that it would shut down seven vehicle plants and cut 20,000 jobs globally after experiencing a net loss for fiscal year 2024. </p>

          <p>Despite facing a historically poor season with no wins in the first 13 games, the LA Galaxy has extended coach Greg Vanney's contract for three more years, through 2028. The team, currently the reigning MLS Cup champion, has struggled to replicate its success from the previous year, suffering multiple defeats. General Manager Will Kuntz stated that the decision to extend Vanney's contract was not influenced by the team's current performance, but rather by his leadership and past achievements, including the 2024 championship. The Galaxy faces rival LAFC in a crucial match this Sunday. </p>

          <p>Michelle Goldberg reflects on the Democratic Party's missteps in addressing concerns about Joe Biden's fitness for office. She argues that many Democrats were in denial about Biden's decline, influenced by groupthink, inertia, and risk aversion. Goldberg suggests that the party's leaders need to grapple with their collective failure and be honest about what they got wrong. She notes that while some close associates may have hidden the worst of Biden's condition, it was evident to many voters that he was too old to run for re-election. </p>

          <p>Donald Trump accused former FBI Director James Comey of calling for his assassination through a coded social media post featuring seashells arranged to spell the numbers 8647. The Secret Service launched an investigation into the post, which Comey claimed was simply a political message and that he didn't realize it could be associated with violence. Trump insisted that Comey knew exactly what the numbers meant and that it was a clear call for assassination. The exchanges highlight ongoing tensions over inflamed political rhetoric. </p>

Moody's lowered the US rating from 'AAA' to 'Aa1,' noting that successive administrations had failed to reverse ballooning deficits. The White House responded by blaming the previous administration for the "mess." A lower credit rating typically leads to higher borrowing costs for countries. </p>
