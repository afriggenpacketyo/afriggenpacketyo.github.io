          <p>Toyota Industries' shares experienced a significant drop after the Toyota Group announced a $33 billion deal to take the company private, reflecting investor concerns about the offer's attractiveness. The deal involves creating a new holding company with investments from various Toyota entities and external financing from major banks. This move aligns with a broader trend in Japan where firms face pressure to unwind cross-shareholding ties. Despite negotiations, the offer price was considered below the valuation range suggested by independent financial advisors, leading to reservations among some analysts. Optimism for the stock is currently tempered by the market's reaction to the buyout terms.</p>

The WE League is collaborating with the J-League to acquire sponsors and stabilize its financial base.
