          <p>Tesla's stock experienced a significant rebound, its best day since November 2024, following nine consecutive weeks of decline.

          <p>The Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court to block a lower court's order reinstating thousands of terminated federal probationary employees.  The administration argues the lower court overstepped its authority and that the proper channels for challenging terminations were not followed.
