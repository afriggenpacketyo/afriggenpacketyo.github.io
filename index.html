          <p>A piece of a meteorite that crashed through the roof of a home near Atlanta has been identified by a University of Georgia geologist as being 4.56 billion years old, predating the Earth itself. The fragment originated from an asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and created a small crater in the homeowner's floor upon impact. Scientists are studying the object to better understand the early solar system and assess risks from larger celestial bodies, providing insight into planetary formation.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested at least 365 people at a demonstration in Parliament Square for showing support for Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed under UK anti-terrorism laws. The protest saw attendees display signs with messages like "I support Palestine Action," leading to their immediate arrest. The government defended the ban, citing the group's history of serious criminal attacks, while protesters argued it infringes on freedom of speech and democratic rights, highlighting a tense clash over activism and national security.</p>

Initially a backdrop for love stories, the rise of militancy in the late 1980s shifted the narrative to themes of patriotism and national security. More recent films, such as "The Kashmir Files" and "Article 370," are described as reflecting government narratives, sparking debate over their one-sided portrayals and potential to deepen societal divides.</p>

          <p>Six Lebanese soldiers were killed in an explosion at a Hezbollah weapons depot in southern Lebanon near the Israeli border. The soldiers were inspecting the facility and dismantling its contents as part of a UN-backed ceasefire agreement with Israel. The incident occurred in the Tyre district, a region where the Lebanese army has been working to dismantle unauthorized military infrastructure. The blast highlights the dangers involved in the disarmament process and the volatile security situation in the area.</p>

          <h2>Mediterranean Sea Faces Mounting Environmental Crises from Pollution and Overfishing</h2>

          <p>The Mediterranean Sea is grappling with severe environmental challenges, including massive plastic pollution, overfishing by industrial trawlers, and sewage discharge, which are devastating marine ecosystems and local economies. Fishermen from Libya to Egypt report drastically reduced catches, finding their nets filled with plastic instead of fish. While nations are proposing plans for coastal protection and better monitoring, local fishermen and activists remain skeptical, arguing that promises are not translating into effective action to save their livelihoods and the sea itself.</p>

          <h2>A Historical Look at the Rise of Partisan Gerrymandering in the U.S.</h2>

          <p>This article provides a historical overview of how partisan gerrymandering, particularly the Republican-led "Redmap" project after 2010, has reshaped American politics. By targeting and winning key state legislative races, the GOP was able to redraw congressional and state-level maps to entrench their power for a decade, often winning majorities of seats with fewer overall votes. The piece explains how this strategy, combined with advanced technology and a 2019 Supreme Court decision that limited federal oversight, has led to an era of extreme partisan maps.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly presented a posthumous award to a U.S. envoy intended for the son of a senior CIA official who was killed while fighting for Russia in Ukraine. The award, a Soviet-era Order of Lenin, was for 21-year-old Michael Gloss, whose mother is a deputy director at the CIA. Gloss, who reportedly suffered from mental health issues, had enlisted with Russian forces in 2023. The gesture occurred as U.S. and Russian officials prepare for a high-stakes summit on the Ukraine war.</p>

          <p>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans has detailed a "point system" to determine payouts for survivors of clergy sexual abuse as part of a proposed bankruptcy settlement. Court documents show different point values assigned based on the severity of the abuse, such as 75 points for sexual assault and 10 for being shown pornography. The final monetary value of each point remains unknown, and the plan requires approval from two-thirds of the voting survivors, a threshold that may not be met.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has subpoenaed New York Attorney General Letitia James to testify regarding her civil fraud investigation into President Donald Trump. This move is seen by James's office and her supporters as a politically motivated act of retribution by the Trump administration. James successfully sued Trump and his organization for fraudulently overvaluing assets, a case he is currently appealing. Her office condemned the subpoena as a "weaponization of the justice system," highlighting the escalating political and legal battles.</p>

          <p>Newly released documents reveal that a Royal Navy nuclear weapons base at Coulport, Scotland, leaked radioactive water into a loch due to burst pipes. The files, obtained after a six-year freedom of information battle, show that the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) cited "shortfalls in maintenance" for the incidents. One leak in 2019 resulted in the release of low levels of tritium. While the MoD and Sepa state there was no unsafe release or significant environmental risk, the findings raise concerns about the maintenance of UK nuclear facilities.</p>

          <p>A growing faction of the Democratic party is advocating for a more aggressive, "fight fire with fire" approach to counter Republican political tactics, particularly gerrymandering. Spurred by a new Republican push to redraw the Texas congressional map, Democratic leaders like California Governor Gavin Newsom are threatening to retaliate with their own partisan map-drawing. This marks a significant shift from past rhetoric about "going high," reflecting a belief that democracy is under an existential threat and requires a more combative response to level the playing field.</p>

          <p>An abandoned 19th-century college campus in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood has been transformed into a 205-unit luxury apartment building called The Hartby. Developers spent over $100 million to renovate the historic St. John's College site, which had been deteriorating for decades. The project preserved original architectural elements while adding modern amenities and a new wing. The development includes 62 affordable housing units alongside market-rate apartments, revitalizing the landmark while providing income for the adjacent church that owns the land.</p>

          <p>Several German cities have offered to take in and treat sick or traumatized children from Gaza, but the federal government is reluctant to approve the plan. Government ministries cite security concerns and a preference for providing aid on the ground. However, critics suggest the hesitation stems from fears of sparking a new wave of immigration and political pressure from the far-right. The debate has caused friction within the ruling coalition, contrasting with other European nations like Italy and Spain that have already evacuated children for medical care.</p>

          <p>William H. Webster, the only person to have served as director of both the FBI and the CIA, has died at the age of 101. Known for his integrity, Webster was appointed to lead the FBI in 1978 to restore its reputation after a period of scandal, and later took over the CIA in 1987 in the wake of the Iran-Contra affair. A former federal judge, he was widely credited with stabilizing both agencies and improving their public standing through his non-partisan leadership, leaving a significant mark on U.S. intelligence.</p>
