          <p>HS2 Ltd, the company constructing the high-speed rail line between London and Birmingham, is investigating two firms supplying construction staff for the West Midlands section due to alleged misclassification of staff and inflated billing rates. The investigation, initiated earlier this year and first reported by the i newspaper, involves Balfour Beatty Vinci, one of HS2's contractors, which has implemented additional monitoring and controls. A Department for Transport spokesman said the government and HS2 "take all whistleblower allegations extremely seriously and have a zero-tolerance attitude towards fraud, bribery, and corruption". Work continues on the London-Birmingham section, with a majority of tunneling completed, while plans for a new rail line linking Greater Manchester and the West Midlands, relying on private investment, are being developed by regional mayors.</p>

Floyd's family gathered near his gravesite in Houston for a service led by Rev Al Sharpton, while Minneapolis hosted commemorations, including a church service and gospel concert at George Floyd Square. Rev Sharpton emphasized the need to continue pushing for changes begun after Floyd's death, urging President Donald Trump to maintain federal police reform agreements. The murder of Floyd sparked global outrage and a wave of demonstrations against racial injustice and police use of force; Chauvin is currently serving a 22-year prison sentence for the crime.</p>

While some experts believe AI systems could soon achieve consciousness, others, like Prof Anil Seth, argue that associating consciousness solely with intelligence and language is a human-centric view. Google suspended an engineer in 2022 who claimed AI chatbots could feel, highlighting the growing debate within the tech sector. The article explores the complexities of defining consciousness and the potential societal impacts of believing machines could possess it, including the risk of moral corrosion and altered human relationships.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly criticized President Putin‚Äôs recent escalation of attacks on Ukraine, expressing his unhappiness with the situation and stating that he is considering imposing further sanctions on Russia. Speaking to reporters, Trump noted that the attacks are occurring even as the two countries are in the midst of negotiations for a cease-fire agreement. Russia carried out one of its largest drone and missile barrages of the war on Ukraine overnight, killing at least 12 people and injuring dozens across the country. On Sunday, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine condemned Russia‚Äôs attacks in a social media post, and said they warranted punishment.</p>

          <p>Ministers are facing calls to resume processing Syrian asylum applications, with over 7,000 people in the UK uncertain about their status following a pause in decisions after the fall of President Bashar al-Assad. Charities like the Refugee Council advocate for case-by-case assessments, citing the indefinite limbo and its impact on taxpayers who fund accommodation for asylum seekers. The government defends the pause, citing the lack of stable information to assess risks for those returning to Syria, now under the interim presidency of HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa. A total of 7,386 Syrians were waiting for an initial decision on an asylum claim by the end of March, according to the latest figures published on Thursday.</p>

          <p>Data from the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes reveal that small dwarf galaxies played a crucial role in bringing light to the early Universe, clearing the murky hydrogen fog that filled intergalactic space. These dwarf galaxies, though small, were surprisingly bright and abundant, collectively emitting enough energy to ionize the gas and allow light to shine through. Researchers analyzed data from a galaxy cluster called Abell 2744, using its gravitational lensing effect to observe these distant galaxies. This discovery challenges previous assumptions that large galaxies and black holes were the primary sources of reionization, offering new insights into the Universe's early evolution.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's tariffs are posing a significant threat to European winemakers, particularly those in Burgundy, France, as the US is their largest export market. Trump initially imposed a 20% tariff on European Union products, later reducing it to 10% with a potential increase back to 20% in July, and now threatens a 50% tariff on all goods from the EU. The Burgundy Wine Board, representing 3,500 winemakers, notes that the US market was booming before Trump's re-election, with sales of Burgundy wines rising sharply. Winemakers fear a return to the 2019 situation when a 25% import tariff caused a 50% drop in exports to the US, highlighting the precarious position of the industry under the current trade climate.</p>

Brussels and Washington have been negotiating to avoid a trade war sparked by Trump's April announcement that he would slap tariffs on most of the US' trading partners. The bloc, which Trump has repeatedly accused of having "taken advantage" of the US, has been hit with three rounds of tariffs: a 25% tax on imports of steel and aluminum and cars, a 20% "reciprocal" tariff on all imports, which has been lifted while trade talks are ongoing. A "universal" baseline 10% tariff, however, remains in place.</p>
