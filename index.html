          <p>The Federal Reserve's latest "Beige Book" report reveals that the U.S. economy experienced a slight contraction over the past six weeks, with hiring slowing and concerns rising among consumers and businesses about tariff-related price increases. All districts reported elevated levels of economic and policy uncertainty, leading to hesitancy in business and household decisions. Hiring remained mostly flat, with lower labor demand indicated by declining hours worked, hiring pauses, and staff reduction plans. The report also noted that prices are rising at a moderate pace, with widespread expectations of faster cost increases due to higher tariff rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to shift Greenland from U.S. European Command to U.S. Northern Command, signaling a strategic view of Greenland as integral to U.S. homeland defense. Top Trump officials have urged Greenland to separate from Denmark and align with the U.S. for security, citing underinvestment by Denmark in Greenland's infrastructure and security. President Trump has expressed interest in acquiring Greenland due to its strategic importance and rare earth minerals, needed for electronics. However, most Greenlanders oppose joining the U.S., preferring to remain part of the Kingdom of Denmark.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has raised tariffs on aluminum and steel to 50%, a move that experts predict will increase costs for a wide range of consumer products, including cars, sports equipment, and canned goods. While some businesses may absorb the increased costs, many are expected to pass them on to consumers through higher prices. Automobile manufacturers, for example, are likely to feel the impact due to their heavy reliance on steel and aluminum, potentially increasing the cost of a car by hundreds or even thousands of dollars. The tariffs are intended to reduce America's reliance on foreign nations, but experts warn of potential harm to industries and consumers.</p>

The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office released a report on Wednesday saying that Trump’s “one big, beautiful bill” would decrease federal revenues by $3.67tn while cutting spending by $1.25tn through 2034, as the national debt currently stands at $36tn.</p>

The removal of the $1.95 trillion asset cap allows the bank to grow its deposit base, invest in high-growth lines of business, and lower compliance costs. The bank has missed out on an estimated $400 billion in deposits over the past seven years due to the cap. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the New York City Democratic mayoral primary approaching, former Governor Andrew Cuomo is vying for a comeback after resigning amid allegations of sexual harassment and inappropriate conduct. Cuomo faces competition from Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic Socialist candidate gaining traction with progressive policies. While incumbent Mayor Eric Adams is running as an independent, the Democratic primary winner is likely to become the next mayor. Cuomo's name recognition and past record contribute to his favorable polling, while Mamdani's populist appeal and DSA support make him a candidate to watch.</p>

Kennedy Jr. plans to require American medical schools to offer nutrition courses or risk losing federal funding from the Department of Health and Human Services. Kennedy expressed concern that medical schools focus on treating illnesses with drugs rather than preventing them with food. While some medical schools claim to already offer sufficient nutrition education, a 2015 study indicated that medical students spend an average of only 19 hours on required nutrition education.

          <p>New research indicates that higher temperatures caused by climate change are exacerbating droughts by creating a "thirstier" atmosphere. This phenomenon drives complex processes that make droughts more severe and widespread. The research highlights that it's not just a lack of rain causing droughts, but also the increased evaporative demand due to rising temperatures. The findings underscore the need to address climate change to mitigate the impacts of droughts on water resources and ecosystems.</p>

The court argues that if the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) is unable to fulfill its role due to Trump's actions, federal courts should step in and hear cases brought by illegally fired civil servants. This proposal aims to close a legal loophole that has left federal employees vulnerable, and it challenges the Supreme Court's embrace of the "unitary executive" theory, which has enabled Trump to fire officials with civil service protections.</p>
