          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and US President Donald Trump reportedly discussed reviving the Keystone XL pipeline during a recent meeting. The project, which would transport oil from Alberta to the US, was previously blocked by the Obama and Biden administrations. Trump expressed receptiveness, prompting both leaders to instruct their teams to continue discussions. Alberta's Premier welcomed the news, viewing provincial oil as key to renegotiating the North American free trade agreement.</p>

          <p>Federal investigators determined the devastating Palisades Fire was a "holdover" from an intentionally set Lachman Fire on New Year's Day, which smoldered underground before rekindling. This revelation raises critical questions about whether the Los Angeles Fire Department could have done more to prevent the catastrophic reignition, particularly given warnings about extreme weather. Critics point to the LAFD's decision not to pre-deploy additional engines despite past practices, prompting calls for an examination into the department's response protocols.</p>

          <p>Chelsea Women drew 1-1 with Twente in their Champions League opener, a result that former England forward Lianne Sanderson believes will lead to "questions" for manager Sonia Bompastor. Despite being favorites, Chelsea's "disjointed" performance, attributed to seven changes in the starting XI, yielded only one goal from numerous opportunities. Sanderson suggested Bompastor "took Twente lightly" and made the "wrong team selection," highlighting the pressure on Chelsea to secure a maiden European trophy. The team's inability to convert chances was a key issue.</p>
