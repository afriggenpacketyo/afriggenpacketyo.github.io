          <h2>Hunter Biden Attributes Father's 2024 Debate Issues to Ambien Use</h2>

          <p>Hunter Biden has claimed his father's poor performance in the June 2024 presidential debate was due to taking the sedative Ambien to sleep after extensive travel. This statement revisits the period when the Trump campaign challenged then-President Biden to take a drug test, an accusation the Biden campaign dismissed as false lies. The article contextualizes this new claim within the broader narrative of concerns over the former president's mental acuity and the political fallout from the debate, which many allies saw as a turning point in the election cycle. Hunter Biden also directed harsh criticism at Democrats who called for his father to withdraw from the race.</p>

          <p>Senator Mike Lee of Utah reportedly shared a fake, AI-generated letter on social media announcing the resignation of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The post, which included siren emojis and the text "Powell's out!", was quickly deleted after journalists noted inconsistencies like a garbled Fed seal. According to a reporter, Senator Lee stated he removed the post "out of an abundance of caution" as he was unsure of the letter's legitimacy. The incident occurred amidst ongoing criticism of Powell by President Trump, who has been urging the Fed to lower interest rates.</p>

          <h2>General Motors Affirms Yearly Guidance Despite $1.1 Billion Tariff Impact in Second Quarter</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>General Motors reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations, though the company's profits were significantly affected by trade tariffs. CFO Paul Jacobson confirmed that tariffs cost the automaker $1.1 billion in the quarter, contributing to a decline in its North America profit margin from 10.9% to 6.1% year-over-year. Despite this, GM affirmed its full-year guidance, which anticipates a total tariff impact of $4 to $5 billion, and is working on strategies to mitigate these costs. The company also noted a potential rush on EV sales before federal tax credits expire. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Delta Air Lines flight bound for Atlanta was forced to abruptly halt its takeoff at Mexico City's international airport when an Aeromexico jet landed on the same runway directly in its path. The Delta Boeing 737 had reached a speed of about 71 miles per hour before the pilots executed an emergency stop to avoid a collision. The flight, carrying 150 people, returned to the gate and later departed safely for its destination. Delta is cooperating with U.S. and Mexican authorities who are now investigating the serious runway incursion incident.</p>

This move marks the second time the U.S. has left the agency under President Trump, who previously withdrew in 2017 before the Biden administration rejoined.

          <p>Life sciences firm Danaher reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, with revenue increasing 3.5% to $5.94 billion.

Despite the mixed geographic results and a stock that has struggled, management raised its full-year earnings-per-share forecast, signaling confidence in its cost-saving initiatives and underlying business strength.

          <p>England's players and substitutes stood arm-in-arm on the touchline before their Euro 2025 semi-final against Italy in a powerful show of solidarity. The gesture was in support of their teammate Jess Carter, who has been the target of online racist abuse throughout the tournament. This action followed the team's recent announcement that they would no longer take the knee, stating the gesture's impact was insufficient and a different approach was needed to combat racism. During the match, fans also applauded in the 16th minute, corresponding to Carter's jersey number, to show their support.</p>

          <p>Spinner Liam Dawson is set to make his first appearance for the England Test cricket team in eight years for the crucial fourth Test against India. Dawson's recall comes after fellow spinner Shoaib Bashir was ruled out with a finger injury sustained in the previous match. The article contrasts the two players, highlighting the 35-year-old Dawson's extensive first-class experience compared to the much younger Bashir, who was a surprise selection. Dawson's inclusion as an all-rounder is expected to significantly strengthen England's batting lineup as they aim to secure a series victory against India.</p>

Television production was a lone bright spot, increasing by 17%, though overall activity remains well below the region's five-year average.
