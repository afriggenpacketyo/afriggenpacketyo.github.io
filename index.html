        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House East Wing has been largely demolished to accommodate President Trump's planned 90,000-square-foot ballroom, now estimated to cost $300 million. Initially, Trump stated the project would not affect the existing structure, but an administration official later confirmed a full modernization of the East Wing was necessary for a stable and beautiful structure. The controversial construction is reportedly financed by Trump himself and a list of corporate and individual donors, including major tech giants like Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft. This development has generated significant public criticism regarding the project's scale, cost, and the transparency of its funding, especially given the ongoing federal government shutdown.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker signed an executive order establishing the Illinois Accountability Commission to document alleged civil rights abuses by federal immigration enforcement agents. Pritzker asserts that ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers are conducting "unlawful attacks" under Operation Midway Blitz, targeting individuals based on race and using excessive force against peaceful protesters. The commission, chaired by former Chief Judge Ruben Castillo, will create a public record of these incidents, capture their impact on communities, and recommend measures to ensure federal accountability. This move underscores a growing tension between state and federal authorities regarding immigration enforcement, with Illinois actively pursuing legal avenues against perceived overreach.</p>

          <p>Meta is transitioning to artificial intelligence for its FTC-mandated privacy compliance reviews, resulting in layoffs within its risk organization. The company’s chief privacy officer announced these job reductions, indicating a shift towards automating the assessment and documentation of product risks to ensure global regulatory adherence. This internal restructuring follows a $5 billion fine from the Federal Trade Commission, which prompted Meta to overhaul its privacy approach. The company emphasizes that its revamped system relies on basic automation to reduce human error and increase reliability, rather than advanced generative AI. This strategic move aligns with a wider industry trend where major companies are increasingly adopting AI technologies to enhance efficiency and reduce workforce size.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James is challenging criminal charges against her, contending that the U.S. Attorney in eastern Virginia, Lindsey Halligan, was unlawfully appointed. James, who faces charges of bank fraud and making false statements, argues Halligan's appointment by Donald Trump and her lack of prosecutorial experience raise serious questions about the indictment's legitimacy. This legal strategy comes as former FBI Director James Comey is also challenging Halligan's appointment in a related case, both men being critics of Trump. The ongoing legal battles underscore concerns about potential political weaponization of the justice system and the proper protocols for federal prosecutor appointments, as oral arguments for Comey's challenge are already scheduled.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued a pardon for Changpeng Zhao, the founder of cryptocurrency exchange Binance, who previously pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering. The White House justified the pardon by criticizing the Biden administration's stance on cryptocurrency, asserting that Zhao faced no allegations of fraud or identifiable victims. Senator Elizabeth Warren, however, vehemently condemned the pardon as an act of "corruption," suggesting a link to Zhao's alleged support for Trump's crypto ventures and his lobbying efforts for clemency. Zhao, who had agreed to a $4.3 billion settlement and a four-month jail sentence, expressed deep gratitude, vowing to contribute to making America a global leader in the crypto and Web3 industries.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Attorney for Maryland, Kelly Hayes, has reportedly informed Department of Justice superiors that she believes there is insufficient evidence to indict Senator Adam Schiff for mortgage fraud. This assessment contradicts President Trump's public demands for the criminal prosecution of Schiff, a staunch critic and key figure in Trump's first impeachment. While Hayes, an experienced prosecutor, conveyed her doubts, a controversial senior DOJ official, Ed Martin, is reportedly advocating for the continuation of the investigation. Senator Schiff has consistently labeled the allegations as "transparently false" and a politically motivated attempt to silence his opposition, raising significant concerns about potential undue influence within the justice system.</p>

Lawyers representing the academic who initiated the case asserted that Apple generated exorbitant profits by eliminating competition in app distribution and in-app purchases.

These actions include blacklisting 23 Chinese institutions, announcing new tariffs on goods like kitchen cabinets, extending export controls to potentially thousands of Chinese subsidiaries, and imposing port fees on Chinese-listed vessels.

          <p>Oil prices experienced a sharp increase of over 5% following the Trump administration's imposition of additional sanctions on Russia's two largest crude oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. The Treasury Secretary justified these measures by citing Moscow's "lack of serious commitment to a peace process to end the war in Ukraine." White House officials indicated the sanctions were partly a response to the collapse of a proposed meeting between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. These actions are intended to diminish the Kremlin's ability to fund its war in Ukraine, contributing to global market volatility and exacerbating existing trade tensions, despite efforts by OPEC+ to increase oil production.

          <p>A Colorado woman, Elizabeth Ann Davis, 61, has been convicted of voter fraud for illegally casting mail ballots for her late ex-husband and son in the 2022 general election. Davis was found guilty of two counts of forgery and one count of impersonating an elector, offenses that carry a potential sentence of up to three years in prison. Prosecutors underscored that while voter fraud is generally uncommon, the nation's election processes include robust safeguards, such as mandatory ballot signatures, to detect such illicit activities. The District Attorney's office affirmed its commitment to prosecuting individuals who attempt to undermine election integrity, even through a single fraudulent vote.</p>

          <p>Gold prices recently experienced a significant 6% drop, marking the largest single-day decline in over a decade, which is prompting investors to reconsider purchasing the metal. Despite the current price of $4,131.47 per ounce remaining relatively high, this dip offers a more affordable entry point for those interested in gold investments, including from major retailers like Costco. The article suggests that buying during such temporary price declines is often a sound strategy, as gold prices historically rebound. Costco provides a flexible and vetted option for acquiring physical bullion, potentially offering easier resale and avoiding shipping costs, though consumers should note that all gold sales from the retailer are final.

          <p>Violent clashes are escalating in Lebanon, igniting fears of renewed conflict, nearly a year after a fragile ceasefire was established between Israel and the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia. Recent Israeli airstrikes targeted an alleged Hezbollah training camp and killed a commander, contributing to hundreds of casualties since the ceasefire began. Both Israel and Hezbollah accuse each other of violating the agreement's terms, which included Israeli troop withdrawal and Hezbollah's disarmament. Lebanon continues to grapple with a profound political vacuum and an economic crisis, with international aid contingent on economic reforms and Hezbollah's demilitarization. Experts warn that this unstable "lessfire" situation could serve as a dangerous model for other regional conflicts.</p>

          <p>Home equity loan interest rates are currently near a two-year low, averaging 8.11% for a 5-year loan, making them an attractive option for homeowners amidst economic uncertainties. This rate presents a significantly more affordable borrowing alternative compared to personal loans or credit cards, which carry much higher interest rates. The article advises that waiting for potential future rate cuts from the Federal Reserve may not be beneficial, as any reductions are expected to be minimal. By securing a low, fixed home equity loan rate now, homeowners can access needed funds and protect themselves from potential future rate increases, with the flexibility to refinance if rates substantially decline.

          <p>Electric vehicle manufacturer Rivian is laying off over 600 employees, representing about 4.5% of its workforce, to conserve cash amidst a significant slowdown in EV demand. This move comes shortly after the expiration of federal tax credits for electric vehicles and is exacerbated by the Trump administration's reversal of Biden-era EV incentives. CEO RJ Scaringe attributed the layoffs to a "changing operating backdrop," necessitating a restructuring of go-to-market functions. The situation underscores broader challenges within the EV industry, including market saturation and affordability issues, prompting companies like Rivian and Tesla to re-evaluate production and pricing strategies in a more competitive and less incentivized environment.
