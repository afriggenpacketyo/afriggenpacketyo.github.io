          <p>Federal and state authorities in Utah are continuing their search for the suspect who fatally shot conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a university event. Investigators have released images of a person of interest and have recovered a high-powered, bolt-action rifle believed to be the weapon used in the attack. Officials have tracked the shooter's movements, indicating the suspect arrived on campus, proceeded to a rooftop, fired a single shot, and then fled into a nearby neighborhood. A reward of up to $100,000 is being offered for information leading to an arrest in what is being described as a targeted assassination.</p>

          <p>The Philippine government has strongly condemned a new Chinese plan concerning the contested Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea, viewing it as a thinly veiled attempt at occupation. Philippine National Security Adviser Eduardo Ano described the move as a "clear pretext towards eventual occupation" rather than a genuine effort to protect the marine environment. In response, China's foreign ministry asserted its sovereign right to safeguard the area's ecological system and urged the Philippines to cease what it called provocative actions. The Philippines intends to file a formal diplomatic protest against the plan.</p>

The ministry urged Mexico to "think twice before acting," emphasizing the importance of their trade partnership and expressing unwillingness to see it damaged. This development occurs amid ongoing global trade tensions and as Chinese auto manufacturers have been increasing their investments and exports to Mexico, which benefits from tariff-free trade with the U.S. under the USMCA agreement.</p>

          <p>The fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University has intensified the national conversation about security and free expression on college campuses. Security experts and university officials are re-evaluating the balance between maintaining an open environment for debate and ensuring the physical safety of speakers and attendees. The incident has raised concerns about a potential "assassin's veto," where the threat of violence could be used to silence controversial viewpoints.

          <p>Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has been sentenced to 27 years and three months in prison after being convicted of leading a conspiracy to stage a military coup. The Supreme Court found him guilty of attempting to illegally retain power following his 2022 election loss to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The ruling, which also bars him from public office until 2033, has drawn criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump. Bolsonaro's lawyers have called the sentence excessive and plan to appeal, though legal experts suggest this will be difficult.</p>

The organization is presented as an embodiment of multilateral principles that can help prevent further global fragmentation.

His opening statement consisted of philosophical musings, leading the judge to reprimand him for making a mockery of the court and ultimately cutting his remarks short. Prosecutors laid out their case, stating they would use cellphone data, security footage, and eyewitness testimony to prove the plot was carefully planned. The first witness, a Secret Service agent, testified about discovering Routh hiding with an AK-style weapon at Trump's golf course.</p>

          <p>Teaching unions in the United Kingdom are raising alarms as an increasing number of children are starting primary school without essential developmental skills. A survey of over 1,000 teachers revealed that many reception-class students are not toilet-trained and lack the ability to speak in full sentences. Nine out of ten respondents noted a decline in speech and language abilities among new students over the past two years, a trend partly attributed to social isolation and increased screen time.

          <p>For parents struggling with children who are fussy eaters, a common developmental stage, a child nutritionist offers practical advice to make mealtimes less stressful.

The expert also recommends avoiding labeling foods as "good" or "bad" to foster a healthier long-term relationship with food. Other tips include making mealtime a fun, engaging experience and getting children involved in food preparation to encourage familiarity and adventurousness.</p>

The article notes the incorporation of Asian and Middle Eastern instruments like the sitar and tabla, particularly on tracks like "Sapphire," a duet with Indian superstar Arjit Singh. However, the review suggests these global influences are often assimilated into Sheeran's familiar, frictionless pop style rather than defining the songs. While the album contains some raw and adventurous moments, it largely retreats to the safety of his established formula of love ballads and radio-friendly hits.</p>

          <p>South Africa's Constitutional Court has struck down an apartheid-era law, ruling that husbands now have the right to take their wives' family names upon marriage. The court found the previous legislation, which only allowed women to change their surnames, was discriminatory on the basis of gender and a "colonial import." The ruling noted that in many traditional African cultures, women retained their birth names. The government has been given two years to amend the Births and Deaths Registration Act to reflect the landmark decision for gender equality.</p>

          <p>Recent significant gains in China's $12 trillion stock market are presenting a challenge for regulators in Beijing. The government aims to foster a stable, sustainable bull market that can increase household wealth and support consumer spending, avoiding the wild boom-and-bust cycles of the past. By guiding a more measured ascent, authorities hope to shift wealth from the property market and boost the broader economy. While recent volatility may be a concern, analysts believe the overall upward trend remains intact as China transitions toward a slower, more manageable bull market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Southern Water has prohibited tanker companies from extracting its water to supply the estate of American billionaire Stephen Schwarzman, after it was used to help fill a new lake. The practice was legal, as the water was taken from an area in Hampshire for construction purposes not covered by a local hosepipe ban. However, the water utility's managing director said he was "appalled by this use of water" following complaints and documentation from local residents who tracked the tankers. The estate's owner stated the water was sourced through licensed providers and complied with all regulations.</p>

Struthers had served as the administrative director for the Kennedy Center's celebrated jazz programming. The move has created uncertainty about the future of jazz at the prominent D.C. arts institution, which has seen its mainstage jazz schedule reduced significantly.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have successfully voted to change chamber rules, a move often called the "nuclear option," to speed up the confirmation of President Trump's nominees. The new rule allows for non-cabinet level executive branch nominees to be considered in batches rather than through individual votes, effectively curtailing the minority party's ability to delay the process. Majority Leader John Thune argued the change was necessary to restore standard practice and allow the president to get his team in place. Democrats, however, criticized the move as an act of capitulation to the executive branch.</p>

The author argues that when a society replaces civil debate with violence, it is no longer capable of self-governance.
