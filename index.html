            <p>US envoy Steve Witkoff met with Vladimir Putin in St Petersburg to discuss a potential settlement in Ukraine, as Donald Trump urges Russia to expedite ceasefire negotiations. The Kremlin described the four-hour meeting as productive, while Trump expressed frustration over the slow pace of talks and emphasized the high death toll in the ongoing conflict. Meanwhile, Ukraine's President Zelensky accused the Kremlin of prolonging the war and alleged the presence of Chinese nationals fighting with the Russian army. European nations have pledged additional military aid to Kyiv, but defense ministers see no end in sight to the conflict.</p>

            <p>The UK government is contemplating nationalizing British Steel to prevent its collapse, as the company faces financial difficulties and potential closure. Parliament is being recalled for an emergency session to grant the business secretary the power to intervene, including buying coal to keep the furnaces burning. While the Chinese owners remain shareholders for now, the government acknowledges the need to preserve domestic steel production for infrastructure projects and national security. Nationalization is seen as a possible solution to ensure the UK remains a G7 country with primary steel-making capability.</p>

            <p>American, European, and German business chambers in China are expressing concerns over the escalating trade war with the United States, fearing long-lasting negative impacts. American firms anticipate that higher tariffs will harm consumers globally, as many companies rely on the flow of goods between the US and China. A former chair of AmCham China criticized the Trump administration's tariff approach, arguing that threats and bullying will not help American businesses gain greater market access. The chambers emphasize the importance of negotiation and alternative measures to manage trade disputes in the best interest of both countries.</p>

            <p>SenseTime, a Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) company, plans to significantly expand its computing power in the next two years to capitalize on the growing demand for generative AI models. The company aims to increase its computing power by a high double-digit to triple-digit percentage annually. This expansion includes increasing the adoption of home-grown chips to mitigate risks from the ongoing US-China tech war. SenseTime recently launched an upgraded version of its SenseCore AI infrastructure, featuring better performance and industry-wide solutions.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has decided to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of Afghans in the U.S., potentially leading to their deportation starting May 20. The decision was based on a review of conditions in Afghanistan, with the DHS Secretary determining that the country no longer meets the requirements for TPS designation. This move has been criticized by advocates who argue that conditions in Afghanistan have worsened, not improved, and that it undermines America's commitment to its allies.</p>

            <p>Experts warn that a prolonged US-China trade war could have devastating consequences for Africa if China's economy falters. The US tariff policy could significantly impact African exports, particularly from resource-rich countries like South Africa and Nigeria. While the US runs large trade deficits with Africa's top commodity exporters, overall US-Africa trade remains relatively small compared to US trade with other regions. Some African nations that benefit from the US African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) could also be seriously affected by the trade war.</p>

            <p>Southern California Edison (Edison) is investigating the possibility that an idle transmission line somehow reenergized and caused the destructive Eaton fire. Edison is taking precautions to harden other idle towers and lines to prevent similar incidents. Evidence suggests that induction, where the magnetic field of an active line induces current in an unconnected line, may have caused the fire. Edison is revising its internal manual to provide more uniform grounding procedures for idle equipment, and conducting field inspections to ensure proper grounding.</p>

The justices declined to block a lower court's order to "facilitate" bringing back Kilmar Abrego Garcia, but noted that the lower court may have exceeded its authority. The government conceded that Mr. Garcia was deported due to an "administrative error," although they allege he is a member of the MS-13 gang, which his lawyer denies. A judge has ordered daily updates on the efforts to release Garcia.</p>
