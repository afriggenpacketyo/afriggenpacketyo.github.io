            <p>The United States and Iran held negotiations in Oman concerning Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program, marking the first round of talks between the two nations since President Trump returned to the White House. The White House described the discussions as "very positive and constructive," emphasizing that Envoy Witkoff had instructions from President Trump to resolve differences through dialogue and diplomacy. The talks addressed sanctions relief and enrichment, with Iran seeking to limit its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. A second round of discussions is scheduled for next week, mediated by Oman. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has exempted smartphones, computers, and other electronics from escalating trade war tariffs with China. This decision aims to protect American consumers from price increases on commonly used high-tech products, which would have potentially impacted the cost of iPhones and other devices. The exemption follows China's announcement of increased tariffs on U.S. goods, and the move is intended to encourage tech companies to onshore their manufacturing in the United States. However, these electronics are still subject to the 20% tariff on China related to fentanyl. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>While Apple's iPhone and other technology hardware have been granted a China tariff reprieve by President Trump, the 145% tariffs being imposed on Chinese imports will soon cause irreversible damage to many American businesses. Canceled freight orders and abandoned freight from China are becoming the norm, with furniture, toys, apparel, footwear, and sports equipment industries experiencing a halt in orders. Economists warn that the tariffs will halt most trade between the U.S. and China, leading to product shortages and lost sales. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A company claiming to have created "the world's first successfully de-extincted animal", the dire wolf, has sparked debate about the ethics of resurrecting extinct species. Critics argue that resources would be better spent on saving existing endangered animals. The dire wolf project also raises questions about the welfare of the animals, as they lack kin and a natural habitat. The article questions whether de-extinction undermines conservation efforts and diverts resources from more pressing needs.</p>

            <p>California's sea lion population is facing a severe threat from a toxic algae bloom, causing domoic acid poisoning and overwhelming animal rescue teams. SeaWorld's rescue team has seen a dramatic increase in sea lion rescues due to the bloom, which has sickened hundreds of marine animals. The rescue team has doubled its staff to manage the surge in calls and rescues, which have been receiving roughly 100 calls a day for several weeks. Warming oceans fueled by climate crisis have long been shown to contribute to extreme algae blooms.</p>

This follows a dry, sunny, and warm start to the month for many, with temperatures well above the April average. Large parts of England and Wales have experienced "very high" pollen levels, primarily due to Birch and Ash tree pollen. The Met Office forecasts a fall to "high" or "moderate" pollen levels by Wednesday as the weather becomes more unsettled.</p>
