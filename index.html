        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the declining prospects for progressives to expand the welfare state in the United States. It highlights two main reasons: the Democrats' limited control of the federal government and their aversion to raising taxes on the middle class. The author points out that the Democrats' coalition is concentrated on the coasts, making it difficult to win Senate majorities. Additionally, the article notes that while Democrats have grown more ambitious about social spending, they have become more hesitant to raise taxes on anyone but the super-rich, which is a challenge given rising inflation and interest rates. The author suggests that Democrats may need to scale back their ambitions or find a way to enact broad-based tax increases to fund welfare programs. </p>

The Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, holds ultimate authority, while the President, Masoud Pezeshkian, manages day-to-day governance. The Guardian Council ensures legislation aligns with Islamic principles, and the Expediency Discernment Council mediates disputes. The Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) wields significant military and economic power, and the Parliament (Majlis) drafts laws but is limited by the Guardian Council. Understanding these key figures and institutions is essential for comprehending power dynamics within Iran.</p>

          <p>U.S. asset management giant Apollo is set to provide a Â£4.5 billion ($6 billion) loan to U.K. nuclear project Hinkley Point to address a funding shortfall. The construction of the Hinkley Point C plant, the first nuclear power station to be built in Britain in decades, has faced delays and budget increases. Apollo will provide an investment-grade, unsecured debt financing package for the project at an interest rate below 7%. The deal would be among the biggest private capital investments in a project of U.K. national interest.</p>

Just before Luxon's arrival, Wellington suspended funding to the Cook Islands over its deepening ties with Beijing.

These items, with their allure of "unknown surprises," have become highly sought-after by young consumers but hide "commercial traps" that induce impulsive spending.

          <p>Israeli strikes on Iran are stirring anxiety in Los Angeles' 'Tehrangeles,' home to a large Iranian diaspora. Community members expressed hope for a regime change and others worried about potential backlash or scapegoating of their community if the US enters the conflict. Some Iranian American community members expressed hope for a regime change. The uncertainty is amplified by the complexities of intersecting identities, as many have family members in both Iran and Israel. Amid the heightened anxiety, some are praying for peace and stability.</p>

Two dozen car washes in the Los Angeles and Orange County areas have been the sites of immigration sweeps this month. Business owners are facing worker shortages and customer apprehension.</p>

          <p>The article examines the threats to Social Security and Medicare under the Trump administration, focusing on immigration, taxation, and healthcare policies. Trump's proposed policies, such as mass deportations and tariffs, could negatively impact Social Security's solvency. The author notes that the Republican answer to the revenue shortfall generally involves cutting benefits, either by outright reductions or such options as raising the full retirement age. The article advocates for eliminating the cap on wages subject to payroll tax and taxing investment income to address the revenue shortfall.</p>

          <p>The musical "Parade" tells the story of Leo Frank, who was wrongly convicted of murdering a young employee in 1913 Georgia. Director Michael Arden's Tony-winning revival at the Ahmanson Theatre explores themes of antisemitism and systemic bias in the judicial system. The production uses a neo-Brechtian staging to seamlessly transmit the historical background, allowing the focus to be on the human figures caught in the snares of American bigotry and barbarism. The production's timeliness is disconcerting, as it delves into systemic bias in our judicial system and the power of a wily demagogue to stoke atavistic hatred for self-gain.</p>
