          <p>Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, a rapper from the Irish hip-hop group Kneecap, was released on unconditional bail after being charged with displaying a flag in support of Hezbollah at a London gig. The rapper, who performs under the name Mo Chara, appeared in Westminster Magistrates' Court accompanied by fellow band members. Supporters gathered outside the court, displaying flags and slogans in support of Ó hAnnaidh and Palestinian rights. The rapper denies the offense and will appear in court for the next hearing in August, with the judge noting the unavailability of an Irish interpreter for the initial hearing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 50+1 rule in German football ensures that club members retain control over the professional part of their football clubs, preventing external investors from taking complete control. This rule stipulates that the parent club must hold at least 50 percent plus one vote in its spun-off professional football company. Exceptions exist for clubs like Bayer Leverkusen and VfL Wolfsburg, which have received continuous investment for over 20 years, while RB Leipzig faces criticism for allegedly circumventing the rule. Critics argue that the rule puts German clubs at a financial disadvantage compared to other countries, but many fans internationally support it to protect fan culture and prevent commercialization.</p>

          <p>UK inflation remained at 3.4% in May, with chocolate prices rising at the fastest pace on record due to bad weather in cocoa-producing regions and long-term government mismanagement of the cocoa sector. Food prices overall have risen for three consecutive months, with some economists suggesting businesses are passing on increased employer National Insurance payments to customers. Rising food inflation was partially offset by cheaper travel prices, as air fares fell compared to last year. The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated the government is investing in Britain's renewal to make working people better off, while the shadow chancellor expressed concern for families.</p>

          <p>The White House has released a series of clips highlighting President Donald Trump's consistent opposition to Iran obtaining nuclear weapons, aiming to counter emerging criticisms. These clips, dating back to 2023, showcase Trump's repeated statements emphasizing that Iran must not be allowed to develop nuclear capabilities. Vice President JD Vance defended Trump's position, stating that it focuses on using the American military to achieve American goals and highlighting Trump's consistency on the issue. The White House also referenced Trump's 2018 withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal as further evidence of his commitment to preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>An analyst argues that Donald Trump's foreign policy is not aligned with either the GOP hawks or the "America First" crowd, instead relying on a collection of impulses that lack a systematic doctrine. Trump's instincts include prioritizing U.S. interests, disregarding constraints, using force aggressively, and seeking advantageous deals. This approach leads to incoherent and contradictory policies, undermining stability and increasing the risk of disaster, especially with hawkish allies advocating for military intervention. The president's policy shifts are influenced by immediate pressures and personal instincts rather than a consistent worldview.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The legality of Israel's attack on Iran is under debate, with arguments focusing on whether it constitutes self-defense under international law. Israel claims the attack was a preemptive measure against a potential nuclear threat from Iran, but international law requires an imminent attack for self-defense to be justified. Critics argue that the attack was a preventive measure, lacking evidence of an imminent threat, while supporters suggest it should be viewed within the context of a larger conflict. Legal experts also discuss the laws of combat, emphasizing the need to avoid targeting civilians and ensure proportionality in attacks.</p>

          <p>The upcoming U.S. Dietary Guidelines are expected to remove the recommendation that adults limit alcohol consumption to one or two drinks per day. Instead, the guidelines will likely include a brief statement encouraging moderation or limiting alcohol intake due to associated health risks. This change comes as some experts argue the scientific basis for specific daily limits is limited, while others worry the message that even moderate drinking can increase risks, especially for breast cancer, will be lost. The guidelines, developed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, are influential internationally and affect various policies.

Beijing launched the austerity push in March to improve the ruling party’s image and cut wasteful spending, but some localities have equated prohibiting illegal dining with banning all eating and drinking, causing businesses to lose customers.</p>

          <p>A UCLA Anderson forecast predicts that California's economy will contract later this year due to the combined effects of Trump's trade war and recent immigration raids. The report cites "confusion and uncertainty" surrounding immigration and trade policies as negatively impacting key sectors like construction, hospitality, and agriculture. Forecasters anticipate negative job growth and a peak unemployment rate of 6.1% this year, with long-term effects stemming from reduced employment in entertainment and tech. The report underscores the sensitivity of California's economy to federal policy decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California is bracing for a dangerous wildfire season, exacerbated by federal budget cuts and restructuring at key agencies like the U.S. Forest Service, NOAA, and FEMA. Experts warn that these changes will weaken the state's ability to prepare for and respond to fires, particularly as climate change drives larger and more destructive blazes. The Trump administration's policies include budget cuts, layoffs, and increased resource extraction from national forests, compounding the challenges. While California is taking steps to enhance its own firefighting capabilities, it still relies on federal support.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Metro is struggling to secure funding for a large bus fleet crucial to its "transit first" plan for the 2028 Olympics and Paralympics.

Challenges include obtaining clean energy buses, training operators, and providing housing, with concerns raised about whether enough Angelenos will use public transit.

Stamets, who founded Fungi Perfecti, believes mycelium has beneficial properties and uses it in his products, while Chilton, founder of Nammex, argues that only fruiting bodies (toadstools) should be labeled as mushrooms. Chilton has petitioned the FDA to differentiate between mushroom and mycelium on supplement labels, alleging that mycelium products often consist mostly of grain starch.
