          <h2>Myanmar Grapples with Political Instability Following Devastating Earthquake</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck Myanmar, exacerbating the existing political turmoil caused by a brutal civil war. The official death toll has risen to 3,471, with estimates predicting it could exceed 10,000. Despite the junta's plea for international aid and a declared ceasefire, analysts doubt a lasting peace deal will emerge due to deeply entrenched battle lines between the junta and resistance forces. The junta is expected to exploit the disaster to weaken resistance capabilities, hindering any meaningful dialogue.</p>

          <p>The United States has halted sea salt imports from Taepyung, a major South Korean salt farm, due to credible evidence of forced labor. This action marks the first punitive measure by a trade partner against the long-standing issue of slavery on salt farms in Sinan County. The investigation revealed numerous indicators of forced labor, including restricted movement, document retention, and abusive working conditions. Advocates hope this ban will pressure South Korea to take more decisive steps to eliminate slavery, which has persisted despite previous exposures and legal recognitions of government responsibility.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs and subsequent actions by other nations have negatively impacted investor portfolios, leading to market declines worldwide. The European Union is reportedly preparing tariffs targeting up to $28 billion of U.S. imports. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated the White House will not postpone the April 9 start date for reciprocal tariffs. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent dismissed concerns about a potential recession, while Berkshire Hathaway weathered the market rout better than the S&P 500.&#x3C;br&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;(not investment advice)&#x3C;/i&#x3E;</p>

          <p>A US judge has criticized the Trump administration for mistakenly deporting a man living in the US to a prison in El Salvador. Judge Paula Xinis reaffirmed her ruling demanding Kilmar Abrego Garcia be returned to the US, stating he was seized "without any lawful authority". The judge calls his situation a "grievous error" that "shocks the conscience". Trump officials argue they lack the authority to remove him from jail in El Salvador.
