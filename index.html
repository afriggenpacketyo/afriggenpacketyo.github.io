          <p>India's foreign ministry has defended its increased importation of Russian oil, stating it was a "vital national compulsion" after traditional supplies were diverted to Europe. New Delhi pointed out that the U.S. and EU, who are criticizing the trade, continue to have significant commerce with Russia themselves. This response follows former President Trump's threats to impose substantially higher tariffs on India, accusing the nation of profiting from discounted Russian crude. The ministry emphasized that its oil purchases were encouraged by the U.S. previously to maintain global energy market stability. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a federal court order, U.S. border agents have been instructed to stop deportations under a sweeping asylum ban implemented by the Trump administration. The policy had previously allowed for the summary deportation of migrants entering the country illegally, a measure credited with a sharp drop in border crossings. While an appeals court affirmed the president's authority to pause asylum access, it ruled that the government cannot deport migrants to places where they face torture or persecution. This directive effectively reopens pathways for migrants to request humanitarian refuge, though they will likely remain detained during the process.</p>

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has directed a federal prosecutor to present evidence to a grand jury regarding the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation. This move follows claims by President Trump and his allies that the probe was a politically motivated "coup" by the Obama administration to undermine his presidency. The referral stems from a declassified report by DNI Tulsi Gabbard, which alleged the politicization of intelligence. It remains unclear what specific charges could be pursued or who might be targeted, though former officials like James Comey and John Brennan have been mentioned.</p>

          <p>A helicopter crew conducted a dramatic rescue of two hikers who became stranded on a remote beach near Elephant Rock at Point Reyes National Seashore. The pair called for help after realizing that rising tides had completely cut off their only path back to safety. Responders used a 100-foot line to hoist the hikers from the shore, flying them to the Marin County Fire Department without any reported injuries. Officials warn that Point Reyes has many coastal hazards, including sneaker waves and unstable cliffs, and advise visitors to check tide charts and carry emergency communication devices.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has ordered the civil arrest of Democratic state lawmakers who left Texas to prevent a vote on a Republican-drawn congressional redistricting map. By leaving the state, the Democrats broke the legislative quorum, halting proceedings on a bill that would add five GOP-favoring seats. The Republican-led House voted to authorize the arrests to compel the members' return, though Texas law enforcement lacks jurisdiction outside the state. This escalates a political standoff over what Democrats call an authoritarian power grab and Republicans call a dereliction of duty.</p>

          <p>Glass House Brands, a major California cannabis company, is implementing significant changes to its labor practices following a large-scale ICE raid that resulted in one worker's death and over 360 detentions. The company has terminated its relationship with two farm labor contractors and hired a consulting firm led by a former ICE director to improve its employment eligibility verification.

          <p>Australia will acquire 11 advanced Mogami-class frigates from Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in a deal worth approximately $6.5 billion. Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles described it as the largest defense-industry agreement ever made between the two nations, reflecting a close strategic alignment in the Indo-Pacific. The deal is part of Australia's broader military restructuring aimed at developing long-range strike capabilities in response to China's military expansion. This marks Japan's first warship export since before World War II, a significant move given its post-war pacifist constitution.</p>

          <p>United Parcel Service (UPS) has agreed to a $1.7 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit from 45 California counties alleging the company improperly disposed of hazardous materials. The lawsuit claimed that UPS discarded corrosive, ignitable, and toxic waste in regular trash bins, which were then sent to landfills unequipped to handle such materials. Investigators from several district attorney's offices conducted a years-long probe into 140 UPS locations. UPS cooperated with the investigation and has since implemented new waste management systems and employee training programs across its California facilities.</p>

          <p>It is currently peak mating season for tarantulas in California, a time when the normally reclusive male spiders leave their burrows in search of a mate. Experts note that sightings are common at dusk in chaparral, desert, and mountain areas across Southern California, including popular spots like Joshua Tree and Griffith Park. While their appearance can be startling, tarantulas are generally harmless to humans unless provoked and possess a mild venom. They may defend themselves by flicking irritant hairs from their bodies, so observers are advised to keep a respectful distance.</p>

Lawmakers are proposing incentives like student loan forgiveness to boost recruitment among young people.

However, the report also suggests a blockade would not be a low-risk option for Beijing, as it would likely incur high casualties and could easily escalate into a wider conflict involving the United States.

The blaze prompted the closure of a section of the Honoapiʻilani Highway due to smoke and firefighting efforts. The Maui County Fire Department reported that the fire was slowly being contained. The incident occurred just a few miles north of Lahaina, the town devastated by the deadliest U.S. wildfire in over a century nearly two years ago, raising concerns among local residents.</p>

          <p>Gareth Ward, a member of the New South Wales state parliament in Australia, is fighting to keep his seat from his jail cell after being convicted of sexually assaulting two men. The 44-year-old was found guilty last month of offenses that occurred between 2013 and 2015 and is in custody awaiting sentencing. The NSW parliament had planned to vote to expel him, but Ward's lawyers are seeking a court injunction to block the move, as he plans to appeal his conviction. The state's premier has called the situation "unconscionable" and urged Ward to resign.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied Sean "Diddy" Combs's request for release on bail, ordering him to remain in custody at the Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center until his sentencing in October. Combs was convicted on two prostitution-related charges, though he was cleared of racketeering and sex trafficking. The judge was unpersuaded by arguments that Combs was not a flight risk and faced threats at the notoriously troubled facility. The ruling came despite a letter submitted by one of the trial's victims in support of his release.</p>

          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, the stock market's strong rebound on Monday was driven by the impressive earnings reports from the "Magnificent Seven" tech companies. He pointed to "flawless" results from Microsoft and strong performance across the board from Alphabet, Meta, Apple, and Amazon as the core of the market's resilience. Cramer suggested that even with Tesla's vehicle business struggling, the tech giants are so dominant and cash-rich that they are difficult to bet against. This strength overshadowed concerns from a weak jobs report. (not investment advice)</p>

After the Associated Press inquired about the potential conflict of interest, the line was removed from a revised version of the document.

The bulk of the savings came from successfully blocking an attempt to freeze federal funding.

The guidance emphasizes that weight management is a long-term process, and patients need a plan that includes healthy eating, exercise, and behavioral support to maintain their progress.

          <p>California is on track for one of its most destructive wildfire seasons in recent memory, with significantly more acreage burned so far this year compared to the five-year average. According to Cal Fire, much of this year's increased activity has been driven by large fires in Central and Southern California, where limited winter rain left vegetation exceptionally dry. While Northern California has had a slower start, officials warn that a coming heatwave will increase fire risk statewide. The state's largest active blaze, the Gifford fire, continues to grow, exhibiting erratic, plume-dominated behavior.</p>
