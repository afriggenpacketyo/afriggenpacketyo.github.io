          <p>Japan, known for its pacifist constitution, is shifting towards arms exports to deepen ties with allies and enhance its defense industrial base. Defense Minister Gen Nakatani aims to promote defense exports, while Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba attended a defense exhibition, signaling a change in policy. This shift is driven by security concerns and the need to improve interoperability with allies through standardized maintenance and joint training. By exporting arms, Japan seeks to achieve economies of scale and revitalize its domestic defense industry, which has suffered due to reliance on U.S. weapons purchases. The optimism score is 65.</p>
