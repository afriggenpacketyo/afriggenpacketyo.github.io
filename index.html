          <p>US agriculture exporters are facing a "full-blown crisis" due to global backlash from President Trump's tariffs, particularly a decline in Chinese buying of US farm products. This has led to cancelled export orders and layoffs, with significant financial losses reported by members of the Agriculture Transportation Coalition (AgTC). Data reveals China made its biggest cancellation of pork orders since 2020, halting a shipment of 12,000 tons. The Port of Oakland warns of potential job instability and economic downturn due to tariff-induced cargo volume decline, as China ranks as the port's top import trading partner and third export partner.</p>

          <p>Gold prices have been hitting record highs, surpassing $3,000 per ounce in March and currently sitting around $3,300 per ounce, driven by economic uncertainty, geopolitical instability, and unpredictable market performance. Experts predict further growth, potentially reaching $4,000 per ounce, especially if the Federal Reserve drops interest rates to zero. However, achieving this milestone would require a significant rally, and pullbacks are expected along the way.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Settling a debt, which involves paying less than the original amount owed, can negatively impact your credit score in the short term, as it's usually marked as "settled" rather than "paid in full." However, it can be a step towards rebuilding if the account was already seriously delinquent. Over time, as the settled debt ages and good financial habits are maintained, the score can recover. Alternatives like debt management and debt consolidation may be more credit-score friendly options. Ultimately, making a plan and sticking to it is crucial for improving financial health (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez are seeking to disqualify Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman from their resentencing case, citing a conflict of interest. Their attorney argues that Hochman hired Kathleen Cady, who previously represented a family member opposing the resentencing, to head the Office of Victims' Services. The motion also claims that Hochman reassigned deputy district attorneys perceived as sympathetic to the Menendez brothers. The brothers, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, are fighting for reduced sentences, arguing years of sexual abuse led to the slayings.</p>

Researchers say cicadas typically remain in a given area for 4 to 6 weeks after they first emerge.
