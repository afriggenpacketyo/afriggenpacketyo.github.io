          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves' Spending Review outlines government spending from 2026, impacting various sectors and public services. While defense and the NHS will receive significant funding, other areas like the Home Office, Foreign Office, and Department for Transport will face budget cuts, potentially affecting jobs and wages. The government plans to continue the Â£3 bus fare cap until at least March 2027 and invest in transport projects like Northern Powerhouse Rail. The review also includes measures to help pensioners with winter fuel payments and improve home insulation to reduce energy bills, along with money for community renewal projects, but also suggests future rises in council tax.

          <p>A new study suggests that mango consumption can benefit heart health, particularly in post-menopausal women. Researchers found that daily mango intake was associated with reduced blood pressure and cholesterol levels. A small probe study also showed that blood glucose levels rose less after mango consumption compared to white bread. While more research is needed, these findings suggest that adding colorful, plant-based foods like mangoes to the diet can have heart-protective benefits due to their unique mix of compounds like mangiferin and quercetin.</p>

          <p>Experts suggest that President Trump's deployment of military forces to Los Angeles was a deliberate strategy years in the making. After regretting not taking a more forceful approach to the 2020 protests, Trump turned to federalizing the national guard and deploying marines to confront demonstrations against his immigration crackdown. Critics argue that this move is a "test case" for exerting federal authority over local governments that resist Trump's agenda. The situation has raised concerns about the use of military force to stifle peaceful protests and the targeting of immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>Democratic members of Congress are introducing the My Body, My Data Act to limit companies' ability to collect data about people's reproductive health, aiming to protect women from persecution in the post-Roe v Wade era. The bill seeks to block companies from collecting, using, retaining, or disclosing information about someoneâ€™s reproductive health unless essential to providing a requested service. This provision would apply to data on pregnancy, menstruation, abortion, and contraception. The bill is unlikely to pass due to Republican control of Congress, but aims to safeguard privacy in the face of increasing online surveillance.</p>
