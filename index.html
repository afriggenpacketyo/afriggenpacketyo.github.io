          <p>Rita Benson LeBlanc, granddaughter of the late New Orleans Saints owner Tom Benson, was arrested in Charleston, South Carolina, for allegedly interfering with a parking enforcement officer. The incident reportedly involved LeBlanc taking the officer's parking boot locking tool and allegedly shoving the officer. Despite the accusation of shoving, she was not charged with assault and was released on a personal recognizance bond. LeBlanc was previously an executive and co-owner of the Saints and Pelicans before being fired by her grandfather, after which his wife, Gayle Benson, became the principal owner of the teams. The former heiress is scheduled to appear in court next month.</p>

          <p>French scientists have identified a new blood type, "Gwada negative," in a woman from Guadeloupe, marking the 48th blood group system recognized worldwide. The discovery occurred 15 years after researchers received a blood sample during routine pre-surgery tests, revealing an unusual antibody. High-throughput DNA sequencing in 2019 pinpointed a genetic mutation, confirming the woman as the only known carrier compatible with herself. Scientists hope to find others with the same blood type to improve care for patients with rare blood types, as this discovery underscores the importance of genetic research in medicine.</p>

Lehecka will now advance to the final, while Draper will rest before preparing for Wimbledon, which starts on June 30.

          <p>The stock market experienced a tense and dynamic week influenced by geopolitical events, particularly the intensifying conflict between Israel and Iran, and Federal Reserve updates. Investors closely monitored safe-haven assets like gold and the dollar, as well as risk assets such as oil, amid uncertainty over potential U.S. involvement in the conflict. The Fed kept interest rates unchanged following its policy meeting, citing lackluster economic updates and dueling dynamics regarding inflation and economic growth. The central bank's decision reflects a cautious approach amid uncertainty surrounding tariff impacts, with projections still indicating two rate cuts in 2025 (not investment advice).</p>

The pilot raised the right main wheel after landing about 1,400 feet down the 2,424-foot runway, as advised by a communications operator, but lost control. The plane crashed in a heavily forested area near the runway, killing the pilot and a passenger, while a second passenger was seriously injured. The NTSB's final report, which will include the probable cause of the crash, is expected in one to two years.</p>

The administration cited dysfunction, bias, and waste as reasons for the layoffs, which affected over 85% of the agency's employees since March. VOA, established during World War Two to counter Nazi propaganda, has been criticized for alleged leftist bias. The firings have been condemned by some as an act of self-sabotage that undermines independent journalism and US ideals of democracy and freedom.</p>

          <p>Despite publicly opposing Israel's attacks on Iran, Jordan and Saudi Arabia have taken actions that indirectly support Israel. Jordan shot down Iranian missiles and drones to protect its airspace, while Saudi Arabia likely allowed Israel to use its airspace for defense. These actions reflect a balancing act between domestic political pressures and strategic alliances, as both nations navigate historical antipathy towards Israel and dependence on the U.S. for security. The decisions highlight the complex dynamics and tensions in the region.</p>

          <p>As Israel's attacks on Iran continue, speculation about regime change in Tehran grows, but historical examples suggest such interventions often lead to disastrous consequences. Foreign-imposed regime change violates international law, often resulting in power vacuums, violence, and instability. The experiences in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya demonstrate the challenges and failures of externally driven regime change. Experts warn that a ground force would be necessary to topple the Iranian government, and there is no strong rebel movement within Iran capable of achieving this.</p>

Bannon advised Trump against the attack, citing concerns about the reliability of Israeli intelligence and the effectiveness of the "bunker-buster" bomb. While some officials insist Trump had already decided to postpone the strike, Bannon's influence highlights the ongoing debate within the administration regarding military action in Iran.

          <p>As a heatwave approaches the US, experts note that American sunscreens may be less effective than those available in other countries, particularly in protecting against UVA rays. Regulatory differences classify sunscreen as an over-the-counter drug in the US, leading to a lengthy approval process for new UV filters. While US sunscreens effectively block UVB rays, they often lack the advanced ingredients found in sunscreens from Europe and South Korea. Dermatologists stress the importance of wearing sunscreen and suggest using broad-spectrum sunscreens with an SPF of 30 or higher.</p>
