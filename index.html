        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>United Kingdom inflation increased to 3.8% in July, marking its highest point since January 2024.  This surge is primarily attributed to significant price hikes in airfares and food, exceeding economist predictions. The cost of eating out and various food and beverage items contributed to the overall increase, reaching levels not seen since February 2024.  The Bank of England's recent interest rate cut to 4% reflects a complex economic situation, balancing inflationary pressures with economic growth concerns.</p>

          <p>Israel's final approval of a controversial settlement plan in the occupied West Bank will see the construction of nearly 3,500 new apartments, expanding the Maale Adumim settlement. This move is condemned by the UN as it would effectively divide the West Bank, hindering any potential two-state solution.  The Israeli government's announcement of the settlements suggests a move to bury the idea of a Palestinian state entirely.  The plan also comes amidst preparations for a large-scale military operation in Gaza, raising concerns about potential mass displacement and humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>Recent German football matches witnessed multiple instances of racial abuse directed at Black players, prompting widespread condemnation from FIFA and the German Football Association (DFB).  The DFB has launched an investigation into the incidents, which include a player being called the N-word and subsequent booing.  FIFA President Gianni Infantino emphasized the unacceptable nature of racism in football, highlighting the need for thorough investigations and punishment of perpetrators. While the DFB reports a decline in discrimination, the incidents underscore the ongoing struggle against racism in German football.</p>

          <p>Authorities in central Mexico discovered six severed heads along a road connecting Puebla and Tlaxcala states, regions not typically associated with such extreme violence.  Another head and additional human remains were found separately in Colima.  Local media reports suggest a pamphlet at the scene blamed the killings on a gang conflict over fuel theft. The incident highlights the ongoing drug-related brutality plaguing parts of Mexico, despite these states being relatively new to such extreme violence.</p>

          <p>Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene called for the complete abolition of property taxes, arguing it's akin to forced rent to the government. She also described the U.S. health insurance system as a "giant scam," deeming it unaffordable and unpopular.  Greene, identifying as "America ONLY," urged immediate action on these issues, framing them as critical problems requiring urgent attention.  Her statements align with her America First ideology and reflect her broader stance on domestic policy.</p>

Discussions among European allies centered on security guarantees for Ukraine, with Zelenskyy highlighting their importance in ending the war.

          <p>Following a High Court ruling granting an injunction to block asylum seekers from a hotel in Epping, Essex, other councils across England are considering similar legal action.  The ruling, based on an alleged planning law breach and public safety concerns, sets a precedent that could significantly impact the government's ability to house asylum seekers in hotels.

          <p>A National Park Service employee was fired and faces potential criminal charges for displaying a transgender pride flag over El Capitan in Yosemite National Park.  The action sparked outrage from LGBTQ+ activists who accuse the government of silencing dissent.  Park officials cited a recently implemented rule prohibiting unauthorized displays on natural features, while the employee argues the rule was retroactively applied.  The incident highlights ongoing tensions surrounding free speech and LGBTQ+ rights, with activists demanding the employee's reinstatement and an independent investigation.</p>

          <p>A study reveals that brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) designed to help paralyzed individuals speak can also decode their inner monologues.  This discovery, while potentially improving communication speed and ease for users, raises significant privacy concerns.  Researchers explored decoding imagined speech, achieving 74% accuracy in translating sentences from a large vocabulary.  The study highlights the need for safeguards to protect the mental privacy of BCI users, particularly as the technology advances and becomes more accessible.</p>
