          <p>A high-stakes summit between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, has concluded without a definitive peace deal or ceasefire for the war in Ukraine. The meeting, which lasted nearly three hours, was described by Trump as a "very productive meeting," with both leaders alluding to progress on several points but offering no specific details. The outcome leaves the path to resolving the conflict uncertain, with Trump indicating he will consult with NATO allies and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy about the discussions and suggesting a potential second summit.</p>

Micherre Fox, 31, had long planned to find her own diamond, viewing the effort as symbolic of the hard work required in a marriage. On her final day at the park, she spotted the gem, which was later confirmed by park staff, making it the third-largest diamond found there this year. She has named the stone the "Fox-Ballou Diamond" in honor of her and her partner.</p>

          <p>Following Taylor Swift's announcement of her new album, "The Life of a Showgirl," numerous major corporations have launched marketing campaigns centered around the color orange. The trend ignited after Swift discussed her energetic connection to the color on a podcast with her boyfriend, Travis Kelce. Companies from United Airlines and Walmart to the NHL and Google have integrated orange themes into their social media and search results, seeking to align their brands with the singer's immense economic influence. This phenomenon underscores the significant impact Swift's cultural presence has on consumer markets and corporate branding strategies.</p>

          <p>A court has ordered singer and actor Teyana Taylor to pay $70,000 in attorney fees to her ex-husband, former NBA player Iman Shumpert, after she was found in contempt of court. The ruling stems from accusations that Taylor violated their 2024 divorce agreement by leaking settlement details to online blogs. The judge in Georgia's Fulton County Superior Court determined that Taylor had disclosed prohibited information from the final judgment. The court also noted her ability to pay the fees, citing her recent and upcoming roles in films and television series.</p>

          <p>Young people across England are struggling with the high cost of bus transportation, which they say significantly impacts their budgets for food, rent, and social activities. A recent report by MPs has recommended extending free bus travel to everyone under 22, similar to a policy already in place in Scotland, to ease financial burdens and improve access to work and education. The BBC spoke with several young individuals who described the fares as "extortionate," detailing how the expense forces them to make difficult financial choices and limits their independence.</p>

          <p>Iconic fashion brand Topshop is planning a major comeback to the UK High Street, years after its physical stores closed following the collapse of its parent company, Arcadia, in 2020. The brand, now owned by online retailer Asos, is set to open new standalone stores and will host its first catwalk show in seven years at London's Trafalgar Square. While nostalgia for the brand is high among millennials and Gen-Z, industry experts caution that its success will depend on attracting a new generation of shoppers and competing with fast-fashion giants in a challenging retail environment.</p>

          <p>Liverpool defeated Bournemouth 4-2 in a dramatic Premier League opener at Anfield, but the victory highlighted significant defensive vulnerabilities for the reigning champions. New £70 million striker Hugo Ekitike was a standout performer, scoring one goal and assisting another, making a strong case for his place amid rumors of another major signing. However, Liverpool's defense appeared porous, allowing Bournemouth to equalize at 2-2 with a notable goal from Antoine Semenyo, who ran unchallenged for 50 yards. The chaotic match showcased both the team's potent attack and the urgent need to address its defensive weaknesses.</p>

Speaking on a podcast amid the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska, Clinton emphasized that a genuine peace must not validate Russia's aggression or its vision of a "greater Russia." She expressed a hope that, for various reasons, Trump might stand up to Putin, framing a potential successful outcome as a victory for both Ukrainian democracy and U.S. security interests.</p>

          <p>At 21 years old, all-rounder Jacob Bethell is set to become the youngest man to ever captain England in international cricket. He will lead an understrength T20 squad for a tour of Ireland in September, as regular captain Harry Brook and other key players are being rested. The appointment is a significant show of faith in Bethell, who has had limited playing time this summer but is highly regarded by England selectors for his leadership qualities. The squad for the tour also includes a first-time call-up for Hampshire bowler Sonny Baker.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are meeting at a military base in Anchorage, Alaska, for a high-stakes summit focused on ending the war in Ukraine. Trump, who campaigned on a promise to end the conflict quickly, initiated the meeting after previous talks failed to yield progress, though the White House has framed it as a "listening exercise." Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was not invited, has welcomed the talks but insists any agreement must not involve trading Ukrainian territory. The meeting's outcome is being closely watched by European allies.</p>

          <p>Solomon Peña, a former Republican candidate for the New Mexico state legislature, has been sentenced to 80 years in federal prison for orchestrating a series of drive-by shootings at the homes of four Democratic officials. The attacks occurred in late 2022 and early 2023 after Peña lost his election bid by a wide margin and baselessly claimed the election was rigged. Prosecutors stated Peña intended to terrorize political opponents and showed no remorse for his actions, which included firing bullets into the bedroom of a state senator's 10-year-old daughter.</p>

The PSLF Buyback program, which could help many borrowers achieve debt cancellation, has been hampered by processing delays within the Department of Education, leaving some applicants waiting for more than six months. Consumer advocates advise eligible borrowers to apply but also to pursue other repayment plans simultaneously rather than relying solely on the backlogged system to reach their required 120 payments.</p>

The blogger, Jim Stewartson, had accused Patel of being a "Kremlin asset" and planning the January 6th Capitol attack. A federal judge in Las Vegas issued the ruling after Stewartson failed to respond to the lawsuit, stating that while criticism of public figures is protected, defamatory falsehoods made with actual malice are not. Stewartson claimed he was never properly served with the lawsuit and intends to challenge the judgment.</p>

Sung contends that Marcotte was unprofessional and that he questioned if their audiences aligned after viewing her content. The backlash from the video was immediate, forcing the restaurant to close and Sung to leave his position as co-owner.</p>

The Department of Transportation has released new guidance to allow the funds to flow, while also stripping away several Biden-era requirements related to community engagement, labor standards, and charger location density. While EV advocates and charging companies welcome the end of the delay, they express frustration over the disruption it caused to the nationwide buildout of high-speed chargers along highway corridors.</p>

          <p>Right-wing commentators on the social media platform X are manufacturing a culture war narrative by claiming that liberals are enraged by viral TikTok videos of sorority recruitment dances. Accounts are reposting the videos of young, predominantly white women dancing, often with patriotic themes, and framing them as something that triggers "purple hair lesbians" and the political left. However, there is no evidence of this widespread outrage; instead, the narrative appears to be a tactic for driving engagement and potential revenue on the platform by creating a fabricated controversy for a receptive conservative audience.</p>

Gil Luria of D.A.

The potential move, which could utilize funds from the CHIPS Act, is seen as a way to ensure domestic control over critical technology, especially with the rise of superintelligent AI.
