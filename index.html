          <p>South Korea has indicted former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo for allegedly abetting ex-President Yoon Suk Yeol's martial law bid. The former first lady, Kim Keon Hee, faces charges of corruption and bribery, including providing funds for stock manipulation and receiving luxury gifts. These indictments follow President Lee Jae Myung's approval of investigations into Yoon's actions while in office, leading to raids on religious institutions and military bases. The probes and subsequent indictments have drawn international attention, including from former U.S. President Donald Trump, who initially expressed concern before softening his stance. The legal proceedings against these high-profile figures highlight the ongoing political tensions and accountability measures in South Korea. Optimism is tempered by the gravity of the charges and their potential impact on the nation's stability. </p>

          <p>The White House has appointed Jim O'Neill as the new director of the CDC, succeeding Susan Monarez, who was dismissed after only a month in office. Monarez's lawyers claim her removal was illegal, alleging she was targeted for refusing to endorse unscientific directives, while the White House stated she was not aligned with the president's agenda. O'Neill, a former Silicon Valley tech investor, takes over the CDC during a period of internal division over vaccine policies, with multiple senior officials resigning. The exodus at the CDC has sparked concerns among health experts regarding the agency's approach to immunizations, with Senator Bernie Sanders calling for an investigation into Monarez's firing. The new director faces the challenge of unifying the agency and addressing public health concerns. </p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Tianjin, marking his first visit to China in seven years. Despite lingering tensions stemming from border clashes and trade imbalances, economic pressures from U.S. tariffs may be pushing both countries toward reluctant cooperation. While experts remain skeptical about a deep, lasting friendship, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi has advocated for viewing each other as partners. The visit highlights the complex interplay of economic necessity, geopolitical rivalry, and the potential for collaboration between the two Asian giants. The summit could provide insight into the future trajectory of their relationship. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. tariff exemption for package shipments valued under $800 has officially ended, raising costs for businesses and disrupting supply chain models. A six-month transition period allows postal service shippers to pay a flat duty of $80-$200 per package, depending on the country of origin. The move broadens the Trump administration's cancellation of the de minimis exemption for shipments from China and Hong Kong earlier this year. Officials claim the change will restrict the flow of narcotics and generate up to $10 billion in tariff revenues annually. The de minimis exemption had been in place since 1938, fostering small business growth on e-commerce marketplaces. </p>

          <p>New Orleans and the Gulf Coast are commemorating the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, which devastated the region on August 29, 2005. The historic Lower 9th Ward, a predominantly Black community with high rates of homeownership, was particularly hard hit by levee breaches. Katrina resulted in nearly 1,400 deaths and remains the costliest storm in U.S. history, with damages around $200 billion in today's dollars. The anniversary serves as a reminder of the storm's profound and lasting impact on the region and its residents. The photographs serve as a stark reminder of the destruction caused by the hurricane. </p>

          <p>UK firms are expressing concerns about new taxes on low-value parcels sent to the US, citing uncertainty and potential price increases for their businesses. The end of the "de minimis" exemption, meaning parcels valued under $800 will be subject to tax, is expected to increase costs and create new barriers for small firms. The Federation of Small Businesses warns that this will hinder their ability to compete with larger brands, with some businesses already halting shipments to the US due to the uncertainty. The changes could significantly impact small UK businesses that rely on the US market for a substantial portion of their sales. </p>

          <p>The United States has ended the tariff exemption for low-value items shipped from abroad, subjecting all goods to duties as of Friday. A six-month transition period allows postal service shippers to pay a flat duty of $80 to $200 per package, depending on the country of origin. Critics argue that the influx of low-value imports hurts US retailers and facilitates the entry of unsafe items and drugs. Full tariff rates will now apply to packages shipped by express carriers, while foreign postal agencies can either collect duties based on package value or opt for a flat rate. The change has led some foreign postal companies to suspend deliveries to the US. </p>

Previously, Southwest has refunded the cost of the additional seat after travel, but no longer guarantees it.
