          <p>Chinese toymaker Pop Mart's shares surged over 12% after reporting a near-400% rise in net profit, fueled by global demand for its Labubu dolls. The company's revenue jumped 204.4% year-on-year to 13.88 billion yuan for the first half of 2025. Despite concerns from analysts about the long-term popularity of its IPs and regulatory scrutiny on "blind boxes," the firm's CEO expressed confidence in reaching ambitious revenue targets. Pop Mart's international expansion, particularly in Asia-Pacific and the Americas, significantly contributed to its robust performance.</p>

Despite a late collapse, Brave reached their target of 112 with just one ball remaining, securing a three-wicket win and maintaining their unbeaten record. Welsh Fire, suffering their fifth consecutive defeat, struggled with an underwhelming batting performance despite Sophia Dunkley's positive start. Brave's bowlers, notably Lauren Bell and Sophie Devine, expertly controlled the innings, setting up their team to potentially secure a spot in the Eliminator.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has implemented new guidance for vetting legal immigrant applicants, scrutinizing them for "anti-American," terrorist, or antisemitic views. This policy grants U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services officers broad discretion to deem such views as "overwhelmingly negative factors" in decisions for green cards, visas, or citizenship. While the term "anti-Americanism" remains undefined, the guidance cites existing law against individuals linked to terrorism or "world communism." Critics argue this move could suppress dissent and will likely face legal challenges, whereas supporters maintain it enhances vetting and aligns with the administration's authority.</p>

          <p>A CNBC Fed Survey suggests President Trump will likely choose his economic advisor Kevin Hassett as the next Fed chair, though respondents prefer former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh. Hassett led the "will pick" category, while Warsh was first in the "should pick" category. Concerns exist regarding Fed independence if Hassett, known for favoring low interest rates, is appointed. The survey also forecasts two Fed rate cuts this year amid high inflation and significant tariff impacts, presenting a complex challenge for the central bank's monetary policy.

          <p>Weekly mortgage application volume, encompassing both refinance and home purchase requests, stalled last week following a significant surge in refinance demand the prior week. This occurred despite only a minuscule increase in average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage interest rates. Refinance applications fell 3% week-over-week, though they remain 23% higher than a year ago. Purchase applications saw a slight 0.1% rise, also 23% higher year-over-year, indicating continued homebuyer activity despite economic headwinds and affordability challenges.

          <p>President Trump's declared "crime emergency" in Washington, D.C., has resulted in federal control over the Metropolitan Police Department and deployment of the D.C. National Guard. While his MPD control is limited to 30 days without Congressional approval, his command over the D.C. National Guard lacks clear time limits. Critics, including D.C.'s attorney general who sued to block the police takeover, view these actions as politically motivated and a "flexing of federal muscle." The article examines legal challenges and public opinion as key factors shaping the duration of this unprecedented federal intervention.</p>

The discounter anticipates offsetting higher costs from tariffs, demonstrating strong customer demand across its U.S. and international businesses. CEO Ernie Herrman highlighted robust second-quarter profit results and a strong start to the third quarter, expressing confidence in the company's position. Analysts suggest off-price retailers like TJX are well-positioned to gain market share from traditional department stores due to their purchasing model, which helps mitigate tariff impacts.</p>

          <p>Walmart has initiated a recall of Great Value brand frozen, raw shrimp across 13 U.S. states due to potential Cesium-137 radioactive contamination. The FDA requested the recall after detecting the radioactive isotope in imported shrimp samples and shipping containers from Indonesia. While the detected level was low, the FDA warns that long-term exposure could pose health concerns. Walmart promptly recalled the affected products, which have specific lot codes and best-by dates, advising consumers to discard or return them for a refund.</p>

The coastal Douglas Fir, over 325 feet tall and 450 years old, has lost approximately 50 feet from its top due to the blaze. Firefighters face challenges accessing a heat cavity 280 feet up the trunk. While not at risk of fully burning down due to its massive size, the fire's cause is under investigation, with lightning ruled out.

While the plastics industry emphasizes benefits, environmental groups warn of human exposure risks. The oil industry's heavy investment in chemical production, offsetting declining oil demand from electrification, underscores the economic stakes in this environmental issue.</p>
