          <p>A federal indictment against former NBA player Damon Jones alleges he leaked confidential injury information about LeBron James to sports bettors before a February 2023 Lakers game. Jones, who was acting as an unofficial coach for the Lakers, allegedly texted a co-conspirator to place a large bet on the opposing team before the news of James's absence was public. James himself is not accused of any wrongdoing, and a source familiar with the situation stated he was unaware his information would be used for betting purposes. The charges are part of a broader federal investigation into illegal sports gambling rings.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has reversed his plan to send federal forces to San Francisco following conversations with tech leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. The president also cited a call with Mayor Daniel Lurie, acknowledging the city's progress in addressing crime. This decision is seen as a political victory for Mayor Lurie, who has advocated for local solutions and partnerships with federal agencies like the FBI and DEA rather than a military presence. The city has recently reported significant decreases in crime rates and a resurgence in business and tourism, driven largely by the AI boom.</p>

          <p>State agencies are warning that the ongoing federal government shutdown could halt the distribution of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits in November. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has informed states of insufficient funds to cover the full benefits if the shutdown continues, affecting over 40 million Americans who rely on the program for groceries. Advocates express grave concern, stating that a lapse in funding would force recipients to make impossible choices between food and other essential expenses like rent. While the USDA has a multi-billion dollar contingency fund, it remains unclear if the administration will use it to prevent the disruption.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Congress has passed the IRS MATH Act, a bipartisan bill aimed at making "math error" notices sent to taxpayers easier to understand. These notices are issued when the IRS identifies simple clerical or mathematical mistakes on tax returns, proposing changes and additional taxes owed. The legislation, now awaiting the president's signature, requires the IRS to provide clearer explanations of the error and the steps needed for correction. Lawmakers and taxpayer advocates have argued that the current notices are often confusing and don't adequately explain the 60-day window taxpayers have to respond before the changes become final.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed new sanctions on Russia's two largest crude oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, causing global oil prices to jump by more than 5%. The Treasury Department stated the measures are a response to Moscow's failure to engage in a peace process to end the war in Ukraine and are designed to hinder the Kremlin's ability to fund its military efforts. The move follows the cancellation of a planned meeting between President Trump and Vladimir Putin. These sanctions add another layer of complexity to the global oil market, which is already contending with increased OPEC+ production and economic concerns from trade tensions.</p>

          <p>India has secured the last remaining spot in the Women's Cricket World Cup semi-finals after a decisive 53-run victory over New Zealand in Navi Mumbai.

Despite a weather-interrupted match, India's performance was strong enough to eliminate both New Zealand and Sri Lanka from contention. The victory marks a crucial return to form for India, which had lost its previous three matches, and sets them up to join Australia, South Africa, and England in the knockout stages.</p>

          <p>A devastating marine heat wave in 2023 has led to the "functional extinction" of two foundational coral species, staghorn and elkhorn, along Florida's reef, according to a new report in the journal Science. Researchers found that prolonged, record-high sea temperatures caused between 97% and 100% of these "reef-building" corals to perish, meaning they can no longer perform their vital role in the ecosystem. These species have provided the structural framework for Caribbean reefs for thousands of years, supporting a quarter of all marine life and protecting coastlines. The report underscores the severe and potentially irreversible impact of climate change on marine ecosystems.</p>

The benefit was most pronounced in patients with tumors typically resistant to immunotherapy.

This change in strategy reflects growing U.S. frustration with the Kremlin's refusal to make concessions to end the war in Ukraine. Russia has reacted defiantly, with former President Dmitry Medvedev calling the sanctions an "act of war."

          <p>A U.S. Commerce Department official has denied reports that the Trump administration is negotiating to take equity stakes in quantum computing companies like IonQ and Rigetti Computing. The denial follows a Wall Street Journal story suggesting the government was considering such investments in exchange for federal funding. This clarification comes as the administration has recently taken stakes in other companies deemed vital to national security, such as Intel and MP Materials. Quantum computing is a field of intense focus for governments due to its potential military applications, including the ability to break advanced encryption.</p>

          <p>The unprecedented dominance of a few mega-cap tech stocks, which now constitute nearly 40% of the S&P 500 index, is driving investors to seek alternative assets for diversification. This concentration risk has led to significant investment flows into cash, precious metals, and cryptocurrency ETFs as investors look for uncorrelated returns. While allocations remain relatively small, the trend indicates a growing acceptance of assets like gold and bitcoin as legitimate portfolio hedges. The launch of spot bitcoin ETFs has further legitimized digital assets as tools for institutional and mainstream investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have revealed the sophisticated methods allegedly used in a high-stakes, rigged poker scheme involving NBA figures and organized crime members. The operation allegedly used altered card-shuffling machines that could predict the winning hand, X-ray tables to read face-down cards, and hidden cameras. Victims, referred to as "fish," were reportedly lured into games with the promise of playing alongside celebrity athletes, known as "face cards," and were cheated out of millions of dollars. The scheme was allegedly operated by members of several La Cosa Nostra families who used it as a "financial pipeline" for their criminal activities.</p>

          <p>According to sources familiar with an internal Department of Justice memo, evidence gathered by original prosecutors in the case against New York Attorney General Letitia James appears to undercut some of the indictment's claims. The memo reportedly concluded that James's personal financial benefit from an allegedly falsified mortgage was minimal, around $800 in the first year. Prosecutors also expressed concern that vague federal guidelines on what constitutes "occupancy" for a second home would make it difficult to prove intentional fraud beyond a reasonable doubt. The indictment was secured by an interim U.S. Attorney appointed after the previous one was ousted by President Trump.</p>

Current employees will not be required to obtain a digital ID unless they change jobs. Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasized that the ID will not be compulsory for accessing essential services like healthcare, aiming to "cut the faff" of providing physical identification for tasks like renting a home.

In a letter, the legislators described Beijing as the "world's largest hostage-taker," accusing it of using detentions and exit bans as tools to gain political and economic leverage. The letter specifically highlights the cases of several imprisoned or restricted Americans and Chinese citizens with U.S.-based relatives.

Colombia's statement rejects the destruction of these vessels and comes amid escalating tensions between Colombian President Gustavo Petro and President Donald Trump.

          <p>Rivian Automotive is planning to lay off more than 600 workers, which amounts to roughly 4% of its workforce, as it confronts a more difficult market for electric vehicles. The company is facing headwinds from changing federal regulations, including the elimination of a key tax credit, as well as slower-than-expected consumer demand. The layoffs come as Rivian navigates significant financial losses, reporting a $1.1 billion loss in the second quarter, and a lack of new products until next year.

          <p>With credit card debt at a record high and interest rates soaring, this article outlines several legitimate pathways for consumers to seek debt forgiveness. One primary method is working with a debt relief company, which negotiates with creditors to settle the debt for a reduced lump-sum amount, though this can impact credit scores. Other options include contacting card issuers directly to enroll in hardship programs that may lower rates or pause payments. Additionally, nonprofit credit counseling agencies can arrange debt management plans that consolidate payments and reduce interest, providing a structured way to pay off the full balance.

This shift follows the recent introduction of fees for checked bags, another departure from its traditional value-oriented approach.

          <p>The UK's national inquiry into grooming gangs is facing significant obstacles before it has even formally begun, revealing deep divisions among the survivors it is meant to serve. Key points of contention include the inquiry's scope, with some survivors fearing it will be broadened beyond a specific focus on grooming gangs, and the choice of a chairperson. Some survivors object to a chair with a policing or social work background, citing conflicts of interest, while others believe such experience is valuable. These fundamental disagreements highlight the immense challenge of establishing trust and consensus among victims who have been repeatedly failed by state institutions.</p>
