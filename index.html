          <p>Millions participated in "No Kings" rallies across the U.S. and globally, protesting President Trump's immigration crackdown, troop deployments, and perceived abuses of power. Organizers, including the ACLU, emphasized peaceful dissent against what they term an "authoritarian lurch," with speakers like Bill Nye drawing parallels to past social movements. Republicans, led by House Speaker Mike Johnson, criticized the demonstrations as "Hate America" rallies, alleging they prolonged the federal government shutdown and attracted radical elements. Despite these claims and increased law enforcement presence in states like Texas, the protests largely remained non-violent. Organizers countered that their actions upheld American democratic values and believed the criticism might inadvertently boost participation.</p>

          <p>President Trump confirmed the repatriation of two survivors, from Ecuador and Colombia, after a U.S. military strike targeted a suspected "drug-carrying submarine" in the Caribbean. This incident, the sixth in recent weeks, resulted in two deaths, raising the total fatalities from these operations to at least 29. Trump asserted the strikes were against "narcoterrorists" trafficking fentanyl and other illicit drugs, justifying them under an "armed conflict" with cartels, and confirmed covert CIA actions in Venezuela. Critics, including lawmakers and UN human rights experts, have raised alarms, questioning the legality of the strikes as "extrajudicial executions" and the administration's reliance on a broad interpretation of war powers without providing sufficient evidence.</p>

Users reported being unable to process orders, view their balances, or access their bets, with many encountering website loading issues. Despite a Kalshi spokesperson denying a complete outage and stating the exchange "never stopped functioning properly," the technical disruptions caused considerable user frustration. This incident occurs shortly after Kalshi secured a $300 million Series D funding round, valuing the company at $5 billion, which underscores potential technical growing pains amidst its rapid expansion in real-world event trading.</p>

          <p>Prince Andrew has announced he will no longer use his royal titles, including Duke of York, following renewed scrutiny over his association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. This decision, made in consultation with King Charles III and other senior family members, aims to prevent his "personal issues" from distracting the work of the Royal Family. Andrew will retain his birth title of Prince and continue residing at Royal Lodge. This latest step follows his withdrawal from public duties in 2019 and the return of his military titles in 2022, and it precedes the upcoming publication of a memoir by Virginia Giuffre, who alleged sexual assault by Andrew, claims he consistently denies. Giuffre's family described this development as a "victory."</p>

          <p>This article explores some of America's most iconic dive bars, celebrating their unpretentious atmosphere, rich history, and affordability. Hospitality expert Derek Brown defines these establishments by their "time, grime, and dime," highlighting their authentic charm, consistent regulars, and opportunities for interesting conversations. A recent ranking by Tasting Table, based on reviews and local coverage, featured notable examples such as Cleveland's Harbor Inn Cafe, established in 1895, and New Orleans' famously dark Snake and Jake's Christmas Club Lounge. Many of these bars are over a century old, like Saloon No. 10 in Deadwood, South Dakota, known as the site of Wild Bill Hickok's death, showcasing their enduring cultural significance.</p>

          <p>A charter flight operated by Eastern Airways veered off a runway at Southwest Florida International Airport (RSW) on Saturday afternoon, becoming disabled on a taxiway. The aircraft, typically used for travel between Lee County and Cuba, saw all passengers safely assisted off with no injuries reported, a positive outcome despite the disruption. Emergency services quickly responded, confirming no fire, but the incident necessitated a 90-minute runway closure for mandatory safety inspections. This operational halt led to numerous flight delays, significantly impacting travelers, though airport services eventually resumed, working to mitigate the lingering effects on passenger schedules.</p>

Conversely, 1996 world champion Damon Hill suggested Piastri's own awareness of first-corner risks was insufficient. Piastri indicated he was hit into Norris, while Norris felt he was an innocent victim of other drivers' carelessness, showcasing the varied interpretations of the chaotic opening moments of the race.</p>

          <p>John Sandweg, a former acting director of ICE, has criticized President Trump's immigration crackdown, asserting it places federal agents "in a terrible position" by deploying them in cities for tasks they are not adequately trained for. He noted that Border Patrol agents, typically trained for desert environments, are now operating in urban settings, leading to controversial incidents such as the use of tear gas in Chicago. Sandweg blames the administration for misassigning these units, whose training emphasizes "overwhelming force." In response to concerns over tactics against protesters and journalists, a federal judge ordered agents in Chicago to wear body cameras, highlighting the escalating scrutiny and unprecedented nature of these confrontations.</p>

          <p>A significant Southern California freeway, Interstate 5, experienced a multi-hour closure for a live-fire event at Camp Pendleton, attended by Vice President JD Vance. This occurred despite earlier assurances from the U.S. Marine Corps that public routes would remain open. The "Amphibious Capabilities Demonstration," celebrating the Marine Corps' 250th anniversary, involved firing live 155mm artillery shells over the freeway. California Governor Gavin Newsom vehemently denounced the event as an "absurd show of force" and "dangerous," criticizing the Trump administration for prioritizing ego over public safety. The California Highway Patrol recommended the closure, citing "extreme life safety risk and distraction" to drivers from unexpected, loud explosions, highlighting a contentious federal-state dispute.</p>

The district attorney's office is now tasked with determining the specific number of charges to be filed against the two individuals.

Vedam, who moved to the U.S. at nine months old, was convicted in 1982 but new evidence recently cleared his name. Despite his exoneration, ICE detained him based on a 1988 deportation order linked to his original murder conviction and a minor drug offense that still stands. His family and legal team are now fighting the deportation, arguing his strong ties to the U.S. and exemplary prison conduct should prevent him from being sent to a country where he has no connections.</p>

          <p>This article explores the hidden environmental and social costs behind popular food trends like Dubai chocolate, matcha, and quinoa. The surge in demand for Dubai chocolate has dramatically increased pistachio cultivation, particularly in dry regions like Spain. This requires extensive irrigation, consuming over 10,000 liters of water per kilogram, and promotes monocultures that deplete soil. Similarly, the global matcha craze has led to shortages and price hikes in Japan, threatening domestic tea merchants. Quinoa's superfood status caused prices to soar in Peru and Bolivia, making it unaffordable for locals and leading to unsustainable farming practices that destroy farmland. Fair trade advocates urge diversified farming to mitigate these negative impacts.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump commuted the prison sentence of former Republican Congressman George Santos, resulting in his immediate release after serving less than three months of an 87-month term. Santos had pleaded guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft, having been expelled from Congress in December 2023 for extensive lies about his background and numerous federal charges. Trump justified the commutation by comparing Santos's conduct to that of Senator Richard Blumenthal, whom Trump accused of misrepresenting military service, and by asserting Santos was "horribly mistreated" in solitary confinement. The decision was reportedly influenced by appeals from Santos's friends and allies, along with his personal writings detailing his prison conditions.</p>

This figure is concerning as experts recommend having ten times one's salary saved by retirement age. The article suggests this discrepancy often arises from high earners prioritizing immediate luxuries over long-term financial security, potentially creating a significant retirement savings gap.

Rooted in a Pentecostal church upbringing, D'Angelo masterfully blended the spiritual and secular, crafting songs about sex with gospel chords and infusing social commentary, particularly in his final album, "Black Messiah," which explored themes of climate change and racial strife, released to meet the moment of the Ferguson uprisings.</p>

          <p>A new study, "Crime and Migration: Perception in German Media," by journalism professor Thomas Hestermann, reveals a "drastic distortion" in German media reporting since 2015. It found that foreign suspects are mentioned three times more often than their actual share in police statistics, a significant increase since the influx of migrants in 2015. Hestermann argues that this intuitive, often unintentional, pattern of reporting aligns with a right-wing populist agenda, influencing public perception of violent crime and threat. Criminologist Gina Wollinger terms this "migrantization" of crime, stressing that crime correlates with poverty and lack of prospects, not origin. The study advocates for greater editorial diversity to combat this bias.</p>
