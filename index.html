          <p>President Trump addressed the ongoing negotiations for a nuclear deal between Iran and the U.S., stating that he advised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu against disrupting the talks because a solution was near. Trump expressed optimism that a deal could be reached soon, which he believes would prevent a violent outcome. He noted that while Iran still needs to agree to the final stages of the document, progress has been made, and a sensible agreement could be reached in the coming weeks. The article suggests a potential breakthrough in nuclear negotiations, aiming for a peaceful resolution with Iran.

          <p>President Trump defended his tariff strategy, dismissing criticism that he always backs down from imposing tariffs, a concept dubbed the "TACO trade." He argued that his tariff threats have been instrumental in jumpstarting trade talks between the U.S. and the European Union. Trump highlighted that after announcing new tariffs, the EU expressed willingness to meet anytime, suggesting his approach is a negotiation tactic rather than a sign of weakness. Stocks initially fell after Trump's tariff announcement but rallied following the delay, indicating market sensitivity to trade policy. The article suggests that Trump views tariffs as a tool to gain leverage in trade negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Commission is planning to establish a "maritime security hub" in the Black Sea region to counter Russian influence and enhance collaboration with neighboring countries like Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia. This initiative aims to improve security by increasing situational awareness, sharing information, and monitoring potential threats, including attacks on critical undersea infrastructure and shipping routes. The hub could also help monitor a potential future ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine and support the development of regional transport infrastructure to improve military mobility.

The Trump Labor Department's move signals a more open approach to digital assets in 401(k)s, but employers still have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of investors.

Toyota's strategy aligns with potential shifts in federal fuel economy standards and emissions regulations, including a possible elimination of California's Advanced Clean Cars II rule.

          <p>President Trump has voiced growing frustration with Vladimir Putin over Russia's intensified strikes on Ukraine, labeling Putin as having gone "absolutely CRAZY!" While Trump has previously emphasized his personal relationship with Putin, these comments indicate a shift in tone. The article questions whether Trump will impose any punitive measures against Russia and notes that Trump had promised to end the war on Day 1 in office. The Kremlin dismissed Trump's criticism as an "emotional reaction," while analysts suggest Putin is not interested in stopping the war.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the government acted improperly in stripping Kseniia Petrova, a Russian scientist at Harvard, of her visa for failing to declare research samples. Judge Christina Reiss stated there was no legal basis for the customs officer's actions and expressed concern for Petrova's safety if deported to Russia. Petrova was detained after carrying frog embryos from an affiliate laboratory at her supervisor's request. The case has drawn attention from the Trump administration, and felony smuggling charges were unsealed against Petrova, leading to her transfer to U.S. Marshals Service custody.</p>

          <p>A new study from Tokyo University of Agriculture reveals that domestic cats can differentiate between their owner's scent and that of a stranger. The research found that cats spent significantly more time sniffing tubes containing the odors of unknown people compared to their owner's smell. This suggests cats can discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar humans based on their odour, although it remains unclear if they can identify specific people. The study adds to existing knowledge about cats' ability to use their sense of smell to recognize and communicate with other cats and potentially humans.</p>
