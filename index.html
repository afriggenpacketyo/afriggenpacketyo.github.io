          <p>The Trump administration has appealed to the Supreme Court, requesting an expedited review of a lower court's decision that deemed most of his "reciprocal tariffs" illegal. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the president overstepped his authority by using emergency powers to impose levies, a power constitutionally vested in Congress. The administration argues the ruling creates legal uncertainty that undermines national security and diplomacy, with a potential Supreme Court decision expected by the summer of 2026.</p>

          <p>Director Aziz Ansari has stated that actor Bill Murray was "devastated" by misconduct allegations that led to the suspension of their film, "Being Mortal," in 2022. The production was halted after a female staffer accused Murray of inappropriate behavior, leading to a reported $100,000 settlement. Murray has since reflected on the incident, which he described as an attempt at humor that was misinterpreted, while Ansari expressed hope that the film could still be completed someday.</p>

Jackson, who has consistently denied the claims and called them a "political hit job," celebrated the reinstatement on social media.</p>

          <p>A bill has advanced to the Texas governor that would permit state residents to sue out-of-state providers of abortion-inducing drugs for up to $100,000. This measure aims to enforce the state's abortion ban by targeting the most common method of abortion, though it exempts the women who receive the pills from liability. While supporters see it as a necessary enforcement tool, opponents argue it creates a chilling effect and encourages vigilantism, setting the stage for significant legal challenges.</p>

          <p>Argentine authorities have recovered "Portrait of a Lady," an 18th-century painting by Giuseppe Ghislandi that was looted by the Nazis during World War II. The artwork, once part of Dutch-Jewish collector Jacques Goudstikker's collection, was discovered after it appeared in an online real estate listing connected to the daughter of a former Nazi lawyer. The painting is reported to be in good condition, and the individuals who possessed it have been placed under house arrest pending a hearing.</p>

          <p>The Trades Union Congress (TUC), a major UK union group, is calling on Chancellor Rachel Reeves to consider implementing wealth taxes in the upcoming budget to fund public services. The TUC's general secretary suggested new taxes on windfall profits for banks, online gaming companies, and equalizing capital gains tax with income tax. The Treasury responded by stating the government believes it has already achieved the right balance in taxing the wealthy, though the debate within the Labour movement continues over how to fund services while adhering to fiscal rules.

          <p>The United Arab Emirates has issued a strong warning to Israel, stating that any move to annex the occupied West Bank would be a "red line" and would undermine the 2020 Abraham Accords. A senior Emirati official emphasized that such an action would be the "death knell" for the two-state solution. The statement came after Israel's far-right Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, unveiled a proposal for annexing approximately 82% of the West Bank, escalating regional tensions over the future of the Palestinian territories.</p>
