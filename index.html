          <p>Actress Jessica Alba recently shared a series of summer photos on Instagram, including one of herself in a bikini, shortly after her ex-husband Cash Warren was publicly seen with a new partner. Warren was photographed with model Hana Sun Doerr in Beverly Hills, while Alba has also been linked to actor Danny Ramirez since her divorce filing. Alba announced her separation from Warren in January after nearly 17 years of marriage, citing irreconcilable differences in the official divorce documents. The former couple shares three children and has been awarded joint custody.</p>

          <p>Ahn Hak-sop, a 95-year-old former North Korean prisoner of war, was turned away in his attempt to cross the border from South to North Korea, where he wishes to be buried. Captured in 1953, he spent over 42 years in a South Korean prison for refusing to renounce his communist sympathies and has lived near the border since his release. Despite his age and poor health, Ahn remains a staunch believer in the North Korean regime's ideology, viewing the U.S. military presence in the South as a form of colonialism preventing reunification. His journey highlights the deep, lingering divisions and personal costs of the Korean War.</p>

          <p>Villanova University issued an active shooter alert on its Pennsylvania campus, prompting a lockdown and a large police response centered around the Law School's Scarpa Hall. Students and staff were instructed to shelter in place as law enforcement officers from multiple agencies searched and cleared buildings. The Radnor Township Police Department confirmed that there were no reported victims, although the incident remained active while the search was ongoing. Officials believe someone with a firearm was on campus, and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro advised the public to avoid the area while the investigation continued.</p>

          <p>President Trump visited federal law enforcement officers in Washington D.C., expressing his gratitude and distributing food amidst a significant anti-crime initiative. This operation has brought approximately 2,000 National Guard members and a surge of federal agents into the city. During a radio interview, Trump mentioned that this deployment serves as a model he may replicate in other American cities to combat crime. The initiative has faced criticism from local officials, who argue that violent crime rates in the district have been declining and that the federal intervention is an unnecessary overreach into the city's autonomy.</p>

          <p>In a speech in Peachtree City, Georgia, Vice President JD Vance promoted President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," framing it as the largest tax cut for families in U.S. history. Vance highlighted provisions such as an increased child tax credit and the elimination of taxes on tips and overtime, while attacking Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff for voting against the measure. The event served as a preview of the Republican campaign strategy for the upcoming midterm elections.

          <p>China is considering its first revision to a 1998 pricing law to address "involution," a term for hyper-competitive, often loss-making business practices that have plagued industries like solar panel manufacturing. The proposed amendment, drafted by top economic planners, aims to combat cutthroat price wars that have led to substantial industry losses and oversupply. For instance, the solar industry has seen a recent 20% price rebound following official calls to end such destructive competition. The revision seeks to establish a more sustainable market equilibrium by regulating pricing and preventing companies from engaging in unsustainable, aggressive price-slashing tactics.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, has permitted the Trump administration to proceed with canceling hundreds of millions of dollars in National Institutes of Health (NIH) research grants. These grants are tied to topics the administration has targeted, including diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), gender identity, and vaccine hesitancy. The ruling lifts a lower court's order that had blocked the cancellations, although the underlying legal challenge from sixteen states and research groups will continue. The administration argued it has the authority to direct funding toward its policy objectives, while opponents warned of irreversible harm to public health and scientific progress.</p>

          <p>Several prominent news publications, including Wired and Business Insider, have removed articles after discovering they were written by a freelance journalist persona, "Margaux Blanchard," that appears to be AI-generated. The issue came to light when an editor at another magazine received a suspicious pitch from Blanchard that seemed fabricated and AI-written. Investigations revealed that published stories contained unverifiable sources and details, prompting the outlets to retract the content and issue editor's notes. This incident highlights the growing challenge newsrooms face in detecting sophisticated AI-generated misinformation and has led to bolstered verification protocols at the affected publications.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace achieved a historic 1-0 victory over Fredrikstad in the Uefa Conference League play-off, marking their first-ever win in a European competition.

Manager Oliver Glasner confirmed Eze's departure post-match, shifting focus to the need for new signings before the transfer window closes.

          <p>A financial strategy known as a 351 conversion is gaining traction among wealthy investors as a way to defer capital gains taxes on appreciated assets. The method involves exchanging stocks from a portfolio into shares of a new or existing exchange-traded fund (ETF) before it is publicly launched. This allows the investor to postpone paying taxes on the profits until they sell the ETF shares. The process has strict diversification requirements, mandating that no single stock can exceed 25% of the contributed assets. While effective, the strategy has high investment minimums and can limit future investment flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bad Bunny's sold-out concert residency in San Juan has inspired a wave of tourism and a corresponding surge in demand for tattoos related to the artist and Puerto Rican culture. Local tattoo studios are experiencing an unexpected boom, with both locals and visitors seeking permanent souvenirs like the island's national flower, the coquí frog, and lyrics from his new album. Tattoo artists are using the opportunity to educate clients, particularly non-Puerto Ricans, about the cultural significance of the symbols they choose. The trend highlights the deep connection between the artist's music and the island's cultural identity.</p>

          <p>Actress Kirsten Dunst has publicly stated her interest in joining the sequel to the highly successful "A Minecraft Movie," citing a desire to participate in a financially lucrative project. In a recent interview, she half-jokingly remarked, "Maybe I can make a movie where I don’t lose money?" Dunst, whose career began at age three, recently starred in the critically acclaimed but moderately profitable film "Civil War." In contrast, "A Minecraft Movie" grossed over $955 million worldwide, a figure that surpasses the combined box office of her last three films, underscoring the financial appeal of major studio blockbusters.</p>

          <p>During immigration raids in Los Angeles this summer, protesters targeted hotels where ICE and CBP agents were staying, leading the U.S. military to compile a list of "LA Hotels to Avoid." Public records show that military officials sought to prevent their personnel from being "harassed" by activists who staged "No sleep for ICE" rallies outside the establishments. The documents, obtained by a government transparency group, suggest the protests were effective in disrupting the Trump administration's immigration operations. Activists view the military's response as confirmation that their strategy of pressuring hotels successfully hindered the federal agents' activities in the city.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has announced that he has instructed his team to begin negotiations for the release of all remaining hostages held in Gaza. This move comes as he also approved military plans for an assault on Gaza City, stating that defeating Hamas and freeing the hostages are interconnected goals. Hamas had previously agreed to a 60-day ceasefire proposal from mediators, but Netanyahu's statement indicates Israel is not accepting the current terms and is seeking a new round of talks. The Israeli military has warned of a planned evacuation of Gaza City's population ahead of the potential offensive.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant jump in utility bills across several East Coast states is emerging as a potential key issue in upcoming elections. Residents in states served by grid operator PJM Interconnection have seen sharp increases, with some New Jersey customers facing a 17-20% hike in their monthly bills. PJM attributes the rising costs to increased energy demand from data centers and manufacturing, while critics blame the operator for delaying the integration of cheaper renewable energy sources. With affordability being a top concern for voters, politicians are already seizing on the issue, signaling that energy prices could heavily influence electoral outcomes.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell faces a challenging situation as he prepares for his annual speech at the Jackson Hole economic symposium. He must address a complex economic landscape with slowing job growth and rising inflation, all while facing political pressure from President Trump to cut interest rates. Investors and economists will be closely watching for any hints about the Fed's next monetary policy decision in September. However, Powell is expected to maintain the central bank's data-dependent stance, avoiding any firm commitments to avoid being cornered by political or market expectations ahead of crucial upcoming economic reports.</p>
