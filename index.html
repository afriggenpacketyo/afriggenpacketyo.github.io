          <p>Mattel is partnering with OpenAI to develop generative AI-powered toys and games, aiming to innovate and stay ahead in the evolving tech landscape. The collaboration seeks to combine Mattel's popular brands, like Barbie and Hot Wheels, with OpenAI's AI capabilities to create new products and experiences. Mattel emphasizes that the AI will be used safely and securely in age-appropriate play experiences, and the company plans to use OpenAI's business tools to improve product development. Mattel has been working to leverage its intellectual property into movies, television, and mobile games in the face of flagging toy sales, and the company has paused its full-year guidance for 2025 citing tariff-driven uncertainty.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is bracing for potential escalation in the Middle East as President Trump sends mixed signals regarding a possible Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear facilities. While the U.S. continues to pursue a diplomatic deal with Tehran, Israel is reportedly considering military action, prompting the State Department to issue a security alert for Americans in the region. Tensions are escalating as the U.S. plans to proceed with a sixth round of nuclear negotiations with Iran in Oman, despite the uncertainty surrounding potential military action. The negotiations have hit a wall over Iran's ability to enrich uranium, a red line for both sides, and the U.S. embassy in Baghdad has issued a partial evacuation order for non-essential staff.</p>

          <p>A federal judge is evaluating whether to temporarily restrict President Trump's use of National Guard troops and U.S. Marines for federal immigration enforcement in Los Angeles. The hearing in San Francisco marks the first legal challenge to Mr. Trump's decision to place over 4,000 California National Guard members under federal control and send 700 Marines to Los Angeles to protect ICE agents during immigration arrests. California Governor Gavin Newsom sued the Trump administration, arguing that the president unlawfully bypassed him when calling the National Guard into service without his permission. The Justice Department maintains the president has the authority under Title 10, while the judge expressed concerns about potential overreach of executive power.</p>

          <p>For the fourth consecutive night, Portadown, Northern Ireland, experienced disorder as crowds threw masonry at police, although at a lower level than earlier in the week. The unrest follows a peaceful protest regarding an alleged sexual assault in Ballymena, with police using loudspeakers to warn of baton rounds if crowds didn't disperse. In Ballymena, where the violence began, a police presence remains, though rioters appeared to have stayed away after three nights of violent disorder. Meanwhile, an anti-racism protest in west Belfast, attended by around 100 people, passed off peacefully, and the PSNI Chief Constable described the violence as "racist thuggery" targeted at ethnic minorities.</p>

Padilla, seeking more information on the administration's immigration enforcement actions, questioned Noem before being pushed out of the room. DHS claimed Padilla interrupted without identifying himself or wearing his Senate security pin, leading officers to believe he was an attacker.

The cancellation is attributed to economic problems with the venue, with the new track league planning to announce new investors next week and looking towards 2026.

Senator Josh Hawley threatened investigations into organizations like Chirla, accusing them of "bankrolling civil unrest" in Los Angeles. Advocacy groups reject these accusations, emphasizing their commitment to non-violent advocacy and democratic values. The attacks come after advocates and lawyers provided assistance to those arrested and detained during recent immigration raids, sparking protests and raising concerns about the suppression of free speech and the intimidation of groups serving immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>Congressional Democrats and a Republican are criticizing the multimillion-dollar cost of the Army's 250th anniversary parade, which is scheduled to coincide with President Trump's 79th birthday. The Army has allocated between $25 million and $45 million for the parade, which will include 6,700 troops and military equipment staged on the National Mall. Critics argue that the money could be better spent on supporting military families or medical research, while some compare the parade to displays seen in authoritarian regimes. Protests are planned to counterprogram the parade, and Trump has warned that protesters will be met with "heavy force."</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has seemingly reversed his stance on Chinese students studying in the United States, expressing support for them and pledging to help them remain in the country after graduation. This contrasts with previous administration initiatives aimed at limiting or blocking international students due to national security concerns. Trump stated that having Chinese nationals study in the US is beneficial for both the schools and the country, and he supports allowing them to work for American companies after completing their studies. He noted that if they are not allowed to stay, they would return to their countries and start businesses there.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece suggests that while a US-China trade truce is emerging, there is little room for optimism unless Washington reorients its trade and foreign policy thinking. The piece notes that China's tightening of rare earth exports, which impacted US car manufacturers and defense companies, was a key reason for Trump to engage with Xi. The author argues that Trump's approach to China is based on a misdiagnosis of the problem, hindering the possibility of lasting solutions. The negotiations may have de-escalated tensions, but a fundamental shift in Washington's approach is needed for true progress.</p>

          <p>The Senate is considering revisions to President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," focusing on key provisions like SNAP, SALT, border funding, Medicaid, and energy tax credits. Changes are expected to lessen the burden on states imposed by the House's SNAP proposal and lower the cap on state and local tax deductions. Senator Rand Paul is advocating for lowering the amount of money allocated for border security, while Medicaid changes remain uncertain. The goal is to rein in government costs and put federal programs on a more sustainable fiscal path, but some changes could face challenges in the House.</p>
