          <p>Zohran Mamdani's Democratic Socialist victory in New York's mayoral primary has exposed a deep rift within the Democratic party. Moderate Democrats, business leaders, and billionaires are now scrambling to find and fund a viable centrist or independent candidate to challenge him in the general election. In response, Mamdani is actively engaging with all groups, including concerned business executives, to build a broad coalition. The split highlights the ongoing ideological battle between the party's progressive and establishment wings for control of the city's future.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the University of Florida suggests that body fat percentage is a far more accurate predictor of mortality risk than the commonly used Body Mass Index (BMI). Researchers found that individuals with high body fat were 78% more likely to die over a 15-year period than those with healthy levels. The study criticizes BMI as "deeply flawed" because it cannot distinguish between muscle and fat mass. Experts believe it is time to adopt more accurate, accessible alternatives like bioelectrical impedance analysis as a standard health metric.</p>

          <p>This opinion article reflects on President Trump's on-camera use of an expletive when discussing the conflict between Israel and Iran. The author argues that while unconventional for a world leader, the moment came across as authentic and relatable to many who share similar frustrations. The piece suggests that judicious swearing could help politicians appear more human and cut through scripted spin, though it doesn't equate profanity with honesty. It posits that such moments can forcefully convey a message when traditional diplomatic language fails to capture public sentiment.</p>

          <p>President Trump's administration experienced a momentous week, marked by both significant wins and pressing challenges that could define his presidency. Key victories included a favorable Supreme Court ruling limiting nationwide injunctions against his executive orders and increased defense spending commitments from NATO allies. However, major hurdles remain, including a bottleneck of unfinished trade deals ahead of a July deadline and the uncertain fate of his comprehensive tax and policy bill in the Senate. The combination of events highlights a period of high-stakes activity for the White House both domestically and abroad.</p>

          <p>American consumers may face higher prices and shortages of fireworks for the upcoming Fourth of July celebrations due to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The U.S. imports nearly all of its consumer and professional fireworks from China, which are now subject to significant import taxes. This has forced some importers to halt deliveries and retailers to raise prices multiple times. The industry is particularly concerned about the impact on the nation's 250th birthday celebration in 2026, hoping for a tariff reprieve to avoid dampening the festivities.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has postponed its decision on a Louisiana congressional redistricting case, scheduling it for re-argument in the next term. The case, which questions whether a new map with a second majority-Black district constitutes an illegal racial gerrymander, could have significant implications for the Voting Rights Act. Legal experts are puzzled by the delay and concerned that the court's conservative majority might further weaken protections against racial discrimination in elections. The outcome will be closely watched by voting rights advocates as other legal challenges to the Act loom.</p>

Ukrainian military experts and officials, including President Zelenskyy, view the development of these interceptor drones as a critical, unconventional strategy.

Among the bodies to be abolished are patient advocacy group Healthwatch England and the National Guardian's Office for whistleblowers.

          <p>Supporters of LGBTQ+ rights from over 30 countries are expected to participate in the Budapest Pride march, defying a police ban under Hungary's controversial "child-protection" legislation. The event has become a symbol of resistance against the nationalist government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban and its repression of civil liberties. Despite the risk of fines and potential jail time for organizers, the march has garnered support from numerous embassies and European officials. The situation highlights the growing tension between Hungary's government and advocates for democratic freedoms ahead of next year's elections.</p>

          <p>Former heavyweight world champion Deontay Wilder made a successful, albeit low-key, return to boxing with a seventh-round stoppage victory over Tyrrell Herndon. After three defeats in his previous four fights, this was Wilder's first win since October 2022 and marked what he calls a "new beginning." The 39-year-old stated he has been working with a sports psychologist to repair himself emotionally and rekindle his love for the sport. While the dominant performance was not as explosive as his past victories, it puts the "Bronze Bomber" back in the win column.</p>

          <p>A rift has emerged within Germany's coalition government over the role of nuclear energy, exposing differing priorities between the Economy and Environment ministries. The dispute was highlighted when Economy Minister Katherina Reiche attended a meeting of pro-nuclear EU states, despite Germany's official nuclear phase-out. This move angered her Social Democratic colleague, who insists Germany is focused on renewables. The disagreement points to a larger, unresolved debate within the government on how to achieve climate neutrality, competitiveness, and energy sovereignty, particularly with plans for new gas-fired power plants also causing contention.</p>

          <p>A team from China's Nankai University has completed the world's first human trial of a brain-computer interface (BCI) implanted via blood vessels, a minimally invasive alternative to open-skull surgery. In the trial, a paralyzed patient successfully regained some limb movement after surgeons inserted a stent electrode into an intracranial blood vessel. This technique, which avoids direct brain surgery, significantly reduces risk and recovery time compared to methods used by companies like Elon Musk's Neuralink. The breakthrough represents a major advancement in neurotechnology, offering new hope for patients with paralysis.</p>

          <h2>China Enhances Social Safety Net for Populations Affected by Flood Diversion Schemes</h2>

          <p>In response to increasingly extreme rainfall, China has expanded its compensation rules for people affected by flood diversion and storage schemes. The central government will now cover 70% of compensation funds, and for the first time, payments will be made for the loss of livestock and poultry. This policy change comes after nearly one million people were relocated in Hebei province last summer, sparking social tensions over sacrificed homes and farms. The move aims to provide greater economic security for communities in designated flood-prone areas as China grapples with more frequent and intense weather events.</p>

          <p>A Shandong Airlines flight was forced to make an emergency landing in Nanjing after passengers reported loud bangs, severe shaking, and a distinct burning smell in the cabin. One passenger described the experience as "terrifying," noting the plane shook from side to side for several minutes. Despite the frightening situation, the captain announced the emergency landing and managed the process smoothly, earning praise from those on board. All affected passengers were safely accommodated, and another aircraft was dispatched to continue the journey, with emergency vehicles meeting the plane upon its safe arrival.</p>

          <p>U.S. federal prosecutors have charged 11 people in connection with a massive, Russia-based scheme that attempted to defraud the Medicare program of $10.6 billion. The transnational criminal organization allegedly purchased legitimate medical equipment companies and used stolen information from over a million Medicare recipients to submit fraudulent claims. While the claims were for expensive medical equipment, no products were ever delivered. The group successfully received approximately $41 million from Medicare and an estimated $900 million from supplemental insurers before the widespread fraud was uncovered and its members were charged.</p>
