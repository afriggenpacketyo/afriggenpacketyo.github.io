          <p>In Gaza, the start of September brings not sharpened pencils but bombed-out buildings and worsening famine, severely disrupting education. Teachers like Alaa Abu Sabt volunteer in makeshift tents, lacking basic supplies and a proper learning environment. Children, many traumatized by loss and displacement, struggle with fundamental skills, while virtual schooling efforts are largely ineffective due to lack of resources. This article highlights how survival priorities have overshadowed education, with nearly all schools damaged or destroyed and families facing immense hardship.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's proposal to impose a $100,000 application fee for H-1B foreign worker visas has created significant uncertainty and chaos across the US tech sector and universities. Economists warn of a "tremendous economic loss" due to potential talent drain, with many multinational companies considering relocating operations. Universities and startups, heavily reliant on H-1B visas, would be particularly impacted, potentially hindering innovation in critical industries like AI. While the administration claims the system is exploited, critics argue the move is an astronomical penalty that ignores existing regulations and long-term economic benefits provided by these workers.

          <p>At the Berlin international literature festival, renowned authors discussed the perceived decline of free speech and the rise of authoritarian ideology in the US during Donald Trump's second presidential term. Historian William Hitchcock noted the destabilization of previously taken-for-granted freedoms, while Pulitzer Prize-winning author Elizabeth Kolbert highlighted media companies facing lawsuits, creating an atmosphere of caution. Novelist Jamaica Kincaid suggested this moment could transform American life, making liberals feel a vulnerability previously known primarily by African Americans. The article delves into the authors' perspectives on Trump's policies, media scrutiny, and the underlying role of racism in contemporary American politics, with some questioning if his administration aligns with indicators of fascism.</p>

          <h2>Expert Strategies for Securing Lower Mortgage Rates This October</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-23 10:03:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite recent declines, mortgage rates remain high for many homebuyers and refinancers. Experts recommend several strategies to secure a lower rate this October, including comparing offers from multiple lenders, as rates vary significantly. Improving one's credit score is crucial, especially for conventional loans, as higher scores lead to better rates. Considering adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) or shorter-term loans can also offer initial savings, though with trade-offs in future rate adjustments or higher monthly payments. Additionally, buying mortgage points can reduce the interest rate for the loan's duration, a smart move if planning to stay in the home long enough to break even on the upfront cost.

          <p>Disney announced the return of 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' to ABC after a temporary suspension following controversial comments made by the host linking a conservative activist's alleged killer to President Donald Trump's MAGA movement.

Following discussions with Kimmel, Disney CEO Bob Iger and co-chair Dana Walden decided to reinstate the program.

          <p>The Trump administration has dismissed nearly 20 more immigration judges this month, adding to over 80 firings this year, despite a record-high backlog of nearly 4 million cases. These terminations, some at the end of probationary periods, are criticized by union leaders as illogical and costly, undermining due process and wasting taxpayer dollars. Advocates argue the focus on enforcement is reducing limited due process for immigrants, as dismissed judges are replaced with less experienced adjudicators or not at all. The firings have created a culture of fear, with many employees opting for voluntary resignation programs, further exacerbating delays in immigration case resolutions. The article highlights a contentious intersection of immigration policy and judicial capacity.</p>

          <p>After a robust first half of 2025, single-family home rent growth began to slow in July, indicating potential challenges for landlords as consumer struggles intensify. According to Cotality data, prices increased 2.3% year-over-year, a decrease from the 3.1% average a year prior and below pre-pandemic growth levels. Monthly gains also softened significantly, falling below historical averages. While some markets like Chicago still show strong growth, others such as Miami have seen rent growth stagnate, a stark contrast to the pandemic-driven surges. This article suggests that the cooling trend, affecting all price points, could lead single-family rental REITs to re-evaluate their expansion strategies.</p>

          <p>Indonesia and the EU have signed a comprehensive economic partnership agreement, granting zero-tariff access for about 80% of Indonesian exports, including palm oil, to Europe.

This new framework requires exporters to prove their palm oil does not originate from recently deforested areas, posing a major challenge for smallholders who control over 42% of plantations. Experts warn that without a national traceability system recognized by the EU, the zero-tariff benefit could be negated, risking exclusion from supply chains and perpetuating the negative stigma of environmentally destructive palm oil production.</p>

          <p>As of September 22, 2025, the price of gold stands at $3,728.61 per ounce, a figure subject to constant fluctuations driven by various market factors. This article explains that gold's value is primarily influenced by supply and demand, economic conditions, and inflation, often serving as a safe-haven asset during uncertainty. Interest rates also play a role, with lower rates making gold more attractive due to minimal opportunity cost. Geopolitical instability, currency movements, market sentiment, and central bank policies further contribute to price volatility. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for investors monitoring the precious metal's performance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prosecutors allege that the man accused of shooting at an ABC affiliate station in Sacramento, California, may have been motivated by the network's temporary suspension of talk show host Jimmy Kimmel. District Attorney Thien Ho cited 'circumstantial evidence,' including notes left behind by the suspect, Anibal Hernandez Santana, suggesting a political motive. Kimmel had criticized the Trump administration's response to the Charlie Kirk killing, leading to FCC threats against ABC's broadcast licenses. This article highlights the escalating tensions around media commentary and political violence, as Hernandez faces federal charges for firearm offenses and interfering with a radio communication station. Despite Disney reinstating Kimmel's show, Sinclair, a major affiliate owner, will continue to preempt it.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris admitted on 'Good Morning America' that she regrets not personally challenging former President Joe Biden's decision to run for reelection, describing her inaction as 'reckless.' In her memoir, '107 Days,' Harris initially stated the decision was Biden's alone, but she has since reflected on her silence. She explained that her hesitation stemmed from a fear of appearing 'self-serving,' which might undermine her credibility. This article highlights Harris's nuanced position, asserting that her concerns about his reelection bid were separate from her consistent admiration for his capacity to serve as president, indicating a complex dynamic within the former administration.</p>

          <p>Homeowners can leverage their home equity through a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) to save money this October, particularly for consolidating high-interest debt or financing major expenses. With average HELOC rates significantly lower than credit card or personal loan rates, homeowners can substantially reduce monthly payments and total interest paid. Experts suggest that a potential upcoming Fed rate cut could further benefit HELOC borrowers, as these rates are directly tied to Fed policy. This article also highlights the flexibility of HELOCs, which allow drawing funds as needed, and potential tax advantages if used for home improvements, making them a valuable financial tool when used responsibly.

          <p>Former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is campaigning against Proposition 50, a November California ballot measure proposed by state Democrats that would replace independent redistricting with partisan-crafted congressional districts. Schwarzenegger, a long-time champion of political reform, argues the measure serves entrenched politicians rather than voters, threatening democracy. The initiative follows President Trump's encouragement for GOP-led states to redraw districts, prompting California Democrats to counter with a mid-decade redistricting plan to boost their party's congressional ranks. This article highlights the significant funding behind the opposition, led by GOP donor Charles Munger Jr., underscoring a heated battle over electoral boundaries in a closely divided Congress.

This article highlights the widespread condemnation of Trump's statements by medical experts and organizations like the National Autistic Society, who label his remarks as dangerous misinformation. While some research suggests a potential association requiring further study, the consensus among health authorities is that paracetamol remains the safest painkiller for pregnant women, and untreated fever poses a greater risk.

The article highlights the stalling of a working group on illicit synthetic drugs, including fentanyl, due to eroded trust and political baggage from COVID-19 origins investigations and US tariffs.
