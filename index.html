          <p>President Trump's decision to close a tariff loophole on low-value shipments from China is expected to significantly impact delivery companies like UPS, FedEx, and DHL. The loophole, known as the de minimis exemption, allowed goods worth $800 or less to enter the U.S. without tariffs, fueling a surge in e-commerce shipments from China. UPS anticipates a 25% decline in revenue from China-to-U.S. shipments, leading to job cuts and macroeconomic uncertainty.
