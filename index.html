          <p>A tragic collision between a small sailboat carrying summer campers and a barge near Miami Beach resulted in the deaths of two children, aged 7 and 13. Two other children remain in critical condition, while a 12-year-old and an adult counselor were rescued. The incident occurred on Biscayne Bay, throwing all six people aboard the sailboat into the water. The children were part of a summer sailing camp affiliated with the Miami Yacht Club, and authorities are continuing their investigation into the accident.</p>

Tamura, 27, has a documented mental health history and played high school football, prompting ongoing investigations into his motive. One NFL employee was also injured in the attack.</p>

          <p>Boeing significantly cut its quarterly losses and saw a jump in sales, delivering the most airplanes since 2018, signaling potential recovery from years of crises. The aerospace giant reported a $176 million loss, down from $1.09 billion a year prior, with revenue up 35%. CEO Kelly Ortberg expressed optimism for 2025 as a "turnaround year," citing improved deliveries and production stability. However, challenges remain, including delayed certification for new 737 Max models and potential labor strikes, despite the positive financial report. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article argues that Benjamin Netanyahu's decisions regarding the Gaza war and humanitarian aid have been corrupted by his need to appease extreme right-wing coalition allies. Faced with pressure to provide aid internationally and demands to ethnically cleanse Gaza domestically, Israel's policies have been contradictory. The piece details how Hamas's co-option of aid and Israel's inconsistent responses have led to the current famine, further exacerbated by shifts in international and internal political pressures. It concludes that Palestinians and Israelis continue to pay the price for Netanyahu's compromised decision-making.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the 2026 midterms, Republicans are pushing for unusual mid-decade redistricting in states like Texas to gain more House seats. This strategy aims to solidify their slim majority, potentially carving out five additional Republican-leaning districts. While Ohio and Missouri also show similar efforts, Democrats face limitations due to independent commissions in their trifecta states. This article explores the implications of such gerrymandering, including the potential for a "mutually assured destruction" scenario if Democrats like Gavin Newsom retaliate, raising concerns about trust in the political system.</p>
