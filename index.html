          <p>The direct action group Palestine Action is set to be officially banned in the United Kingdom after a High Court judge denied its request for a temporary block on the government's decision. This proscription, which amends the Terrorism Act 2000, makes supporting the group a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The government pursued the ban following actions claimed by the group that caused an estimated £7 million in damages. The group's co-founder condemned the move as an "authoritarian abuse" of power and stated they would seek an urgent appeal.</p>

          <p>Authorities have found human remains at the scene of a massive explosion and fire at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, California. The incident, which occurred at a facility owned by Devastating Pyrotechnics, left seven people unaccounted for, and officials have not yet made a positive identification of the remains. Investigations revealed the facility was operating without the necessary local licenses for storing fireworks on the agricultural property. The federal Bureau ofAlcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is assisting in the investigation of the blast, which injured two people and burned approximately 80 acres.</p>

          <p>During a speech in Iowa, President Donald Trump suggested hosting a UFC fight on the White House grounds as part of the nation's 250th anniversary celebrations next year. He stated that he had discussed the idea with UFC CEO Dana White, envisioning an event for 20,000 to 25,000 people. If the proposal were to proceed, it would mark the first time a major sporting event has been held at the White House. The president, a known fan of the sport, has frequently attended UFC events since returning to office.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is facing calls for an investigation from Mayor Eric Adams and former Governor Andrew Cuomo over allegations he falsely identified as African American on a 2009 Columbia University application. Mamdani, who is of Indian descent but was born in Uganda, stated he was trying to reflect his complex background. While his opponents condemned the act as potentially fraudulent, Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa argued the controversy is a distraction that makes Mamdani a martyr and shifts focus from his socialist policies. The Adams campaign has demanded Columbia University release Mamdani's application records.</p>

Burns emphasized that while the Declaration of Independence's promises did not initially include many groups, its inspirational words set in motion movements for equality worldwide.

In a single event, contestants can consume over 22,000 calories and dangerously high levels of sodium, risking immediate gastrointestinal distress and potential spikes in blood pressure. A 2007 study showed that a competitive eater's stomach can distend massively to accommodate food, unlike a normal person's.

          <p>Civil rights groups, including the ACLU, have filed a federal class-action lawsuit against U.S. immigration agencies, alleging that agents are engaging in widespread racial profiling in Southern California. The suit claims that agents are unconstitutionally targeting people based on their skin color and apparent occupation, raiding known hubs for Latino workers and arresting individuals without reasonable suspicion. Advocates argue the administration's high daily arrest quotas are forcing agents to cut corners, leading to the detention of people who appear to be immigrants, including U.S. citizens. The Department of Homeland Security has denied the allegations, stating its operations are highly targeted.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to sign a landmark 870-page policy bill that narrowly passed Congress, enacting key parts of his agenda. The legislation extends the 2017 tax cuts, provides new tax breaks for certain incomes, boosts defense spending by $150 billion, and allocates $100 billion to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). It also includes steep cuts to Medicaid and reduces clean energy tax credits from the previous administration. While the White House touts the bill as a driver of economic growth, it faced opposition from Democrats and some Republicans over its potential impact on the national debt.

          <p>In an innovative effort to save Florida's devastated reefs, scientists are transplanting fragments of crossbred coral onto a reef near Miami. The project, a collaboration between the University of Miami, The Florida Aquarium, and a Honduran organization, involves crossbreeding Florida's native Elkhorn corals with a more resilient strain from the warmer waters of Honduras. The goal is to create a more "thermally tolerant" coral population capable of surviving rising ocean temperatures that have caused widespread bleaching and killed over 95% of Florida's Elkhorn corals. This marks the first time an international crossbreeding effort has been permitted for planting in the wild.</p>

Delgado has investigated over 100 wrecks, including the Titanic, which he described as an overwhelming and eerie experience. He recalled the spooky moment of seeing his own reflection in a porthole 2.5 miles below the surface, a haunting reminder of the human drama that unfolded on the ship.</p>

The blast, which was heard across the Italian capital, sent a massive plume of fire and smoke into the air and caused widespread devastation to nearby vehicles and buildings. Authorities believe a potential massacre was averted as police evacuated a nearby sports center, where dozens of children were expected for a summer camp, just before the main explosion occurred.

          <p>As Germany commits to a massive increase in defense spending to make its military "ready for war," economists are skeptical that the investment will deliver a significant economic boost. A study from the University of Mannheim suggests the economic stimulus will be moderate, with every euro of military spending generating only 50 cents of additional economic activity. This is because military hardware, unlike infrastructure or education, does not create further economic value. Critics warn that with defense contractors already at full capacity, the spending spree is more likely to increase corporate profits than to significantly grow the national economy.
