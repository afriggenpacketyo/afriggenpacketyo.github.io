          <p>Two Israeli Embassy employees were fatally shot outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. The suspect, identified as Elias Rodriguez, was apprehended by museum security after the shooting. Rodriguez reportedly chanted 'free, free Palestine' while in custody, suggesting a possible motive for the attack. Authorities are investigating the incident as a potential targeted attack, with the FBI involved due to the possibility of a hate crime or terrorist act. The victims were a young couple about to be engaged, according to the Israeli ambassador to the U.S.</p>

          <p>One year after winning the general election, the Labour government is facing a challenging political and economic landscape. As part of what they are calling ‚Äúlegacy Thursday‚Äù, Labour is attempting to deflect criticism by blaming the previous Conservative government for various issues, including the handover of the Chagos Islands and a looming prison capacity crisis. The government is also considering mandatory chemical castration for sex offenders. With public sector pay deals and net migration figures also expected, the government is trying to demonstrate its achievements amid low opinion poll scores.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are moving to revoke California's vehicle emissions waivers, a decision Democrats are decrying as the "nuclear option." These waivers allow California to set stricter emissions standards than federal regulations, including a mandate for all new vehicle sales to be zero emissions by 2035. Republicans argue they have the authority to overturn the waivers under the Congressional Review Act, while Democrats contend this action is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. Sixteen other states and the District of Columbia have adopted California's vehicle standards, meaning the revocation could have widespread impact, particularly for the electric vehicle market.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has launched a new gasoline subsidy aimed at reducing prices by 10 yen per liter to alleviate cost-of-living pressures for consumers. The subsidy, which will provide a fixed sum regardless of prices, targets a reduction of 7.40 yen per liter in the first week, with a goal of reaching a 10-yen reduction by mid-June. The program has no set end date but is expected to last until March 2026, supported by a budget of around 1 trillion yen. This reintroduction of subsidies comes ahead of an upcoming parliamentary election.</p>

          <p>Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent discussed currency issues amid ongoing bilateral tariff negotiations, agreeing that the current dollar-yen exchange rate reflects economic fundamentals. This acknowledgement suggests that the yen's weakness against the dollar should no longer be a point of contention in trade talks. Kato expressed concerns about the global economic impact of the Trump administration's tariffs and reiterated Japan's opposition to additional tariffs. Despite these discussions, Japan is reportedly considering concessions on U.S. tariff rates to reach a trade deal.</p>

          <p>Microsoft recently announced a partnership with Elon Musk's xAI to include its Grok 3 model on the Azure platform, signaling a potential shift away from its reliance on OpenAI. The move aims to enhance Microsoft's AI offerings and attract more developers to its Azure cloud platform. While Microsoft has heavily invested in OpenAI, tensions have risen as OpenAI has begun selling AI products directly to enterprise customers, becoming a competitor. This partnership could diversify Microsoft's AI portfolio and reduce its dependence on a single provider.</p>
