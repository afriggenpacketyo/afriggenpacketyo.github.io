          <p>A 27-year-old woman, Dahbia Benkired, has been given a rare whole-life sentence in France for the sexual assault and murder of 12-year-old Lola Daviet in October 2022. This case, which has deeply shocked the nation, involves the country's harshest penalty, requiring Benkired to serve a minimum of 30 years. The crime has also fueled political debate, as Benkired was an Algerian immigrant under an order to leave France, prompting criticism from right-wing politicians. Lola's body was discovered in a storage box in her apartment building's courtyard, and the court cited "extreme cruelty" and "true torture" in its verdict.</p>

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has invested in Six Flags Entertainment as part of a group led by activist investment firm JANA Partners. The group acquired a 9% stake, making them one of the largest shareholders in the amusement park company, which has been grappling with significant debt and declining attendance post-pandemic. Kelce, a self-proclaimed lifelong fan, aims to help revitalize the brand, which recently merged with Cedar Fair but continues to face financial headwinds. The investment has sparked fan hopes for new attractions and is seen as a positive move to leverage Kelce's popularity to attract a younger audience.</p>

This visit is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to crack down on international sources contributing to the U.S. opioid crisis. The administration has emphasized holding China accountable for its role in the illicit drug trade, with President Trump planning to make it a primary topic in his upcoming meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With two months until Christmas, major retailers are rolling out holiday deals earlier than usual to appeal to price-conscious shoppers. Executives from companies like Kohl's and Academy Sports and Outdoors note that consumers, particularly in the lower- and middle-income brackets, are feeling the strain of their budgets and are more carefully planning their purchases. This has led to a strategy of capturing spending early and often, with shoppers making more frequent trips for smaller purchases to find the best deals. Despite concerns about a potential government shutdown and tariffs, retailers report normal inventory levels and are cautiously optimistic about the holiday season.</p>

          <p>The German women's national football team defeated France 1-0 in the first leg of the UEFA Women's Nations League semifinal. The decisive goal was scored by Bayern Munich's Klara Bühl late in the game, giving Germany a narrow advantage heading into the second leg in Caen, France. Head coach Christian Wück expressed satisfaction with the team's performance but noted their inefficiency in front of goal, stating the victory was deserved but too close. The match was the first encounter between the two rivals since their dramatic quarter-final at the European Championship, setting the stage for a highly anticipated conclusion to the semifinal matchup.</p>

Cross was convicted in 2008 of kidnapping, murder, and sexual assault, but has always maintained his innocence. In a notable development, Currin's father has joined forces with Cross's father, stating that justice for his daughter means finding the real perpetrators of the crime.</p>

          <p>After a four-month standoff, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has endorsed democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani for New York City mayor. The endorsement came just one day before the start of early voting, following months of pressure from progressives and repeated questions from the media about his reluctance. Jeffries' hesitation was reportedly due to concerns over Mamdani's past rhetoric on Israel and how his progressive policies would be implemented. The endorsement solidifies Democratic party unity around Mamdani, who holds a strong lead in the polls against his opponents, former Governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa, ahead of the November 4 election.</p>

          <p>Misty Copeland, who made history as the first Black woman to be promoted to principal dancer at the American Ballet Theatre, has retired after a 25-year career with the company. Copeland took her final bow at a farewell gala at Lincoln Center, an event she said was important for closure and to express gratitude. After a five-year hiatus, she decided to return for one last performance, viewing her retirement as a pivotal moment to shift her impact from on-stage to off-stage. Copeland will now join ABT's board of trustees, aiming to continue advocating for diversity and representation in ballet from behind the scenes.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration has announced a 2.8% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026, which will increase monthly payments for approximately 71 million beneficiaries. This adjustment, based on inflation data from the third quarter, will raise the average monthly benefit by about $56, to $2,071, starting in January. However, advocacy groups for seniors express concern that the increase may not be sufficient to cover rising costs, particularly for healthcare. With Medicare Part B premiums also projected to rise significantly next year, much of the COLA increase could be consumed by higher healthcare expenses, leaving many seniors still struggling financially.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicated that inflation rose at a 3% annual rate in September, slightly below economists' forecasts but still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The data, released despite the government shutdown due to its importance for calculating Social Security adjustments, reflects ongoing price pressures, some of which are attributed to tariffs. This persistent inflation complicates the Fed's upcoming interest rate decision, as it coincides with a slowing job market. Despite the higher inflation, analysts still widely expect the central bank to implement another quarter-point rate cut to support the weakening labor market.</p>

Cramer anticipates a challenging quarter for Starbucks but believes it will be the "last bad quarter" of its turnaround.

          <p>The University of Michigan's sentiment index revealed that U.S. consumer confidence fell for the third straight month in October, signaling growing pessimism about the economy. The index dipped by 1.5%, with persistent inflation and a weakening labor market being the primary concerns weighing on Americans' morale, especially for those in lower to median income brackets. Inflation expectations also increased, indicating that high prices remain a top concern for households. The report noted that the ongoing federal government shutdown has had a minimal direct impact on consumer sentiment thus far, with very few respondents mentioning it as a primary economic concern.</p>

          <p>Satellite imagery indicates that construction for President Trump's new $300 million ballroom at the White House has led to the removal of at least six trees, including two historic magnolias commemorating Presidents Harding and Roosevelt.

According to former officials, the demolition work began without consulting the National Capital Planning Commission, a body legally tasked with preserving government buildings. President Trump had previously stated the project would not interfere with the existing East Wing, but the new images show that structure has been demolished as well.</p>

This comprehensive article details the state-by-state consequences, noting that millions are at risk of losing SNAP and WIC benefits if the impasse extends into November. While some services like the U.S. Postal Service continue uninterrupted, nearly half of the IRS staff has been furloughed, and national parks are operating with limited services. The shutdown stems from a partisan dispute over extending Affordable Care Act subsidies, leaving 1.4 million federal employees without pay.</p>

          <p>The NFL has fined the New York Giants organization, head coach Brian Daboll, and a player a total of $315,000 for violating the league's concussion protocol. The incident occurred during an October 9 game when rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart was being evaluated in the sideline medical tent. Coach Daboll and running back Cam Skattebo both entered the tent during the examination, which is prohibited to ensure medical evaluations are free from outside influence. While a joint NFL-NFLPA review found no evidence that their actions affected the medical care provided, it concluded their conduct created a perception of interference and disregarded protocol requirements.</p>
