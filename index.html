          <p>This article delves into some surprising facts about Elon Musk, highlighting his early entrepreneurial ventures such as creating a video game at age 12 and founding Zip2 with his brother. It also touches on his foray into unconventional products like perfume and tequila, and his initial involvement with X.com, which later became PayPal. The article further explains Musk's influence on the character of Tony Stark in the Iron Man movies, and clarifies that Musk was not the original founder of Tesla but an early investor who propelled the company to global recognition. The piece concludes by mentioning Musk's vision for X as an 'everything app' similar to WeChat. Optimism about Musk's endeavors remains somewhat mixed given his controversial management of Twitter.</p>

          <h2>US Court Ruling on Trump Tariffs Has Limited Immediate Impact on UK-US Trade Deal</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent New York court ruling against blanket tariffs imposed by President Trump has sparked questions about its impact on the UK-US trade deal. Despite the ruling, existing tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum, which significantly affect UK exports, remain unchanged. Although the UK has secured a deal with the US to reduce these tariffs, it has not yet been implemented. The ruling does block Trump's imposition of blanket tariffs on other UK goods like salmon and whisky, but the White House intends to appeal the decision, creating uncertainty for British exporters. This situation introduces another unpredictable element into international trade, making it difficult for businesses to plan and invest with confidence.</p>

          <h2>UK Saltmarshes Play Crucial Role in Climate Change Mitigation, Report Reveals</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from WWF emphasizes the vital role of UK saltmarshes as carbon sinks, effectively locking away greenhouse gases in mud layers. The report calls for these tidal habitats to be included in the official UK inventory of carbon emissions and removals. Researchers monitored greenhouse gas levels at a restored saltmarsh in North-West England, revealing that the plants absorb more carbon dioxide in the summer than they release in winter. With the UK having lost a significant portion of its saltmarshes, the report advocates for their restoration and protection to combat climate change and protect against coastal flooding. The recognition of these sites could provide more incentive to protect and restore more of these sites.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the deportation of Qian Xuesen, a brilliant Chinese rocket scientist, from the U.S. in 1955 and its profound consequences. Despite his significant contributions to American aerospace and weaponry, Qian was deported amidst the Red Scare, leading him to return to China and spearhead the country's missile and space programs. This decision enabled China to rapidly develop its technological capabilities, ultimately transforming it into a superpower. The author draws parallels to current U.S. policies targeting foreign students and researchers, cautioning against repeating past mistakes that could undermine American dominance and spur scientific advancements in rival nations. The historical misstep serves as a cautionary tale.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has initiated its first debate in 28 years regarding legislation that would allow married couples to choose separate surnames. Currently, Japanese law mandates that married couples share a single family name, traditionally leading women to adopt their husband's surname. While public support for a dual family-name system is growing, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party remains hesitant, citing concerns about family cohesion and traditional values. Three opposition parties have submitted bills proposing different approaches to implementing the change, but their passage during the current Diet session appears unlikely. Despite this, the renewed discussion signifies a potential shift in societal attitudes towards marriage and family identity in Japan.</p>

          <p>President Trump has criticized conservative legal activist Leonard Leo, accusing him of being a 'bad person' who 'probably hates America,' following a court ruling against his tariffs. Trump blamed the Federalist Society, which Leo previously led, for providing poor advice on judicial nominations. This attack is notable given Leo's past role in advising Trump on Supreme Court picks and the Federalist Society's influence in shaping the federal judiciary.

          <p>Fast fashion giant Shein is reportedly shifting its IPO plans to Hong Kong after facing regulatory hurdles in London.

Additionally, the closure of the U.S.'s de minimis loophole for low-cost goods has added to the company's challenges.

          <p>A Harris's hawk that had been terrorizing the village of Flamstead has found a permanent home with a local falconer. The hawk, nicknamed Bomber Harris, was captured in April after attacking numerous people. Falconer Wayne Housden has been training the bird and reports that it has calmed down significantly. Housden intends to keep the hawk full-time, ensuring it receives proper care and stability, and will even bring the bird to the Flamstead Scarecrow Festival. The falconer's kindness has led to a positive outcome.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally dismissed its lawsuit against Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao. The original complaint accused the crypto exchange of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. This dismissal marks a significant shift, especially as the Trump administration seeks to align itself with the crypto industry. Binance is taking a $2 billion investment from the Emirati state fund MGX entirely in USD1, a stablecoin newly launched by the World Liberty team. (not investment advice)</p>
