          <h2>WeightWatchers Faces Bankruptcy Amid Popularity of Weight Loss Injections</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 13:23:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>WeightWatchers has filed for bankruptcy in the United States due to significant debt and increased competition from weight loss injections like Ozempic and Mounjaro. The bankruptcy process aims to eliminate $1.15 billion of the company's debt while establishing new repayment terms with lenders. Despite the financial restructuring, WeightWatchers assures its members that it will remain fully operational and there will be no impact on their services. The company attributes its financial challenges to the rapidly changing landscape of weight management, driven by the growing popularity of weight loss injections.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Used vehicle prices have experienced a significant increase, reaching levels not seen since October 2023, driven by consumer concerns over potential price hikes due to auto tariffs. Cox Automotive's Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index, which tracks used vehicle prices at U.S. wholesale auctions, rose by 4.9% compared to the previous year. This increase also represents a 2.7% rise from March, significantly higher than the typical month-to-month increase. According to Cox Automotive, the 'spring bounce' in prices extended throughout April, reflecting strong price appreciation in anticipation of the tariffs.</p>

          <p>In his first interview since leaving office, former President Joe Biden criticized President Trump's foreign policy, particularly his comments about Greenland, Canada, and Russia. Biden described Trump's approach to Russia as 'modern-day appeasement' and questioned Trump's remarks about acquiring Greenland and referring to Canada as the 51st state. He emphasized that America stands for freedom, democracy, and opportunity, not confiscation. Biden also expressed concern about the future of NATO and its importance in maintaining global stability.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to deport migrants without legal status to Libya, a country embroiled in armed conflict, according to a U.S. official. The plan involves using the U.S. military for deportations, with a single aircraft making the flight. Libya is divided between two factions, and the appalling treatment of migrants there has been widely condemned by human rights groups. The administration has been seeking to deport migrants to third countries as part of its immigration crackdown, with several Latin American countries already accepting deportees.</p>

          <p>Brendan Buck, writing for the New York Times, argues that congressional Republicans are misguided if they believe a spending and tax cut package will solve the economic problems caused by President Trump's tariffs. He suggests that extending the 2017 tax law, while beneficial, will not offset the economic damage from the tariffs. Buck points out that voters may not reward Republicans for this bill, and the effort is preventing them from pressuring Trump to reconsider his trade policies. He concludes that without a stable economic footing, House members in battleground districts face a difficult path to re-election.</p>

This announcement follows previous clashes with the media over renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.

          <p>Sixteen people have been arrested, including a Sinaloa cartel leader, and 3 million fentanyl-laced pills were seized in what federal prosecutors are calling the 'largest fentanyl bust in DEA history.' The operation spanned several states in the West. Attorney General Pam Bondi said that among those arrested was Heriberto Salazar Amaya, a Mexican national. The Justice Department reported that officials seized over 400 kilograms of fentanyl pills, fentanyl powder, methamphetamine, cocaine, and heroin, along with $5 million in cash and 49 rifles and pistols.</p>
