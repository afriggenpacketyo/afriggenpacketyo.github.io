          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that a previous summit between former President Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska was a strategic win for the Russian leader. Zelenskyy argued that Putin primarily sought the legitimacy and imagery of meeting with a U.S. president, which he successfully obtained without offering meaningful concessions for Ukraine. This critique comes amid ongoing Russian aggression, including a recent record-breaking drone assault on Kyiv, as Zelenskyy continues to advocate for increased international pressure and sanctions against Russia to achieve a just and lasting peace.</p>

          <p>The Catholic Church has officially canonized Carlo Acutis, an Italian teenager who died of leukemia in 2006 at the age of 15, making him the first millennial to be declared a saint. Known as "God's influencer," Acutis was recognized for his devout faith and his use of the internet to document miracles and spread Catholic teachings. The canonization ceremony, led by Pope Leo XIV at the Vatican, drew tens of thousands of pilgrims and highlights the church's effort to connect with younger generations by recognizing a modern figure who combined technology with deep religious devotion.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen secured a dominant victory for Red Bull at the Italian Grand Prix, but the race was marked by a contentious decision within the McLaren team. McLaren instructed Oscar Piastri to allow his teammate Lando Norris to pass for second place, despite Norris falling behind Piastri due to a slow pit stop caused by a wheel gun fault. The team justified the order by referencing a past race where Norris had similarly aided Piastri, but the decision has sparked debate about fairness in the context of a tight championship battle, ultimately narrowing Piastri's lead over Norris.</p>

          <p>Health experts are observing a rise in knee pain among adults in their 30s and 40s, a trend attributed primarily to higher rates of obesity and increased participation in high-intensity sports during youth. A recent study found that early structural damage in the knee is common by age 30, often without symptoms, with higher body mass index (BMI) being a key factor. Orthopedic surgeons recommend maintaining a healthy weight, strengthening surrounding leg muscles, and using proper footwear as key preventative measures to avoid long-term issues like osteoarthritis and the potential need for future knee replacement surgery.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of representatives, including Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna, is pushing for a House vote to release government files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Massie suggested that former President Trump's resistance may stem from a desire to avoid embarrassment for politically connected donors, while emphasizing that justice must not be avoided for powerful individuals.

          <p>After years of sporadic sightings, police in the Czech Republic have arrested a 51-year-old man who was repeatedly seen driving a red, Ferrari-liveried racing car on a public motorway. The driver, who had evaded identification since 2019 by wearing a full racing helmet, was tracked to his home after new video of the car surfaced. The vehicle, identified as a Dallara GP2 racing car rather than an actual F1 car, is not street legal. The owner now faces fines for operating a vehicle on the motorway without essential features like headlights, indicators, or number plates.</p>

When questioned about controversial Trump administration policies, she declined to comment on specific pending legal issues, explaining that a judge must approach each case with an open mind through a formal process of briefs and arguments.</p>

The article posits that the majority of small businesses are service-based and won't be directly impacted by the change in import duties. The author argues that the larger economic picture, including consumer income and wealth, is more critical for absorbing price increases, and that as long as the labor market remains strong, the economy can likely withstand the effects of the tariffs.

The emergence of young, powerful stars like 22-year-old flanker Freda Tafuna, who scored six tries in the tournament, points to a growing talent pipeline from the US college system. The team's spirit and the rise of this new generation suggest a promising outlook for the next World Cup cycle.</p>

          <p>According to pediatrician Dr. Daniel Golshevsky, establishing healthy sleep habits, or "sleep hygiene," in infancy is one of the most crucial things parents can do to support their child's long-term health and success. These habits are foundational for a baby's physical, mental, and cognitive development, and they influence a child's ability to learn and regulate emotions later in life. Dr. Golshevsky advises creating a soothing environment that mimics the womb, involving both parents in settling routines, and maintaining flexibility rather than adhering to rigid schedules. This approach helps teach babies to self-soothe, a skill that benefits them throughout their lives.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece makes the case that right-wing survivalists, or "preppers," should embrace solar power as the ideal energy source for off-grid self-sufficiency. The author contrasts the complexity and failure points of fossil fuel systems—requiring drilling, refining, and constant refueling—with the simplicity and resilience of solar panels and batteries. Solar energy is framed not as an environmental choice but as a practical one for hyper-individualists, providing a reliable, long-term power source independent of complex supply chains. This perspective suggests a potential, if unexpected, common ground between typically opposed political ideologies on the issue of renewable energy.</p>

          <p>Republican leaders in the Arizona state senate have filed an ethics complaint seeking to expel Democratic Senator Analise Ortiz for resharing an Instagram post from a community group that warned of immigration enforcement activity near a school. The complaint alleges her action was reckless and endangered officers, while Ortiz and free speech advocates maintain her post is protected First Amendment speech. Ortiz claims the effort is an attempt to intimidate her and make an example out of her for speaking out against ICE's presence in sensitive locations. The controversy has drawn national attention and criticism from Arizona's Democratic attorney general.</p>

          <p>An analysis of President Donald Trump's rhetoric reveals his increasing and characteristic use of phrases like "never seen anything like it" to describe events, policies, and outcomes. This form of hyperbole is not just a verbal tic but reflects his black-and-white worldview, where his successes are historic and the nation's problems are unprecedented crises requiring his decisive action. According to a database of his remarks, Trump has used such phrases 194 times this year, far outpacing previous years in office. This grandiosity, often not supported by facts, is seen by communication experts as a tool to frame situations in extremes, justifying extreme responses.</p>

          <p>Over 15,000 protesters gathered in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to prioritize a deal for the release of hostages held by Hamas and to end the war in Gaza. The families of the remaining hostages expressed anger and fear that an intensified military offensive would further endanger their loved ones. Despite growing domestic and international pressure for a ceasefire, the Israeli government has signaled its intent to expand its military operations to achieve what it calls a "total victory" over Hamas. The protests highlight the deep divisions within Israel over the government's handling of the nearly two-year-long conflict.</p>

Following the game, Belichick addressed recent reports by confirming that he has banned scouts from the New England Patriots, his former team, from attending UNC practices. He stated bluntly that since he feels unwelcome at the Patriots' facility, their personnel are not welcome at his, signaling a clear deterioration in the relationship since his departure from the NFL team.

          <p>Despite being a global leader in green-technology exports, China is simultaneously ramping up its coal power capacity. An opinion piece argues this is not a climate policy reversal but a pragmatic strategy to ensure grid stability while integrating record amounts of renewable energy. With solar and wind power generation surging but also facing curtailment issues, and hydropower output reduced by droughts, coal plants are being used as a reliable backup to prevent blackouts during peak demand. This approach allows grid operators to confidently approve and connect new renewable sources without compromising the energy supply.</p>

          <p>The United States Tennis Association is facing accusations of hypocrisy and cowardice for asking its broadcast partners not to show any crowd disruptions or negative reactions to Donald Trump's attendance at the US Open final. Critics argue this pre-emptive censorship contradicts the tournament's brand of being unfiltered and rowdy, and they point out that other disturbances, like climate protests, have been televised extensively. The USTA's move to shield a political figure from public disapproval is seen as a capitulation that sacrifices the event's authenticity and undermines democratic expression in a public forum.</p>

The concept gained traction through word of mouth and expanded internationally, eventually becoming Lithuania's first tech "unicorn."

          <p>A new study of fossils from Brazil reveals that numerous long-necked dinosaurs, or sauropods, were afflicted with osteomyelitis, a destructive bone infection, approximately 80 million years ago. Researchers analyzed the skeletons of six sauropods from the same paleontological site and found lesions indicative of the disease, which is caused by bacteria, fungi, or other pathogens. The findings suggest the ancient wetland environment these dinosaurs inhabited may have been a breeding ground for pathogens. As the bone lesions showed no signs of healing, the infections were likely active at the time of death and may have been a contributing factor.</p>
