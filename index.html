          <p>Mohammed Zahid, the 65-year-old ringleader of a grooming gang in Rochdale, has been sentenced to 35 years in prison for committing sexual assault against two schoolgirls. The court heard that Zahid and six other men, who also received lengthy sentences, sexually exploited the vulnerable girls between 2001 and 2006, treating them as 'sex slaves' after luring them with gifts, drugs, and alcohol. The judge described the men as predatory and their treatment of the girls as appalling, noting that past failings by social services and police had been acknowledged. The convictions followed a lengthy investigation and were praised by the Crown Prosecution Service.</p>

          <p>Following a better-than-expected quarterly report, Jim Cramer's CNBC Investing Club is increasing its investment in Nike, signaling confidence in the company's turnaround. The report highlighted early successes of CEO Elliott Hill's 'Win Now' strategy, including accelerated growth in the running business and normalizing inventory levels. While acknowledging that challenges remain in areas like the Chinese market and the Converse brand, the club views the positive results as a sign that management's broader plan is on track. The move increases the Charitable Trust's position in Nike, reflecting a stronger belief in its recovery. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK bakery chain Greggs has announced it will raise prices for the third time this year, affecting items like its breakfast meal deals and biscuits. CEO Roisin Currie attributed the move to mounting cost pressures, including increased staffing expenses and a £20 million hit from higher employer National Insurance contributions. While the popular sausage roll price remains unchanged in this round, the company is responding to a wider trend of price hikes on the British high street. Despite the increases, Greggs plans to continue its expansion, particularly in southern England, and expects cost pressures to ease next year.</p>

          <p>At a summit in Copenhagen, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen called for a robust European Union response to what she described as Russian hybrid attacks, including recent drone disruptions at Danish airports and incursions into EU airspace. The meeting of EU leaders is focused on bolstering European defense capabilities, with discussions centered on proposals like a multi-layered 'drone wall' for detection and interception. Amid heightened security, Denmark and its allies are collaborating to prevent further incidents, highlighting a growing consensus that Europe is in its most dangerous security situation since World War II.</p>

          <h2>Expiration of Enhanced Subsidies Could Cause ACA Premiums to More Than Double, Study Finds</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis by the health policy research group KFF warns that premiums for Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace plans could increase by an average of 114% in 2026 if enhanced subsidies are allowed to expire. These subsidies, which currently make insurance cheaper for 22 million people, are set to end in 2025 without congressional action. The issue is a central point of contention in the ongoing government funding debate, with Democrats pushing to extend the credits. The KFF report highlights that the cost increase would be compounded by other factors, including insurer rate hikes and changes to how tax credits are calculated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The New York Yankees made unfortunate postseason history in their 3-1 Wild Card loss to the Boston Red Sox. In the bottom of the ninth inning, the Yankees loaded the bases with no outs but failed to score a single run, becoming the first team in MLB playoff history to do so and lose the game. Boston closer Aroldis Chapman managed to escape the jam by securing three consecutive outs, sealing the victory for the Red Sox.

          <p>A new survey from TD Bank reveals that Americans are increasingly using credit cards to pay for essential items, with groceries and gasoline cited as the top spending categories causing financial pain. Nearly half of consumers reported that their grocery spending increased the most over the last year, reflecting stubbornly high food prices and broader inflation. This reliance on credit for non-discretionary purchases highlights the growing strain on household budgets, as overall credit card balances have continued to climb to near-record highs. The findings challenge the perception of credit card spending as primarily frivolous, showing it is often used for daily necessities.</p>

The property is located directly next to the city's historic Freedom Tower, a landmark that served as a processing center for Cuban refugees fleeing communism. Opponents, including immigrant advocacy groups, argue that building a monument to a president known for restrictive immigration policies next to a symbol of refuge is a profound betrayal of the site's legacy.

While the document vaguely mentions a pathway to Palestinian statehood, Netanyahu has publicly stated he would forcibly resist such an outcome, claiming Trump agreed with his position.

          <p>The world-famous Oktoberfest in Munich was temporarily shut down after police received a bomb threat connected to a deadly incident elsewhere in the city. Earlier in the day, a residential building was deliberately set on fire during a family dispute, resulting in one death and the discovery of explosive devices. A letter from the perpetrator of the fire reportedly contained the threat against the festival grounds. Police cordoned off the area to conduct searches, delaying the opening of the event for several hours as a precautionary measure while special forces worked to defuse the bombs at the residence.</p>

          <p>American households are facing sharply rising electricity bills, with residential rates having increased over 30% on average since 2020, nearly double the rate of inflation in the past year. This surge is driven by a combination of factors, including increased demand, volatile fuel prices, and delays in grid upgrades. The price hikes disproportionately affect lower-income households and add inflationary pressure throughout the economy. While the short-term outlook suggests continued high prices, some experts believe the long-term trend of electrification, particularly in vehicles, could eventually lead to a decrease in overall household energy spending.</p>

          <p>The U.S. oil and gas industry is undergoing a significant wave of job cuts, shedding thousands of positions in 2025. This downturn is driven by a combination of falling crude oil prices, which are below the break-even point for many shale producers, and increased costs from tariffs on materials like steel. A recent surge in major consolidations, including acquisitions by giants like Exxon Mobil, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips, is also contributing to the workforce reduction. Industry executives have criticized the administration's policies, arguing they have kneecapped domestic producers while benefiting OPEC+. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to begin a new term that could fundamentally reshape the balance of power between the branches of government, with several key cases challenging the scope of presidential authority. The court will hear arguments on whether President Trump had the power to unilaterally impose tariffs and will also reconsider a 90-year-old precedent limiting the president's ability to fire the heads of independent agencies. This article notes that the court's conservative majority has consistently sided with the administration on its emergency 'shadow docket,' raising concerns among critics about whether the court will serve as a check on executive power or a rubber stamp.</p>
