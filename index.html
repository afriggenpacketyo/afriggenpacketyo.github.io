          <p>In this New York Times article, columnists Gail Collins and Bret Stephens reflect on the end of their eight-year weekly dialogue, "The Conversation," which aimed to bridge the liberal-conservative divide. They discuss the transformation of the Republican Party, the degradation of public discourse, and the role of social media in political polarization. Collins and Stephens share insights on maintaining civil conversations, emphasizing the importance of humor and a willingness to understand opposing viewpoints, rather than trying to "win" an argument. The article emphasizes the importance of civil discourse in a time of division, and also the importance of media fact checking.</p>

          <p>Jack Goldsmith, in this New York Times guest essay, argues that Donald Trump's expansion of presidential powers builds on excesses from previous administrations, including those of Richard Nixon, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden. He contends that this escalation of power grabs has put the country on a dangerous course, leading to extreme policies and the politicization of the Justice Department. Goldsmith calls for substantial limitations on the presidency, suggesting reforms through the Supreme Court, Congress, and even constitutional amendments to restore checks and balances and curb executive overreach. The article advocates for a return to a time when Congress played a more vital role in domestic policy and law and norms effectively checked presidential actions.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed a potentially universal antivenom using antibodies isolated from the blood of Tim Friede, a man who intentionally exposed himself to venom from multiple deadly snakes over 18 years. The antivenom, created by combining two of Friede’s antibodies with another molecule, has shown promise in mouse trials against the venom of various snakes, including black mambas and king cobras. Researchers hope this approach could lead to a more broadly effective and easily deployable antivenom, potentially saving lives in rural areas. The research was published in the journal Cell Press.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration is facing increasing complaints of errors and delays in benefit payments, with some recipients wrongly marked as deceased and others experiencing disruptions in their payments. These issues are attributed to initiatives aimed at rooting out fraud and modernizing technology, as well as staff departures, which have led to increased workloads and demoralization among employees. Advocates and lawyers report that these problems are creating significant hardships for beneficiaries, who rely on Social Security for necessities. Some fear that these problems could lead to privatization of the agency.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs is standing trial in New York City on multiple charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy, stemming from alleged incidents over multiple decades. The indictment accuses Combs of running a criminal enterprise since at least 2004, engaging in sexual assault, forced labor, and other offenses. Prosecutors plan to use a 2016 hotel security video showing Combs attacking his then-girlfriend as key evidence. Four accusers are expected to testify against Combs, who has pleaded not guilty to all charges and faces potentially decades in prison if convicted.</p>

          <p>Kosmos 482, a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972, is expected to reenter Earth's atmosphere this weekend after orbiting the planet for over half a century. The probe, originally intended to reach Venus, became stranded in low Earth orbit due to an engine malfunction. While there is a small chance it could damage property or injure someone, experts believe the spacecraft is more likely to splash down in a body of water or burn up during reentry, though its heat shield may allow it to survive largely intact.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has directed his government to reopen and expand Alcatraz prison to house America's most violent offenders. The move, part of an effort to overhaul federal incarceration, faces practical challenges due to the island's crumbling infrastructure and high operating costs. The former prison, now a popular tourist site, was closed in 1963 due to these issues. The Bureau of Prisons stated it would comply with presidential orders, but the feasibility of the plan remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>China’s offshore yuan has strengthened, surpassing the 7.2 level against the US dollar, driven by expectations of a potential rollback of tariffs and renewed interest in Chinese assets. This shift in market sentiment is fueled by indications that the US and China may begin trade negotiations, potentially leading to a reduction in tariffs. However, analysts caution that negotiations are likely to be lengthy and volatile, and global investors are awaiting tangible signs of China's ability to withstand economic challenges before increasing their investments.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists assert that the "Shi's Star Catalogue," dating back to approximately 335BC, is the world's oldest star log. The researchers used image processing to convert ancient records into measurable celestial coordinates, confirming the catalogue's observations. If confirmed, this would predate the Hipparchus star catalogue from Greece, previously recognized as the oldest known human record of the stars. The study was published in the journal Research in Astronomy and Astrophysics.</p>

          <p>The Australian film industry is concerned about Donald Trump's proposal to impose 100% tariffs on film productions made outside the US. The Australian government has pledged to support its screen industry, which benefits from a 30% rebate for big-budget projects. The potential tariffs could impact foreign productions in Australia and the export of Australian content to the US, raising concerns about the industry's future. Foreign productions account for nearly half of the A$1.7bn spent on screen production in Australia during 2023-24.</p>
