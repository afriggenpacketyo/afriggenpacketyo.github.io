          <p>According to Tsinghua University professor Yan Xuetong, China should remain vigilant about the risk of the United States being drawn into military conflicts by its allies. Speaking at a press briefing, the foreign policy expert suggested that current US policy is accelerating a trend of deglobalization rather than establishing a new international order. He argued that this shift is leading to an increase in military conflicts and greater uncertainty within the international community, a trend China must carefully navigate.</p>

The Pacific archipelago is one of the world's most climate-threatened nations, with scientists predicting most of its landmass will be below the high tide level by 2050. The visa program will grant 280 applicants permanent residency in Australia annually, but the massive influx of registrations indicates the program will be vastly oversubscribed.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's vehicle production experienced a dramatic slump in May, falling 32.8% to its lowest level for the month since 1949, excluding the pandemic lockdown period. This sharp decline is largely attributed to US trade tariffs, ongoing model changeovers, and industry restructuring, with shipments to the key US market falling by over 55%. While a recent reduction in the US tariff levy offers some relief, the industry has faced an exceptionally difficult year, though some express cautious optimism for future recovery.

          <p>China's industrial profits fell by a sharp 9.1% in May compared to the previous year, marking the largest monthly drop since last October. The national statistics bureau attributed the decline to insufficient domestic demand and falling prices for industrial goods, indicating that Beijing's stimulus efforts have not yet fully revived corporate profitability. During the first five months of the year, the mining industry saw the largest profit decline, while profits in the automotive manufacturing sector also dropped significantly.

The government has struggled to set a clear direction, often resorting to reviews rather than decisive action, and has faced significant public and internal backlash over policies like cuts to winter fuel payments.</p>

          <p>Inspector Moloy Campbell, a police officer who was slashed in the hand while confronting a sword-wielding attacker in Hainault, says he does not consider himself a hero. He recounted the face-to-face struggle to disarm Marcus Monzo, who had just murdered 14-year-old Daniel Anjorin and attacked several others. Despite his severe injury, the inspector emphasized that his only thought was to stop the assailant and preserve life, calling the actions of his entire team that day "undoubtedly heroic" in protecting the public.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has created a "digital embryo," a high-resolution spatiotemporal atlas that maps out early organ formation in human development. This breakthrough provides a powerful tool to decode how a single fertilized egg develops into the hundreds of cell types that form complex tissues and organs. Researchers believe this detailed model will be crucial for understanding the origins of developmental defects and diseases, as abnormalities during this critical stage are highly likely to cause health issues later in life.</p>
