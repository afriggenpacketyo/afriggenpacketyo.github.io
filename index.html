          <p>A 36-year-old California woman participating in a YouTube survival challenge became lost in Michigan's Pigeon River State Forest. After being reported missing, she was located by a Michigan State Police helicopter using its advanced camera system. The search initially involved state troopers and canine units on the ground before the aerial crew spotted her. She was then safely escorted out of the dense forest by law enforcement and firefighters, bringing the ordeal to a positive conclusion.</p>

          <p>England's manager, Thomas Tuchel, has expressed his desire for the team to incorporate long throw-ins and long balls into their strategy for the upcoming World Cup. Despite the team's current success in qualifying with a short-passing style, Tuchel believes these direct tactics will be crucial for success on the world stage. He acknowledged the limited training time but emphasized that such patterns, along with crosses, are making a comeback and will be important in the tournament. Tuchel's contract is set to conclude after the World Cup.</p>

          <p>A drone launched by Houthi militants from Yemen successfully evaded Israeli air defenses and struck the Ramon International Airport near Eilat. The impact caused damage to the passenger terminal, including shattered windows, and resulted in one man being treated for light shrapnel wounds. While most drones in the barrage were intercepted, the Houthis claimed the attack as a "qualitative military operation" and warned that other sensitive targets are under fire. The airport resumed normal operations a few hours after the incident.</p>

His presence in a luxury suite at Arthur Ashe Stadium drew a mixed response from the crowd, with both cheers and boos heard at different moments. The U.S. Tennis Association reportedly asked broadcasters to avoid showcasing disruptions related to his visit, a standard practice for off-court distractions.

Moving away from the signature crew cut he had throughout his playing career, Watt now has a "feathered and lethal" look, as described by the network. He was on the call for the game between the New York Jets and the Pittsburgh Steelers, where his brother T.J. Watt plays.

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed confidence that the Trump administration's tariff plan will be upheld by the Supreme Court but warned of significant financial consequences if it is not. Should the court rule the tariffs illegal, Bessent stated the Treasury would be forced to issue refunds on about half the collected duties, which could amount to between $750 billion and $1 trillion. The administration has requested an expedited ruling to resolve the uncertainty after a federal appeals court found most of the "reciprocal tariffs" were an overstep of presidential authority.

          <p>Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth strongly condemned President Trump's recent rhetoric about sending federal forces to Chicago, stating he "essentially just declared war on a major city." While noting there are currently no indications of an imminent troop deployment, she emphasized that such an order would be illegal and unacceptable. Duckworth criticized the administration for not coordinating with local law enforcement, suggesting a lack of genuine interest in fighting crime.

The technology is not merely experimental and is expected to be integrated into the production version of the car next year.

          <p>President Trump has intensified his threats to deploy federal forces to Chicago, using social media to share an "Apocalypse Now"-themed image with the caption "I love the smell of deportations in the morning." Despite later telling reporters "we're not going to war," his rhetoric has been widely condemned by Illinois leaders as authoritarian and unconstitutional. The threats follow the deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles and Washington D.C., and an internal memo revealed the Department of Homeland Security has already begun positioning personnel and equipment at a naval base north of Chicago for a potential month-long operation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Guardian editorial criticizes President Trump's militaristic approach to the "war on drugs," arguing it dangerously escalates a failed policy into a reality of extrajudicial killings. The piece references a recent U.S. military strike that killed 11 alleged drug traffickers from Venezuela, warning it sets a precedent for military action without congressional approval or due process. The editorial contends that such strikes are counterproductive, making international cooperation more difficult and inevitably leading to innocent deaths, similar to the brutal campaign in the Philippines. It suggests that tackling demand and stemming the flow of U.S. arms to cartels would be far more effective.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent analysis of government data shows that Massachusetts residents spend more per capita on lottery tickets than any other state, averaging $915 annually. Rhode Island follows at $573 per person, while North Dakotans spend the least at just $50 a year. The report suggests that accessibility may play a role, as urban areas offer more opportunities to purchase tickets. Lottery sales represent a significant source of state revenue, accounting for an average of 1% of general funds and as much as 3% in states like Rhode Island and South Dakota.

          <p>U.S. authorities are investigating a sophisticated malware attack disguised as an email from a Republican congressman, allegedly aimed at spying on U.S.-China trade negotiations. The email, which appeared to be from Rep. John Moolenaar, was sent to trade groups, law firms, and government agencies, asking them to review attached legislation. Cybersecurity analysts have traced the malware to APT41, a hacker group widely believed to be working for Chinese intelligence. The incident is seen as the latest attempt by Beijing to gain an illicit advantage in the contentious trade discussions with the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Over 15,000 protesters gathered in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to secure a deal for the release of remaining hostages held by Hamas and to end the war in Gaza. The demonstrations, among the largest in recent months, included impassioned pleas from the families of the 48 hostages still in captivity. Many protesters fear that the government's plan to intensify the military offensive in Gaza City will further endanger the lives of their loved ones. The protests reflect growing domestic and international pressure on Netanyahu, who insists that "total victory" is the only way to bring the hostages home.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated his readiness to escalate economic pressure on Russia over the war in Ukraine, stating he is prepared to move to a "second phase" of sanctions. While he has previously threatened such measures, this is his most direct confirmation that new actions could be imminent, though he did not specify what they would entail. The comments suggest a more aggressive posture as his administration seeks to end the conflict. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has suggested that secondary tariffs on countries that continue to purchase Russian oil could be a potential next step. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Defence Secretary John Healey has confirmed the government is considering an expansion of its policy to house asylum seekers on military bases and other "non-military" sites. The plan aims to move people out of hotels, which have become costly and a focal point for protests, as Labour seeks to accelerate its strategy to end their use. Two former military sites are already in use, and officials are now working to identify additional locations. The announcement comes as the new Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, faces the challenge of a rising number of small boat crossings over the English Channel.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Rand Paul has strongly criticized Vice President JD Vance for his remarks supporting the recent U.S. military strike that killed 11 alleged Venezuelan drug traffickers. Vance had called the extrajudicial killings the "highest and best use of our military," a sentiment Paul labeled as "despicable and thoughtless." Citing the novel "To Kill a Mockingbird," Paul condemned the glorification of killing accused individuals without a trial or due process.
