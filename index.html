          <p>The England manager understands how Jude Bellingham's on-field attitude can cause 'mixed emotions'. He said Bellingham has the fire and he doesn't want to dim this down. He should play with this kind of fire, but the fire comes with some attributes that can intimidate you, maybe even as a team-mate. If he smiles, he wins everyone. But sometimes you see the rage, the hunger and the fire and it comes out in a way that can be a bit repulsive, for example, for my mother when she sits in front of the TV. I see that but, in general, we are very happy to have him. He's a special boy.</p>

          <p>Entering a romantic relationship can often lead to a decline in friendships, as society tends to prioritize romantic love over platonic bonds. This cultural emphasis can result in individuals losing close friendships when they become romantically involved. Experts suggest that a balanced approach, where both romantic partners and friends are valued, is essential for long-term well-being. By prioritizing both love and friendship, individuals can maintain a supportive network and avoid the potential isolation that can arise from focusing solely on romantic relationships.</p>

          <p>A combination of factors contributed to the violence in Ballymena, County Antrim, following a peaceful protest. The PSNI has branded the violence "racist thuggery", and pointed to a "mob mentality" fuelled by social media. The families who were targeted, many of them relatively new to Northern Ireland, have been left feeling terrified and terrorised. The riots broke out after a planned peaceful protest on Monday evening, in response to an alleged serious sexual assault in the County Antrim town on Saturday evening.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has echoed President Trump's criticism of the Federal Reserve, stating that the Fed's refusal to cut rates is "monetary malpractice." Vance's statement follows a report showing that tariffs are yet to exert any substantial upward pressure on inflation.

I make no excuses.” She has been open about her health struggles and financial difficulties in the past.</p>
