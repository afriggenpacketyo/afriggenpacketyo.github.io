        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The July jobs report revealed a significant slowdown in the U.S. economy, with nonfarm payrolls growing by only 73,000, far below expectations. Downward revisions for May and June brought the three-month average job gain to a mere 35,000, fueling concerns about a potential recession. Economists are divided on the outlook, with some citing tariff pressures and slowing consumer spending as major risks, while White House officials remain optimistic. The weak labor market data has increased pressure on the Federal Reserve to consider interest rate cuts to stimulate growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pfizer has increased its full-year adjusted profit forecast for 2025, citing the success of its cost-cutting initiatives and strong performance, particularly from its COVID-19 products. The pharmaceutical company reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, with sales of its Comirnaty vaccine and Paxlovid pill showing significant year-over-year growth. The updated outlook also accounts for potential impacts from U.S. tariffs and political pressure to lower drug prices.

          <p>Russia has entered the escalating trade dispute between the United States and India, stating that New Delhi has the sovereign right to choose its own trading partners. The intervention comes after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose significantly higher tariffs on India if it continues to purchase Russian oil. A Kremlin spokesperson criticized the U.S. threats as illegitimate attempts to force countries to sever trade relations with Russia. The dispute is being closely monitored, as India has accused the U.S. and EU of hypocrisy, noting their own continued trade with Russia.</p>

          <p>Yum Brands, the parent company of KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell, reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that fell short of analyst expectations. The disappointing results were driven by declining same-store sales at its Pizza Hut and KFC chains within the United States. While overall net sales saw a 10% increase to $1.93 billion, the company's adjusted earnings per share of $1.44 did not meet the anticipated $1.46. The performance highlights ongoing struggles for some of the company's key brands in its domestic market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This essay reflects on the concept of evil, using the case of Bryan Kohberger, convicted of the University of Idaho murders, as a starting point. The author questions the utility of labeling perpetrators as simply "evil," arguing it can be a way to stop thinking critically about the complex causes of violence. Drawing parallels to other cases, like the 1966 Texas tower sniper who had a brain tumor, the article explores how biological and environmental factors can influence behavior. It suggests that a deeper, more compassionate inquiry into the roots of such horrific acts is necessary to prevent future tragedies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration was forced to release over $5 billion in federal K–12 education funds after a four-week freeze sparked widespread backlash from educators and lawmakers across the political spectrum. The freeze, which the administration claimed was to review spending on "radical" agendas, disrupted budget planning for school districts nationwide, from rural North Dakota to large urban centers. An unusual alliance of red-state Republican senators and big-city school officials opposed the move, highlighting the political difficulty of cutting popular education programs.

While the long-held maxim is that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought, the actions and doctrines of countries like the U.S., Russia, and China suggest they are preparing for such a possibility. Proponents argue that planning for limited nuclear use is necessary for deterrence, while critics warn that it makes such a conflict more likely and risks uncontrollable escalation.

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has stated that police guidance regarding the disclosure of personal information about crime suspects, including their immigration status, "needs to change." The comments follow a public debate over Warwickshire Police's decision not to release such details for two men arrested in a high-profile sexual assault case. While police follow national guidance to avoid prejudicing legal proceedings, there is growing pressure for greater transparency, especially in cases that could fuel public unrest or misinformation. The Law Commission is now expediting a review of the governing rules.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has proposed a new 12-month pilot program that could require some foreign nationals to pay a bond of up to $15,000 to obtain a business or tourist visa. The program is designed to deter visa overstays and would apply to individuals from countries with high overstay rates or where security vetting is considered deficient. The notice does not specify which countries will be affected. This move is part of the Trump administration's broader agenda to tighten immigration controls, which has included travel bans and increased scrutiny of student visas.</p>

          <p>Byron Black, a 69-year-old convicted triple-murderer, is scheduled to be executed in Tennessee, potentially becoming the first person put to death with an active defibrillator implanted in his chest. His lawyers argued unsuccessfully for a delay, raising concerns that the device could deliver electric shocks during the lethal injection process, causing unnecessary suffering and a "grotesque spectacle." State officials have contended that the lethal drugs will not trigger the device. Black, who is in poor health, was convicted for the 1988 murders of his girlfriend and her two young daughters.</p>

          <p>A contributor critiques the trend of converting decommissioned Cold War missile silos into commercial properties, focusing on an Atlas F silo in Kansas currently listed on Zillow. The author argues that marketing these sites as quirky venues or luxury bunkers erases their true purpose as architecture for mass annihilation. While the real estate listing highlights features like blast doors, it ignores that the site was built to launch a thermonuclear warhead. The piece contends that such repurposing represents a failure to reckon with the terrifying legacy of nuclear deterrence, a strategy that remains active today.</p>

          <p>A report from compensation consultancy Johnson Associates projects that Wall Street traders can expect their annual bonuses to increase by 10% to 30% this year. The significant rise is attributed to their ability to capitalize on market volatility driven by uncertainty around trade tariffs and other economic shifts. In contrast, compensation for most other financial sector employees, including investment bankers and asset managers, is expected to be flat or see only modest single-digit increases. The report suggests the benefits of recent market activity are not being distributed evenly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, former U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich argues that President Trump's firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioner has shattered the agency's credibility. Reich explains that the BLS's independence is crucial for providing trusted, non-politicized data about the economy. By firing the commissioner over job numbers he disliked and accusing the agency of rigging data, Trump has sent a message that he will replace any messenger who delivers facts he disagrees with. Reich warns this is part of a broader attack on fact-based institutions, from the Federal Reserve to the EPA.</p>

The author claims the move is based on strained legal arguments and outlier science, and that it repudiates the federal government's authority to combat climate change.
