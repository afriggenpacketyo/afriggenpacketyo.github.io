          <p>New government measures will grant police chiefs the authority to automatically dismiss officers who fail background checks, aiming to restore public confidence in policing after serious cases undermined trust. The reforms, prompted by an independent report following the murder of Sarah Everard by a police officer, make passing vetting checks a legal requirement for all serving officers. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper emphasized the reforms are essential to ensure only officers of the highest standards wear the uniform, addressing concerns about officers remaining on full pay despite failing vetting. The National Police Chiefs' Council supports the changes, viewing them as providing clear routes to remove individuals who fall below expected standards.</p>

          <p>Tesla is carefully considering entering the Indian market, according to CFO Vaibhav Taneja, due to high import tariffs and luxury taxes that could significantly increase the price of its vehicles. Despite India's large middle class making it an attractive market, the 70% tariff on EV imports presents a significant challenge. India has expressed interest in Tesla establishing a manufacturing base within the country, but protectionist policies remain a hurdle. CEO Elon Musk recently discussed technology and innovation collaboration with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, signaling ongoing negotiations.</p>

          <p>Chinese state-backed energy firms may need to renegotiate long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG) contracts with US providers due to the ongoing trade war, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights. Trade flows of US LNG to China have ceased since Beijing imposed tariffs in response to US actions, now reaching at least 140 percent. While the US has only supplied a small portion of China's LNG imports, volumes were expected to increase significantly. Chinese buyers currently hold numerous long-term procurement contracts with US producers, but these could be resold to other markets in the short term.</p>

In Chaoshan, ancestral halls and lineage are highly honored, leading many families to have multiple children. Guangdong recorded over one million births in 2024, making it China's top province for new births for the seventh consecutive year.
