          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal has gained strength as it moves toward the U.S. southeast coast, with landfall expected in South Carolina. The National Hurricane Center issued tropical storm warnings for parts of North and South Carolina, anticipating heavy rainfall of up to six inches in some areas. This significant precipitation raises concerns about potential flash flooding through Monday. In response, South Carolina's Emergency Management division has alerted coastal residents to the possibility of isolated tornadoes and minor flooding, urging caution on water-covered roads.</p>

          <p>Tensions over mass tourism and housing shortages on the Spanish island of Mallorca have escalated, with anti-German graffiti appearing on shops and cars. In the southern village of Santanyi, dozens of German-owned properties were defaced with slogans such as "Germans out" and "Foreign buyers go to hell." Police have confirmed the incidents, which have alarmed long-term German residents who contribute to the local economy. The vandalism reflects growing local frustration, which has also manifested in recent large-scale protests against the negative impacts of tourism on the popular holiday island.</p>

          <p>A large-scale rescue operation is underway in southern Germany after a father and his six-year-old child went missing in a boating accident on the Eibsee, an Alpine lake. The incident occurred when the family of four was on a pedal boat and the child fell into the water. The father jumped in to attempt a rescue, but neither of them resurfaced from the lake. Emergency responders are caring for the mother and the other child, who is four years old. The search involves helicopters and divers as authorities work to locate the missing pair.</p>

          <p>German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt will host a summit with counterparts from France, Poland, Austria, Denmark, and the Czech Republic to discuss tightening European migration rules. The meeting, scheduled for July 18 on Germany's highest mountain, the Zugspitze, aims to build momentum for a more stringent EU-wide policy. Key topics will include combating people smuggling and improving deportation procedures. This initiative comes as EU member states debate reforms to the bloc's common asylum system, which are planned to be fully implemented by 2026.</p>

The game, which drew over 66,000 fans in Atlanta, saw PSG advance despite two late red cards. Musiala's injury cast a somber mood over the otherwise thrilling contest.</p>

This year's parade, held under the motto "For queer rights. Many. Together. Strong.," featured approximately 90 floats.

          <p>A French intelligence assessment concludes that China has been actively working to undermine the reputation and sales of France's flagship Rafale fighter jet. The report alleges that Chinese embassy defense attaches have led a campaign to spread doubts about the jet's performance, particularly following its use in India-Pakistan clashes. This effort reportedly involved lobbying potential buyers, such as Indonesia, to discourage purchases and promote Chinese-made aircraft instead. While French officials have not directly linked the online disinformation to the Chinese government, they view it as a strategic attack on France's credibility and defense industry.</p>

Bure, 49, contrasted this with what she sees as a more body-positive outlook among younger generations.

          <p>A new gene therapy delivered via a single injection has shown remarkable results in reversing a form of congenital deafness, according to a clinical trial. The therapy involves delivering a healthy copy of the OTOF gene to the inner ear, which is crucial for transmitting sound signals to the brain. All ten participants in the small-scale trial, who had deafness caused by mutations in this gene, showed considerable hearing improvement within six months. The treatment, which was found to be safe, proved especially effective in children, with one seven-year-old regaining nearly full hearing.</p>

The owner, Andrew Board, caught a man stealing a crate of beer and brought him back to the store. However, police dealt with the matter through a community resolution, requiring the offender only to pay for the stolen goods and accept a ban from the shop. Board argues that this approach fails to deter crime, reflecting a broader national issue where a majority of reported shoplifting offenses do not result in charges.</p>

          <p>Monasteries and convents across Germany are closing at an alarming rate as religious orders struggle with aging populations and a severe lack of new members. In the decade from 2012 to 2022, the number of convents dropped from 1,627 to 964, forcing many to sell their historic properties. This decline is attributed to the church's diminishing influence and increased professional opportunities for women outside religious life.

          <h2>Chinese Researchers Link Genetics to Brain's Information Processing Capabilities</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by Chinese researchers has found that genetic factors play a significant role in shaping the brain's "criticality," a crucial balance between neural excitation and inhibition. This state of balance is widely believed to enhance the brain's ability to process information effectively. The research, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, demonstrated that genetics influence criticality across various scales, from individual brain regions to large networks. The findings also suggest a shared genetic foundation between brain criticality and cognitive functions, opening new avenues for understanding brain health and dysfunction.</p>

          <p>This article provides context on the 2022 dismissal of murder charges against Barry Morphew in the case of his missing wife, Suzanne. A judge dropped the charges just before trial after sanctioning prosecutors for repeatedly failing to turn over potentially exculpatory evidence to the defense. This evidence included DNA from Suzanne's car linked to unsolved sexual assault cases in other states, suggesting another potential suspect. The judge found the prosecution's actions amounted to "negligent and arguably, reckless disregard" for their obligations, ultimately leading to the case's dismissal without prejudice.</p>

          <p>Barry Morphew has been arrested for a second time and indicted on first-degree murder charges in the 2020 death of his wife, Suzanne Morphew. This new indictment follows the discovery of Suzanne's remains in a shallow grave, which revealed she had been tranquilized with a compound used on wildlife. The indictment alleges her body was moved at least twice after she died, and that Barry Morphew was the only private citizen in the area with access to the specific tranquilizer drugs found in her system. The initial charges against him were dropped in 2022 due to prosecutorial missteps.</p>

          <p>Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's Supreme Leader, made his first public appearance since the beginning of a recent 12-day war between Iran and Israel. He attended a mourning ceremony in Tehran, ending speculation about his seclusion during the conflict, which reportedly involved U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. The war resulted in over 900 acknowledged deaths in Iran and significant damage to its nuclear program. In response to the conflict, Iran has suspended cooperation with the UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, further escalating tensions over its atomic ambitions.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the United Nations is facing an acute funding crisis that threatens the entire international rules-based order, largely driven by the United States. The Trump administration has initiated a review with the potential to end or drastically reduce funding to the UN and other international bodies, following the abolition of USAID. The author contends that this, combined with other countries falling behind on dues and ignoring international law, is crippling the UN's ability to function. The piece warns that the failure of the UN would lead to global anarchy, with nothing to replace it.</p>

          <p>The UK's High Court has ordered a new, robust investigation into MI5 after ruling that the Security Service's internal inquiries into its own misconduct were "deficient." The case stems from MI5 providing false evidence to three courts to conceal its relationship with a violent, misogynistic agent. After being exposed, MI5 apologized and launched two reviews that attributed the failure to mistakes and memory lapses. However, newly revealed secret material showed MI5 continued to mislead the court about these inquiries, withholding key information that undermined their conclusions and attempting to keep damning evidence secret.</p>

          <p>A new trend is emerging in China's travel market as young people, particularly recent university graduates, are increasingly choosing cruise ship holidays. Analysts find that these travelers are drawn to cruises as a unique and social way to travel with groups of friends and alumni. The contained environment of a ship, with its communal spaces and variety of activities, provides an ideal setting for bonding without the logistical challenges of other group travel. This demographic is fueling a notable boom in the Chinese cruise industry, which offers trips to nearby destinations like Japan.</p>

          <p>Billionaire Elon Musk has announced he is launching a new political party called the "America Party," positioning it as a challenge to the traditional two-party system in the U.S. The announcement, made on his social media platform X, follows a recent and public falling out with President Donald Trump, under whom Musk had briefly served. Musk, who is ineligible to run for president, did not name a leader for the party, and its formal registration with election authorities is unclear. The move reflects Musk's criticism that both major parties contribute to national debt and waste.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a £500 million plan to roll out "Best Start" family hubs to every local authority in England by April 2026. These hubs are designed to provide a wide range of support services for families, from midwifery and birth registration to debt advice and youth clubs. The initiative aims to support 500,000 more children in disadvantaged areas, building on a previous rollout of 400 hubs in 75 localities. The concept echoes the "Sure Start" centers of the early 2000s, aiming to provide a central point of access for family support.</p>
