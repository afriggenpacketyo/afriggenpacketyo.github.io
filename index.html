          <h2>Fungus Linked to Ancient Egyptian Tombs Shows Potential for Cancer Treatment</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 05:00:58 EDT</div>

          <p>Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have discovered that a fungus, Aspergillus flavus, historically associated with the "pharaoh's curse," may hold properties to combat cancer. Scientists modified molecules from the fungus to create a compound that shows potent effects against leukemia cells in laboratory tests. While the study is in its very early stages and has not yet been tested on animals or humans, the findings suggest that natural products like fungi remain a promising source for new medicines. The research highlights a potential therapeutic use for a fungus more commonly known for causing respiratory issues in immunocompromised individuals.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has created a searchable national database system to allow state and local election officials to verify the citizenship of voters. The system, an expansion of the Department of Homeland Security's SAVE program, integrates Social Security and immigration data to check against voter rolls. While officials say it could streamline verification, privacy advocates and legal experts express alarm over its rapid development without public debate or transparency. Concerns remain about the data's accuracy, its potential for misuse, and what the federal government will do with the state voter records it processes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Couples planning weddings are facing unexpected costs as U.S. tariffs on Chinese-made goods have significantly impacted the bridal industry. With approximately 90% of American wedding gowns manufactured in China, new tariffs have led to price hikes and surcharges of 10-30% on dresses and accessories. This has created uncertainty for both brides and boutique owners, who struggle to budget for fluctuating costs on gowns that are ordered months in advance. The article notes that producing these skilled, hand-beaded gowns in the U.S. is not currently feasible, making the industry particularly vulnerable to the trade policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a visit to Israel, German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt voiced strong support for Israel's recent military actions against Iran, describing Iran's nuclear program as a threat to both Israel and Europe. In response to regional tensions, Markus SÃ¶der, a prominent Bavarian leader, has called for Germany to establish its own "Iron Dome"-style missile defense shield. The proposal includes acquiring thousands of drones, new missile systems, and a significant number of Patriot systems to create a comprehensive protective shield for the country. This reflects a growing sentiment in Germany for bolstering its national defense capabilities.</p>

          <p>A jury has found Samuel Woodward guilty of the first-degree murder of his former high school classmate, 19-year-old Blaze Bernstein, with an added hate crime enhancement. Bernstein, who was gay and Jewish, was stabbed to death in 2018. Prosecutors argued Woodward, a member of a neo-Nazi group, was motivated by hate, while the defense claimed he was provoked. The verdict, which came after a six-year legal process, means Woodward faces a sentence of life in prison without parole. The case has highlighted the dangers of extremist ideologies and their violent consequences.</p>

          <p>The French government has led a significant investment in satellite operator Eutelsat, aiming to establish a European competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink. This move is part of a broader push for Europe's technological sovereignty in the space sector, where it currently lags behind the U.S. However, experts express skepticism about Eutelsat's ability to match Starlink's scale, as its OneWeb constellation of 650 satellites is much smaller than Starlink's network of over 7,000. While Eutelsat may struggle in the mass-market consumer segment, it is well-positioned to serve European government, security, and enterprise clients. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In response to the perceived threat from Russia, five NATO countries bordering Russia or Belarusâ€”Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Polandâ€”have announced their withdrawal from the 1997 Ottawa Convention, which bans anti-personnel land mines. The move would allow them to produce and deploy mines along their borders as a deterrent, creating a new, explosive "Iron Curtain." This strategy is highly controversial due to the indiscriminate danger mines pose to civilians long after conflicts end.

While e-cigarettes are not included in the ban, violators of the new law could face fines of up to â‚¬700.

The Bishop of Leicester initially dismissed Hulme's complaint, even accusing him of witchcraft, before later apologizing.
