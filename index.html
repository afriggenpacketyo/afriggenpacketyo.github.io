          <p>The government is launching a 10-year industrial strategy aimed at boosting the UK economy by focusing on key sectors and reducing energy costs for businesses. The plan includes measures such as scrapping green levies, which could cut energy bills by up to 25% for over 7,000 UK businesses, and providing discounts on network charges for energy-intensive firms. Additional initiatives involve upskilling British workers, attracting global talent through visa reforms, streamlining planning processes, and increasing research and development spending, including Â£2 billion for AI. Prime Minister Starmer emphasized that this strategy will provide long-term certainty for businesses, while critics have raised concerns about the cost of net zero and the potential impact of the Employment Rights Bill on growth.

          <p>Satellite photos show the aftermath of U.S. military strikes on Iran's Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan nuclear facilities, revealing significant damage. The strikes, dubbed "Operation Midnight Hammer," involved B-2 Spirit bombers dropping GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators and Tomahawk missiles. Images show craters, ash, and blocked tunnel entrances at Fordo, as well as extensive building damage at Isfahan, including uranium conversion-related structures and tunnel entrances. While Iran has yet to offer a damage assessment, the IAEA reported no increase in off-site radiation levels, though they were unable to assess the underground damage at Fordo, urging dialogue and diplomacy to prevent further escalation.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Rubio is calling on China to persuade Iran not to close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical global oil trade route. This appeal follows U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, after which Iran warned it reserves the right to defend its sovereignty. Blocking the Strait of Hormuz could severely impact the global economy, potentially driving oil prices above $100 per barrel. While some analysts believe the U.S. Navy would swiftly counter any Iranian attempt to block the strait, others warn the market is underestimating the risk of prolonged disruption.</p>

          <p>The article explores three potential pathways for escalation following the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. These include the possibility of the U.S. needing to "finish the job" if the initial strikes were insufficient, a cycle of violence triggered by Iranian retaliation against U.S. forces or international shipping, and the risk of the situation spiraling out of control due to unforeseen consequences, drawing parallels to the 2003 Iraq War. The author expresses concern that the Trump administration may not have adequately considered the potential ramifications of their actions.</p>

          <h2>Strait of Hormuz's Vital Role in Oil Trade Highlighted Amid Iran Retaliation Fears</h2>

          <p>Concerns are rising about potential Iranian retaliation following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, including the possibility of Iran blocking oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait of Hormuz, a crucial maritime passage connecting the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea, facilitates the transit of millions of barrels of oil and petroleum products daily. Secretary of State Rubio warned that any Iranian effort to block the strait would be a "suicidal move," likely triggering backlash from numerous countries dependent on the trade route.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is defending its decision to launch a precision strike on Iranian nuclear sites without prior Congressional approval, asserting it was a limited engagement to disrupt Iranian nuclear capabilities. Secretary of State Rubio stated the action was not an attack on Iran or its people, but rather a targeted effort to degrade nuclear weaponization ambitions. However, some lawmakers, like Republican Rep. Massie, argue that the strikes lacked constitutional authorization and that Congress should have been consulted before any action was taken.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, world leaders and organizations have issued reactions ranging from condemnation to calls for de-escalation and diplomacy. While Israeli leaders lauded the strikes, Iran vowed "regrettable responses," and its allies, Hamas and the Houthis, pledged to join the retaliation. U.N. Secretary-General Guterres expressed grave alarm, urging de-escalation and emphasizing diplomacy. Other nations, including Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, and China, have also weighed in, reflecting the widespread concern over the potential for regional conflict.</p>

          <p>Details have emerged regarding how the U.S. conducted airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites without detection. Operation Midnight Hammer involved B-2 stealth bombers dropping 30,000-pound bombs on key underground uranium enrichment plants, while a U.S. submarine launched cruise missiles. The operation relied on deceptive tactics, including a decoy plan with B-2 bombers traveling west, and minimizing communications to maintain secrecy. U.S. officials claim Iran did not detect the inbound aircraft or launch any defenses.</p>

          <p>The increasing practice of immigration agents wearing masks to avoid recognition is criticized as undermining their authority and endangering public safety. The use of masks can contradict Department of Homeland Security guidelines and provide cover for agents to violate rights. It can also confuse both bystanders and targets, potentially leading to interference in law enforcement actions. The author argues that the need for citizen accountability outweighs any justification for agent anonymity.</p>
