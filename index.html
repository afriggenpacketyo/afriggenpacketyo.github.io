          <p>The Tennessee Titans selected Miami quarterback Cam Ward as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, fulfilling weeks of predictions. The Jacksonville Jaguars traded up to select Colorado's Travis Hunter, a two-way player. The draft saw a focus on offensive and defensive lines, with seven of the first 12 picks being linemen, unlike the previous year's quarterback-heavy draft. The New York Giants traded back into the first round to select Ole Miss quarterback Jaxson Dart, marking only the second quarterback selected in the first round.</p>

          <p>President Trump asserted that trade talks with China were ongoing, a claim refuted by Chinese officials who stated there were "absolutely no negotiations" taking place.

This disagreement highlights the ongoing tensions between the two countries despite indications from Trump and Treasury Secretary Bessent about a potential easing of trade disputes, which have included escalating tariffs and restrictions on critical minerals.</p>

          <p>California's GDP reached $4.10 trillion in 2024, surpassing Japan to become the fourth-largest economy globally, trailing only the United States, China, and Germany.

Newsom also voiced concerns about the impact of President Trump's tariff policies on the state's economy, emphasizing the need to protect California's economic power. Japan's economy faces challenges due to its declining and aging population, impacting its workforce and social care costs.</p>

          <p>The New York Giants traded with the Houston Texans to draft former Ole Miss quarterback Jaxson Dart with the No. 25 pick in the NFL Draft. Dart, who averaged 329.2 passing yards per game last season, is seen as the Giants' quarterback of the future. The speculation of drafting Dart was fueled by Giants' general manager Joe Schoen's son posting a video of Dart on social media. Dart will step in as the Giants' presumptive quarterback of the future and look to live up to Eli Manning's legacy.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece suggests China could enhance its soft power in Africa by adopting a non-governmental organization (NGO) model similar to Western countries. While China has invested heavily in infrastructure projects through government-to-government aid, a decentralized NGO network could foster better community engagement and human connections. The author argues that this approach could counter narratives of China as a neocolonial power and address cultural clashes and social isolation often associated with Chinese investments.</p>

          <p>The Trump Organization began selling "Trump 2028" hats and shirts on its online store, sparking speculation about President Donald Trump seeking a third term in office. The U.S. Constitution limits presidents to two terms. Trump has repeatedly teased the possibility of running for a third term, suggesting there are "methods" to do so, though he acknowledges it is too early to consider.</p>

          <p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov indicated that the US and Russia are moving in the "right direction" to end the war in Ukraine, noting that they are "ready to reach a deal." This comes after a deadly Russian airstrike on Kyiv, which President Trump responded to by urging Putin to stop.
