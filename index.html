Altman noted that Meta considers OpenAI its biggest competitor, as its AI efforts have not been as successful as hoped. Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, is personally building a top AI team for its "superintelligence" AI lab and investing heavily in AI research.

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the Trump administration from enforcing a policy requiring Americans to select their gender assigned at birth on new passports. The ruling allows individuals to choose the gender they identify with, including selecting "X" on passport applications. The judge deemed the policy discriminatory against transgender Americans. The White House criticized the ruling as an attempt to thwart President Trump's agenda, while the Justice Department has appealed the decision. </p>

          <p>Two wildfires in New Mexico are burning over 80,000 acres, leading to evacuation orders for approximately 2,000 homes and a state of emergency declaration. The Buck Fire and Trout Fire are burning in Catron County and the Gila National Forest, respectively. Extreme drought conditions and high temperatures have contributed to the fires' growth. New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham has allocated $750,000 for emergency response efforts and deployed the National Guard to assist. </p>
