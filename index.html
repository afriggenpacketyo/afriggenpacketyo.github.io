          <p>France is experiencing significant political turmoil following the resignation of Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu after only 27 days, leaving the country's fiscal consolidation in jeopardy. President Emmanuel Macron has given him a 48-hour deadline to resolve the political deadlock, which has paralyzed the government and prevented budget planning. This crisis draws sharp focus to France's massive budget deficit and public debt, which far exceed EU limits, raising serious concerns among European officials and investors about the nation's economic stability and ability to implement necessary reforms.

          <p>The European Union has proposed measures to protect its steel industry, including reducing tariff-free import quotas and increasing tariffs on excess imports from 25% to 50%. This announcement caused a surge in the stock prices of major European steel producers like SSAB and Thyssenkrupp. Conversely, the auto industry expressed concern, with shares for companies like BMW and Mercedes-Benz falling due to the prospect of higher material costs and their potential impact on vehicle manufacturing prices, highlighting the complex economic trade-offs of the policy.

          <p>Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel has generated controversy with recent comments suggesting that Poland and Baltic states opposed a 2021 EU initiative for direct talks with Vladimir Putin, which she implied could have influenced events leading to the Ukraine invasion. Her statements have drawn sharp criticism from officials in those countries, who called the accusation "outrageous" and accused her of deflecting from her own past policies. Conversely, Merkel's remarks were praised by Moscow, which claimed the EU is "held hostage" by the policies of its eastern members.</p>

          <p>Kemi Badenoch, leader of the UK's Conservative party, is set to announce a new economic "golden rule" aimed at reducing government borrowing and enabling tax cuts. Under the proposed plan, half of all savings achieved by the government would be allocated to deficit reduction, while the other half would fund pro-growth policies, including tax reductions. In her party conference speech, Badenoch will frame the policy as a path to fiscal responsibility and contrast it with the Labour government's approach, which she will criticize as a "borrowing and tax doom loop."</p>

          <p>The participation of Australian cricket captain Pat Cummins in the upcoming Ashes series is in doubt due to a persistent back stress injury. While no final decision has been made, recent scans reportedly show the issue has not fully healed, raising concerns he could miss the first Test and potentially the entire series. Cummins' absence would be a significant blow to the Australian team, likely leading to Steve Smith taking over captaincy and Scott Boland joining the pace attack. The situation adds to the injury concerns for both teams, with England's captain Ben Stokes also recovering from a shoulder issue.</p>

          <p>An attack by Myanmar's military has resulted in the deaths of at least 24 people and injured 47 others in the Sagaing region. The military used a motorized paraglider to drop two bombs on a crowd of approximately 100 people gathered for a peaceful protest against the ruling junta. This incident is part of a disturbing trend where the military employs paramotors for airstrikes amid its ongoing civil war with resistance forces. Amnesty International has condemned the attack, calling for urgent protection for civilians in the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing US government shutdown is leading to significant flight delays and cancellations nationwide as air traffic controller shortages worsen. Controllers are deemed essential and must work without pay, leading to an increase in sick calls that leave control towers understaffed in key locations like Nashville, Dallas, and Chicago. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association stated that the shutdown is exacerbating a pre-existing staffing crisis. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy expressed concern that controllers are facing immense financial stress, potentially forcing them to take second jobs while performing their high-pressure duties.</p>

          <p>The government of Chad has ended its 15-year partnership with African Parks, a prominent conservation charity with Prince Harry on its board of directors. The Chadian environment ministry accused the organization of failing to curb poaching, lacking investment, and displaying a disrespectful attitude towards national authorities. This decision removes the charity's mandate to manage two major protected areas, including the Greater Zakouma Ecosystem. The move represents another significant blow to the organization, which has recently faced allegations of abuse by its employees in the Republic of Congo.</p>

          <p>A building undergoing renovation in Madrid partially collapsed, resulting in the deaths of four construction workers. Emergency services recovered the bodies from the rubble after an extensive search operation that involved police dogs. At least three other workers were injured in the incident, which occurred while the building was being converted into a four-star hotel. The Madrid Judicial Police are now investigating the cause of the structural failure as a workplace accident. Witnesses reported hearing a loud bang and seeing a thick cloud of smoke.</p>

          <p>Researchers have successfully tested a new method that converts the blood type of donor kidneys, a breakthrough that could significantly expand the pool of available organs for transplantation. The technique uses enzymes to change kidneys to the universal O-type, potentially reducing wait times and improving allocation equality for patients of all blood types. In a recent experiment, an enzyme-converted kidney was transplanted into a recipient and functioned for two days without signs of hyperacute rejection. This development offers a more immediate solution than animal-to-human transplants, which remain years away from common practice.</p>

While a direct landfall is not anticipated, its path is projected to take it near or north of the northern Leeward Islands by late Thursday or Friday. A tropical storm watch has been issued for several Caribbean islands, which are expected to experience life-threatening surf, rip currents, and heavy rainfall.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts has explained his decision to initially hold back star relief pitcher Roki Sasaki during a critical ninth-inning situation in Game 2 of the NLDS. Roberts cited the need to manage the workload of Sasaki, a rookie recently converted from a starting role, as the reason for using Blake Treinen instead. The plan nearly failed as Treinen allowed two runs, forcing Sasaki to enter the game anyway to secure the final out. Moving forward, Roberts confirmed Sasaki is the primary closing option but emphasized that he cannot be used in every game.</p>

Mackesy described the theft as a major setback, compounded by the personal grief of losing his mother and his beloved dog during the same period, but he ultimately persevered to complete the new book.</p>

          <p>Residents of a Portland, Oregon, apartment complex are living in what they describe as a "war zone" due to nightly clashes between federal agents and protesters outside a nearby ICE facility. The unrest has led to tear gas seeping into their homes, forcing some to sleep with gas masks on. The situation has placed Portland at the center of a national debate, with President Trump threatening to deploy the National Guard, a move temporarily blocked by a federal judge. While many city residents blame federal agents for escalating tensions, those living at the epicenter are divided and exhausted by the constant conflict.</p>
