          <h2>German Intelligence Classifies AfD as Extreme-Right</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 07:40:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's domestic intelligence agency has officially classified the Alternative fÃ¼r Deutschland (AfD) party as right-wing extremist, a move likely to be challenged in courts. The agency stated that the AfD's views on ethnicity and ancestry are incompatible with Germany's democratic order, specifically citing the party's stance on citizens with a "migration background from predominantly Muslim countries." This classification allows for increased monitoring of the party through informants and surveillance, though a formal ban would require action from parliament, the government, or the constitutional court. The deputy leader of the Social Democrat SPD supports a ban on the AfD, emphasizing the importance of upholding Germany's post-war constitution.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Exxon Mobil's first-quarter earnings exceeded Wall Street's forecasts, although they decreased compared to the previous year due to falling crude oil prices driven by fears of tariffs impacting global demand. Volume growth in the Permian Basin and Guyana, along with cost-cutting measures, helped offset the negative impact of lower oil prices. The company's global production business saw a profit increase of approximately 19% year-over-year, primarily attributed to growth in the Permian and Guyana regions, as well as cost savings. Exxon returned $9.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share purchases during the quarter.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 07:32:30 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As debates intensify over President Trump's policy agenda, potential changes to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction could benefit higher earners. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 imposed a $10,000 limit on the federal SALT deduction, which is set to expire after 2025 unless Congress acts. Lawmakers from high-tax states are pushing for raising or repealing the SALT cap, and Trump has expressed support for SALT relief. Any changes to the SALT deduction will likely be part of a broader tax package, with negotiations influenced by budget constraints and competing priorities.</p>

          <p>Early results from local elections in England show Reform UK gaining a seat from Labour in the Runcorn and Helsby by-election after a recount. Andrea Jenkyns of Reform UK became the first mayor of Greater Lincolnshire, winning with over 40% of the vote. Labour retained three existing mayoralties, with Reform coming second in all of them, albeit with reduced majorities in Doncaster and North Tyneside. These local elections function as a referendum on the governing party, with Reform's gains indicating a potential shift in the political landscape.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform U.K. party secured a narrow victory in a parliamentary special election in Runcorn and Helsby, seizing a long-held Labour seat. Sarah Pochin of Reform won by a mere six votes, highlighting the party's growing influence and Britain's shifting political landscape. The anti-immigration Reform U.K. party is hoping to emerge as a genuine rival to Britainâ€™s two major parties, capitalizing on voter dissatisfaction with the economy and tensions over immigration. While Labour retained several mayoralties, Reform performed strongly, underscoring the potential for a more polarized, multiparty system.</p>

          <p>Cities in California are rapidly changing their approach to homeless encampments, prompted by a Supreme Court ruling allowing enforcement of anti-camping bans. They are expanding "interim housing" options, such as tiny house shelters, to move people off the streets more quickly. While critics caution against a two-tiered housing system, elected officials view temporary housing as a faster and cheaper alternative to permanent supportive housing. San Francisco and San Jose are embracing more forceful approaches, including arrests for those who refuse shelter, alongside expanding interim housing options.</p>

The decision comes after an expert group recommended separate legislation to address abuse and violence against women. The government has also shelved plans for a new law banning conversion therapy, hoping for a UK-wide solution instead.</p>

          <p>Chevron's stock price decreased after the oil major reported a decline in profit, primarily due to the drop in oil prices this year.

Chevron plans to repurchase a smaller amount of its own stock in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. The company's U.S. production business experienced a profit decline due to higher operating expenses and lower commodity prices, while its U.S. refining business returned to profitability but saw earnings decrease significantly.</p>

          <p>David Kirp argues that universities are under attack from the Trump administration and need to band together to defend academic freedom. He suggests that competition among universities is detrimental in the current climate and that a united front is necessary to resist assaults on their values. Well-endowed universities should support financially weaker institutions in legal battles, creating a "NATO for higher education" to deter the administration's actions. Kirp emphasizes that universities must hang together or risk hanging separately.</p>

          <p>A new analysis reveals that expected greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. oil and gas projects have increased under President Trump, reversing a previous decline during Joe Biden's administration. Despite tariffs causing economic chaos, the U.S. is projected to increase oil and gas extraction, leading to a surge in emissions. Trump's policies have been warmly welcomed by the fossil fuel industry, though tariffs on materials like steel and fears of recession have created uncertainty. The administration has also taken steps to hinder renewable energy projects, raising concerns about meeting climate targets.</p>
