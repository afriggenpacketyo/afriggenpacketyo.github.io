          <p>A U.S. Army sergeant is in custody after allegedly shooting and wounding five soldiers at Fort Stewart in Georgia using his personal handgun. The incident, which involved the suspect's co-workers, prompted a base-wide lockdown that has since been lifted, with all victims reported in stable condition and expected to recover. Authorities praised the immediate intervention of other soldiers for preventing further casualties, and the White House confirmed President Trump has been briefed on the developing situation. This event underscores concerns about firearm restrictions on military bases, even for personal weapons, and the ongoing challenges of maintaining safety within these environments.</p>

          <p>An "unprecedented" wildfire is raging in southwestern France, having claimed one life and injured thirteen, including nine firefighters. This catastrophic blaze, the largest since 1949, has scorched over 15,000 hectares, forcing evacuations and road closures. Prime Minister Francois Bayrou attributed the disaster to global warming and drought, highlighting its severe environmental and human toll. Firefighters, supported by water bomber planes, continue their arduous battle against the rapidly spreading inferno, with significant portions of villages already devastated. The ongoing efforts aim to contain this immense natural disaster.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, a self-identified Democratic Socialist, faces scrutiny for spending over $33,000 on private security, contrasting sharply with his past public calls to "defund the NYPD." This financial outlay, coupled with reports of armed security at his wedding, has fueled accusations of hypocrisy. Mamdani recently softened his anti-police stance after a deadly Manhattan shooting, claiming his previous tweets are "out of step" with his current campaign. However, he has not retracted a more recent pledge to disband the NYPD's Strategic Response Group, sparking further debate about his evolving positions on public safety.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has sanctioned Mexican musician Ricardo Hernández, "El Makabelico," alleging he laundered money for the Cartel del Noreste (CDN) through concerts, with 50% of his streaming royalties reportedly going to the cartel. This move, part of a broader effort against "narco-culture" artists, aims to block his U.S. properties and financial transactions. The sanctions highlight the administration's focus on disrupting alternative revenue streams for criminal enterprises, beyond traditional drug trafficking. This action follows previous visa revocations for other Mexican musicians, sparking debate on artistic expression versus censorship, and the dangers faced by artists linked to cartels.</p>

St. Charles Police confirmed no device was found after a thorough search, and all 400 evacuated guests and staff safely returned. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has instructed state police to investigate this incident, emphasizing that threats of violence will be held accountable. This event escalates the political standoff, with Texas Republicans, including Governor Greg Abbott, intensifying efforts to force the Democrats' return, even calling for FBI involvement in the contentious legislative battle.</p>

          <p>The BBC's "MasterChef" has returned with new episodes featuring hosts Gregg Wallace and John Torode, despite their recent sacking over misconduct allegations. The series, filmed before the allegations were upheld, is being aired by the BBC to support the participating chefs, a decision that has drawn significant backlash. Reports indicate the episodes have been edited to reduce the hosts' usual banter and jokes, making the show feel "different" to regular viewers. The controversy stems from upheld complaints against Wallace, including unwelcome physical contact, and a severely offensive racist term allegedly used by Torode, leaving a "bitter aftertaste" for many.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump faces strategic choices in filling the Federal Reserve board vacancy left by Adriana Kugler's resignation, which could significantly impact the central bank's policy direction. Options include appointing a short-term "shadow chair" to challenge current Chair Jerome Powell, or directly nominating his preferred long-term Fed chair. This situation introduces political intrigue into the historically collegial institution, as Trump seeks appointees favoring aggressive rate cuts. The decision carries both opportunity and peril, with potential candidates like Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett being considered for the influential role. This article highlights the fluid situation and the potential for institutional pushback against political influence on the Fed's independence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s decision to cancel nearly $500 million in contracts for mRNA vaccine research has deeply dismayed public health and biosecurity experts. While Kennedy asserts this move aims to find "better solutions" beyond mRNA technology, critics, including former biodefense officials, condemn it as a "dangerous public health judgment" that could severely compromise U.S. preparedness for future pandemics and bioterrorism. Experts emphasize mRNA's proven safety, effectiveness, and critical speed for rapid response to new threats, arguing that diverting funds to older technologies is an irresponsible step backward for national security and public health.</p>

Experts emphasize that wildfire smoke, containing toxic substances from burned buildings and materials, can be more harmful than standard air pollution.

          <p>Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shia militant and political movement, has vehemently rejected the Lebanese government's decision to establish a state monopoly on arms, labeling it a "grave sin" and vowing to disregard it entirely. The group asserts that this decision is a result of American "diktats" and insists it will not discuss disarmament while Israeli attacks continue, accusing Israel of ceasefire breaches. This defiant stance comes despite mounting international pressure for Hezbollah to disarm, particularly after last year's conflict with Israel. The ongoing standoff underscores the deep internal divisions within Lebanon and risks escalating political and security tensions in the region.</p>

          <p>The murder of Minnesota nurse Alexandra Pennig, initially reported as a suicide, was ultimately solved by a small, crucial piece of a bathroom door lock found beneath her body. Detectives Abby DeSanto and Jennifer O'Donnell investigated Matthew Ecker, the only other person present, who claimed Pennig locked herself in the bathroom and shot herself, after which he broke the door open. However, the discovery of the metal ring, indicating the door was forced open *before* the shot, directly contradicted Ecker's narrative. This pivotal forensic evidence proved Ecker had lied, leading to his conviction for second-degree murder and a 30-year sentence.</p>

The migrants, who have faced months of delays in their applications, are escorted by various Mexican authorities, highlighting the government's strategy of containing migrants in its southern region.

This "ongoing siege" has resulted in significant backlogs, unspent funds, and a demoralized workforce, with many officials quitting or being fired.
