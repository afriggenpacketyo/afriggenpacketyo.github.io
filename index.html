          <p>Prince Harry has voiced his desire for reconciliation with the Royal Family in a recent BBC interview, expressing his devastation over losing a legal challenge regarding his security in the UK. Harry stated that he cannot envision bringing his wife and children back to the UK due to security concerns, feeling that his family's safety has been compromised since stepping down as senior royals in 2020. He mentioned being cut off from his father, King Charles, and hopes for reconciliation, emphasizing the preciousness of life and the desire to end the ongoing disputes. The prince also added that he loves his country, despite what some people have done and is saddened that he cannot show his children their homeland.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed budget for the 2026 fiscal year outlines $163 billion in cuts to federal spending, targeting departments such as Education, Health and Human Services, USAID, and the Environmental Protection Agency. While the budget proposes a 13% increase in defense spending, Republican senators have criticized the proposal, claiming it leaves military spending flat, which is a cut in real terms. The White House defends the cuts, stating they would lead to significant savings while protecting funding for homeland security, veterans, seniors, law enforcement, and infrastructure. Senate Democrats have also criticized the budget, expressing alarm that the request could severely slash programs many Americans rely on.</p>

          <p>A photograph revealed Michael Waltz, then national security advisor, using an alternative messaging platform similar to Signal, raising concerns about White House communication security. The app, TeleMessage, archives messages, potentially conflicting with federal record-keeping rules, while Signal's encrypted and auto-deleting messages pose challenges for the National Archives. Cybersecurity experts question the security of TeleMessage, noting that the company had in the past routed information through Israel, which is renowned for its electronic spying skills. Senator Ron Wyden criticized the use of a "counterfeit Signal knockoff," highlighting potential counterintelligence risks.

          <p>The expiration of a tariff exemption, known as the de minimis loophole, is set to increase the cost of goods from China for U.S. consumers. This loophole, which previously allowed packages worth under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free, was eliminated by President Trump, leading retailers to add tariff surcharges to customer orders. Experts anticipate that this change will result in higher prices, longer delivery times, and a diminished market for price-sensitive goods. Companies selling goods made in the U.S. may benefit from reduced competition, but consumers are expected to seek cheaper alternatives or turn to resale platforms.</p>

Researchers found that Ronan outperformed college students in keeping a beat, showcasing her lifetime learning and flexibility in recognizing new rhythms.

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Health and Human Services Secretary, is spearheading a $50 million research effort to understand the causes of autism, but his statements about the condition have raised concerns among scientists. Kennedy has made inaccurate claims about autism being preventable and solely caused by environmental factors, dismissing the role of genetics. Researchers are troubled by the lack of consultation and the potential cuts to existing government-funded autism research programs. The initiative also includes plans for a secure data repository using personal health information, similar to the National Cancer Institute's program, raising questions about privacy and the direction of autism research.</p>

In contrast, both the Conservatives and Labour experienced losses, while the Liberal Democrats and Greens showed resilience.

The report comes amid an uncertain climate in which Trump kicked off April by slapping "liberation day" 10% across-the-board tariffs on U.S. imports, and threatened a menu of other "reciprocal" duties on dozens of other nations. Health care and transportation led job creation, while the federal government reported a loss of jobs.
