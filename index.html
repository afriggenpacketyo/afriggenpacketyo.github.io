          <p>The upcoming election in South Korea is likely to have a significant impact on the country's relationship with China. While both main candidates support the alliance with the United States, the leading candidate favors a more diplomatic approach with North Korea and China to ease current tensions. This shift in diplomatic strategy could lead to improved relations and increased cooperation between South Korea and China. The election results will be crucial in determining the future direction of South Korea's foreign policy and its approach to regional stability.</p>

          <p>Poland's upcoming presidential runoff election is poised to be a significant indicator for populist movements across Europe. The election pits the governing party against a surge of nationalist sentiment, creating a pivotal showdown that could influence the political landscape.

This election is being closely watched as a bellwether for the broader trend of populism in the region.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is expediting trade deal discussions with the European Union, but skepticism from the American right wing towards the EU could pose challenges. Some members of the U.S. right view the EU more as a rival than a partner, which may complicate the negotiation process and affect the terms of any potential agreement. This ideological divide could lead to contentious discussions and potentially hinder the establishment of favorable trade relations between the U.S. and the EU. The dynamics between these differing viewpoints will be crucial in shaping the future of transatlantic trade. </p>

          <p>AVZ Minerals has suspended its arbitration case against the Democratic Republic of Congo following encouragement from the U.S. government to resolve a dispute over the Manono lithium project. The U.S. is supporting KoBold Metals, backed by tech billionaires, to acquire AVZâ€™s stake in the project and invest $1 billion to develop it. This move is aimed at countering Chinaâ€™s Zijin Mining, which currently controls the northern section after Congo revoked AVZâ€™s rights in 2023. Washington's efforts signal a growing interest in securing critical minerals in Congo and directly challenging Chinaâ€™s dominance in the global green energy transition.</p>

Despite a Hollywood film topping ticket presales, the overall box office income for the first day of the festival was estimated at 122 million yuan, less than the May 1 holiday. This decline reflects broader struggles in stimulating domestic consumption and a decrease in Chinaâ€™s box office revenue compared to the previous year.

          <p>Maja Stark of Sweden shot a 2-under 70 to take a one-shot lead at the US Womenâ€™s Open, as Erin Hills presented a difficult challenge to competitors. Many golfers struggled with the faster greens and tricky pin placements, resulting in numerous double and triple bogeys. Julia LÃ³pez Ramirez of Spain shot the dayâ€™s best score with a 68, placing her in second. Stark aims to maintain a free-spirited approach in the final round, avoiding the tendency to play cautiously.</p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has warned that tough choices are unavoidable as the UK government finalizes its spending plans for various sectors, including health, defense, and education. The level of funding allocated to the NHS will significantly impact potential cuts to other unprotected areas. While funding increased sharply in 2024, it will no longer increase year on year, given the government's commitments. The Chancellor's stance on not borrowing more money or raising taxes has led to speculation that spending cuts will be made, with the IFS highlighting that increasing defense spending would necessitate bigger cuts elsewhere.</p>
