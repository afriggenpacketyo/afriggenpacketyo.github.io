        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US Vice President JD Vance stated that Russia has shown "significant concessions" and flexibility in peace negotiations regarding the war in Ukraine. He highlighted Russia's acknowledgment of Ukraine's territorial integrity and rejection of a puppet regime in Kyiv as key shifts, though no meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy is currently scheduled. Vance indicated that further sanctions against Russia remain a possibility, with decisions made on a case-by-case basis to exert diplomatic leverage. The article notes these developments amidst ongoing frustrations from President Trump over the lack of a definitive peace deal.</p>

          <p>President Volodymyr Zelenskyy affirmed Ukraine's commitment to fighting for a "just peace" on its Independence Day, emphasizing the nation's resilience as a fighter, not a victim. This declaration followed Russian accusations of a Ukrainian drone attack on a nuclear plant in Kursk, which Ukraine's disinformation center denied. The day also saw a prisoner swap of 146 soldiers on each side and strong international support, with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney pledging $2 billion in military aid and US envoy Keith Kellogg attending celebrations. Trump expressed frustration over stalled peace talks, considering further sanctions against Russia.</p>

The typhoon is traveling across the South China Sea with windspeeds of 175 kilometers per hour, threatening heavy rains and widespread flooding.

          <p>The Football Association has launched an investigation into a provocative banner unfurled by Crystal Palace fans during their match against Nottingham Forest. The banner depicted Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis holding a gun to midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White's head, accompanied by text denying Marinakis's involvement in various illicit activities. Nottingham Forest expressed significant disappointment that the banner was permitted inside Selhurst Park, viewing it as inflammatory and xenophobic. This incident escalates tensions between the clubs, following a controversial summer that saw Crystal Palace relegated from the Europa League due to UEFA's multi-club ownership rules.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning significant reforms to its asylum appeals system, aiming to reduce the number of migrants housed in hotels while awaiting decisions. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced the establishment of a new body with independent adjudicators to expedite the appeals process, which currently takes over a year on average for 51,000 pending cases. While the government seeks to end hotel reliance, the Refugee Council argues that improving initial decision accuracy is the most effective way to cut the appeals backlog.
