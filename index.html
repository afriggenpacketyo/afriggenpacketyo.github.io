          <p>Iraqi officials have commenced the excavation of a large sinkhole south of Mosul, believed to be a mass grave containing thousands of victims of the Islamic State group. The operation, a collaboration between multiple Iraqi agencies, is initially focused on collecting surface remains and DNA samples from families of the missing before a full exhumation can proceed. The site, known as al-Khafsa, is considered one of the largest mass graves in modern Iraqi history, with victims thought to include security personnel and minority groups executed by the extremist group a decade ago. The complexity of the site, which contains hazards like unexploded ordnance, will require international support for a complete investigation.</p>

          <p>A 63-year-old American man sustained severe injuries after being attacked by a shark while spearfishing near Abaco in the Bahamas. Local authorities reported that the incident occurred on Sunday afternoon, and the victim was transported to a local clinic before being airlifted to the United States for further treatment. Although shark attacks are extremely rare globally, the Bahamas has one of the world's highest incident rates, with this being the latest in a series of recent encounters involving tourists in the region. The International Shark Attack File has confirmed 34 attacks in the Bahamas over the last 400 years.</p>

          <p>Jodi Arias, who is serving a life sentence for the 2008 murder of her ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander, has suggested she may be preparing a new legal challenge to her conviction. Through a recent public blog post, Arias mentioned her focus is on post-conviction relief (PCR), her art, and writing, fueling speculation about her next steps. Now 45, Arias has been incarcerated at an Arizona women's prison since her highly publicized trial in 2013 and has previously used proceeds from her artwork to fund legal efforts. A PCR filing in Arizona allows for the introduction of new evidence or constitutional concerns after standard appeals have been exhausted.</p>

Despite being out-possessed and facing 22 shots, Arsenal's defense held firm, securing the win through a Riccardo Calafiori goal from a set-piece. Manager Mikel Arteta acknowledged his side was not at its best, with new £64m striker Viktor Gyokeres appearing to lack match fitness and the team struggling to adapt to a more direct style of play. Pundits noted that while the win was crucial, it highlighted the team's resilience and set-piece strength rather than fluid attacking play.</p>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the offer "historic" ahead of his own meeting in Washington with Trump and European leaders.

According to Morning Consult, nearly a third of U.S. adults say their financial situation is negatively impacting their travel plans. For savvy travelers, this slump could present an opportunity for discounts on hotels, restaurants, and attractions in typically popular destinations. (not investment advice)</p>

For the millions who have fled or are still living under Russian occupation or near the front lines, the proposal represents an abandonment.

          <p>Two American cruise passengers, a 79-year-old man and a 74-year-old woman, died in separate drowning incidents on Friday at Celebration Key, Carnival Cruise Line's new private resort in the Bahamas. According to the Royal Bahamas Police Force, the man became unresponsive while snorkeling at a beach, and the woman lost consciousness while swimming in a pool. In both cases, lifeguards administered CPR but were unable to revive them. The two victims were traveling on different Carnival ships with their families. The resort had only opened to the public in July, and autopsies are pending to determine the exact causes of death.</p>

          <h2>300,000-Year-Old Dental Fossils in China Suggest Interbreeding Among Early Human Species</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 12:46:45 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study of dental remains discovered at an archaeological site in China is challenging previous understandings of early human evolution in Asia. The 300,000-year-old teeth exhibit a "mosaic" of features, combining archaic traits typical of Homo erectus with more advanced characteristics found in Homo sapiens. Researchers suggest this indicates that different human species were interbreeding in the region much earlier than previously believed and that modern human traits may have emerged in Asia independently. The discovery points to a more complex and less linear evolutionary path, with Asia hosting multiple unique anatomical experiments among hominins during the Middle Pleistocene era.</p>

          <p>Spain is struggling to contain approximately 20 major wildfires as the country endures a heatwave that has lasted for over two weeks, with temperatures soaring above 40 degrees Celsius (104 F). The fires have already claimed at least three lives, destroyed over a thousand square kilometers of land, and forced thousands to evacuate. The government has deployed military emergency units to support firefighters, particularly in the hard-hit northwestern region of Galicia. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has acknowledged the challenge posed by the weather, and several European nations, including Germany, are sending assistance through the EU's Civil Protection Mechanism to help combat the blazes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following his summit with Vladimir Putin, President Trump has shifted his position on ending the war in Ukraine, now advocating for a direct peace agreement rather than an immediate ceasefire. Before the meeting, Trump had emphasized the need for a ceasefire and warned of "severe consequences" if one was not achieved. However, he now aligns with Putin's view that a comprehensive peace deal is the better path, a stance that puts him at odds with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Ukraine favors a ceasefire first to halt the fighting and create space for complex negotiations, fearing that talks without a truce would allow Russia to prolong the war.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A draft of an upcoming "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) report does not recommend significant restrictions on pesticides or ultra-processed foods, a potential setback for HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his allies. Kennedy has been a vocal critic of chemical additives in the food supply, linking them to health issues in children. The draft document, obtained by ABC News, instead calls for more targeted pesticide applications and the development of a government-wide definition for "ultra-processed food." This language suggests a victory for agriculture industry lobbyists who campaigned against stricter regulations, and it may conflict with the strong stance Kennedy took during his confirmation.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old Gazan woman, who was evacuated to Italy for medical treatment while severely emaciated, has died in a hospital in Pisa. The woman, identified as Marah Abu Zuhri, suffered a cardiac arrest less than 48 hours after her arrival, with the hospital citing a "very complex clinical picture" and severe weight loss. While Italian news agencies reported severe malnutrition, an Israeli military body stated she had leukemia. Her death highlights the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, where the UN has warned of widespread malnutrition and an unfolding famine, a claim Israel denies.</p>

          <p>Dr. Alieu Kamara, the first and only neurosurgeon in Sierra Leone, is shouldering the neurological disease burden for the country's eight million people. Before his practice began this year, patients with severe head and spine injuries had no hope for treatment within the country. A recent, successful spine surgery—the first ever in Sierra Leone—on a paralyzed man highlights the transformative impact of his work, which was made possible by a grassroots network of international support. This network, facilitated by nonprofits like Mission Brain, arranged for Dr. Kamara's training, secured vital equipment, and is helping to build a sustainable neurosurgery program from the ground up.</p>
