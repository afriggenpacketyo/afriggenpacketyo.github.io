          <p>Ten American citizens detained in Venezuela are returning home following a prisoner exchange deal. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio credited President Trump's leadership for securing the release, stating that every wrongfully detained American in Venezuela is now free. The exchange was facilitated by El Salvador, which released hundreds of Venezuelan nationals accused of gang activity from its prisons. Family members of the released Americans, including a Navy SEAL and another man kidnapped by border guards, expressed immense relief and gratitude for their return.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and El Salvador have confirmed a complex prisoner exchange with Venezuela, securing the release of 10 detained Americans. In the deal, El Salvador repatriated approximately 250 Venezuelan nationals who had been deported from the U.S. and held in a maximum-security prison. U.S. officials noted that the deal went "down to the wire" and highlighted the warming relations between President Trump and Salvadoran leader Nayib Bukele, who was instrumental in the negotiations. With this exchange, no U.S. nationals are currently known to be held by the Venezuelan government.</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency exchange Bullish, backed by investor Peter Thiel, has filed for an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "BLSH." The company, led by former NYSE president Tom Farley, reported executing over $2.5 billion in average daily volume in early 2025. This move marks another step in the crypto industry's push for mainstream financial acceptance, following other recent public offerings by firms like Circle and Etoro. The filing coincides with President Trump signing new stablecoin regulations into law. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has filed a lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal, its owner Rupert Murdoch, and its parent companies over a report about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. The lawsuit centers on an article detailing a sexually suggestive birthday letter Trump allegedly sent to Epstein in 2003, which included a sketch of a naked woman. Trump has strongly denied writing the letter, calling it fake. The legal action comes amid heightened scrutiny of Trump's past association with the disgraced financier, who died in jail in 2019.</p>

          <p>The documentary "Afternoons of Solitude," from Spanish director Albert Serra, provides an immersive and unflinching look into the world of bullfighting. The film follows star Peruvian matador Andrés Roca Rey, focusing on the ornate rituals and gruesome reality of the controversial tradition without offering explicit judgment or context. The review praises Serra's minimalist, observational style for capturing both the palpable danger for the matador and the horror of the bull's fate. The article concludes that the film is a spellbinding and honest work that intertwines meditation with obscenity.</p>

          <p>Golfer Shane Lowry has expressed his disappointment after accepting a two-stroke penalty during the second round of The Open for a rules violation. Officials determined that his ball moved during a practice swing in the rough, a movement Lowry insists he did not see. The penalty changed his score on the 12th hole from a five to a seven, significantly impacting his standing. Lowry stated he accepted the penalty to avoid being labeled a cheat on social media but remains unconvinced the decision was correct, citing a lack of definitive camera angles.</p>

          <p>Leaders at NPR and PBS are anticipating significant consequences after Congress approved a proposal to strip $1.1 billion in federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The cuts are expected to lead to layoffs and reduced programming, with a disproportionate impact on smaller, rural stations that rely heavily on federal support. Acclaimed filmmaker Ken Burns warned that many projects will no longer be possible, reducing diverse representation in media. Southern California stations, while less dependent on federal funds, are also facing multimillion-dollar losses that will affect their operations and journalistic staff. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's approach to the Jeffrey Epstein controversy has been marked by internal debate and presidential frustration. Initially resistant to taking further action, President Trump felt betrayed by MAGA supporters who continued to fuel conspiracy theories despite his calls to move on. The strategy shifted abruptly after The Wall Street Journal published a story about an alleged letter from Trump to Epstein. This prompted Trump to publicly ask the Attorney General to seek the unsealing of grand jury transcripts, a reversal aimed at quelling the political furor and redirecting the narrative.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to wear an electronic ankle monitor, deeming him a flight risk as he faces charges of plotting a coup. The court also imposed a curfew and barred him from contacting foreign diplomats or using social media. The move escalates a feud between the two nations, as U.S. President Trump has demanded the case be dropped and threatened Brazil with tariffs. Brazilian President Lula da Silva has vowed not to bow to what he calls "blackmail," creating a tense diplomatic standoff.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The latest big-screen adaptation of "Smurfs" is described as a messy, strained, and incoherent film that fails to offer nostalgia or enchantment. The review criticizes the movie's frantic plot, which involves portals, multiple dimensions, and an overstuffed cast of characters, as feeling random and unearned. While the voice cast includes stars like Rihanna and John Goodman, the film is seen as a "weapon of mass distraction" rather than a well-crafted story. The article concludes that the movie's chaotic nature undermines its ultimate message of togetherness, making it a test of parental tolerance.</p>

          <p>This political commentary argues that members of the U.S. Congress, particularly Republicans, have abdicated their legislative responsibility by voting for bills they seemingly oppose. The article cites examples like Senator Josh Hawley voting for Medicaid cuts he had publicly criticized, and others supporting measures while hoping another chamber or branch of government will alter them. This behavior of a "Vote Yes/Hope No Caucus" is seen as a surrender of congressional power to the executive branch. The author contends this preening cowardice allows President Trump to successfully implement his agenda without meaningful legislative opposition.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that approximately two-thirds of Americans favor the U.S. pursuing space exploration, including returning to the moon and undertaking a mission to Mars. Support is particularly strong among younger Americans who did not witness the original moon landing. The survey also found that a large majority of the public believes the 1969 moon landing was a worthwhile achievement. These positive views on space exploration generally cut across partisan and ideological lines, with many feeling the space program contributes to national pride and technological advancement.</p>

          <p>The stock price of online real estate company Opendoor skyrocketed 189% in one week, largely driven by social media posts from hedge fund manager Eric Jackson. Jackson, whose firm EMJ Capital had nearly shut down, announced he was reinvesting in the beaten-down stock, speculating it could be a "100-bagger." This triggered a massive rally, despite no fundamental improvements in the cash-burning company's business. The event highlights the growing influence of social media on stock market volatility and the appetite among retail investors for high-risk, "downtrodden" comeback stories.

          <p>A new law signed by President Trump establishes a $250 "visa integrity fee" for many nonimmigrant visa holders, such as international students and temporary skilled workers. The fee, part of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," is effective for the current fiscal year. While the law suggests the fee could be reimbursed if visa holders comply with all regulations, the mechanism for collection and reimbursement has not yet been established. Immigration advocates argue this and other new charges, like a $100 fee for asylum seekers, will put legal pathways to the U.S. out of reach for many. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Druze are a religious sect with origins tracing back about 1,000 years to an offshoot of Shiite Islam, now caught in recent violence in Syria. Their religious practices are largely secret, conversion is not permitted, and intermarriage is discouraged, fostering a tight-knit community. A core social doctrine is mutual defense, treating the global Druze population as a large, interconnected tribe. While most of the world's 1 million Druze live in Syria, with other communities in Lebanon and Israel, they have a history of navigating complex political landscapes to ensure their survival and autonomy.</p>

The city admitted the driver was at fault but disputed the amount of damages, arguing Hakimi's comatose state minimized his pain and suffering.
