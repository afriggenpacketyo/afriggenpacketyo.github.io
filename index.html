          <p>Afghanistan and Pakistan have agreed to elevate their diplomatic ties by appointing ambassadors in each other's capitals, signaling a potential improvement in relations after a period of strain. This decision follows a trilateral meeting in Beijing with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who expressed China's willingness to assist in improving Afghanistan-Pakistan relations. Relations between the two countries have been tense due to Pakistan's accusations that Afghanistan harbors the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and Pakistan's deportation of Afghan refugees. The move is expected to enhance bilateral cooperation across various sectors, although no country has officially recognized the Taliban administration since they took control in 2021. </p>

          <p>This Fox News opinion piece accuses NPR of partisan bias and criticizes media coverage of NPR's lawsuit against President Trump over attempts to defund the organization. The author argues that NPR's lawyers arrogantly claimed Trump's actions violated the First Amendment and suggests conservatives are being forced to fund speech they oppose. The piece highlights instances where NPR and PBS are perceived to exhibit a liberal bias, citing examples such as interviews with Harvard's president and the celebration of NPR's "founding mothers". The author claims NPR's CEO Katherine Maher denies any political bias, which the author disputes. </p>

          <p>Workers at the U.S. Department of Energy are raising concerns that budget cuts and deregulations will undermine the department's ability to function, leading to significant energy cost increases for consumers. Proposed cuts to the department's budget, coupled with the elimination of energy efficiency standards, are expected to raise utility bills for American households. Employees report low morale and a drain on resources due to the firings and resignations, with many feeling that appointees are dismantling programs without considering long-term consequences. Experts predict that these actions will result in lawsuits and legal challenges, negatively impacting research and development in renewable energy. </p>

          <p>Georgia's economy is facing mixed impacts from Donald Trump's tariffs, with the hospitality industry and wine merchants particularly vulnerable, while some industrial manufacturers believe they are insulated or may even profit. Wine distributors are struggling with shipping delays and uncertainty, leading to logistical disruptions similar to those experienced during Covid-19 shutdowns. The film industry is also confused by proposed tariffs on foreign-produced films, which could threaten Georgia's thriving entertainment sector. Meanwhile, the carpet-and-flooring industry in Dalton, Georgia, is seeing increased demand due to tariffs on imported flooring from Asia. </p>

The restaurant donated Calvin to the Biomes Marine Biology Center in North Kingstown, where it is now on display. The center's director noted that gold lobsters are often mistaken for more common orange lobsters, but that Calvin's distinct coloration made him stand out. </p>

          <p>The National Weather Service is facing severe staffing shortages as the Atlantic hurricane season approaches, raising concerns about the agency's ability to provide timely and accurate forecasts.

Some regional forecast offices are critically understaffed, potentially affecting their ability to issue urgent warnings about incoming storms.

Captain Emelie Vanasse, one of the first women to serve as an Army infantry officer, recounts her experiences at Ranger School, emphasizing that she met the same standards as her male counterparts. She believes that gender-neutral standards are important but that lethality extends beyond physical fitness, encompassing tactical skills, decision-making, and leadership. </p>

          <p>A study reveals that more than half of pet owners, including those in high-income households, have skipped necessary veterinary care due to soaring costs. Veterinary care costs in the U.S. have increased significantly since 2014, forcing many owners to forgo recommended treatments for their pets. Diagnostic procedures, vaccinations, and elective surgeries are the most commonly declined services, with cost being the primary factor. The study suggests that veterinarians should offer more affordable alternatives and payment plans to help owners manage expenses. </p>

          <p>Denmark's decision to raise its retirement age to 70 has sparked debate in the U.S. about whether a similar move is feasible or desirable. While some argue that raising the retirement age could help address Social Security's funding challenges, others caution that it could disproportionately harm lower-income individuals with shorter life expectancies. The U.S. has already gradually increased the full retirement age to 67, but further increases may be problematic due to income inequality and the time it would take to phase in the change. </p>

          <p>Governors Tim Walz of Minnesota and Wes Moore of Maryland are calling for a more assertive Democratic Party that emphasizes the political gravity of the moment and engages with diverse constituencies. Both governors, speaking at Jim Clyburn's Fish Fry, denied any plans of seeking the presidential nomination in 2028, but stressed the importance of focusing on the present. Moore emphasized the need to deliver an alternative to Trump, while Walz urged Democrats to compete in every district and school board seat. Clyburn praised both governors as great leaders. </p>
