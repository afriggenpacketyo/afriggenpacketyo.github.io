          <p>President Trump has directed the Bureau of Prisons to reopen and substantially enlarge Alcatraz, the infamous former prison on an island off the coast of California. Trump stated that reopening Alcatraz would serve as a "symbol of law, order, and justice" amid concerns about repeat criminal offenders. The prison, closed in 1963 due to high operating costs, would house America's most ruthless and violent offenders. Experts note the federal prison system has ample empty beds, questioning the need for a new facility.</p>

          <p>India has commenced work to increase reservoir capacity at two hydroelectric projects in Kashmir after suspending the Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan, according to sources. This action follows heightened tensions after an attack in Kashmir. The "reservoir flushing" process, which involves removing sediment, is being carried out at the Salal and Baglihar projects. India did not inform Pakistan about the work, which was previously restricted by the treaty. The work may not immediately threaten water supply to Pakistan, but could eventually affect it if other projects launch similar efforts.</p>

          <p>New evolutionary genetic analysis conducted by Chinese and Dutch researchers indicates that the earliest roses were likely yellow, contrary to the common association of roses with red color. The study, which examined domesticated and wild rose samples, found that the ancestor of modern roses probably had single-petal flowers with a yellow hue. Roses, highly cultivated ornamental flowers, are typically seen as symbols of love and beauty, but the research suggests a different origin for their iconic color.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has initiated the call-up of tens of thousands of reservists in preparation for an "intensified and expanded" military operation in Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated the aim is to increase pressure on Hamas to release hostages and defeat militants. Critics question the effectiveness of the offensive in securing the release of captives and challenge Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's objectives. The plan involves operating in new areas and destroying infrastructure, with reports suggesting the offensive will commence after President Trump's visit.</p>
