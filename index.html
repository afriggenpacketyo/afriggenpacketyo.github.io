          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, affirmed the constitutionality of the Federal Communications Commission's Universal Service Fund. This multi-billion-dollar program, supported by contributions from telecom carriers, aims to expand phone and internet access to rural and low-income communities. The majority opinion, authored by Justice Kagan, rejected the challenge that the funding mechanism violated the Constitution, ensuring the continued operation of programs designed to bridge the digital divide.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant 6-3 ruling, the Supreme Court has limited the power of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions that block government policies across the country. The decision arose from a case concerning a Trump administration order on birthright citizenship, though the court did not rule on the order's constitutionality. Authored by Justice Barrett, the majority opinion argues that such broad injunctions often exceed the courts' congressionally granted authority, a move that will impact how presidential policies from any administration are challenged in the future.</p>

          <p>A trend dubbed "revenge saving" is emerging as Americans increase their savings in response to economic uncertainties like inflation, tariffs, and market volatility. The U.S. personal saving rate has risen significantly, with many consumers cutting discretionary spending to build up emergency funds and increase retirement contributions. This shift from post-pandemic "revenge spending" reflects a broader consumer focus on financial stability, with experts noting the psychological and practical benefits of having substantial cash reserves.
