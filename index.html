            <p>The LA Galaxy's 30th-anniversary celebration was dampened by a 1-1 draw against the Houston Dynamo, extending their winless streak to eight games. Despite the festive atmosphere and commemorative rings for fans, the Dynamo took an early lead, further frustrating the Galaxy's already struggling season. A red card for the Galaxy's Mathias Jørgensen added to the team's woes, but Diego Fagundez scored a free-kick goal in the second half to level the score. The Galaxy will seek their first victory against Austin FC next Saturday, hoping to turn their season around.</p>

            <p>Big tech companies have secured a significant reprieve from Donald Trump's trade war, with smartphones, computers, and other electronics exempted from tariffs on Chinese imports. Experts had previously warned that these tariffs would cause consumer prices to spike in the US. Concurrently, the US military is increasing its presence at the Mexico border. This coincides with a visit to the region this week by Chinese president Xi Jinping on his first official foreign trip this year.</p>

            <p>The "Indian pot belly," once seen as a sign of prosperity, is now a major health concern as obesity rates surge in India. The country had the second-highest number of overweight or obese adults in 2021, with projections indicating a significant increase by 2050. Abdominal obesity, characterized by excess fat around the belly, is linked to chronic conditions like Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Studies show South Asians tend to have more body fat than Caucasians at the same BMI, increasing their risk of metabolic disorders.</p>

            <p>The State Department has informed a federal judge that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man wrongfully deported to El Salvador, is alive and detained in the country's Terrorism Confinement Center.

President Trump claimed El Salvador President Nayib Bukele has accepted custody of violent alien enemies. Attorneys for Abrego Garcia are seeking additional relief, including holding the government in contempt and granting him parole.</p>
