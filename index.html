          <p>A weather outlook for the United States highlights the ongoing risk of heavy rain and flash flooding in parts of the Four Corners and the Plains due to persistent monsoonal moisture. In New Mexico, areas with burn scars from previous fires are on high alert for potential flooding. Meanwhile, southern Florida is expected to continue experiencing hot and stormy conditions, though the heaviest rainfall from the past week has likely subsided. The central and eastern U.S. are forecasted to see a significant warm-up, ending a recent period of cooler, fall-like temperatures for millions.</p>

          <p>A report indicates that UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's office questioned Lord Peter Mandelson about his connections to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein before appointing him as the US ambassador. This inquiry was prompted by initial vetting that flagged the relationship. Mandelson was ultimately dismissed after newly surfaced emails revealed supportive messages he sent to Epstein after his 2008 conviction. The incident has raised significant questions about the thoroughness of the government's vetting process and what information was available to the Prime Minister at the time of the appointment.</p>

          <p>During a large "Unite the Kingdom" rally in London, organizers paid tribute to the recently assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk, displaying his image and playing a tribute video. Tech billionaire Elon Musk appeared via video link, condemning the political left following Kirk's death, stating it has become "the party of murder." Musk also criticized mass migration in the UK and accused the BBC of being complicit in what he described as the erosion of British identity. The rally, organized by activist Tommy Robinson, was framed as a demonstration for free speech and British culture.</p>

          <p>The United Nations General Assembly has overwhelmingly approved a nonbinding resolution endorsing a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with a vote of 142-10. The resolution, based on the "New York Declaration," urges Israel to commit to a Palestinian state, a notion Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected just hours before the vote. The United States and Israel were among the nations that voted against the measure, calling it a "gift to Hamas." The declaration also includes a rare condemnation of Hamas by Arab nations for its October 7 attacks.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration is seeking to fine Boeing $3.1 million for numerous safety and quality control violations identified between September 2023 and February 2024. This period includes the January incident where a door plug panel blew out mid-flight on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 jet. The regulator found hundreds of violations at factories belonging to Boeing and its subcontractor, Spirit AeroSystems. Boeing has acknowledged the proposed penalty and stated it continues to work on strengthening its safety culture under an FAA-overseen quality improvement plan.</p>

          <p>Authorities have arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson in connection with the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. The arrest was made after Robinson's father recognized him from images released by law enforcement and urged him to surrender. Investigators believe Robinson acted alone in what they describe as a "targeted attack" and a "political assassination." Evidence recovered includes a high-powered rifle found in a wooded area and bullet casings with inscriptions on them, providing key leads in the ongoing investigation into the motive behind the killing.</p>

          <p>The California Legislature has passed several significant education bills that now await the governor's signature, each with the potential to reshape the student experience. Key measures include mandating a phonics-based "science of reading" approach to boost literacy, phasing out ultra-processed foods like chicken nuggets from school cafeterias, and creating a state Office for Civil Rights to combat discrimination, including antisemitism in ethnic studies curricula. These bills have generated considerable debate among educators, advocacy groups, and industry, reflecting deep divisions on educational policy.</p>

          <h2>Fed Governor Lisa Cook's Loan Document May Weaken Trump Administration's Fraud Claims</h2>

          <p>Documents have emerged showing that Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook described a condominium she purchased as a "vacation home" on a loan estimate form. This characterization could undermine the Trump administration's allegations that she committed mortgage fraud by claiming two properties as primary residences simultaneously. The administration is using these claims as grounds to fire Cook "for cause," a move she is currently fighting in court. Cook has successfully secured a temporary injunction to block her dismissal while the legal battle continues ahead of a key Fed interest rate meeting.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Clippers owner Steve Ballmer has denied any knowledge of the specifics of an endorsement deal between star player Kawhi Leonard and Aspiration, a now-bankrupt financial company in which Ballmer was an investor. The NBA has launched an investigation into the deal over allegations that it was a scheme to circumvent the league's salary cap rules. Ballmer admitted to making an initial introduction between the parties but insisted he was not involved in negotiating the contract and was unaware of its terms, stating he would want the league to investigate if another team were accused of similar actions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Georgia judge has dismissed the sweeping RICO conspiracy charges brought against 61 individuals protesting the construction of the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center, known as "Cop City." The judge ruled that the state attorney general's office did not have the proper authority to bring the case without explicit permission from local district attorneys or the governor. This decision represents a major collapse of the state's controversial, two-year legal effort to prosecute the protest movement using a law typically reserved for organized crime, and has been hailed as a victory by civil liberties advocates.</p>

          <p>The first deportation flights sending migrants from the UK back to France are expected to begin next week under a new "one in, one out" pilot scheme. The agreement, announced in July by leaders of both countries, will see the UK return certain asylum seekers who crossed the Channel in small boats. In exchange, the UK will accept an equal number of asylum seekers directly from France who pass security and eligibility checks. The policy is a key part of the new government's strategy to address the ongoing issue of small boat crossings.</p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced that over a quarter of a million people have left Gaza City as it intensifies its military offensive against what it calls Hamas's last major stronghold. An army spokesman urged all remaining residents to move south "immediately" to a designated humanitarian zone for their own safety. The United Nations, however, has provided a lower estimate of recent evacuations and, along with aid groups, has warned that the mass displacement of hundreds of thousands more people will severely worsen the already dire humanitarian crisis in the territory.</p>

          <p>In response to historic droughts that severely restricted vessel traffic, the Panama Canal Authority is moving forward with major infrastructure investments to secure its water supply. The plans include constructing a new dam and tunnel system to provide supplemental water and developing a "land bridge" with a natural gas pipeline to transport energy products without using the canal's locks. These ambitious, multi-billion dollar projects are designed as long-term solutions to mitigate the impacts of climate change and ensure the canal remains a reliable gateway for global trade.</p>
