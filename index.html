          <p>Rising American tennis star Ethan Quinn, 21, offered a unique perspective on the camaraderie among U.S. players at the 2025 U.S. Open, despite the inherently individualistic nature of the sport. Quinn, now at a career-high ranking of No. 84, expressed pride in the large American contingent in the main draw, describing a supportive community where players push each other to excel. He highlighted the bond with veteran players and the intense, yet friendly, rivalry to be the top American. The article also details Quinn's meticulous physical preparation, including his reliance on Orgain protein shakes to meet his demanding nutritional needs during the tournament.</p>

          <p>A devastating shooting incident occurred at Haffen Park in the Bronx, New York City, during a youth basketball tournament, resulting in one fatality and four additional injuries. Multiple gunmen initiated gunfire around 7:27 p.m., leading to chaos and a scramble for safety among the attendees. A 32-year-old man tragically died from a chest wound, and a 17-year-old girl was left in critical condition after being shot in the face. Three other individuals suffered non-life-threatening injuries. Police have initiated an investigation, detaining at least four people, as they work to determine the motive behind this violent event, which follows another mass shooting in Brooklyn the previous weekend.</p>

          <p>Jerry Adler, a revered figure who transitioned from a decades-long career behind the scenes in Broadway to a notable acting career in his 60s, passed away peacefully at the age of 96. His acting credits include iconic roles such as Tony Soprano's advisor Hesh Rabkin in "The Sopranos" and law partner Howard Lyman in "The Good Wife." Before his on-screen success, Adler contributed to 53 Broadway productions as a stage manager, producer, or director, stemming from a family deeply rooted in Jewish and Yiddish theater. His unexpected pivot to acting, which he once described as saving him from a "mediocre career," allowed him to enjoy over 30 years consistently in front of the camera, a testament to his belief that "retirement is a road to nowhere."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries accused President Donald Trump of fabricating a crisis to justify sending federalized National Guard troops into Chicago, bypassing local authority. Jeffries condemned Trump's domestic military deployment as "playing games with the lives of Americans" and an "unprecedented" move, echoing Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson's sentiment that such a plan would be a "flagrant violation of our constitution." Pentagon officials confirmed plans to mobilize up to 1,700 National Guard members in 19 states for immigration support, but Trump has also indicated deployments to cities like Chicago and New York for crime. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker also opposed federal intervention, emphasizing that crime statistics show declines in Chicago.</p>

The blaze, which began Friday after an explosion, has not resulted in any reported injuries, and air monitoring indicates contaminant levels are well below actionable thresholds. Crews are focused on removing structural debris and extinguishing remaining hotspots, while also conducting environmental response efforts in the Tangipahoa River and nearby waterways. The incident has impacted the town of Roseland, home to 1,100 people, and the plant, which is a major employer. Efforts are ongoing to ensure public safety and mitigate environmental impact.</p>

Maxwell, currently serving a 20-year sentence for procuring young girls for sexual assault by Epstein, has appealed her conviction and hinted at hoping for a pardon. The release of transcripts detailing her interviews with the Attorney General and her move to a lower-security prison have further fueled speculation about Trump's connection to Epstein and potential political motivations.</p>

          <p>A legislative proposal in California to reduce the cannabis excise tax from 19% back to 15% for six years has ignited a contentious debate, pitting the struggling legal cannabis industry against child-care advocates. The proposed cut would reduce state revenue by $180 million annually, with approximately $81 million specifically impacting subsidized child-care slots for low-income families. Child care advocates argue this prioritizes the cannabis industry over crucial services for children, especially as federal funding cuts loom. The article highlights the inherent instability of funding social services through "sin taxes" and the broader challenges faced by both the legal cannabis market and the state's child care system.

Nuno is pushing for more defensive signings, despite the club having already invested over £100m in new talent this summer. While the team secured a 1-1 draw against Crystal Palace, the ongoing tensions between the manager and the club's hierarchy, including global head of football Edu, suggest a potential power struggle that could still lead to his departure, despite fan support.</p>

          <p>Law enforcement agents in California removed thousands of illegal marijuana plants and over 2,000 pounds of trash from a 13-acre grow site within Sequoia National Park. The operation, involving National Park Service rangers and Bureau of Land Management agents, also uncovered a semi-automatic pistol and a gallon of the toxic banned insecticide Methamidophos. This article highlights the extensive environmental damage caused by these cartel-backed operations, including water diversion, terraced hillsides, and illegal trails, alongside public safety threats. Officials have eradicated nearly 300,000 cannabis plants from Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks over the last two decades, emphasizing the ongoing challenge posed by illegal cultivation.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Proposed Medicare Cuts Threaten Home Health Care for Seniors</h2>

          <p>This opinion article warns that proposed Medicare cuts of over $1 billion to home health funding in 2026, put forth by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) under President Trump, could severely impact older New Jersey residents. The author argues these cuts will lead to reduced access to home-based care, staffing shortages, longer waits, and potentially force seniors into more expensive institutional care. Despite CMS's stated aim to target fraud, the article contends this approach ignores the real-world impact on patients and will ultimately raise healthcare costs. The author urges opposition to the cuts to ensure continued access to preferred home health services for millions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Juan Sebastian Pinto, a former Palantir employee, warns about the pervasive and often invisible dangers of AI surveillance tools, specifically "intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance" (Istar) systems, which he argues are used by agencies like ICE and the IDF to track and detain individuals at scale. These tools, developed by companies like Palantir, combine vast public and private data to identify targets, raising significant civil rights and privacy concerns. Pinto emphasizes that these systems violate First and Fourth Amendment rights by creating mass surveillance networks and enabling warrantless data searches. The article highlights the ethical questions surrounding data collection, bias, and accountability in these AI-powered platforms, urging greater public awareness and legislative action to protect vulnerable populations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Andrew Bailey, the Bank of England governor, stated that Britain faces an "acute challenge" due to weak underlying economic growth and a post-pandemic decline in its workforce. He highlighted a significant rise in long-term sickness and a drop in young people in employment, which, combined with an aging population, intensifies the pressure on the economy. Bailey emphasized the urgent need to boost economic productivity, as the percentage of 16-64-year-olds active in the labor market remains lower than pre-pandemic levels, unlike other advanced economies. The article notes that mental health is a primary reason for economic inactivity, contributing to concerns that Britain's inflation rate may be slow to return to target. (not investment advice)</p>

His family conveyed their immense sorrow, describing the sudden loss as "impossible to put into words" and affirming their endless love for him. The funfair has been closed for the weekend as a mark of respect, and the Health and Safety Executive has launched an investigation into what fairground bosses called a "tragic accident."</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the 33-year-old Democratic front-runner in New York City's mayoral race, is drawing attention for an ambitious platform whose practicality is being questioned. His campaign pledges include substantial tax increases on affluent individuals and corporations, the implementation of free public bus services, universal free child care, and a $30 minimum wage by 2030. The article critically examines these proposals, suggesting that many, despite their potential appeal, face significant hurdles in becoming tangible realities. This commentary highlights the common disconnect between aspirational campaign promises and the complex political and economic constraints that often limit a mayor's ability to enact sweeping changes, particularly in a large city like New York.</p>

          <p>On Ukraine's Independence Day, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney visited Kyiv, affirming that only Ukraine and its allies, not Russia, would determine future security guarantees. This article provides a comprehensive update on the ongoing conflict, including a prisoner swap between Russia and Ukraine, and Ukrainian forces reportedly retaking three villages in Donetsk. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, however, accused Western countries of "blocking" peace negotiations. Meanwhile, U.S. envoy Keith Kellogg attended Kyiv's celebrations, and Norway announced a significant contribution of air defense systems. The article also reports Russia's claim of a Ukrainian drone attack on the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant and the Pentagon's alleged blocking of Ukraine's use of long-range U.S. missiles against Russia.</p>

          <p>Internal correspondence from the 1970s and 80s reveals that numerous Jesuit officials were aware of Donald B. Dickerson's pattern of sexually assaulting children but allowed him to be ordained a priest. The documents, stemming from a 2024 lawsuit, show leaders struggled to contain his abuse while he received psychological help. Despite warnings from some, Dickerson was ordained and continued to face accusations, leading to his eventual dismissal from the priesthood in 1986. The article highlights the profound failure of oversight and the debate over the potential canonization of Pedro Arrupe, a former superior general who was aware of the case, raising questions about accountability and the church's handling of such allegations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to introduce new legislation that would allow courts to impose pub and travel bans as part of community sentences, aiming to deter crime and ease prison overcrowding. These proposed changes, which expand existing powers, could mean offenders face penalties unrelated to their specific crime, such as being barred from sports matches or driving. The reforms also include restricting short prison sentences and a scheme for early release for well-behaved inmates, inspired by a Texas model. While some judicial figures see potential benefits, concerns have been raised about the practical implementation and funding required to enforce such bans, particularly for the hospitality sector and an already stretched probation service.</p>
