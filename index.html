          <p>A U.S. Navy F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet rolled off an aircraft carrier and sank into the Red Sea, resulting in one minor injury to personnel involved in the towing operation. The incident, attributed to human error, occurred while the jet was being moved out of the hangar bay of the USS Harry S. Truman. An investigation is underway to determine the exact cause of the mishap, which officials have stated is unrelated to recent Houthi attacks in the area. The USS Harry S. Truman has been operating in the Red Sea since September, providing protection for commercial ships.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apollo Global Management's chief economist, Torsten Slok, predicts a recession this summer due to the impact of tariffs announced by President Trump. Slok's timeline suggests that U.S. consumers will begin to see trade-related shortages in stores next month, leading to trucking layoffs and ultimately a recession. While Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledges the tariff standoff is unsustainable, he anticipates a "detox period" rather than a recession. Bernstein analyst Aneesha Sherman suggests that existing stock levels may delay the predicted empty shelves, citing evidence of a "pull-forward" in orders before the tariffs were announced.

          <p>Researchers at the University of Missouri discovered that exercise can improve brain health, even when the liver's ability to produce ketones is limited. Ketones, produced when the body is low on glucose, are crucial for cognitive functions. The study found that exercise can compensate for the lack of ketones, potentially reversing cognitive decline, especially relevant for aging individuals and those with liver conditions. Lead researcher R. Scott Rector emphasizes that exercise activates backup pathways that enhance brain health, highlighting the importance of liver health in preventing brain diseases like Alzheimer's.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House says President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order aimed at identifying sanctuary cities, part of a broader effort to target jurisdictions that limit their cooperation with immigration authorities. The executive order will direct the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security to identify jurisdictions where local enforcement has declined to cooperate with the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. The Trump administration has also tried to withhold funding from sanctuary cities and states, but those efforts have often been defeated in court.</p>
