          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University, students, including those who previously opposed his views, have expressed a profound resolve to continue the tradition of open debate he championed. Scott Sperry, a student inspired by Kirk, believes attempts to silence such voices only amplify them, anticipating a surge of new conservative activists across the nation. The killing has thrust the university into the national political spotlight, with many students now feeling a personal sense of responsibility to ensure that healthy ideological discussions persist on college campuses. This article highlights a renewed commitment to free speech and political engagement, even as the community grapples with the shock and political polarization surrounding the tragic event, emphasizing a determination to transform grief into continued advocacy.</p>

          <p>US health authorities are on alert as Chagas disease, originating from South America and spread by the 'kissing bug,' is increasingly detected across at least eight states. Researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are considering classifying it as endemic, shifting its perception from an imported tropical illness to a permanent health risk. The disease, caused by the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite, can lead to severe chronic health issues like heart failure if untreated, and there is currently no vaccine. This article underscores the growing public health concern and the need for enhanced monitoring, research, and treatment strategies in the US.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers experienced a disappointing 5-1 walk-off loss to the San Francisco Giants, despite a dominant performance from pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto. Yamamoto delivered seven innings, allowing only one run and striking out ten batters, lowering his season ERA to 2.66. However, the Dodgers' offense struggled to provide run support, managing only one run from a Michael Conforto home run. The game, crucial for the surging Giants' playoff hopes, ended with Patrick Bailey's grand slam in the tenth inning off Tanner Scott. This article highlights the Dodgers' inconsistent hitting, which undermined an otherwise strong pitching effort.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of Charlie Kirk, AI tools like Grok and Perplexity's X bot rapidly amplified false claims, conspiracy theories, and misidentified suspects, a CBS News analysis reveals.

          <p>An analysis reveals Charlie Kirk's instrumental role in mobilizing younger voters for Donald Trump, contributing to his 2024 election victory and improved performance among demographics traditionally dominated by Democrats.

Harvard Kennedy School's John Della Volpe noted Kirk's ability to display "strength and masculinity," resonating with young men and narrowing the youth vote margin for Democrats.
