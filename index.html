The call, initiated by Lula, comes as Brazil faces potential impacts from new U.S. trade measures, contrasting with Washington's recent extension of a tariff pause for Chinese goods. This diplomatic engagement highlights the shifting global trade alliances and Brazil's efforts to navigate its economic relationships with both superpowers.

          <p>Elon Musk has threatened to sue Apple, accusing the company of anticompetitive practices related to its App Store rankings. Musk alleges that Apple's policies make it impossible for his AI chatbot, Grok, to fairly compete with OpenAI's ChatGPT, which is integrated into Apple's operating systems. The threat adds to Apple's existing legal challenges, including a major antitrust lawsuit from the Department of Justice over its iPhone ecosystem monopoly.

The plant, the largest coke manufacturing facility in the U.S., has been stabilized, but the event has raised significant safety concerns.

          <p>The CEO of Resorts World Sentosa in Singapore is focusing on transforming the complex into a premium lifestyle destination after its casino license was renewed for only two years instead of the usual three. The shorter renewal was due to "unsatisfactory" tourism performance, prompting a strategic shift away from shopping and towards unique experiences. The resort is moving forward with a SG$6.8 billion expansion, including new attractions like Minion Land and the Singapore Oceanarium. This plan aims to enhance its global appeal and secure a full license renewal in 2026.</p>

          <p>A former reserve officer with the Los Angeles Police Department has been charged with participating in a violent home invasion and kidnapping for ransom. Prosecutors allege that Eric Halem and three accomplices handcuffed victims in a Koreatown apartment and forced one to transfer $200,000 in cryptocurrency. The incident occurred while Halem was still an active reserve officer, and he now faces multiple felony charges, including one that carries a potential life sentence.

          <p>Scientists report that coral reefs along a 1,500km stretch of Western Australia's coast have experienced their most severe bleaching event on record. The damage was caused by a prolonged and intense marine heatwave, which stressed the coral and caused it to expel the vital algae it depends on. This event is part of a global bleaching crisis driven by record-high ocean temperatures. Even previously resilient reefs, such as Ningaloo and the Rowley Shoals, have been heavily impacted, signaling a critical escalation of climate change effects on marine ecosystems.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced the deployment of the National Guard to Washington, D.C., and has placed the city's Metropolitan Police Department under direct federal control. Citing a need to address crime and "lawlessness," the president invoked the D.C. Home Rule Act to authorize the takeover, which is expected to last for 30 days. The move has been criticized by D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and others as an "unprecedented" and unsettling action, despite official data showing a recent decline in violent crime in the city.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Unified School District is expanding its "safe passage" zones around campuses after federal immigration agents mistakenly detained a 15-year-old student at gunpoint outside a high school. The incident has intensified fears among immigrant families about the safety of their children traveling to and from school. In response, the district, along with city leaders, will deploy staff and volunteers to create protective perimeters around at least 100 schools. This initiative aims to reassure the community and ensure students are not kept home due to fear of immigration enforcement actions.</p>

          <p>In the canals of Xochimilco, Mexico City, scientists are using environmental DNA (eDNA) to search for the critically endangered axolotl. With the salamander now nearly impossible to find physically, researchers are filtering water to detect genetic traces left by the elusive creature. This modern technique helps monitor the dwindling population, which has plummeted from an estimated 6,000 per square kilometer in 1998 to just 36 in 2014. The research highlights the urgent need for habitat restoration and conservation policies to save the iconic species from extinction.</p>

          <p>Nigeria's military has announced that it killed more than 100 members of an armed gang in a joint air and ground operation in the northwestern state of Zamfara. The operation was launched after intelligence indicated that a large group of "bandits" was preparing to attack a local village. These armed groups have been responsible for widespread terror, kidnapping for ransom, and violence across the region. This military action is part of the government's ongoing efforts to quell the escalating insecurity that has destabilized communities in northwest and central Nigeria.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has described the Trump administration's deal with Nvidia and AMD as another form of a tariff, rather than a novel policy. The agreement requires the semiconductor giants to give the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from certain chip sales to China in exchange for export licenses. Cramer noted that while the "pay-to-play" aspect is debatable, the revenue goes to the U.S. Treasury. He argued the decision is ultimately beneficial for the companies by allowing market access and for taxpayers who benefit from the revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Colorado is contending with two major wildfires, prompting the deployment of more than 1,000 firefighters to the region. The Lee fire has grown to become the fifth-largest in the state's history, burning over 130,000 acres with minimal containment due to dry, gusty conditions. A second blaze, the Elk fire, is also active nearby, and Governor Jared Polis has declared a disaster emergency for another fire in the state. The situation reflects an explosive fire season across North America, exacerbated by climate change-driven drought and extreme weather.</p>

          <p>This article scrutinizes the claims made by President Trump to justify the federal takeover of Washington, D.C.'s police force. It argues that the president's portrayal of the city as a "lawless" hellscape is based on outdated and misleading crime statistics from 2023, ignoring significant drops in violent crime throughout 2024 and 2025. Critics and local officials, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, assert that the move is a political stunt rather than a data-driven response to a public safety crisis. The analysis draws parallels to similar narratives used by the administration regarding other major U.S. cities.</p>

          <p>Staff at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national center for AI, have warned that the organization is at risk of collapse in a whistleblowing complaint to the Charity Commission. The complaint alleges misuse of public funds, a "toxic" culture, and governance failures. This internal crisis comes as the UK's Technology Secretary threatens to withdraw a £100 million grant unless the institute pivots its research focus towards defense and national security. The turmoil places the future of the prominent, publicly-funded research charity in serious jeopardy.</p>
