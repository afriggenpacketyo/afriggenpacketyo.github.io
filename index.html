          <p>The Nobel Peace Prize winner is anticipated to be announced in Oslo, with a record 338 candidates, comprising 244 individuals and 94 organizations, under consideration. Former US President Donald Trump has actively campaigned for the award, citing his role in brokering eight conflicts, including a recent ceasefire framework between Israel and Hamas. The Norwegian Nobel Committee upholds strict confidentiality regarding nominees and their deliberations for half a century, though those who submit nominations are free to publicize their recommendations. This prestigious award, unique among the Nobel Prizes for its Oslo presentation, acknowledges significant achievements from the preceding year and carries a substantial cash prize of 11 million Swedish kronor, equivalent to over $1 million.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US Senate has approved bipartisan legislation aimed at restricting the export of advanced AI chips from companies like Nvidia and AMD to China and other foreign adversaries. Passed as part of the annual defense policy bill, this measure seeks to bolster American competitiveness in cutting-edge industries. However, the bill's path to becoming law remains unclear, facing significant opposition from US tech leaders and industry groups. Critics argue that these export controls could inadvertently limit competition, hinder innovation, and ultimately weaken the American technology sector, rather than strengthening it as intended by proponents.</p>

          <p>A powerful 7.4-magnitude earthquake struck off the southern Philippines, resulting in at least two fatalities, damage to a hospital and schools, and widespread power outages. The tremor initially triggered tsunami warnings for nearby coastal areas, leading to evacuations, though the alert was subsequently canceled. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has initiated damage assessment and is preparing rescue and relief operations for the affected communities. This latest natural disaster follows a recent deadly earthquake and multiple storms, underscoring the archipelago's continuous vulnerability to seismic activity and the ongoing need for robust disaster preparedness.</p>

          <p>Reports suggest several tech billionaires, including Mark Zuckerberg, are engaged in extensive "doom prepping" by constructing self-sufficient compounds and luxury bunkers, fueling public anxiety about potential future catastrophes. This trend is linked to fears of war, climate change, and the rapidly advancing capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI). Paradoxically, some leading AI scientists and tech developers, despite their work, express profound apprehension about what advanced AI could unleash, even discussing the necessity of underground shelters. This elite preparedness reflects a deep-seated unease about societal stability and the unprecedented challenges humanity may face, prompting questions about what information they might possess.</p>

          <p>Peru's Congress has voted to impeach President Dina Boluarte, citing her government's failure to curb rampant crime and her "moral incapacity" to govern. The impeachment occurred after Boluarte did not appear before lawmakers to defend herself, with 118 out of 122 votes in favor of her removal. Congress leader Jose Jeri was sworn in as interim president, pledging to declare "war on crime" and lead a transitional government until elections in April 2026. Boluarte, Peru's first female president, took office in December 2022 following her predecessor's impeachment, but struggled with rising homicides and extortion.</p>

          <p>Overnight Russian missile and drone strikes have caused extensive power cuts across Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, injuring nine people and disrupting water supplies in eastern districts. Separately, a seven-year-old child was tragically killed in a Russian drone strike in the Zaporizhzhia area. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of intentionally targeting the country's energy grid to create chaos and psychological pressure. Energy Minister Svitlana Hrynchuk confirmed a "massive strike" on facilities nationwide, with repair crews working to restore power amidst ongoing air raid alerts.</p>

          <p>The Office for Students (OfS), England's higher education watchdog, has warned universities they could face sanctions if pro-Palestinian protests lead to harassment and discrimination against Jewish students. Arif Ahmed, the OfS free speech director, emphasized that freedom of speech does not extend to intimidation or unlawful support for proscribed organizations. The regulator is prepared to impose fines, cut funding, or revoke degree-awarding powers if universities fail to protect Jewish students. This warning follows a wave of protests on the anniversary of the October 7th Hamas attack, amidst heightened concerns about antisemitism on campuses.</p>

          <p>S&P Global Ratings projects a steeper decline for China's real estate market in 2025 than previously expected, extending the industry slump for a fifth consecutive year. The agency now forecasts new home sales to drop by 8% to between 8.8 trillion and 9 trillion yuan, a significant revision from its earlier 3% decline estimate. This weaker outlook is primarily attributed to fragile homebuyer sentiment, despite Beijing's efforts to stabilize the sector. The property market has effectively halved in value since 2021, with a full turnaround remaining elusive, prompting calls for more aggressive government support. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The American trucking industry is facing a significant surge in online cargo theft, which has skyrocketed by 1,500% over the past four years, costing the industry $19 million daily. Fraudsters, often operating from Eastern Europe, are targeting expensive freight and using stolen identities to divert shipments. Industry leaders are urging lawmakers to pass the Combating Organized Retail Crime Act (CORCA) to establish a federal task force and national database, as current law enforcement efforts are insufficient.

          <p>Scientists from China and Spain have made a breakthrough, discovering that adding salt to ice enables it to generate electricity when bent. This finding opens up new possibilities for harnessing clean power in cold environments. The team found that salt-doped ice could produce an electrical response comparable to some of the best ceramic materials known for their electrical properties. This phenomenon is attributed to flexoelectricity, where an electrical charge is generated when a material is subjected to non-uniform strain. This innovation could lead to low-cost energy sources in frigid regions.</p>

          <p>A judge has dismissed Drake's defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group (UMG) concerning Kendrick Lamar's track "Not Like Us." The judge ruled that Lamar's lyrics, which accused Drake of being a "certified paedophile," constituted "nonactionable opinion" within the context of a heated rap battle and could not be considered defamatory. Drake's legal team plans to appeal the decision, while UMG expressed satisfaction with the outcome. This ruling concludes a significant legal skirmish stemming from one of the most infamous rap battles in the genre's history, solidifying the song's controversial status.</p>

          <p>A US federal judge has issued a temporary order blocking President Donald Trump's deployment of hundreds of National Guard soldiers to Illinois, including Chicago, to protect federal officials and facilities. Local Democratic officials accused Trump of spurring protests with heavy-handed operations, asserting that state law enforcement was sufficient. Judge April Perry stated that deploying Guard troops would "add fuel to the fire" and expressed doubt about the federal government's claims of protest violence. The Trump administration plans to appeal the ruling, which is in effect for two weeks, emphasizing its commitment to addressing perceived lawlessness.</p>

          <p>China's chip and AI-related stocks have experienced a significant rally, surging 55% since June, driven by Beijing's push for technological self-sufficiency and a directive to avoid Nvidia processors. However, these soaring valuations are now testing investors' patience, with some fund managers expressing doubts about whether companies can deliver on such high expectations. Analysts warn that the elevated multiples leave little margin for error, suggesting the market may quickly lose patience if performance does not meet these ambitious projections. This situation reflects a cautious sentiment despite the strong government support for the domestic tech sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has threatened to fire air traffic controllers who are calling in sick during the government shutdown, labeling them "problem children" responsible for over half the country's flight delays. Duffy praised controllers still working, stating that only about 10% are "lashing out" by not reporting for duty without pay. He affirmed that those who don't come to work will not be paid, contrasting with essential workers who are required to perform duties. The shutdown, now in its second week, is causing increasing disruptions, including potential military pay delays and museum closures.</p>
