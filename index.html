          <p>An Idaho man, Dan Howard, a former state trooper, is under scrutiny following the death of his wife, Kendy Howard, who was initially believed to have committed suicide. Investigators became suspicious due to inconsistencies at the scene, including a lack of blood, a running dryer filled with clean towels, and the husband's uneasy behavior regarding gunshot residue testing. Friends and family of Kendy voiced doubts about the suicide ruling, citing her positive outlook and plans for the future, including plastic surgery and a divorce. The case took a turn when a second autopsy suggested Kendy was strangled before being shot, leading to murder charges against Dan Howard.</p>

The incident reflects a broader crackdown on pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses, with students facing disciplinary action and limited opportunities for demonstration.</p>

The distillery, located in Frankfort, Kentucky, faced significant damage when the Kentucky River rose to over 48 feet, flooding buildings across its 400-acre campus. Despite the devastation, crews worked quickly to restore operations, allowing the distillery to resume limited tours and tastings for visitors during Derby Week. The reopening signifies a step forward for the community and the distillery's 770 employees.</p>

Harris also argued that it is a process UK political parties should learn from.</p>

The European Council on Foreign Relations says that the "perception of many Europeans" is that Europe is more committed to its relationship with the U.S. than the other way around.</p>
