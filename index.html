          <p>FCC Chairman Brendan Carr stated that Jimmy Kimmel appeared to mislead the public regarding the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, linking the alleged killer to the MAGA movement. This controversy led to ABC suspending "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" indefinitely, drawing praise from Donald Trump, who also criticized Kimmel's talent. House Democratic leaders, however, called for Carr's resignation, alleging a corrupt abuse of power to pressure ABC and Disney. Court documents indicate the alleged killer leaned left and cited Kirk's hate speech as motive, contrasting Kimmel's initial assertions.</p>

The company, however, raised its full-year revenue growth projection, even as shares fell over 9%. Strong performance from its casual dining brands, driven by value offerings and marketing initiatives, helped offset weakness in its fine-dining segment. Darden's strategy of keeping menu price hikes below inflation has attracted price-conscious customers across income groups. (not investment advice)</p>

The deal, which adds Nvidia to Intel's list of significant investors alongside SoftBank and the U.S. government, marks a major milestone for American high-tech manufacturing.

          <p>The UK successfully deported its first small boat migrant, an Indian national, to France under the new "one in one out" pilot scheme aimed at deterring illegal Channel crossings. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood hailed this as an important step, despite an ongoing government appeal against a High Court decision temporarily blocking another deportation on modern slavery grounds. The scheme, which began in August, intends to return one migrant to France for each asylum seeker with a strong case brought to the UK. US President Donald Trump also commented on border control during his UK visit, offering advice to PM Keir Starmer.</p>

          <p>Representative Elise Stefanik has requested Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate Doctors Without Borders (MSF) under the Anti-Terrorism Act, accusing the medical charity of amplifying Hamas-aligned disinformation. Stefanik claims MSF's attacks on a U.S.-backed Gaza aid group mirror Hamas propaganda, potentially undermining humanitarian efforts and violating its nonprofit status. She highlighted MSF's alleged neutrality failures, such as not mentioning Israeli hostages or their medical needs, and questioned staff actions linked to Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The article underscores national security concerns and the protection of legitimate aid organizations.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that wildfire smoke could cause up to 1.4 million global deaths annually by the end of the century if planet-heating emissions are not significantly curbed. The study highlights that wildfire smoke is considerably more toxic than other air pollution, with tiny PM2.5 particles causing severe respiratory and heart problems. While the total area affected by wildfires has decreased, human exposure has dramatically increased, driven by the climate crisis. Africa is projected to be disproportionately affected, facing an 11-fold increase in fire-related deaths compared to current norms.</p>

          <p>Nearly two dozen state attorneys general and 254 advocacy organizations are opposing the Trump administration's proposed rule to narrow eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. The proposed changes, based on an executive order, would exclude borrowers employed by organizations involved in activities like "illegal immigration" or "disruption of public order." Critics argue the rule is unconstitutional, illegal, and harmful to millions of public servants who relied on the promise of debt relief.
