          <p>Following Angela Rayner's resignation as Labour's deputy leader, the contest to find her successor is now underway, with several candidates announcing their bids. The potential replacements include Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson, who is seen as a frontrunner, and other prominent MPs like Lucy Powell and Emily Thornberry. Candidates from the party's left, such as Bell Ribeiro-Addy and Paula Barker, are also running, highlighting different visions for the party's future direction. The outcome of this leadership race will be decided by a vote of party members and announced on October 25.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in Frontiers in Marine Science has found that shark meat from endangered species is being sold in the United States with ambiguous or incorrect labels. Researchers used DNA barcoding on 29 shark products and discovered that 31% were from at-risk species like the great hammerhead and scalloped hammerhead. The mislabeling not only threatens vulnerable shark populations but also poses potential health risks to consumers, as some of these species contain high levels of mercury and other toxins. The study's authors are calling for stricter, species-specific labeling requirements to protect both wildlife and public health.</p>

          <p>A South Korean court has overturned the 1965 conviction of Choi Mal-ja, who was found guilty of grievous bodily harm for biting off her attacker's tongue while defending herself from a sexual assault. Now 79, Choi was originally given a suspended prison sentence, while her attacker received a lighter penalty. Inspired by the #MeToo movement, she sought a retrial, and the Busan District Court has now ruled that her actions constituted justifiable self-defense. The landmark decision is being celebrated as a significant victory for women's rights in South Korea.</p>

          <p>The U.S. producer price index (PPI), which measures inflation at the wholesale level, unexpectedly fell by 0.1% in August, contrary to economists' expectations of an increase. This marks the third time this year the PPI has shown deflation, providing positive news on inflation fundamentals, with the services sector also reporting a decline. The tame reading has intensified market expectations that the Federal Reserve will implement an interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting. Attention now turns to the consumer price index (CPI) report for a more complete picture of the nation's inflation landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nepal's army is now patrolling the streets of Kathmandu following days of intense anti-corruption protests that escalated into widespread violence and arson. The unrest, which led to the prime minister's resignation and resulted in 30 deaths, saw government buildings and parliament set ablaze. The "Gen Z" groups that initiated the peaceful demonstrations claim their movement was "hijacked" by opportunistic elements and have distanced themselves from the destruction. As a nationwide curfew is enforced, the military has invited the student leaders for peace talks to address the deep-seated public discontent.</p>

          <p>Tensions have risen between the United States and South Korea after a major immigration raid at a Hyundai-LG facility in Georgia resulted in the detention of over 300 South Korean nationals for alleged visa violations. The workers are awaiting a charter flight to return home, but the incident has sparked anger among South Korean lawmakers and the public. The raid tests a crucial political and economic partnership, as South Korea is a top foreign investor in the U.S. In response, South Korea's foreign minister is meeting with U.S. officials to negotiate for more visas for highly skilled workers.</p>

The lawsuit describes a partisan and inept environment within the FBI and Justice Department, where leaders prioritized White House directives over federal law.

This massive backlog overshadowed a mixed quarterly earnings report, demonstrating strong investor confidence in Oracle's position as a key player in the competitive AI market.

          <p>The typical peak season for freight shipments to the U.S. ahead of the holidays has slowed significantly this year, largely due to a sharp drop in imports from China. Data shows a sustained 27% year-over-year decline in Chinese exports to the U.S., with key product segments like furniture, toys, and electronics seeing major reductions. This slowdown is attributed to the ongoing trade war, which prompted an early front-loading of inventory, and subsequent reports of high inventory levels in the U.S. In response to the reduced demand, ocean carriers have announced dozens of blank sailings for October.</p>

          <p>Donna Hughes-Brown, a 58-year-old Irish grandmother and green card holder who has lived in the U.S. since she was 11, is facing deportation over a decade-old misdemeanor for writing a bad check for $25. She was detained in July upon returning from a trip to Ireland under legislation amended in President Trump's recent omnibus bill. Her husband, a U.S. military veteran, states she made restitution for the check long ago and is now being held in an ICE facility in Kentucky. The case highlights the severe consequences of minor offenses under current immigration enforcement policies.</p>

          <p>Natural cosmetics company Weleda has launched a new historical investigation following allegations that it was linked to the Dachau Nazi concentration camp. A historian's report claims the Swiss firm sourced raw materials from a garden at the camp and produced an anti-freeze cream that was allegedly tested on prisoners in horrific hypothermia experiments by an SS doctor. Weleda stated a previous report found no evidence of this, but it acknowledges the new findings may not have been fully explored. The company has condemned the Nazi regime's atrocities and committed to a transparent re-examination of its history.</p>

Protest groups organized "Block Everything" demonstrations in Paris and other major cities, citing frustration over the cost of living and privatization of public services.

          <p>Organizers of the upcoming Ryder Cup at Bethpage have asked the White House for President Donald Trump to delay his planned arrival on the first day of the event. The request aims to avoid logistical and security chaos for the approximately 50,000 daily spectators, similar to the delays caused by his visit to the U.S. Open tennis final. Officials have no issue with the president attending but believe having him arrive for lunch and the afternoon session, rather than for the opening tee shots, would be more manageable.

          <p>Four men have been found guilty of murdering 33-year-old Tony Ferns, who was fatally stabbed in the heart while in his car in Thornliebank in April 2019.

Park, who planned the murder, was jailed for 20 years, while Raymond Platt, who carried out the stabbing, received 23 years. The getaway driver and another accomplice also received lengthy sentences for their roles in what the judge called a "targeted and pre-planned assassination."</p>

Prime Minister Donald Tusk confirmed the incident and stated that Poland has formally requested to invoke Article 4 of the NATO treaty, which calls for urgent talks when a member's security is threatened.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction preventing President Donald Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook while a lawsuit over her removal proceeds. Judge Jia Cobb ruled that Cook demonstrated a strong likelihood that her purported removal, based on allegations of mortgage fraud from before she joined the Fed, violated the "for cause" provision of the Federal Reserve Act. The ruling reaffirms the principle of Federal Reserve independence from political interference and means Cook will participate in the central bank's upcoming policy meeting.

Additionally, long-term custodial care, healthcare services received while traveling overseas, and certain alternative treatments are typically excluded.
