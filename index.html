          <p>Bella Culley, an 18-year-old from Billingham, England, is facing a potential nine-month detention in Georgia while authorities investigate her on suspicion of drug offenses. She was arrested in Tbilisi and charged with importing large quantities of narcotics. The prosecutor has requested 55 days to gather evidence, which could be extended by another seven months. Culley informed the court she is pregnant, and her lawyer stated that police are investigating the origin of the 12kg of marijuana and 2kg of hashish and whether she intended to hand it over to someone.

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor stated that President Donald Trump's executive order sharply limiting birthright citizenship "violates four Supreme Court precedents" during a hearing. Sotomayor and Justice Elena Kagan questioned the Justice Department lawyer's argument that individual federal district court judges should not have the power to impose national injunctions blocking such executive actions. The justices suggested that the argument could prevent courts, including the Supreme Court, from ruling on the constitutionality of the executive order. The case involves executive orders issued by Trump that have been halted by federal district court judges.</p>

          <p>Walmart cautioned that even with reduced tariffs on Chinese imports, the company may be forced to raise prices on certain items. CEO Doug McMillon stated that tariffs create cost pressure, particularly on electronics and toys, and CFO John David Rainey warned that a restoration of higher tariff levels could jeopardize earnings growth. The retailer aims to absorb some costs to keep food prices low but acknowledges the impact of tariffs on consumer spending. The article notes that rising cost pressures for retailers are emerging, and economists predict that the impact on prices will put additional pressure on demand.</p>

Coinbase will reimburse affected customers who were tricked into sending funds to the attackers. The hackers bribed multiple contractors and employees working in support roles outside the U.S. to collect information from internal systems, leading to their immediate termination.

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves stated that the UK economy is "beginning to turn a corner" after it grew by 0.7% in the first three months of the year, exceeding expectations. The growth was driven by increases in consumer spending and business investment. However, analysts warned that the strong rate of growth is unlikely to continue due to upcoming US tariffs and increased UK employer taxes.

          <p>This article analyzes the music, lyrics, and performances of Eurovision winners since 2000 to determine the formula for success. Key elements include singing about personal liberation, using English lyrics, and alluding to folk music without sending a full folk song. Staging should be all-out and potentially involve fire, but novelty acts are generally discouraged. The article advises against dramatic key changes, which were once essential but are now best avoided. The overall goal is to be spectacular, inspiring, and just weird enough to capture the audience's attention.</p>

          <p>Starbucks workers at 75 U.S. stores are striking in protest of the company's new dress code, which requires employees to wear a solid black shirt and khaki, black, or blue denim bottoms under their green apron.

          <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon stated that a recession remains a serious possibility for the United States, despite the recent rollback of tariffs on China. While he hopes to avoid it, Dimon defers to his bank's economists, who estimate recession odds at below 50%. Dimon acknowledged that the tariff pauses are positive for the economy and market, but noted that import taxes are still higher than last year, which could hinder investment. Dimon's comments mark a shift from his previous statement last month that a recession was likely.</p>

          <p>Walmart reported solid sales but cautioned that President Trump's tariffs will lead to price increases soon.

          <p>A new analysis from the National Association of Realtors reveals that a shortage of affordable homes is preventing many middle-income families from achieving homeownership. Only about 1 in 5 listed homes in March were affordable for households with $75,000 in annual income, a significant drop from pre-pandemic levels. Rising home prices and higher mortgage rates are pushing homes out of reach, with the median sale price in the first quarter of 2025 approaching $420,000. The affordability gap is particularly severe in cities with zoning or permitting restrictions that limit new construction.</p>
