        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has implemented 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum, potentially increasing the cost of various consumer goods. Experts predict that the tariffs could lead to higher prices for cars, sports equipment, canned goods, household appliances, and homes due to increased manufacturing costs. While some businesses may absorb some of the costs, many are expected to pass them on to consumers, as was seen during the previous imposition of tariffs in 2018. The tariffs aim to reduce America's reliance on foreign nations, but economists warn they could negatively impact industries and consumers alike (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has released an estimate indicating that President Trump's proposed budget bill would increase the national deficit by $2.4 trillion over the next decade.

          <p>While making on-time debt payments is crucial for maintaining good credit, experts caution that it isn't the only factor determining your credit score. Not all bill payments are factored into credit scores, as payments like rent-to-own, utilities, or private school tuition may not be reported to credit bureaus. Additionally, while some Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) providers report loans, this is not a universal practice, and missed BNPL payments can negatively impact your score. To fully understand your credit standing, it's essential to review your credit report regularly to see which payments are influencing your score (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A federal investigation found that a Texas hospital violated the law by repeatedly sending a woman home without ending her nonviable, life-threatening ectopic pregnancy. Kyleigh Thurman ultimately lost part of her reproductive system after being denied care at Ascension Seton Williamson in Round Rock, Texas. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) concluded that the hospital failed to provide a proper medical screening exam and stabilizing treatment, violating the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act. This case highlights concerns about emergency abortion access following state abortion restrictions.</p>
