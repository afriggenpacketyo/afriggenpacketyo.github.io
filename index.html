          <p>The article explores the question of how much gold an investor should buy each year to safeguard their portfolio amidst economic uncertainty, inflation concerns, and shifting global politics. Experts recommend considering one's risk appetite, suggesting allocations between 5% for growth-oriented investors and up to 20% for risk-averse individuals, with a sweet spot generally between 5% and 10% of the total portfolio. The article advises gradual buying throughout the year to mitigate price volatility and to monitor market conditions, such as interest rates, inflation, and geopolitical events, to inform purchasing decisions, while also cautioning against over-investing due to storage, taxes, and liquidity concerns.

          <p>Even with easing trade tensions between the United States and China, Beijing is preparing for continued rivalry with Washington, according to this New York Times article. China's pursuit of economic and diplomatic opportunities in Asia will likely continue alongside its firm stance on regional territorial disputes and military competition. While the tariff truce may lead to talks between President Trump and Xi Jinping, Beijing remains wary of U.S. intentions, especially regarding military presence in Asia and technology access. China is presenting itself as a stable alternative amidst Washington's trade policy upheaval but will not concede on sovereignty disputes, particularly in the South China Sea and concerning Taiwan.</p>

          <p>This CNBC article reports that Social Security recipients in default on student loans may have up to 15% of their benefits garnished to repay the debt, with a minimum of $750 a month left to the beneficiary. Borrowers are reportedly receiving less notice of these offsets under the Trump administration, although a 30-day warning is still required. Borrowers can contest the offset by proving financial hardship or having a pending student loan discharge. The article advises borrowers facing offsets to seek help immediately and not panic.</p>

Ms. Ventura stated she participated initially to please Mr. Combs but eventually felt her career was reduced to performing for his sexual gratification.

          <p>According to this CNBC article, the world experienced a U.S.-China trade embargo, but a breakthrough on Monday with lowered tariffs signals a new era of "mutual respect." U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized this respect during talks, contrasting with previous strained interactions. Businesses now understand the need to mitigate tariff uncertainty, and while large businesses will diversify supply chains, small businesses may halt production due to fading confidence in the U.S. dollar. China is also focusing on self-sufficiency, strengthening export controls on critical minerals and emphasizing its role as a stabilizing force amid global uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo holds a double-digit lead in the Democratic primary for New York City mayor, according to a Marist College survey, despite facing financial setbacks and criticism over past controversies. Cuomo's campaign has been denied matching funds twice due to documentation errors and alleged coordination with a super PAC. Opponents have criticized him for his 2021 resignation and handling of COVID-19, with current Mayor Eric Adams demanding answers about nursing home deaths. Despite these challenges, the poll indicates Cuomo's strong position in the race.</p>

          <p>Japan's health ministry is planning to eliminate out-of-pocket expenses for childbirth, potentially starting in April 2026, to combat the country's declining birthrate. The policy involves fully covering normal delivery costs under the public medical insurance system, which currently excludes childbirth as it is not considered a medical condition. While the government provides a lump-sum payment of 500,000 yen per birth, actual costs often exceed this amount. Obstetricians have raised concerns that a unified, publicly covered price could strain medical institutions due to reduced revenue.</p>

The program seeks to raise $120 million for an advance market commitment (AMC) to incentivize manufacturers to produce a test that delivers results within minutes. The NeoTest team is primarily approaching middle-income countries to fund the initiative, reflecting the increasing capacity of these nations to address their own health challenges.

          <p>Donald Trump has met with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa in Saudi Arabia after agreeing to lift sanctions on Syria, stating that doing so "gives them a chance of greatness," according to The Guardian. The meeting, facilitated by Saudi Arabia and Turkey, aimed to recognize the legitimacy of the new authority in Damascus after Bashar al-Assad's ouster. Trump also outlined conditions for Syria, including signing onto the Abraham Accords and combating terrorism. This marks a significant shift in US policy towards Syria.</p>

China agreed to pause or remove non-tariff countermeasures imposed since April 2, alongside the lowering of most tariffs imposed by the two countries, for 90 days, from today. The deal implicitly indicates a scrapping of China’s April 4 curbs on exports of seven rare earth metals classified as “medium and heavy”, with earlier restrictions on other critical minerals remaining in place.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump’s attacks on the courts follow a pattern seen in backsliding democracies globally, systematically weakening the courts as a check on executive power, according to this article in The Atlantic. This fight takes place both inside and, importantly, outside the courtroom, in the arena of the public’s opinion. Political leaders adopt policies that are popular but very likely illegal. The courts then rule against the executive, and the executive uses their unpopular decision to condemn the judiciary writ large. To thwart court-baiting, an effective counterattack for the judiciary’s defenders is to reframe the executive’s policies to render them less palatable for voters.</p>

While his death would be a tactical success, its long-term strategic significance is unclear. The group has survived for decades despite Israel’s systematic assassination of its leaders. Although powerful, Mr. Sinwar is just one of several senior military leaders in Gaza, and far from the only Hamas leader opposed to concessions to Israel. His killing would undermine the group, analysts said, but might not change Hamas’s strategic outlook and operational abilities or soften Israel’s uncompromising approach to cease-fire negotiations.</p>
