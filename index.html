        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study from Flinders University in Australia suggests that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) can become significantly more severe on weekends, a phenomenon researchers have termed 'social apnea.' The analysis of over 70,000 individuals found that weekend catch-up sleep and 'social jetlag'—a misalignment of the body's natural clock with social schedules—were linked to a notable increase in OSA severity. Researchers also noted that other weekend behaviors, such as increased alcohol consumption, could be contributing factors to this pattern.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has revoked the visas of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and 80 other officials, a move that prevents his attendance at the upcoming U.N. General Assembly. The decision was framed by the U.S. as a measure to hold the Palestinian leadership accountable for undermining peace prospects. The Palestinian Authority condemned the action as a violation of U.S. commitments as the U.N. host nation, and European allies like France and Spain have voiced their support for Abbas.</p>

          <p>Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have announced that an Israeli airstrike killed Ahmed al-Rahawi, the prime minister of their rebel-controlled government. The strike reportedly occurred in the capital city of Sanaa, targeting a government workshop and killing several other ministers as well. This event marks a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict, where Houthis have been launching attacks against Israel in what they claim is solidarity with Palestinians, prompting retaliatory strikes from Israel.</p>

          <p>President Trump's efforts to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook have ignited a debate over the central bank's independence from political influence. Financial experts and legal scholars warn that such a move could erode the Fed's credibility, potentially leading to long-term economic instability, higher inflation, and a weaker dollar. While some market participants might initially welcome politically motivated interest rate cuts, the consensus among analysts is that undermining the Fed's autonomy poses a significant threat to the U.S. financial system.

          <p>A new executive order from President Trump directing federal officials to prosecute flag-burning is likely to be legally ineffective and could even provide a defense for protestors, according to legal analysis. The Supreme Court has twice ruled that flag-burning is a form of expressive speech protected by the First Amendment. By explicitly stating a desire to prosecute based on the act's message, the order may enable defendants to argue they are victims of unconstitutional "selective prosecution."</p>
