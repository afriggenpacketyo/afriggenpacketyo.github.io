          <p>Alphabet's Waymo has secured its inaugural permit from the New York Department of Transportation, allowing it to commence testing autonomous vehicles in New York City. Mayor Eric Adams announced this significant step, marking the city's first-ever autonomous vehicle testing launch and reflecting a tech-friendly administration keen on innovation. The program will initially deploy up to eight vehicles in Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn until late September, with a trained safety specialist required to be present in each vehicle, adhering to New York state law. This expansion follows Waymo's rapid growth, having surpassed 10 million robotaxi trips in May and targeting new markets like Philadelphia, demonstrating a push into the Northeast.</p>

          <p>Over 100 UK business leaders are urging the government to create a standalone legal offense for assaults against all public-facing workers, including transport staff and call center agents. This call comes amid a significant rise in hostile incidents, with 43% of customer-facing employees reporting abuse in the last six months, a 20% increase from the previous year. While a bill proposes a specific offense for retail workers, business leaders, supported by the Institute of Customer Service, argue for broader protection across all sectors to act as a stronger deterrent and prevent staff from leaving their jobs due to aggressive behavior.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced his intention to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook if she does not resign from her position. Cook, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, has recently faced criticism from the Trump administration over allegations concerning her mortgages. Trump's statement, made during an impromptu visit to The People's House museum, signals escalating political pressure on the independent central bank and its leadership. This development underscores ongoing tensions between the executive branch and the Federal Reserve, potentially impacting the institution's perceived autonomy in monetary policy decisions.</p>

The probe focuses on the alleged use of classified documents in leaks to news media, an investigation that reportedly began during the Biden administration. Bolton, a staunch critic of Trump, was not confirmed to be home during the raid, which occurred around 7 a.m. This event follows recent public clashes between Trump and Bolton, and the former president had previously canceled Bolton's Secret Service protection.</p>

          <p>The UK government's Home Office is seeking to appeal a High Court ruling that granted a temporary injunction to Epping Forest District Council, preventing asylum seekers from being housed at the Bell Hotel in Epping. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the government is committed to closing all asylum hotels in a managed way, arguing that piecemeal court decisions create problems elsewhere. The council brought the case citing escalating community tensions, especially after an asylum seeker from the hotel was charged with sexual assault. More councils are considering similar legal action following this precedent.</p>

This marks a second transfer blow for Tottenham this summer, after Morgan Gibbs-White opted to sign a new contract with Nottingham Forest instead of moving to Spurs.</p>

          <p>Southern California is enduring a dangerous heat wave, with temperatures exceeding 105 degrees in many valleys and 110 in some deserts, breaking daily records. National Weather Service officials warn that the extreme heat, compounded by minimal nighttime cooling, poses a high risk for heat-related illnesses and can fuel wildfires. A red flag warning is in effect for mountains and foothills, with potential for monsoonal thunderstorms bringing localized flooding and dry lightning. Temperatures are expected to gradually fall next week, but will remain above average, signaling prolonged hazardous conditions.</p>

          <p>John Deere is at a crossroads, experiencing weaker demand in the agricultural sector while committing to multi-million dollar investments in U.S. manufacturing. The company recently reported significant decreases in net income and sales, citing lower crop prices and farmer spending, alongside $300 million in tariff expenses. Despite recent layoffs, Deere plans to invest $20 billion in U.S. manufacturing over the next decade, aiming to capitalize on growth in Europe and South America. Analysts remain optimistic about the long-term outlook, anticipating a rebound in the cyclical agricultural sector, especially in precision agriculture.</p>

          <p>This article explains Venezuela's significant role in the international oil trade, noting it holds the world's largest proven crude oil reserves, estimated at 303 billion barrels. Despite these vast reserves, the country only produced 0.8% of global crude in 2023, largely due to U.S. sanctions imposed on its state oil company, PDVSA, since 2019. The presence of U.S. warships circling Venezuela underscores geopolitical tensions, which have given the country's oil prominence a global scope. Recent reports suggest a modest increase in PDVSA's crude oil and fuel exports in 2024.</p>

          <p>Major retailers like Walmart and Home Depot are largely mitigating the impact of President Trump's tariffs, preventing widespread price hikes for consumers so far. Companies are employing tactics such as diversifying sourcing, negotiating with vendors, and importing goods early to absorb increased costs. While some prices have risen, consumer spending remains steady, though lower-income households are more sensitive to changes. However, retailers anticipate continued cost increases from duties through the second half of the fiscal year, and some brands like Crocs are already reporting weak retail orders and cautious consumers.</p>

Democratic State Senator Carlos Guillermo Smith and Pulse shooting survivor Brandon Wolf also criticized the move, calling it a "hostile act" and an attempt to "desecrate their memory."

Experts from institutions like the American Enterprise Institute and Moody's Analytics emphasize that "uncertainty is the enemy" of economic growth. While tariffs aim to boost domestic manufacturing, economists argue the initiative requires a predictable environment and will lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers. They anticipate tariffs will contribute to rising inflation and slow consumption, potentially impacting overall economic growth.</p>

Glacier National Park, experiencing record visitation, faces a 25% staff loss, impacting critical services from fire positions to IT.

          <p>Chocolate lovers should anticipate further price increases due to a lagged impact from soaring cocoa prices, which hit record highs amid West African supply issues. Cocoa futures have eased slightly this year, but manufacturers are still processing higher costs from late 2024, passing them onto consumers. While some experts predict structurally higher cocoa prices long-term, industrial demand is softening, and supply is improving from new plantings. This suggests a potentially brighter outlook by next Easter, though other factors like minimum wage hikes and U.S. tariffs could also influence costs.</p>
