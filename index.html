          <p>The Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026 is projected to be between 2.7% and 2.8%, which is in line with the long-term average but has drawn concern from some retirees. Beneficiaries recall the larger 8.7% adjustment in 2023, which was a response to post-pandemic inflation, and feel the modest upcoming increase will not be enough to cover rising expenses for healthcare, food, and housing. The article discusses the ongoing debate over the formula used to calculate the COLA, with advocacy groups suggesting alternative measures that might better reflect the actual inflation experienced by seniors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier was arrested as part of a wide-ranging FBI investigation into sports betting and gambling. The arrest is reportedly linked to an ongoing probe into unusual betting activity surrounding a March 2023 game when Rozier was playing for the Charlotte Hornets. At that time, heavy wagers were placed on his individual player statistics, prompting federal scrutiny. Rozier, a key player for the Heat, now faces an uncertain legal and professional future as law enforcement officials prepare to release more details about the investigation.</p>

          <p>A leading House Republican, August Pfluger, has strongly criticized House Minority Whip Katherine Clark for describing the ongoing government shutdown as a "leverage point" for Democrats. Clark made the comment in an interview, stating that while shutdowns harm families, they are one of the few opportunities Democrats have to push their priorities, such as extending Obamacare subsidies. Pfluger condemned the remark as "calculated hostage-taking," accusing Democrats of weaponizing the suffering of American families for political gain amid the prolonged budget impasse.</p>

The project has generated significant controversy due to the sudden and unannounced demolition of the historic East Wing, which Trump stated was necessary to build the new structure properly. House Democrats have rebuked the administration for a lack of transparency, noting that key decisions were made in secret without public disclosure or proper consultation.</p>

          <p>A BBC Verify analysis of new satellite images and videos indicates that the Israeli military is positioning boundary markers hundreds of meters deeper inside Gaza than the ceasefire deal's agreed-upon "Yellow Line." This action effectively creates a larger buffer zone under Israeli control and has led to confusion and deadly incidents, as Gazans are unclear about which areas are safe. The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) have warned that anyone crossing the line will be met with fire, raising concerns about civilian safety and the terms of the ceasefire agreement.</p>

          <p>A review of Kelly Reichardt's new film, "The Mastermind," praises it as a departure from typical heist movies, focusing instead on the methodical deconstruction of its clumsy protagonist. The film is described as a precise and often humorous character study of an unemployed carpenter, played by Josh O'Connor, whose ill-conceived plan to steal paintings unravels immediately. Rather than focusing on the crime, the article highlights how the film explores hubris and selfishness through the main character's inept attempts to deal with the consequences of his actions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has unanimously passed the IRS MATH Act, a bill designed to make it easier for taxpayers to understand and resolve simple mistakes on their tax returns. The legislation, which now awaits the president's signature, will require the IRS to provide clearer explanations in its "math error notices," detailing the specific error and the steps required for correction. Lawmakers and taxpayer advocates have long argued that the current notices are confusing and do not adequately inform filers of the 60-day deadline to challenge the agency's proposed changes.</p>

          <p>Metropolitan Police have arrested three men in London on suspicion of assisting Russia's foreign intelligence service under the National Security Act. The arrests are part of a major ongoing investigation led by counter-terrorism police into alleged hostile state activities. Authorities noted an increasing trend of foreign intelligence services recruiting "proxies" within the UK to carry out criminal activities. This operation follows several other recent high-profile cases involving espionage and malign influence campaigns linked to the Russian state.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent economic trends indicate a growing divergence in consumer behavior, creating what is often described as a "K-shaped" economy. High-income households continue to drive spending on premium goods and services, benefiting companies like Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines. In contrast, lower- and middle-income consumers are pulling back, feeling the pressure of inflation on essentials and increasingly turning to value-oriented options like McDonald's. This bifurcation is becoming more pronounced across various sectors, including food, automotive, and hospitality, highlighting rising economic inequality. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis from The Atlantic suggests that China is adopting an increasingly tough and assertive economic posture in its dealings with the Trump administration. Beijing has demonstrated a new willingness to use its economic power as a coercive tool, evidenced by its tightening of export controls on critical rare-earth metals and sanctioning a U.S.-linked shipbuilding company. These actions are seen as direct responses to U.S. trade policies and signal a strategic shift by China to leverage its market dominance to compel global actors to align with its interests, potentially escalating the trade war.</p>

          <p>A jury has found six men guilty of rioting in the Ely area of Cardiff in May 2023. The violent disorder was triggered by the deaths of two teenagers, Kyrees Sullivan and Harvey Evans, in an e-bike crash, which was followed by widespread social media rumors that the boys were being chased by police. CCTV footage later confirmed a police vehicle was following the e-bike shortly before the fatal crash. The judge has warned the convicted men to expect significant custodial sentences for their roles in the riot.</p>

While national trends show a slowdown, some regional markets like Chicago continue to experience stronger rent growth, whereas cities like Dallas have seen rents decline. (not investment advice)</p>
