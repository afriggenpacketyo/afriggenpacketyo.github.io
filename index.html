The IDF stated that the targeted officials were involved in planning terrorist attacks against Israel, the West, and Middle Eastern countries. In response, Iran launched a new wave of missile attacks on Israel, resulting in casualties and significant damage in Tel Aviv, escalating fears of a broader regional conflict.</p>

A state of emergency has been declared in Ohio and Marion Counties, with the National Guard assisting in rescue and recovery efforts.

The ants colonize undisturbed forest areas and can also be found near homes and businesses, nesting under mulch, pavers, and landscape timbers.

          <p>Consumer spending in China shows little sign of recovery due to uncertainty about future wealth, changing preferences, and a lack of a social safety net. Consumer prices have declined for four consecutive months, consumer confidence is low, and the real estate market struggles to rebound. Disposable income growth has slowed since the pandemic, and unemployment among young people remains high. Chinese households prefer saving over spending, reflecting concerns about healthcare, education, and retirement costs, with a shift towards lower-priced products and smaller cities exacerbating the trend.

Netanyahu did not confirm or deny the report, while a spokesperson for Netanyahu called the reports false. Trump warned Iran against retaliating against U.S. targets, suggesting that Iran and Israel should make a deal, drawing parallels to his past efforts to de-escalate conflicts.</p>

The drones offer a safer and more efficient alternative to helicopters, which have been used to release the mosquitoes in the past.</p>

This shift has strained Russia's information mills and forced Putin to improvise, as he competes with Ukraine to convince the White House of the other side's unreasonableness.

          <p>Former England captain Owen Farrell has agreed to rejoin Saracens on a two-year deal, just a year after leaving for French side Racing 92. The 33-year-old has signed a two-year deal after the Premiership club came to an agreement with Paris-based Racing to end his stint in Top 14 a year early. Farrell previously spent 16 years at Saracens, helping the club win six Premiership titles and three European Champions Cups. He expressed his excitement to return to Saracens and contribute to the club's potential.</p>
