          <h2>Former President Joe Biden Diagnosed with Advanced Prostate Cancer</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former U.S. President Joe Biden, 82, has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to his bones. The diagnosis came after Biden experienced increasing urinary symptoms, leading to the discovery of a prostate nodule. While the cancer is aggressive, it is reportedly hormone-sensitive, allowing for effective management. Biden and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians and have received support from political figures across the spectrum. This underscores the importance of tailored medical decisions, as Biden's new symptoms and active lifestyle justified a closer medical examination.</p>

          <p>Portugal's right-of-center Democratic Alliance secured a victory in the recent snap parliamentary elections, marking the third election in as many years. However, the party fell short of obtaining a majority. Party leader Luís Montenegro pledged to stimulate investment and ensure prosperity and social justice. Following the election results, Socialist leader Pedro Nuno Santos announced his resignation after his party's significant loss of seats, resulting in a near tie with the far-right Chega party. The final seat distribution remains uncertain until the overseas voter results are tallied, which could potentially shift the balance further.</p>

The Department of Homeland Security ended TPS for Afghan nationals, citing an improved security situation, a claim disputed by advocacy groups. The White House stated that Afghans lacking legal grounds can apply for asylum, but advocacy groups urge recognition of Afghanistan as a Country of Particular Concern.</p>

          <p>A cyber-attack in February 2020 crippled Redcar and Cleveland Council's IT systems, disrupting essential services and putting vulnerable children at risk.

          <p>Gary Lineker is expected to leave the BBC following a social media post about Zionism that included an antisemitic image, with an announcement anticipated on Monday. The 64-year-old presenter, the BBC's highest-paid, had previously announced his departure from Match of the Day at the end of the season but was slated to continue covering the FA Cup and World Cup. Lineker apologized for the post, but BBC bosses reportedly deemed his position untenable. This follows a previous suspension in 2023 over impartiality concerns related to a tweet about government asylum policy.</p>

          <p>The primary suspect in a fatal car bombing outside a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, has been identified as 25-year-old Guy Edward Bartkus. Authorities believe Bartkus, who is deceased, targeted the in vitro fertilization clinic and had nihilistic ideations. Investigators served a search warrant on Bartkus's home and are examining his writings, including a manifesto, and social media posts. The blast, which injured at least four other people, is being treated as an intentional act of terrorism.</p>

Discussions focus on improved defense cooperation, reduced trade barriers, and agreements on veterinary standards, touring artists, and professional qualifications.

          <p>Wildfires in Europe are becoming more severe, with climate change intensifying droughts and reducing summer rain, leading to a predicted doubling of wildfire risk by 2100. Scientists emphasize the link between climate change and elevated fire danger, citing increasing urbanization and unmanaged vegetation growth as contributing factors. While the number of fires has decreased due to improved firefighting capacity, the fires are expected to become larger and more devastating. Solutions include controlled burning, restoring ecosystems, and increasing public awareness about fire risks.</p>

          <p>According to a senior Asian economist, China's yuan has the potential to compete with the US dollar as a global currency if Beijing liberalizes convertibility and access for foreign investors. The yuan already functions smoothly in cross-border purchase settlements, but China needs to deepen its financial markets to attract foreign investment in yuan-denominated assets. Convertibility remains a key concern for investors outside the mainland, hindering the yuan's broader adoption as a global reserve currency.</p>

          <p>A trade "reset" between the US and China, involving lowered tariffs, could undermine India's aspirations to become a global manufacturing hub. The reduction in tariffs on Chinese goods entering the US may stall or reverse manufacturing investment that was shifting from China to India. While India has benefited from trade diversion due to US-China tensions, the renewed competition from China and the need for domestic reforms pose challenges to India's manufacturing growth. India needs to complement any tariff arbitrage with serious ease-of-doing-business reforms.</p>

Despite the attack, President Zelensky met with Vice President Vance in Rome to discuss negotiations towards a cease-fire. The drone assaults are seen as part of a strategy to exhaust Ukraine's air defenses and set the stage for larger bombardments.</p>
