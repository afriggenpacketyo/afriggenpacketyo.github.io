          <p>Following a federal appeals court ruling that deemed many of his administration's tariffs illegal, President Trump announced his intention to seek an expedited decision from the Supreme Court. The lower court found that the president overstepped his authority, arguing that the power to impose tariffs rests with Congress. The administration contends that the tariffs are crucial for the nation's financial stability and will argue for their immediate reinstatement to protect the country's economic fabric.

          <p>A federal court's decision to rule many of the Trump administration's tariffs illegal has introduced significant uncertainty for the shipping industry and raises questions about billions of dollars in collected duties.

          <p>A group of over 85 international climate experts has published a detailed critique of a recent Department of Energy report on greenhouse gases, labeling it "full of errors" and not representative of current climate science. The experts argue the government's report, which downplayed the economic damage of CO2 emissions, cherry-picked data and misrepresented scientific literature. This response is the latest effort by the scientific community to counter what they describe as politically motivated misinformation from the administration.</p>

          <p>Police in Argentina are investigating the descendants of a deceased Nazi official after a 17th-century painting, looted from a Jewish art dealer during WWII, was spotted in a real estate ad.

The letter warns that this action threatens the central bank's crucial political independence and undermines trust in the U.S. financial system.

This article explains that the expected cut is only a marginal 25 basis points, and many lenders may have already priced this reduction into their current offers. Furthermore, mortgage rates are influenced by other factors, such as the 10-year Treasury yield, meaning a single Fed action will have a limited impact. (not investment advice)</p>
