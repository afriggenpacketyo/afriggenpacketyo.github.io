          <p>Tesla is expected to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, on June 22, with initial rides in the Model Y limited to a geofenced area and monitored by a safety monitor and remote drivers. Elon Musk has emphasized safety and plans to scale up the service gradually, with potential expansions to Los Angeles and San Francisco. Wall Street analysts predict that robotaxis could significantly boost Tesla's market capitalization, although Tesla lags behind competitors like Waymo in autonomous driving technology. The rollout faces regulatory hurdles and the need to ensure safety and reliability, as Tesla aims to establish itself in the autonomous vehicle market. Optimism among analysts remains, but caution is advised given past delays and ongoing competition.</p>

          <p>A recent study from the University of Chicago Medicine and Columbia University suggests that increasing the intake of fruits and vegetables can lead to more restful sleep. The study found that adults who consumed more fruits, vegetables, and healthy carbohydrates experienced deeper and more uninterrupted sleep patterns. Researchers believe that dietary modifications could offer a natural and cost-effective way to improve sleep quality. While a sleep expert noted that the study's findings are not entirely unexpected, the expert also emphasized the need for more extensive research to establish causality.</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly contradicted his director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, regarding Iran's nuclear capabilities. Gabbard testified that the U.S. assessed Iran was not building a nuclear weapon, but Trump asserted that Iran was "very close to having one." The White House indicated that Trump would decide within two weeks whether to join Israel in strikes on Iran. This disagreement highlights a potential rift between the president and his intelligence community on a critical national security issue.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance visited Los Angeles to tour a federal law enforcement operations center and meet with Marines, marking the highest-ranking Trump administration official visit since protests erupted over Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids.

Federal immigration officers have increased enforcement efforts, aiming for 3,000 arrests a day, though the current average is around 1,200.

          <p>The Trump administration has terminated 639 employees at Voice of America (VOA) and its parent organization, USAGM, significantly reducing the international broadcasting service. This action is part of a broader effort to eliminate 1,400 positions since March, nearly dismantling an organization founded in 1942 to counter Nazi propaganda. Trump's senior advisor to USAGM, Kari Lake, stated that the cuts aim to end decades of dysfunction and bias. The cuts represent a major shift from America's Cold War strategy of using broadcasting to promote democratic values globally.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump will decide within two weeks whether to strike Iran, allowing time for potential diplomatic negotiations. Trump will meet with his national security team at the White House before departing for a fundraiser in Bedminster, New Jersey. The timeline aims to provide an opportunity for diplomacy, with Trump stating there is a “substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future.” Trump will receive further intelligence briefings over the weekend.</p>

          <p>Kroger's shares increased as the supermarket operator raised its full-year sales outlook, indicating that shoppers are seeking lower-priced store brands and cooking at home more often. The company now expects identical sales, excluding fuel, to increase between 2.25% and 3.25% year over year. Interim CEO Ron Sargent stated that Kroger is catering to value-minded shoppers by simplifying promotions and lowering prices on over 2,000 products. Kroger's private labels, particularly Simple Truth and Private Selection, have been a growth driver, and the company plans to launch 80 new protein products in its Simple Truth line.</p>

          <p>Senior White House adviser Kari Lake issued mass layoff notices to 639 employees of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, significantly impacting Voice of America (VOA). Lake described the action as part of a long-overdue effort to dismantle a bloated bureaucracy, eliminating 85% of jobs in total. The move has effectively silenced VOA, which has been broadcasting news to countries under autocratic regimes since World War II. Critics argue that the cuts undermine U.S. ideals of democracy and freedom, while Lake claims the agency has been riddled with dysfunction and bias.</p>

The court did not rule on the suit itself but stated that the fuel makers had standing to sue because they would be injured by the state’s rule.

Under the Republican proposals, borrowers taking out loans after July 1, 2026, would have limited repayment plan choices. The bill could push more borrowers into default, as it fails to provide affordable monthly bills for many.

Researchers at Cybernews discovered 30 exposed datasets containing vast amounts of login information, giving criminals unprecedented access to accounts. The leaked information appears to stem from multiple breaches over time, compiled by various "infostealers."

          <p>QXO is maintaining its unsolicited $5 billion cash offer for GMS Inc., despite Home Depot's competing bid for the building products distributor. Darden Restaurants' earnings report indicates that consumers are still spending on casual dining, benefiting companies like Texas Roadhouse. The Trump administration extended the deadline for ByteDance to divest TikTok's U.S. operations by another 90 days.
