            <p>JPMorgan has released new research outlining its base case for the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs, expecting "some deals" but predicting a significant increase in tax rates. The firm anticipates the effective tariff rate to land in the 10%-to-20% range, leading to slower economic growth, increased unemployment, and inflation. To navigate this volatile environment, JPMorgan recommends structured notes for defensive exposure and hedge funds in diversified portfolios to exploit market mispricings. (not investment advice)</p>

South Korean officials have said there could be a rise in attempts by foreign companies, such as those in neighbouring China, to use South Korea, which is a major U.S. ally and has a free-trade pact, as a bypass to avoid tariffs and regulations.</p>
