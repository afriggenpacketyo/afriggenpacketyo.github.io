          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology, the world's largest battery manufacturer, jumped over 16% in their Hong Kong debut, driven by investor optimism in the electronic vehicle sector. The IPO raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion), marking the largest offering this year, with funds allocated to a new factory in Hungary to supply European automotive clients. CATL faces increased scrutiny from the U.S. and EU, which have placed tariffs on EVs made in China, and the Pentagon has put it on a watchlist over suspected links to China's military. The article notes that CATL's focus remains on markets such as Europe and emerging regions.</p>

          <p>Yuri Grigorovich, a titan of Russian ballet and one of the greatest choreographers of the 20th century, has died at the age of 98. He served as artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet from 1964 to 1995, leading the company with an iron fist and redefining Soviet ballet through productions like "Ivan the Terrible" and "Romeo and Juliet." Grigorovich was praised for revitalizing male dance, creating demanding roles for men, and his departure from the Bolshoi in 1995 led to a historic dancers' strike. His work was steeped in the traditions of classical ballet, following in the footsteps of his uncle, Georgy Rozai, who studied under Vaslav Nijinsky.</p>

Current observations show an increasing rate of melting in Greenland and Antarctica, and computer models suggest sea-level rise will not stop even if warming stabilizes.

          <p>Despite President Trump's imposition of sweeping tariffs, collecting them has proven difficult due to overwhelmed and understaffed federal agencies. The article notes that higher tariffs, particularly against China, have increased incentives for smuggling and practices like transshipping. The union representing Customs and Border Protection agents says CBP has long suffered from chronic understaffing. The article describes how some U.S. business owners have proposed legislation to fund a DOJ task force to prosecute trade fraud cases.</p>

          <p>NASA engineers successfully revived a dormant thruster on Voyager 1, averting a potential loss of communication with the spacecraft. The article details how engineers revisited primary roll thrusters to determine if they could be revived to ensure its antenna remains pointed at Earth. The switch was made when controllers noticed that heater switches in the primary system had turned off on their own, signaling a possible fault. The Voyager team remains optimistic about keeping the two spacecraft operational long enough to celebrate their 50th anniversary in 2027.</p>
