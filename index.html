        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nexstar Media Group, a prominent owner of broadcast TV stations, announced its continued preemption of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" as the show returned to ABC, joining Sinclair in this decision. This action follows host Jimmy Kimmel's controversial comments, which linked the alleged killer of a conservative activist to former President Donald Trump's MAGA movement, sparking significant public and political debate. Both Nexstar and Sinclair stated their commitment to fostering an environment of respectful, constructive dialogue in the markets they serve, noting that Kimmel's show would still be available on Disney-owned streaming platforms nationwide. The controversy also prompted the Federal Communications Commission Chairman to suggest that broadcast licenses could be at risk if stations fail to operate in the "public interest," underscoring the legal and public scrutiny surrounding media responsibility and political commentary in the current national discourse.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump abruptly canceled a crucial meeting with top Democratic leaders, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, just days before a potential federal government shutdown. Trump attributed the cancellation to "unserious and ridiculous demands" from Democrats, who are insisting on extending Affordable Care Act tax credits and protecting other healthcare programs. Democrats quickly accused Trump of "running away from the negotiating table" and holding the country hostage, warning that the President would own the impending shutdown. This political stalemate intensifies concerns about the government's ability to fund essential services.</p>

          <p>The Chinese military has issued a stern warning against Japan's ongoing development of laser weapons, asserting that Tokyo's plans are actively undermining regional security. Japan is making significant progress on road-mobile laser weapons and is set to begin a ship-mounted laser weapon program specifically designed to intercept incoming small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Beijing views these technological advancements with high caution, particularly noting the substantial budget allocated by the Japanese Ministry of Defence to enhance these systems. This situation underscores an escalating arms race in directed-energy weapons within the region, raising considerable concerns about potential instability and increased tensions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump garnered laughter from world leaders during his opening remarks at the United Nations General Assembly by humorously addressing a broken escalator and malfunctioning teleprompters. He used the technical glitches as an opportunity to quip about speaking "from the heart" and playfully warned the teleprompter operator, adding an unexpected, informal tone to the proceedings. Trump later drew more laughter by recounting his dissatisfaction with the UN's assistance in global conflicts, reiterating his perception of the organization's inefficiencies and lack of involvement in past deals. These lighthearted moments offered a distinctive start to a significant diplomatic event, showcasing his characteristic style on the international stage.</p>

          <p>Morgan Stanley is preparing to offer direct cryptocurrency trading to its retail customers through its E-Trade division, with services expected to roll out in the first half of 2026. The Wall Street giant is collaborating with the startup Zerohash for liquidity, custody, and settlement, having also invested in the company. This move is a significant indicator of increasing crypto adoption by financial incumbents, especially following a more favorable regulatory environment under President Donald Trump. The firm plans to initially offer trading for Bitcoin, Ether, and Solana, viewing this as just the "tip of the iceberg" for integrating digital assets into wealth management.

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris has formally endorsed Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race, a move that stands out as many other prominent Democrats have remained silent. Mamdani, a Democratic Socialist, has drawn criticism from some party leaders for his progressive stances, including his strong condemnation of Israel's actions in Gaza and calls for a rent freeze and higher taxes for the wealthy. Despite these divisions, Mamdani has secured significant backing from progressive figures like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders. Polls indicate Mamdani holds a commanding lead, highlighting a significant ideological split within the Democratic Party regarding the future direction of urban leadership.</p>

Although UK economic growth for this year sees a slight upgrade to 1.4%, a noticeable slowdown to 1% is anticipated for 2026, largely attributed to a "tighter fiscal stance" and rising trade costs. The OECD report underscores broader concerns about global economic resilience, noting that while growth has been stronger than expected in the first half of the year, the full impact of higher tariffs, particularly from the US, is yet to be fully realized.

          <p>This article critically examines President Trump's economic policies, arguing that his claims of a thriving economy and falling inflation are contradicted by current data, including decelerating consumer spending and dismal job growth. The piece highlights that inflation is actually rising, largely due to tariff-related price increases. A survey of 100 CEOs further reveals significant business concerns, indicating that tariffs harm companies and do not spur domestic investment, while Trump's pressure on the Federal Reserve is seen as eroding its independence. The article concludes that policy ineptitude, exemplified by H-1B visa fee confusion and a disruptive ICE raid, stifles economic growth and damages international relations.

          <p>Scientists and public health experts are expressing deep alarm over President Trump and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s claims linking Tylenol and childhood vaccines to autism, labeling them as dangerous misinformation. Despite Trump's advice for pregnant women to avoid Tylenol, medical consensus and rigorous studies refute a causal link between acetaminophen and autism, or between vaccines and the developmental disorder. Researchers fear these unsubstantiated statements could lead individuals to avoid safe medications and critical vaccinations, potentially undermining public health initiatives and eroding trust in scientific evidence.

          <p>President Donald Trump's "big beautiful bill" has temporarily increased the federal deduction limit for state and local taxes (SALT) from $10,000 to $40,000 for 2025, a move expected to provide substantial tax savings for residents in specific states. A Redfin report indicates that New York, California, and New Jersey residents could see the largest median benefits, while states like South Dakota and Alaska would experience the smallest. This change primarily benefits higher earners who itemize deductions, with the increased limit phasing out for incomes above $500,000 before reverting to $10,000 in 2030. (not investment advice)</p>
