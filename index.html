          <p>Decades after the brutal 1991 murders of four teenage girls in an Austin, Texas, yogurt shop, this article explores a persistent theory in the unsolved case. Investigators and defense attorneys believe two unidentified men, seen in the shop shortly before closing, may hold the key to the crime. Despite numerous leads, overturned convictions, and advancements in DNA technology that exonerated initial suspects, these two men have never been identified or come forward. The report details their descriptions and highlights the ongoing suspicion that they were the last customers and potentially the perpetrators of the horrific event.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) has confirmed it is investigating former special counsel Jack Smith for potential violations of the Hatch Act, which prohibits government employees from engaging in political activities. This non-criminal probe follows a request from Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged that Smith's investigations into Donald Trump were politically motivated to influence the 2024 election. The OSC is an independent federal agency distinct from the special counsel role Smith held, responsible for enforcing laws like the Hatch Act and investigating alleged abuses of power.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the Beijing Institute of Technology claim to have developed a sophisticated electronic warfare system using a swarm of drones. This technology can reportedly create a protective 'storm eye' for friendly forces by precisely canceling out jamming signals at their location. By adjusting signal properties like waveform and amplitude, the drones can simultaneously jam enemy communications while ensuring allied communications remain clear. This targeted approach marks a significant advancement over traditional brute-force jamming methods that disrupt all signals, including those of friendly troops, within a given range.</p>

He shared that he considered ending his recent Forget Tomorrow tour after the diagnosis but chose to continue, stating the joy of performing outweighed the stress on his body. Timberlake, who described himself as a private person, thanked his family for their support and expressed uncertainty about his future on stage.

The author notes that recent films depicting the wartime event have triggered a wave of reflection, particularly among younger generations who are learning about this historical trauma for the first time. The piece argues that for many Chinese people, the massacre is more than just a historical tragedy; it is a profound moral wound.

          <p>President Trump publicly rejected a potential deal with Senate Democrats aimed at confirming his administration's nominees before the August recess, telling Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to 'go to hell' in a social media post. Intense negotiations had been underway, with Schumer reportedly demanding the release of frozen federal funds and an agreement from Trump not to pursue further budget cuts. Trump characterized these demands as 'egregious and unprecedented,' urging Republicans to reject the offer and recess.

The case stemmed from controversial raids by the Trump administration that sparked protests and widespread fear.

          <p>Comedian Harry Hill has revealed that the early death of his stepfather inspired him to leave his career as a doctor and pursue entertainment. In an interview, Hill explained that his stepfather passed away at 54, before he could enjoy retirement, which made him realize he didn't want the same fate. Having qualified as a doctor in 1988, Hill felt he was unsuited for medicine, recalling an instance where he felt 'completely out of my depth' breaking tragic news to a patient. This personal loss, he said, gave him the freedom to pivot to comedy in the early 1990s.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United is reportedly prepared to sell Danish striker Rasmus Hojlund for a fee of around £30 million. This news comes despite Hojlund's recent public statement expressing his desire to stay at the club. The potential sale is linked to United's ongoing interest in signing RB Leipzig forward Benjamin Sesko. While club sources insist they can make a new signing without first selling players, an exit would likely be necessary to comply with Premier League financial regulations. Selling Hojlund for £30m would represent a book loss for the club, given his remaining contract value.</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms, a key advocate for open-source AI with its Llama models, has indicated it will be more 'careful' with its open-source strategy in the future. This shift in stance contrasts with China's accelerated development in the open-source AI space, where companies like Alibaba and Zhipu AI have recently launched advanced models. Renowned computer scientist Andrew Ng noted that while top proprietary models are still from U.S. labs, the leading open-source models are now predominantly from China. This competitive pressure appears to be influencing Meta's approach to sharing its powerful AI technology freely.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have likely solved the 80-year-old mystery of what killed 'Winston,' a platypus sent as a gift to UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill from Australia in 1943. For decades, it was rumored the creature died from shell-shock after its ship encountered a German U-boat. However, archival research by students at Monash University and the Australian Museum uncovered the ship's logs, revealing the real culprit was likely the heat. Records show that as the ship crossed the equator, water and air temperatures soared well above the safe threshold for a platypus, suggesting the animal essentially overheated on its long journey.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly using large-scale theme parks as a strategy to boost its domestic economy and fuel consumer spending. The recent opening of the world's largest Legoland resort is the latest addition to a rapidly growing attractions industry, which is projected to expand at an annual rate of 19 percent. According to the global theme park association IAAPA, these attractions serve as significant economic drivers for local economies. The article suggests that for every yuan of operating revenue generated by a theme park, it creates a ripple effect of 3.8 yuan in the surrounding community.</p>

The son of famed composer Assi Rahbani and legendary singer Fairuz, he carved out a unique legacy with his politically charged and socially conscious work, which often criticized the sectarianism that fueled Lebanon's civil war. Rahbani was known for blending jazz and other global styles with traditional Arab music, creating a sound that was uniquely his own. He also had a transformative creative partnership with his mother, bringing a more raw and human element to her iconic status.</p>

          <p>In this interview, Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute argues that President Trump's foreign policy, which she characterizes as viewing allies as a burden, is dangerously isolating the United States. She warns that this approach risks the collapse of the cooperative international order, which would make protecting American interests far more costly and difficult. Schake contends that principled conservatives have a crucial role to play in challenging this 'post-American world' vision. She asserts that failing to do so will leave America less safe and prosperous, contrary to core conservative principles of defending dignity and expanding opportunity.</p>

          <p>In her new book, professor Carol Mason argues that the American anti-abortion movement has become increasingly intertwined with far-right and white nationalist extremism. She traces the evolution of the movement's rhetoric from 'overturn Roe' to 'ignore Roe,' suggesting a shift towards viewing the rule of law as illegitimate. Mason connects the tactics used at clinic blockades, such as using bike racks as barriers, to the imagery of the January 6 Capitol insurrection. The book posits that shared conspiracy theories and a belief in obeying 'God's law over man's law' have created a bridge between anti-abortion activism and insurrectionary politics.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to introduce a new criminal offense targeting individuals who use the internet to advertise services that facilitate illegal immigration, such as small boat crossings over the Channel. The proposed law, part of a broader immigration bill, could lead to up to five years in prison for those creating online material promoting illegal entry, fake documents, or illicit work. Home Office analysis indicates that around 80% of migrants arriving by small boat used social media to contact smuggling gangs. Officials believe the new offense will provide more power to disrupt these criminal networks.</p>
