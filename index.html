          <p>North Korea has condemned Donald Trump's "Golden Dome" missile shield plan, calling it a dangerous initiative that could turn space into a potential nuclear war zone. According to North Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the plan is a strategic threat to nuclear weapons states and will trigger a global arms race. Trump announced the plan, which involves a network of satellites with sensors and interceptors, to protect the U.S. from missiles launched by countries like North Korea, China, Iran, and Russia. Experts suggest the plan faces political and technical challenges and could be costly.</p>

          <p>The diamond industry faces challenges from tariffs, which impose a baseline 10% import duty to the U.S., and the rise of lab-grown diamonds (LGD). These chemically identical stones sell at a significant discount, impacting demand for mined diamonds. Despite these challenges, some analysts believe the industry is nearing a stabilization point between LGD and mined diamonds. De Beers is focusing on natural diamonds and closing its LGD jewelry brand, citing the declining value of lab-grown diamonds (not investment advice).</p>

According to Wang Haibo, director of the China Organ Transplant Response System (COTRS), mainland laws, particularly those related to HIV regulation, prevent the transfer of organs across the border. The specific law controlling the spread of HIV is hindering the development of this cross-border mechanism, as organs, blood, and tissue cannot be transferred across the border.</p>
