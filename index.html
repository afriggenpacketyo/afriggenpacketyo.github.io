          <p>China's restrictions on rare earth element exports, critical for manufacturing military and commercial products, have raised concerns in the US defense industry. These elements are essential for technologies in jet engines, radar, and avionics. China, the world's largest producer, imposed these controls in response to increased US tariffs on Chinese goods, escalating trade tensions. The restrictions affect seven medium and heavy rare earth categories, potentially impacting US weapons production and technological advancement. This article highlights the strategic vulnerabilities of the US supply chain and its reliance on Chinese rare earth elements.</p>
