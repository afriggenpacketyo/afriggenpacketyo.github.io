          <p>China's economy expanded by 4.8% in the third quarter, aligning with analyst forecasts, despite a persistent and deepening real estate crisis. Fixed-asset investment, a key economic driver including property, unexpectedly declined by 0.5% in the first nine months, exacerbated by a 13.9% drop in property investment. While industrial production showed resilience with a 6.5% increase, retail sales growth slowed, and headline inflation fell, indicating ongoing deflationary pressures. The People's Bank of China maintained benchmark lending rates, signaling a cautious approach to stimulate growth amidst these complex economic challenges and external uncertainties.</p>

          <p>Thousands participated in widespread "No Kings" rallies across the U.S. and internationally, expressing anger over President Trump's policies, particularly his administration's crackdown on undocumented migrants and deployment of National Guard troops. Demonstrations, often characterized as vibrant street parties with signs like "Resist Fascism," saw significant turnouts in major cities such as New York, Boston, Atlanta, and Los Angeles. Organizers, part of a larger coalition, emphasized a "fierce love for our country," despite Republican criticism labeling the events as "Hate America" rallies. While largely peaceful, some tensions flared in Portland, leading to federal agents deploying tear gas to disperse crowds.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump accused Colombian President Petro of being an "illegal drug leader" and threatened to immediately cut U.S. funding, with a Republican senator indicating forthcoming "major tariffs" on Colombia. Separately, disgraced former U.S. Congressman George Santos, whose sentence was commuted by Trump, called his prison term "disproportionate" but acknowledged a "large slice of humble pie." An investigation also uncovered a coordinated campaign by major soft-drink corporations, leveraging Republican ties, to counter a movement promoting healthier eating. Additionally, residents of Portland, Oregon, publicly mocked Trump's portrayal of their city as "war-ravaged."</p>

          <p>A Boeing 747 cargo aircraft, operating for Emirates SkyCargo from Dubai, tragically skidded off the runway into the sea while attempting to land at Hong Kong International Airport. The incident, which occurred in the early morning, resulted in the confirmed deaths of two airport ground staff who fell into the water. Four crew members were successfully rescued and transported to the hospital. Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Department has launched an investigation into the cause, and the northern runway was temporarily closed, though other runways remained operational. The aircraft sustained significant damage but reportedly carried no cargo.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump reacted to the global "No Kings Day" protests by dismissing them as "a joke" and "very small, very ineffective," asserting that the participants were "not representative of this country." He vehemently denied being a king, stating he "works his ass off to make our country great," and attributed the rallies to funding from "Soros and other radical left lunatics." Despite Republican concerns that the marches could turn violent, demonstrations in major cities like New York and Washington D.C. were largely peaceful, with no significant incidents or arrests reported by police officials.</p>

          <p>Dozens of tenant rights advocates rallied in San Francisco against the imminent eviction of three disabled senior residents from their long-term rent-controlled apartment, with one having lived there since 1977. The vulnerable tenants, including a 69-year-old recovering from heart surgery, expressed profound distress over potential displacement given their health issues and fixed incomes. Advocates from the Tenant and Neighborhood Councils argue the landlord's motive is to raise rent to market rates, highlighting a pervasive issue in the city's exorbitant housing market. A crucial court hearing on the eviction is scheduled for the upcoming week, as supporters vow to continue their protests.</p>

The market uplift also mirrored a strong close on Wall Street, influenced by a softening U.S. tone on its trade talks with China and a collective effort to move past recent credit concerns that had affected regional banks stateside.</p>

          <p>The fragile U.S.-brokered ceasefire in Gaza faced its first major test as Israel launched air and artillery strikes, accusing Hamas of violating the truce by targeting Israeli soldiers and killing two IDF personnel.

Hospital sources in Gaza reported at least 38 fatalities since Sunday morning from the intensified Israeli strikes.

Beijing recently expanded export rules on rare earths, now requiring foreign firms to seek approval for exporting magnets containing Chinese-originated materials or technology. This strategic move, mirroring U.S. restrictions on Chinese access to technology, demonstrates China's intention of "hitting back with the enemy's methods" to assert its economic and technological independence.

          <p>Hollywood actor Cate Blanchett has enthusiastically partnered with Kew's Millennium Seed Bank (MSB) to advocate for global seed conservation, coinciding with its 25th anniversary. The MSB, located at Wakehurst botanic garden, houses over 2.5 billion seeds from 40,000 wild plant species worldwide, carefully processed, dried, and stored at -20C. Initially conceived as a "doomsday vault," the collection is now actively utilized to restore threatened environments, including rare chalk grasslands and areas devastated by wildfires in Australia. Blanchett, who lives locally, expressed her profound awe for the project and its vital role in safeguarding plant diversity for future restoration efforts.</p>

          <p>The global secondhand luxury market is experiencing rapid expansion, projected to reach $360 billion by 2030, making robust authentication a critical factor for credible resale platforms. With the increasing sophistication of counterfeits, including convincing "superfakes," establishing consumer trust is paramount. Resale platforms like Singapore-based Carousell and South Korea's Bunjang are investing heavily in advanced verification systems, combining traditional visual inspections with scientific equipment and AI trained on vast datasets. This commitment to rigorous verification not only boosts consumer confidence but also drives sales, reflecting a fundamental shift in how younger generations perceive and engage with luxury goods.</p>

          <p>The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) is actively investigating serious claims that Russian hackers stole hundreds of sensitive military documents, including detailed information on eight RAF and Royal Navy bases, as well as MoD staff names and emails.

This incident raises significant national security concerns, coming after previous high-profile data breaches affecting the MoD.

          <p>A new Tesla Model 3 owner has vividly demonstrated substantial cost savings after switching from a gas-powered car, effectively highlighting how his reduced fuel expenses are offsetting his monthly car payment. Driving a significant 130 miles daily, he reported spending only $24 on charging in his first month, largely due to access to free workplace charging. Previously, this commute cost him $400 monthly in gas. This personal account underscores the immediate and considerable financial benefits of electric vehicle ownership, especially when coupled with free charging opportunities, proving EVs can dramatically reduce transportation expenses for many drivers.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers, despite donning their nostalgic all-gold uniforms, suffered a disappointing 38-24 loss against the Indianapolis Colts, primarily due to running back Jonathan Taylor's dominant performance, scoring three touchdowns. The Chargers' defense struggled significantly, allowing Taylor to consistently gain yardage and creating open passing lanes for Colts quarterback Daniel Jones. While quarterback Justin Herbert threw three second-half touchdowns, his efforts were insufficient to overcome the deep deficit. Now with a 3-4 record, the team faces a short week before their next game, with coach Jim Harbaugh acknowledging the urgent need for substantial improvements across all phases.</p>

Judge Mark Pittman, in a sharply ironic order, encouraged the companies to consider relocating their headquarters to Fort Worth, openly criticizing the practice of "forum-shopping" for potentially favorable rulings. The lawsuit alleges that Apple favors OpenAI's ChatGPT on its App Store, deprioritizing competitors like xAI's Grok, raising questions about fair competition in the burgeoning AI industry.</p>
