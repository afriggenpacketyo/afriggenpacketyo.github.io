          <p>Jim Lovell, the renowned NASA astronaut who commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission, has passed away at the age of 97. In a statement, NASA honored his legacy of courage under pressure, which not only helped forge a path to the Moon but also continues to inspire millions today. As a veteran of four spaceflights, Lovell's most famous moment came during the 1970 Apollo 13 flight, where his calm leadership was instrumental in navigating a catastrophic in-flight emergency and bringing the crew safely back to Earth. The article notes that this is a developing story with more details to be updated.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is expanding its mass deportation efforts by securing agreements with several nations, including Rwanda, to accept deportees who are not their own citizens. Rwanda has formally agreed to take in 250 individuals, providing them with support like workforce training and healthcare to help them resettle. This strategy targets migrants whose home countries refuse their return and involves other partners like Eswatini, South Sudan, Costa Rica, and Panama. These third-country deals represent a significant component of the administration's approach to immigration enforcement and deportation logistics.</p>

          <p>Billy Long has left his position as IRS commissioner after just two months on the job, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent taking over as the temporary head of the agency. A White House official confirmed the departure, adding that President Trump plans to nominate Long, a former Republican congressman, for an ambassadorship. His brief and tumultuous tenure comes as the IRS has seen a series of interim leaders under an administration focused on significantly reducing the agency's workforce. Long's appointment had previously drawn criticism due to his lack of an accounting background.</p>

          <p>A six-year-old boy was seriously injured after being attacked by a coyote during his sister's softball game at a park in Carson, California. The child, Enoch Palomar, was bitten and scratched on his leg, head, and neck, requiring twenty stitches to close his wounds. His mother, Melissa Palomar, heroically ran to his aid and scared the animal away, an intense moment that was partially captured on video by another parent. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is now investigating the incident, which underscores the potential dangers of human-wildlife encounters in urban areas.</p>

          <p>As the American food industry moves to eliminate synthetic dyes like Red 40 and Yellow 5, the whitening agent titanium dioxide is largely being left out of these reforms. Driven by the "Make America Healthy Again" initiative, major companies are removing many artificial colors from products, but titanium dioxide is often excluded from these pledges because the FDA classifies it differently. While the European Union banned the chemical over potential health concerns, U.S. food makers are reluctant to abandon it due to its superior effectiveness and the technical challenges of finding a suitable replacement without affecting product appearance and cost.</p>

The New York Times reported on a directive that provides a basis for military operations against cartels designated as terrorist organizations by the U.S. While the White House did not confirm the order, it reiterated that protecting the homeland is a top priority. Sheinbaum emphasized that the U.S.-Mexico relationship must be based on collaboration and coordination, not interventionism or subordination.</p>

          <p>Tonia Haddix, a Missouri woman featured in the HBO documentary "Chimp Crazy," has been sentenced to 46 months in federal prison for perjury and obstruction of justice. The charges stemmed from a lawsuit filed by PETA concerning her mistreatment of several chimpanzees, including the movie-star primate Tonka. Haddix had falsely claimed Tonka died to avoid a court order to transfer him to a sanctuary, but the chimp was later discovered alive in a cage in her basement. The sentence marks the culmination of a long-running legal battle over the welfare of the animals in her care.</p>

          <p>As personal bankruptcy filings increase, it is crucial for individuals considering this option to understand the strict eligibility criteria that can lead to disqualification. For Chapter 7 bankruptcy, a primary obstacle is the "means test," which denies eligibility to those with disposable income above their state's median. Other key disqualifiers include having a recent bankruptcy discharge within a specified period, failing to complete mandatory credit counseling, or engaging in fraudulent activities like hiding assets. The article advises that if disqualified, alternatives like debt consolidation or settlement programs should be explored with a financial professional. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For beginner investors looking to diversify their portfolios, gold remains a popular safe-haven asset, and this article outlines several accessible methods for investment. Options range from the direct ownership of physical gold, such as bars and coins, to more abstract financial instruments like gold-backed Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and highly speculative gold futures contracts. Another common strategy is opening a gold IRA, which allows for tax-advantaged holding of precious metals. The guide stresses the importance of understanding the unique risks and benefits of each approach, noting gold is primarily for stability, not rapid growth. (not investment advice)</p>

This trend is expected to make the third quarter a potential record for the EV market.

          <p>The Boar's Head deli meat plant in Jarratt, Virginia, which was shut down last year after being linked to a deadly listeria outbreak, is set to reopen in the coming months. The USDA lifted its suspension after the company addressed the issues that killed 10 people. However, recent inspection documents reveal that other Boar's Head plants in three states have been cited for similar sanitation problems, including leftover meat residue and blocked drains. These findings have raised new questions among food safety advocates about the company's systemic practices and federal oversight as it prepares to resume operations.</p>

          <p>The ethics watchdog group Democracy Defenders Fund is calling for a federal investigation into the Pentagon's acceptance of a luxury jet from Qatar, reportedly for President Trump's use. The group has asked the Department of Defense Inspector General and the GAO to determine if the acceptance of the $400 million Boeing 747-8 violated federal law and constitutional prohibitions on foreign gifts. The request also questions the reported diversion of nearly $1 billion from a nuclear missile program to retrofit the aircraft, which the group calls a "staggering abuse of public trust."</p>

The story explores the complex social and economic factors driving this phenomenon by speaking directly with people in Chile's capital about their personal decisions. It frames the issue as part of a global shift where economic pressures, evolving cultural norms, and greater individual autonomy are contributing to smaller family sizes, leading to significant and lasting demographic changes worldwide.</p>

In his letter, Tan defended his four-decade career, affirmed his commitment to the highest ethical standards, and stated that Intel is actively working with the White House to address the situation, reassuring staff that the board fully supports him.</p>

          <p>A retrospective analysis examines the situation in Belarus five years after the country's largest-ever pro-democracy protests were crushed by Alexander Lukashenko's regime. The article notes that Lukashenko's rule, now bolstered by Russian support, remains firmly in place, with thousands of political opponents imprisoned or exiled. Despite the regime's efforts to erase the memory of the 2020 uprising, human rights groups continue to document widespread and ongoing repression. The piece concludes with a bleak outlook, suggesting the West has limited leverage to effect change, though political prisoners are sometimes used as bargaining chips.</p>

The ombudsman is seeking to clarify how the town will ensure the constitutional right to worship for its Muslim community.

A police report revealed that officers had identified the perpetrators of a prior, similar racially-motivated assault that Mr. Kohli had witnessed two weeks earlier but failed to arrest them before he was killed. The delay was attributed to officer shift patterns and a bank holiday. His daughter argues that swifter action could have sent a message and prevented the subsequent attack, and she is now calling on the police watchdog to reopen its investigation.</p>

          <p>The European Union's recent sanctioning of an Indian refinery for processing Russian crude oil has raised questions about the future of EU-India trade relations. However, this article's analysis suggests the move is largely symbolic and unlikely to derail ongoing negotiations for a comprehensive free trade agreement. Experts argue that the more significant pressure on India is the threat of high U.S. tariffs, which may paradoxically strengthen India's desire for a stable economic partnership with the EU. This complex geopolitical dynamic could ultimately push the two powers closer together, despite the friction over Russia.</p>
