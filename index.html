          <h2>Germany Resumes Collective Deportation Flights to Afghanistan</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 03:51:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany has resumed collective deportations to Afghanistan, sending 81 Afghan men with criminal records back to their home country. This action fulfills a key agreement in the new government's coalition policy, which aims to increase removals of individuals legally required to leave, starting with criminals and security threats. The move, facilitated with logistical support from Qatar, has drawn criticism due to the human rights situation in Afghanistan under Taliban rule. The German government, which does not officially recognize the Taliban, has been seen as controversial for engaging in talks to facilitate these deportations.</p>

          <p>Government data reveals that serious water pollution incidents in England increased by 60% in the last year, reaching a record high of 2,801 events. These incidents, primarily caused by water companies like Thames, Southern, and Yorkshire Water, have a significant environmental impact, harming aquatic life and posing risks to human health. A parliamentary committee has criticized the "woeful" level of pollution and the failure of regulators to hold companies accountable for infrastructure maintenance. Despite increased rainfall, these discharges often breach legal permits, highlighting systemic issues within the water industry.</p>

          <p>CBS has announced that "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" will end its run in May 2026, a move the network describes as a purely financial decision. Host Stephen Colbert, who was informed the night before the announcement, expressed his gratitude to CBS and the audience, confirming he will not be replaced and the show itself is being discontinued. The decision has sparked speculation, with some public figures questioning if it is linked to political pressure or a recent lawsuit settlement between parent company Paramount and Donald Trump. This marks the end of a three-decade-old late-night institution on the network.</p>

          <p>British MP Diane Abbott has been suspended from the Labour Party for a second time following an investigation into her comments on racism. The controversy stems from a 2023 letter where she distinguished between the racism experienced by people of color and the "prejudice" faced by Jewish people, Irish people, and Travellers, remarks for which she previously apologized. In a recent interview, she stood by her differentiation, leading to the new suspension, under which she will sit as an independent MP. Abbott stated it is "obvious" the current Labour leadership wants her out of the party.</p>

          <p>The United States has officially designated The Resistance Front (TRF) as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, identifying it as the group responsible for the April Pahalgam attack in India that killed 26 people. U.S. officials described TRF as a proxy for the Pakistan-based, UN-designated terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba. India has welcomed the decision, viewing it as a strong affirmation of U.S.-India counterterrorism cooperation. The designation is seen by experts as a sign of deepening support for India following the attack, which targeted mostly Hindu tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir and escalated regional tensions.</p>

          <p>A recent crackdown by India's securities regulator (SEBI) on high-frequency trading firm Jane Street has brought the gray area between legal arbitrage and illegal market manipulation into focus. SEBI accused the firm of manipulating India's Nifty 50 index to profit from options, a charge Jane Street disputes as "basic index arbitrage." Experts note the distinction often hinges on intent, or "mens rea," and market impact. While arbitrage exploits existing price differences, manipulation involves actively creating those price distortions, particularly by influencing a less liquid market to profit from a more liquid one, which SEBI alleges occurred here.

          <h2>Widespread Cellphone Internet Shutdowns Sweep Across Russia, Citing Security Reasons</h2>

          <p>Dozens of regions across Russia have been experiencing widespread and unpredictable cellphone internet shutdowns over the past two months. Officials claim the disruptions are a necessary security measure to counter Ukrainian drone attacks, which can use cellular networks for operation. However, the outages have caused significant daily disruptions for citizens, affecting electronic payments, navigation, and ride-sharing apps. Digital rights experts warn that using security as a justification for such broad restrictions normalizes them for the public and could open the door for authorities to abuse the measures, further curtailing already-stifled internet freedom in the country.</p>

          <p>In a late-night session, the House of Representatives narrowly passed a $9 billion spending cuts package, sending the legislation to President Trump's desk for his signature. The bill, known as a rescissions package, passed 216-213 and will block funds previously allocated for the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Republicans celebrated the vote as a victory for fiscal responsibility and a step toward cutting "woke" initiatives. The process was marked by intense debate, with Democrats attempting to force votes related to the Jeffrey Epstein case, which Republicans accused of being a political tactic.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has strongly condemned U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods. Trump has linked the proposed tariffs to the dropping of legal charges against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who is on trial for an alleged coup attempt. Lula described the threat as "unacceptable blackmail" and a "grave attack on national sovereignty," labeling Brazilian politicians who support Trump's policy as "traitors." The dispute escalates diplomatic tensions as Trump also posts letters of support for Bolsonaro and considers sanctions against a key Brazilian judge.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, the author reflects on turning 35 and letting go of the childhood notion that adults have everything figured out. Instead, he embraces the lesson that most people are simply "winging it" through a continuous process of becoming. He draws parallels to the French comedy show "Bref," whose recent sequel explores the deeper, slower themes of middle age. The author contemplates the gains and losses of an immigrant life, the importance of chosen family, and navigating personal growth in a world facing immense political and environmental challenges.</p>

          <p>A farmer in China's Anhui province has captured local attention by building and successfully operating his own 7-meter-long submarine. Zhang, who had managed a riverside dock for years, was inspired by a television program in 2014 and decided to act on his lifelong fascination with invention. Using 5,000 yuan (US$700) of his savings, he secretly bought steel plates, a battery, and an engine to construct the vessel. His creation, a sleek black submarine, now glides through the local river, representing a remarkable achievement born from a personal dream and rural ingenuity.</p>

          <p>A new report from the National Economic Research Institute, a Beijing-based think tank, has revealed a decline in China's overall marketization index, prompting calls from economists for more pro-market reforms. The index, which measures progress toward a market-based economy, fell to 5.62 out of 10 in 2023, down from a peak in 2021. The most significant deterioration was in government-market relations, indicating increased government intervention. Researchers are urging action to reverse this trend to tackle economic imbalances and intense intra-industry competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food costs, cooled to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high and matching economists' expectations. This easing was partly due to a slight moderation in the rapid increase of rice prices. Despite the slowdown, this marks the 39th consecutive month that inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target. Economists note that while the moderation is welcome, the economic outlook is complicated by potential U.S. tariffs and political uncertainty ahead of an upcoming Upper House election.

          <p>An analysis from The Atlantic questions the official "purely financial" reasoning for CBS's decision to end "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," a consistent ratings leader. The article suggests the move may be part of a pattern of capitulation to President Donald Trump by parent company Paramount, especially as it seeks federal approval for a merger with Skydance. It contextualizes the cancellation with other recent events, including a $16 million settlement of a lawsuit from Trump and the departure of the head of "60 Minutes." The piece argues that the network's leadership seems willing to sacrifice its editorial independence.</p>
