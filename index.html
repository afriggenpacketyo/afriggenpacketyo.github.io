          <p>The US Senate confirmed David Perdue, a known China hawk, as the new US ambassador to China amidst escalating tensions between the two countries. Perdue, a former US Senator for Georgia, has been critical of China and views the country as a global threat. During his confirmation hearing, he emphasized the need for a nuanced and strategic approach to the US-China relationship, acknowledging it as a crucial diplomatic challenge. China's foreign ministry responded by reiterating its stance on US ties and trade, signaling a willingness to engage in dialogue based on equality and mutual respect.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk, leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), described his first 100 days as "very, very intense," citing an "entrenched set of interests" hindering progress. While proud of his team's work, Musk admitted DOGE hasn't been as effective as he'd like, despite claiming savings of $1.6 billion a day. He believes reaching the $1 trillion cost-cutting goal is possible but requires overcoming resistance from the federal bureaucracy. Musk emphasized the difficulty of changing the government's default spending habits and the political will required for significant cuts.</p>

          <p>Tennessee Republicans, despite pausing a bill that would have allowed public schools to deny enrollment to children without legal immigration status, plan to revive the measure next year. The bill was initially intended to challenge the Supreme Court's 1982 ruling in Plyler v. Doe, which guarantees education for all students regardless of immigration status. The bill faced opposition due to potential financial repercussions, including the risk of losing federal education funding. Immigrant rights activists see the pause as a victory, but acknowledge the risk of the bill's return and a potential reversal of legal precedent by the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>The Joint Office of Energy and Technology, established to facilitate collaboration between the Department of Transportation and the Department of Energy on electric vehicle infrastructure, has been largely dismantled due to government-wide job cuts and the freezing of climate-related work. The office, once employing around 50 people, no longer has any full-time federal employees. The Trump administration's efforts to reverse Biden's EV policies, combined with general downsizing, led to resignations and project freezes.

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has ended the VA Servicing Purchase (VASP) program, a mortgage-rescue initiative that has helped approximately 20,000 veterans avoid foreclosure. Republicans in Congress criticized VASP, arguing that it placed too much taxpayer money at risk. Mortgage industry groups and veterans organizations warned that ending VASP without a replacement would result in many veterans losing their homes, some due to the VA's own errors. Veterans now face worse options than other homeowners, and thousands who were relying on the program are left in limbo.</p>

          <p>A recent report indicating an economic contraction in the first quarter has increased the political risks for President Trump as he pursues an aggressive trade war. This news arrives after a quarter of declining stock prices and widespread uncertainty among businesses and consumers. The economic downturn could be the equivalent of President Biden’s fumbled withdrawal from Afghanistan, which negatively impacted his job approval ratings. Trump's economic advisors are now recognizing that the timing and execution of his tariff announcements could prove to be colossal mistakes, even if they applaud the underlying strategy.</p>

The central bank now expects the Japanese economy to grow by only 0.5 percent, a significant downgrade from its previous forecast of 1.1 percent. Governor Kazuo Ueda attributed the change to the "unprecedented level" of tariffs imposed by the United States, which threaten both economic growth and corporate profits. The Bank of Japan also decided to keep interest rates unchanged at 0.5 percent in an attempt to stabilize the economy.</p>

          <p>China has enacted a new private sector law that prohibits "profit-driven" enforcement targeting non-state businesses, addressing long-standing complaints about unfair treatment. The law aims to regulate administrative actions and limit administrative powers, with clauses reinforcing accountability for officials. Analysts believe the law will help businesses defend their interests and challenge local governments in court if their rights are violated. The enactment of the law is hailed as a critical step amid increasing economic pressures at home and abroad.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) maintained its policy rate at 0.5% for the second consecutive meeting, citing concerns about the economic impact of President Trump's tariffs. While Japan's inflation has remained above the BOJ's 2% target, allowing for potential rate hikes, trade tensions have complicated these plans. The central bank stated it will continue to raise rates if economic and price forecasts are realized, but also highlighted potential moderation in growth due to economic slowdowns and declining corporate profits. Governor Ueda cautioned that drastic tariff changes would affect the central bank's monetary policy outlook.</p>

          <p>The US has called on India and Pakistan to de-escalate tensions following a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that resulted in 26 civilian deaths. Secretary of State Marco Rubio held separate talks with India's foreign minister and Pakistan's prime minister, urging both sides to maintain peace and security in South Asia. India accuses Pakistan of supporting militants behind the attack, while Islamabad denies the allegations. The situation is further complicated by India's closure of its airspace to Pakistani aircraft and warnings of potential military action.</p>

The article suggests that Trump's demands will increase with each concession, similar to Columbia University's experience. While belligerence seems to yield better results for negotiators with something Trump wants, the UK's approach appears to be driven by the hope that it can talk its way out of anything.
