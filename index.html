          <p>Former President Trump's promise of a "golden age" for the US economy is being questioned after the first quarter GDP showed a contraction. Trump blamed the Biden administration for the negative growth, while simultaneously taking credit for positive economic indicators. The article suggests that the new administration's tariff plans and the resulting uncertainty significantly challenged economic activity during the quarter, with businesses scrambling to preempt tariffs and consumers feeling the pressure. The article highlights the potential for a 'Trumpcession' due to the administration's handling of tariffs and the resulting confusion and apprehension in the business world.</p>

          <p>Australians are voting in a general election amidst a challenging economic and political landscape, marked by inflation, a housing crisis, and complex relations with the United States and China. Voters are primarily concerned with cost-of-living issues, with both major parties offering small-scale measures to alleviate economic pressures. The article notes a shift away from the two major parties towards independent candidates, signaling dissatisfaction with the current political offerings. While global turmoil originating from Washington has dominated news cycles, voters are most concerned about bread-and-butter issues, such as the rising prices of eggs and Vegemite.</p>

          <p>Over 80 people died in recent violence in Druze-majority areas of Syria, sparked by an audio clip deemed blasphemous to Islam. Unidentified armed groups attacked the town of Jaramana, leading to clashes with Druze community members, and the violence spread to other Druze areas. The new Syrian government, led by the Islamist rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, is negotiating with the Druze community about their role in the transitional government. Israel has also intervened, bombing areas near Damascus, claiming to protect the Druze community, but experts warn this interference could destabilize the situation further.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies from the blood of Tim Friede, a man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. The antivenom has shown protection against fatal doses from a wide range of venomous snakes in animal tests, offering hope for a universal antivenom. Friede's motivation was to develop better therapies for snakebite victims, and researchers identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies in his blood that could target two classes of neurotoxin. The antivenom cocktail has shown unprecedented breadth of protection against deadly snakes.</p>

          <h2>Tariffs End Shipping Loophole, Impacting Online Retailers and Advertising Revenue</h2>

          <p>The elimination of the tariff exemption for inexpensive goods is cutting into advertising revenue for Meta, Alphabet, and other platforms. Temu and Shein, known for low-cost items from Chinese factories, heavily relied on digital advertising, but now face tariffs of up to 145 percent. Temu has stopped direct shipments from China, transitioning to local warehouses. The reduction in advertising spending has led to a decline in app downloads for Temu and Shein, and Meta and Snap have also reported a decrease in revenue from Asian retailers.</p>

          <p>Ghana's ambitious national cathedral project, designed by architect David Adjaye, has stalled due to economic mismanagement and corruption allegations. The project, intended to be a national monument, has become a political battleground. The new government has halted funding and dissolved the agency managing the project. The unfinished cathedral has become a symbol of economic mismanagement, with critics questioning the use of public funds for a personal pledge made by the former president.</p>

          <p>The United States imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, potentially increasing prices for new and used vehicles, repairs, and insurance. The tariffs, intended to promote domestic manufacturing, follow earlier levies on imported cars.

          <p>South Africa is facing the dual challenge of rising sea levels and drought, with climate change exacerbating both. While rising seas threaten coastal cities, new research suggests that drought and water loss are causing parts of the country to lift out of the ocean. The study indicates that groundwater loss during droughts makes the land lighter, leading to uplift. However, experts caution against viewing this as a solution to rising sea levels, as drought has severe consequences.</p>
