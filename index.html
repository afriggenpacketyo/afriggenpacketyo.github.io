          <p>This article reflects on the fifth anniversary of George Floyd's murder and the subsequent Black Lives Matter movement, highlighting both the global impact and the disappointments in achieving lasting change, particularly in the United States. Despite initial hopes, many promised reforms have not materialized, and the Trump administration has reversed diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. The article notes that police killings of Black individuals remain disproportionately high, but also acknowledges a shift in how racism is discussed and the banning of the knee-to-neck maneuver in some states. The article quotes artists and authors reflecting on the continued struggle for equality and justice.</p>

          <p>This article explores the concept of a balanced work schedule, drawing parallels between biblical teachings and modern scientific research. It argues that the seven-day week, originating from the Bible, provides a valuable framework for productivity and well-being. The article references studies showing that excessive work hours beyond 55 hours per week do not increase output, supporting the idea of a dedicated day for rest and reflection. It also touches on the importance of finding meaning in work and avoiding the extremes of constant leisure or relentless busyness.</p>
