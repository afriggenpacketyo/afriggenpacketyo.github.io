          <p>White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller condemned reporters for their coverage of MS-13 and Tren de Aragua violence in the U.S., asserting that President Trump had to "shame" them into covering these stories.

He accused reporters of siding with MS-13 terrorists and prioritizing their own safety over the safety of innocent Americans, claiming they would not choose to live near gang members despite their coverage forcing others to do so.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has publicly refuted Anthropic's arguments in support of stricter U.S. chip export controls aimed at China, criticizing the AI startup's claims of elaborate smuggling tactics. Anthropic had suggested that Chinese entities were concealing chips in "prosthetic baby bumps" and alongside live lobsters to evade restrictions. Nvidia argues that American firms should focus on innovation to overcome challenges rather than exaggerating smuggling methods. The existing "AI Diffusion Rule," set to take effect on May 15, imposes global export controls on advanced AI chips to prevent China from advancing in the AI sector, with potential updates from President Trump adding further uncertainty to the policy.</p>

The company clarified that the dismissal was not related to Kohl's performance or financial reporting, and Michael Bender has been appointed as interim CEO.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has voiced concerns over the $2.5 billion renovation of the Federal Reserve building, questioning the high price tag. He suggested that the cost overruns should be examined as part of a broader effort to reduce government waste, despite the Fed being funded by interest on securities and bank fees rather than taxpayer money. The project, initiated in 2021 with an initial budget of $1.9 billion, aims to address aging building systems, meet codes, update technology, and improve energy efficiency. Musk's comments come as his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) claims to have saved taxpayers $160 billion.</p>

          <p>Kinney County, Texas, has collected approximately $1.7 million in bail from migrants who were deported before their court appearances, retaining the money rather than returning it. This practice has become a contentious issue as Texas increases its role in immigration enforcement through Operation Lone Star. The county argues that it is deterring illegal crossings and compensating landowners for damages, while critics argue that it is unfair to migrants who are unable to attend court due to deportation. The funds have been used to bolster the county's law enforcement resources and increase salaries for key officials.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have introduced the Student Success and Taxpayer Savings Plan, proposing significant changes to federal student loan repayment options.

Under the RAP plan, monthly bills would be a percentage of a borrower's income, ranging from 1% to 10% based on earnings.

          <p>Lawmakers are demanding answers following the death of Marie Ange Blaise, a Haitian woman who died after spending over two months in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody. Representative Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick suggested Blaise had not received adequate medical care, while other representatives have called for a full, independent investigation into her death. The incident occurs as the Trump administration increases its immigration enforcement efforts, with a significant number of arrests and deportations reported in the first 100 days.</p>

          <h2>McDonald's Reports Biggest US Sales Drop Since Covid-19 Pandemic</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 10:37:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>McDonald's has reported its largest decline in U.S. sales since the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, with a 3.6% drop in revenue at stores open for at least a year. The company attributes this decline to broader concerns about the U.S. economy, as customers, especially lower-income households, reduce their visits due to rising prices. This sales slump coincides with a contraction in the U.S. economy, which shrank at an annual rate of 0.3% in the first three months of 2025, reflecting reactions to President Trump's tariff announcements.</p>

          <h2>Automakers See Sales Increase Amid Tariff Concerns, but Future Uncertain</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 10:36:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Automakers, including Ford, Hyundai, and Kia, reported significant sales increases in April as consumers rushed to purchase vehicles ahead of potential tariff-related price hikes. This "tariff fear-buying" was further fueled by automakers offering discounts or promising to hold prices. However, demand slowed in late April as inventories tightened and prices increased, suggesting that the initial surge may not last. Economists predict that higher costs and reduced vehicle availability could lead to lower sales in the future.</p>

          <p>Oman's Foreign Minister announced the postponement of the scheduled US-Iran nuclear talks, citing logistical reasons, with a new date to be determined later. The talks aim to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for lifting some economic sanctions. The announcement follows accusations from Iran regarding the U.S.'s "contradictory behavior and provocative statements" after Washington imposed new oil-related sanctions and warned Tehran about supporting Yemen's Houthis. A U.S. source indicated that America had not confirmed participation in the Rome talks but expects them to occur soon.</p>

          <p>McDonald's reported a 3.6% decline in U.S. same-store sales, the largest domestic drop since the Covid-19 pandemic, attributed to bad weather and cautious consumer spending. CEO Chris Kempczinski noted that traffic from low- and middle-income consumers decreased significantly, indicating broader economic pressure. Despite the domestic challenges, McDonald's is focusing on value meals and new menu items to attract customers, with some success already seen in new product launches. The company reiterated its full-year outlook, planning to open 2,200 locations and invest in capital expenditures.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division has experienced a significant reduction in staff, with approximately 70% of its attorneys either leaving, being reassigned, or accepting deferred resignation offers since January. This reduction follows the appointment of Harmeet Dhillon, a Trump ally, to lead the division, who has signaled a shift in priorities. The departures have raised concerns about the division's ability to enforce federal civil rights laws effectively, with critics suggesting it could lead to a politicization of the division's work and a decline in expertise.</p>

Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers stated that Roman "outright lied" about when Apple decided to levy a 27% fee on some App Store purchases and has referred the matter to U.S. attorneys for potential criminal contempt proceedings. While Apple won the majority of counts in the original trial, the court ordered Apple to make changes to its app store.</p>

          <p>Investors in gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) may be surprised to find they face a higher tax rate on their profits. The IRS classifies gold and other precious metals as "collectibles," which are subject to a maximum 28% federal tax rate on long-term capital gains, unlike stocks and real estate which have a maximum rate of 20%. This higher rate applies to ETFs structured as trusts and physically backed by precious metals. With gold prices soaring, investors may need to account for this higher tax liability.</p>
