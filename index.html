          <p>U.S. law enforcement officials have seized over $10 million in cryptocurrency connected to Mexico's Sinaloa cartel. This seizure was part of extensive nationwide operations that also confiscated large amounts of fentanyl and methamphetamine. The operation highlights the increasing use of digital currencies by drug trafficking organizations for financial transactions. These raids represent a significant blow to the cartel's financial infrastructure, occurring shortly after a key member of the Guzman family pleaded guilty to drug charges in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Southern Water has implemented a temporary hosepipe ban for nearly one million customers in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. The restriction is a response to critically low levels in the River Test and Itchen, which are major water sources for the region. The ban prohibits using hosepipes for activities like watering gardens or washing cars to conserve water and protect fragile chalk stream ecosystems. This move has drawn criticism due to the company's history of significant water leakage from its infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's inflation rate rose to 3.6% in the year to June, marking its fastest pace since January 2024 and exceeding economists' expectations. The Office for National Statistics attributed the increase to higher prices for food, clothing, and transport fares. This development complicates the Bank of England's upcoming decision on interest rates as it aims to control inflation while supporting a fragile economy. Despite wage growth, rising costs for essential goods continue to pressure household budgets across the country. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has narrowly voted to begin debate on a contentious spending cuts package proposed by the Trump administration. The measure, which seeks to rescind $9.4 billion in funding for public broadcasting and international aid, advanced only after Vice President JD Vance cast a tie-breaking vote. Several Republican senators joined Democrats in opposition, expressing concerns over the lack of detail and the impact on programs like PEPFAR and local public media stations. The bill now faces a marathon session of amendments before a final vote, with a looming Friday deadline.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly delayed or may cancel approximately $140 million in federal grants intended for fighting the fentanyl crisis, according to anonymous CDC staffers. The funds are part of the Overdose To Action program, which supports state and local public health efforts to reduce overdose deaths. Health officials warn that cutting this funding would be catastrophic, potentially unraveling progress made in combating the opioid epidemic and leading to program shutdowns. The disruption appears to stem from bureaucratic issues involving the administration's cost-cutting initiatives and the Office of Management and Budget.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a decline in popularity, the recorder remains a valuable educational tool for teaching children the fundamentals of music. Educators praise the instrument for being inexpensive, portable, and easy for beginners to produce a sound, making it an ideal gateway to more complex instruments. Originating in the 15th century and favored by figures like Henry VIII, the recorder was revived in the 20th century as a teaching tool. While often seen as a simple school instrument, experts note it is a serious instrument capable of complex music, which most students never explore.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The term "y'all," once considered a distinct Southernism, has become an increasingly popular second-person plural pronoun across the United States. Linguists attribute its rise to its utility in filling a gap in standard English, its inclusive and gender-neutral nature, and its spread through migration and cultural influence, particularly in music. The word's origins are believed to be a blend of Scots-Irish and West African linguistic influences. Its adoption by diverse groups, including queer communities and young people nationwide, marks a significant shift in American vernacular, reflecting a broader acceptance of regional dialects.</p>

          <p>Germany's ambitious transition to renewable energy is being hampered by significant delays in expanding its national power grid. New high-voltage lines are needed to transport wind power from the north to industrial centers in the south, but progress is slow. Grid operators cite lengthy approval processes, skilled labor shortages, and supply bottlenecks as major obstacles. Of the nearly 17,000 kilometers of power lines planned for completion by the end of 2024, only a fraction have been finished, with regulators expecting construction to continue for another decade or more.

          <p>Iranian authorities have seized a foreign-flagged tanker in the Gulf of Oman, accusing its crew of smuggling two million liters of fuel. The chief justice of Hormozgan province stated the vessel was intercepted because its cargo documents were incomplete. Seventeen crew members, including the captain, were taken into custody, though their nationalities and the vessel's details were not disclosed. This incident is the latest in a series of seizures by Iran as it cracks down on the persistent problem of fuel smuggling, which is driven by heavily subsidized domestic fuel prices.</p>

          <p>A debate is intensifying in Germany over the country's staggered summer holiday schedule, with several states demanding an end to what they see as an unfair system. Currently, the southern states of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg always have the last holiday slot due to their traditional Pentecost break, allowing their residents to travel during less crowded periods. Other states, which rotate their holiday times, argue this is no longer fair and creates travel chaos and peak prices for their families. However, leaders in the south have defiantly stated they will not change their long-standing holiday rhythm.</p>

This marks a significant reversal from the previous year, when a weaker yen fueled a 59% sales jump by attracting international shoppers, particularly from China. Despite the slowdown in Japan, the Cartier owner's overall revenue grew by 6%, beating analyst expectations, largely driven by strong performance in its high-end jewelry division.

The review, authored by Prof. Gillian Leng, also suggests standardized uniforms and badges to clearly distinguish them from doctors, and states they should not be diagnosing patients. The recommendations follow a heated debate over the roles' responsibilities and several high-profile cases where patients died after being treated by PAs whom families believed were doctors.
