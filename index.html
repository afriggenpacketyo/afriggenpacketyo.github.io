          <p>Following Europe's tense 15-13 Ryder Cup victory over the United States in New York, team captain Luke Donald has not ruled out leading the team for a third time. Donald became only the second European captain to win back-to-back tournaments, prompting chants of "Two more years!" from players and fans. While humbled by the support, Donald stated he would not rush into a decision, wanting to first savor the recent win. The victory was notable for occurring amid hostile crowd behavior, which Donald acknowledged needs to be addressed for future events.</p>

The initial rollout supports U.S. Etsy sellers, with over a million Shopify merchants slated to join soon, causing stock prices for both e-commerce companies to rise significantly. This move into e-commerce represents a new revenue stream for OpenAI, which will collect a fee from transactions processed through the chatbot. The underlying technology, developed with Stripe, aims to streamline the shopping process for ChatGPT's vast user base. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States has recorded over 1,500 measles cases in 2025, the highest number in more than three decades, with infections confirmed in at least 39 states. A significant portion of these cases originated from a major outbreak in West Texas that resulted in the deaths of two unvaccinated children. Health experts attribute the surge to declining vaccination rates, with kindergarten MMR vaccination coverage falling below the 95% threshold required for community immunity. The CDC warns that measles can lead to severe complications, including brain damage and death, especially in unvaccinated individuals.</p>

The victim, Norlan Guzman-Fuentes, was a 37-year-old detainee from El Salvador with a criminal history in the United States. The attack was carried out by 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, who officials say intended to kill federal agents before fatally shooting himself. Two other individuals were critically wounded in the assault, though no ICE personnel were harmed during the incident.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has unveiled a plan to invest $625 million in coal-fired power plants and open 13.1 million acres of public land to coal mining. This initiative aims to revive the struggling coal sector, which has seen its contribution to U.S. electricity fall from 50% in 2000 to about 15% in 2024 due to competition from natural gas and renewable energy. The funding includes $350 million to modernize existing plants and $175 million for projects in rural communities. Critics argue the move is a wasteful subsidy for an outdated and polluting energy source. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Charlie Javice, the founder of the student financial aid platform Frank, is set to be sentenced after being found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. The bank acquired her startup for $175 million in 2021 based on a claim of over 5 million student users, but later discovered the actual number was fewer than 300,000. Javice was convicted on multiple counts of fraud for fabricating the user data to secure the deal. During the hearing, Javice expressed profound remorse for her actions, while prosecutors described the acquired company as a "crime scene" fueled by greed.</p>

Consequently, seniors may face higher premiums and reduced benefits during the upcoming open enrollment period.

According to a White House spokesperson, the FBI director indicated that Sanford "hated people of the Mormon faith." A local political candidate who met Sanford also reported that he expressed a strong dislike for the church's followers. Sanford drove his vehicle into the church, opened fire on the congregation, and started a fire before being killed by responding officers.</p>

          <p>Approximately 58 million pounds of corn dogs and other sausage-on-a-stick products are being recalled nationwide due to potential contamination with pieces of wood. The recall affects certain State Fair corn dogs and Jimmy Dean brand products made by Hillshire Brands, a subsidiary of Tyson Foods. The company initiated the recall after receiving multiple consumer complaints, including five reports of minor injuries. The affected products were produced between March and September 2025 and were distributed to retailers, schools, and Defense Department facilities, prompting concerns that they may still be in consumers' freezers.</p>

          <p>The Taliban has shut down internet access across Afghanistan, escalating a crackdown that began with severing fiber optic connections in several provinces earlier in the month. According to the internet watchdog Netblocks, the country is now in a "total internet blackout," with telephone services also affected. A local Taliban spokesperson stated the ban was ordered by the regime's supreme leader to "prevent immoral activities." The move further isolates the Afghan population and is expected to have a devastating impact on education, business, and communication in a country already facing a severe humanitarian crisis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Scottish government has issued new guidance requiring schools to provide separate toilet facilities for boys and girls based on biological sex. This move follows a Supreme Court ruling that defined a woman by biological sex under equalities law. While single-sex facilities are now mandatory, schools are also permitted to offer gender-neutral toilets. The updated guidance marks a shift from a 2021 policy that allowed transgender pupils to use facilities matching their gender identity. Education Secretary Jenny Gilruth stated the new rules provide necessary clarity, though critics have called the guidance contradictory.</p>

Under the proposed Labour policy, legal migrants must demonstrate a high standard of English, maintain a clean criminal record, and volunteer in their community to qualify for permanent settlement. Mahmood stated the policy is designed to ensure that contribution to British society is a prerequisite for living there permanently.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A $1.6 billion merger has been proposed between Compass and Anywhere, the two largest real estate brokerage firms in the United States. The deal would create a massive 340,000-agent network, combining Compass's regional strength with Anywhere's national brands like Century 21 and Coldwell Banker. While the companies state the merger will deliver more value to consumers, some industry observers worry it will increase pressure on smaller, independent brokerages. The consolidation comes as the housing market is softening, and it reflects a broader trend of larger firms gaining market share through acquisitions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Over a century after John D. Rockefeller became America's first billionaire, the nation is now home to over 900 billionaires who collectively hold an estimated $6.8 trillion in wealth. This modern billionaire class, largely deriving its fortune from technology and finance, controls a share of the nation's wealth approaching the levels seen during the Gilded Age. Data shows the top 1% of Americans now control over a third of the country's wealth, a significant increase since 1980. While most of today's billionaires are self-made, research indicates that inheritance still plays a significant role for about a third of them. (not investment advice)</p>

Chinese importers capitalized on the lower prices, securing a large portion of their near-term supply from Argentina at a time when they would typically be buying from the U.S. This has caused friction within the Trump administration, highlighted by a widely circulated photo of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reading a text message from an Iowa grain trader who was furious that U.S. financial support inadvertently undercut American farmers.
