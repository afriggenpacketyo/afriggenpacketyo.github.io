          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle's IPO is notable because existing shareholders are selling more shares than the company itself, a rare occurrence reminiscent of Facebook's 2012 IPO. This decision is likely driven by venture capital firms seeking liquidity after a prolonged period of poor returns following the market peak in 2021. The company, which is behind the popular USDC stablecoin, did not provide a reason for its decision. The extended period of meager returns for venture capital firms has caused a strong desire by early investors to get some liquidity.</p>

The bill would add $3 trillion or more to federal budget deficits over the next decade through tax cuts that are only partially offset by spending reductions. Musk's criticism is notable given his close ties to the president and his role in identifying areas for government spending cuts.</p>

          <p>A new report from Oxford Economics indicates that recent college graduates are facing increased difficulty in finding employment, contributing to a rise in the national unemployment rate. The report suggests a mismatch between the supply of recent graduates and the demand in specific fields, particularly in the technology sector, which has experienced a slowdown in hiring. Economic uncertainty, driven by trade policies, is also contributing to the situation, potentially leading to further increases in unemployment among recent graduates. The report also highlights the issue of "underemployment," where qualified workers take jobs that don't require a degree, which can negatively impact their career prospects.</p>

          <p>One of Sean 'Diddy' Combs' former employees testified that the hip-hop mogul kidnapped her at gunpoint and broke into rapper Kid Cudi's home in a plot to kill his love rival. Capricorn Clark, who worked for Mr. Combs for over a decade, told the court that the defendant and a security guard had forced her to drive with them to Kid Cudi's home in 2011. She also claimed that Diddy had threatened to kill her on her first day working for him. Mr. Combs has pleaded not guilty to racketeering, sexual assault, and transportation to engage in prostitution.</p>

          <p>During a live broadcast of an American Hockey League game between the Abbotsford Canucks and the Colorado Eagles, a raucous fan threw a chair that struck the Canucks' announcer, Brandon Astle, in the leg. Astle, who was audibly distracted by the noise, confronted the fan during the broadcast and later apologized for his reaction on social media. He clarified that the incident was isolated and did not reflect the Eagles organization or its fans, and the individual was ejected from the arena. The Canucks won the game and advanced to the conference finals.</p>

          <p>A federal judge will allow prosecutors to downgrade charges against L.A. County sheriff’s deputy Trevor Kirk, who was convicted of a felony in an excessive force case, to a misdemeanor. This decision follows a controversial legal maneuver by U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli, who had offered Kirk a misdemeanor plea deal after his conviction for pepper-spraying and assaulting an unarmed woman. The judge rejected the plea deal but granted the motion to lessen the charges, though Kirk could still face jail time. The case has caused turmoil in the U.S. attorney’s office, with several prosecutors resigning in protest.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists claim to have found a solution to a critical flaw in hyperloop technology, addressing concerns about ride comfort at ultra-high speeds. Researchers at China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation found that even minor imperfections in the track can cause violent vibrations in maglev cars traveling at 1,000km/h. However, they have developed a method to reduce turbulence intensity by nearly half, making the ride "pronounced, but not unpleasant." The study used supercomputer simulations and scaled-down prototype tests to identify and mitigate these issues.</p>
