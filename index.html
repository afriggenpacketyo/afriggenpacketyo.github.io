          <p>The UK government plans to end the recruitment of care workers from abroad as part of a broader effort to reduce net migration. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced that firms will now be required to hire British nationals or extend visas for overseas workers already in the country. The government aims to cut up to 50,000 lower-skilled and care workers from entering the UK over the next year, while also implementing stricter requirements for training commitments to reintegrate unemployed individuals into the domestic labor market. The threshold for skilled visas is expected to be increased to graduate level, tightened from the current A-level measure.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China met in Geneva to address trade tensions stemming from tariffs imposed by both countries.

          <p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is launching a smear campaign against Ukraine to undermine its EU accession process, using propaganda to portray the country as a hub for drug trafficking and organized crime. This campaign serves a dual purpose: discrediting opposition leader Peter Magyar and appealing to revisionist sentiments among far-right voters who dream of reclaiming Transcarpathia. Orban's anti-Ukrainian stance also aligns him with Russian President Vladimir Putin and former US President Donald Trump. The article notes that experts suggest the rule of law is more established in Ukraine than in Hungary.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's encouragement to invest in the stock market, Wall Street strategists caution that volatility may persist even with potential trade deals. Brian Vendig of MJP noted that it's not necessarily a "pound the table" moment to buy stocks, citing ongoing uncertainty. Concerns include the limited timeframe for trade deals, potential impacts on inventory levels, and signs of economic slowdown.

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has expressed caution regarding a consumption tax cut as a measure to combat inflation, citing concerns about the potential strain on state coffers. Senior officials within his administration and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party have also shown reluctance toward reducing the consumption tax, which currently stands at 8% for food and beverages and 10% for other items. The coalition government is currently working on an economic package in preparation for the House of Councillors election this summer.</p>
