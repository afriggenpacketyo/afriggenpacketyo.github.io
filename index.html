            <p>The White House is restructuring the National Security Council (NSC) by appointing aides who are considered loyal to President Trump's agenda, following the dismissal of six officials earlier in April. Derek Harvey, a military intelligence analyst, is expected to become the senior director for intelligence, replacing Brian Walsh. Harvey previously served on the NSC but was ousted due to disagreements with H.R. McMaster. His past involvement as a vocal Trump defender during impeachment inquiries adds a layer of political significance to his return. Optimism score: 60</p>

            <p>The global economy is experiencing volatility due to the Trump administration's trade wars and tariff policies, which are disrupting global supply chains and increasing business expenses. The lack of a clear international response to these policies raises concerns about fear, complacency, or a lack of options. While some argue that the U.S. is using tariffs to address trade imbalances, the costs are significant, and the sustainability of this strategy is questionable. Another possibility is that the U.S. aims to reverse globalization and bring manufacturing jobs back to American soil, which would require substantial investment and potentially lead to inflation.

The group criticized Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu for using partial agreements for political gain. Meanwhile, Israeli strikes continue in Gaza, resulting in numerous casualties, and humanitarian aid efforts face significant challenges.
