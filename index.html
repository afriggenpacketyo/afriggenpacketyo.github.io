          <p>The Swiss National Bank has identified U.S. tariffs as a significant challenge for the country's exporters, leading to a downgrade in economic growth forecasts. While the central bank held interest rates at 0%, officials noted the machinery and watchmaking industries would be most affected. Despite the pressure on specific sectors, the bank does not anticipate a recession, projecting modest growth for 2025 and 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, has acknowledged that Labour MPs have contacted him about potentially challenging Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer for the party leadership. While stating the decision rests with the party in Westminster, Burnham's comments have fueled speculation about his ambitions ahead of the Labour conference. He emphasized the need for a "proper plan for the country" and offered to support the prime minister, even as some party figures dismissed the leadership talk as "tittle tattle."</p>

          <p>A court in Spain has set a legal precedent by convicting a man for killing a puppy under a gender violence law, recognizing the act as a form of psychological abuse against his partner. The 18-year-old was found guilty of throwing the couple's four-month-old puppy off a cliff to inflict emotional suffering on the woman. The groundbreaking ruling classified the crime as "vicarious violence," a form of abuse typically associated with harming a child to hurt the other parent.</p>

          <p>Despite widespread concern, early research indicates that the introduction of generative AI tools like ChatGPT may not have increased the overall rate of academic cheating, which was already high. An education researcher analyzing student survey data found that while some students now use AI to complete assignments, the total percentage of students engaging in cheating behaviors has remained relatively stable. The article suggests that AI has become another method for cheating rather than the cause of a new wave, raising complex questions for educators about what constitutes acceptable AI use.</p>

          <p>The total amount of debt owed by households in England, Wales, and Scotland to energy suppliers has climbed to a new record of £4.4 billion, according to the regulator Ofgem. This figure represents an increase of over £750 million compared to the previous year, with more than one million households having no repayment plan in place. As energy prices remain high, regulators are considering new measures to address the growing crisis, including a potential debt relief scheme funded through all customers' bills.</p>

          <p>A Paris court has found former French President Nicolas Sarkozy guilty of criminal conspiracy related to allegations that he accepted illicit funds from late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi for his 2007 presidential campaign. While convicted on the conspiracy charge, the court acquitted him of other charges, including passive corruption and illegal campaign financing, citing insufficient evidence. This verdict is the latest in a series of legal troubles for Sarkozy, who has faced multiple criminal investigations since leaving office in 2012.</p>

          <p>A political analysis suggests that Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham's recent comments about a potential leadership bid are a deliberate and provocative challenge to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. By openly discussing his policy differences, particularly on borrowing and public spending, Burnham is positioning himself as an alternative and testing the waters for a future run. While the path for him to return to Parliament and mount a formal challenge is complex, his actions create an unwelcome distraction for the government ahead of the party conference.</p>

          <p>A report from S&P Global Ratings has warned that China's banking sector could be entering a period of "Japanification," characterized by prolonged low growth and weak profitability. This situation mirrors Japan's economic stagnation following its asset bubble burst in the 1990s. The report notes that Beijing's efforts to stimulate the economy by cutting prime loan rates to historic lows are squeezing banks' profit margins, and lenders may have fewer options to diversify revenue compared to their global peers.

With JLR's factories shut down until at least October, there are growing fears that smaller suppliers who rely on the company's business could face bankruptcy. One potential plan involves the government purchasing component parts to maintain cash flow for these firms until JLR's operations can resume.</p>

This has created what the charity's CEO calls a "national crisis," where children's independence and quality of life are severely impacted.</p>
