          <p>The BBC has stated it regrets not cutting the live broadcast of Bob Vylan's Glastonbury performance, where the singer led chants of "death to the IDF." The broadcaster is now reviewing its live event guidelines following widespread condemnation from the government and festival organizers, who labeled the remarks as crossing a line into hate speech and incitement. Ofcom, the UK's media regulator, is also investigating the incident, while the band's singer has defended his actions as political activism.</p>

          <p>The attorney for 11 female athletes suing San Jose State University and the Mountain West Conference has condemned the conference's handling of an investigation into a transgender player. The controversy centers on the conference hiring the same law firm to investigate misconduct allegations against the athlete that it was using to defend her eligibility in court. The lawyer, William Bock, called the move "outrageous, improper, and deceptive," suggesting it shows a lack of interest in discovering the truth and instead focuses on promoting a specific narrative.</p>

          <p>Consumer advocates and a former executive are raising alarms over Blue Shield of California's recent restructuring, which established a new parent corporation, Ascendiun Inc., in Delaware. Critics argue the move, approved by state regulators without public oversight, could allow the nonprofit insurer to transfer billions in assets out of state with reduced accountability, gutting California's ability to enforce the insurer's nonprofit obligations. Blue Shield maintains the change will reduce bureaucracy and that state regulators retain full authority, a position the Department of Managed Health Care supports.</p>

          <p>China's film industry is aggressively adopting artificial intelligence, starkly contrasting with Hollywood's more hesitant approach amid labor and intellectual property concerns. A Chinese government-backed foundation announced plans to use AI to revitalize 100 classic kung fu films, reinterpreting them for new audiences through animation and other technologies. This no-holds-barred strategy highlights a significant cultural and industrial divergence, as U.S. guilds like the DGA express strong opposition to altering a director's original work, fearing it could distort a filmmaker's artistic vision.</p>

However, the defense has argued that while Combs behaved badly, the racketeering and sex trafficking charges are exaggerated, and they have highlighted that key witnesses did not report the alleged abuse at the time.</p>

          <p>Eighty years after the liberation of the Buchenwald concentration camp, a survivor and one of the American soldiers who helped free him have met for the first time. Andrew Roth, a Hungarian Jew who survived both Auschwitz and Buchenwald, and Jack Moran, a U.S. Army veteran from Wisconsin, were both teenagers during the war. Their emotional meeting in Los Angeles was facilitated by the USC Shoah Foundation, which is racing to collect testimonies from the world's few remaining Holocaust survivors and witnesses to preserve their history.</p>

          <h2>DOJ Memo Indicates Plans to Aggressively Pursue Citizenship Revocation</h2>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice is prioritizing efforts to strip citizenship from naturalized Americans who have committed certain crimes, according to a new internal memo. The guidance directs federal attorneys to maximally pursue denaturalization through civil litigation, a process with a lower burden of proof and no right to a government-provided lawyer. Immigration law experts express alarm, arguing the policy creates a second class of citizenship and raises serious constitutional due process concerns, reviving a tactic used more heavily in past controversial eras.</p>
