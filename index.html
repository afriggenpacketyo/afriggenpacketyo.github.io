          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-27 09:43:23 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite headwinds from political opposition and supply chain issues, the established onshore wind industry in the U.S. continues to grow, now generating nearly 11% of the nation's electricity. As infrastructure ages, "repowering"—upgrading or replacing older turbines—is creating new business opportunities for industry leaders like GE Vernova, Vestas, and Siemens Gamesa. This repowering sidesteps some challenges associated with new projects, such as property acquisition and permitting, while increasing electricity output and extending lifecycles. Repowering also invigorates the recycling industry for decommissioned turbine components, as OEMs design 100% recyclable models to meet exponentially growing electricity demand.
