          <p>Morgan Stanley announced second-quarter financial results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, reporting earnings of $2.13 per share against a predicted $1.96. The bank's revenue increased by 12% to $16.79 billion, largely due to a significant surge in trading activity, particularly in equities. Both the institutional securities and wealth management divisions saw substantial revenue growth, highlighting the bank's strong performance across different market conditions. Despite the positive results, the company's stock experienced a slight dip following the announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump stated it is "highly unlikely" he will fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, contradicting earlier reports that he intended to do so. The speculation arose after Trump reportedly discussed the possibility with Republican lawmakers and was said to have drafted a dismissal letter. The initial news caused market volatility, which later stabilized following Trump's denial. This development occurs amid ongoing pressure from the White House for the Federal Reserve to implement significant interest rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Central Command reported that Yemeni National Resistance Forces intercepted a massive shipment of Iranian weapons bound for Houthi rebels. The seizure, described as the largest in the forces' history, included over 750 tons of munitions such as advanced missiles, drone components, and radar systems. CENTCOM officials stated that many systems were linked to a sanctioned Iranian defense company. The operation is highlighted as a critical step in curbing Iran's destabilizing influence and enhancing regional security and freedom of navigation.</p>

          <p>The mother of Kayla Hamilton, who was murdered by an MS-13 gang member, is publicly supporting the "Kayla Hamilton Act." This proposed legislation would mandate stricter vetting for Unaccompanied Alien Children (UACs) entering the U.S., including checks for criminal history and gang affiliations. The bill, introduced by Rep. Russell Fry, aims to prevent individuals who pose a public safety risk from being released into communities. Proponents argue that such measures could have prevented Hamilton's death by identifying her killer's gang ties.</p>

          <p>A major review has concluded that the UK's Prevent counter-terrorism program missed opportunities to intervene with Axel Rudakubana, who later murdered three children in Southport. The review by Lord David Anderson KC found that despite teachers referring Rudakubana three times due to his obsession with violence, his case was closed because he lacked a specific terrorist ideology. The report calls for Prevent to broaden its focus to include individuals fascinated with extreme violence, even without clear ideological motives. It also highlighted separate failings in the handling of the man who murdered MP Sir David Amess.</p>

The Justice Department's conclusion that Epstein died by suicide and that no "client list" exists has been rejected by many supporters, who now see the administration as part of a "deep state" cover-up. The article argues that the Epstein case became a sacred symbol of deep-state corruption for the movement, and Trump's attempt to dismiss it has put him on the wrong side of a conspiracy he cannot control.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer expressed a bearish outlook on Coterra Energy, the sole oil and natural gas stock in his investment club's portfolio, suggesting he is preparing to sell more shares. His concerns stem from falling oil prices and a belief that the company's operational capabilities are lacking. This sentiment was reinforced by Coterra's recent decision not to reduce its rig count in the Permian Basin as previously signaled. The discussion also touched on market reactions to President Trump's comments about potentially firing the Federal Reserve chair. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is facing scrutiny over a major data breach from February 2022, where a spreadsheet with personal details of nearly 19,000 Afghans seeking UK relocation was leaked. The breach was discovered in August 2023, prompting the government to obtain a super-injunction to prevent public disclosure. A covert relocation route was established, costing hundreds of millions of pounds, to bring those at risk to the UK. While a government review suggests the data may not have greatly increased risk, the incident has raised serious questions about security and transparency.</p>

This new conviction follows a previous sentence in 2022 for insulting election officials.
