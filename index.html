          <p>US lawmakers have released a "birthday book" given to Jeffrey Epstein for his 50th birthday, including a note allegedly signed by Donald Trump. The released documents, which include Epstein's address book and will, were subpoenaed from the estate. The alleged note features a drawing of a woman's body and text, which Trump denies writing. Republican committee chairman James Comer accused Democrats of politicizing the information, while the White House vowed to pursue litigation, as the signed note includes the line: "Happy Birthday - and may every day be another wonderful secret." The release has sparked further questions about Trump's relationship with Epstein. The context of the note remains a subject of debate. The article underscores the ongoing scrutiny surrounding Trump's past associations. </p>

The agreement resolves litigation among siblings who contested Murdoch's initial plan to install Lachlan as sole successor, with Prudence MacLeod, Elisabeth Murdoch, and James Murdoch ceasing their holdings in exchange for cash. The settlement is valued at $3.3 billion, to be split among the three siblings, with new trusts established for Lachlan and Rupert's younger daughters. This succession solidifies the conservative direction of Fox News. The article highlights the power dynamics within the Murdoch family and the future of the media empire. </p>
