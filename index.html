          <p>The United Kingdom is enduring its third heatwave of the year, with amber heat health alerts active for several regions in England due to potential health risks. While temperatures are expected to cool down soon, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales all registered their warmest day of the year. The extreme heat has led to hosepipe bans for millions and contributed to wildfire warnings in Scotland and an active blaze in Surrey.</p>

          <p>A new study analyzing data from two existing upstream dams in Tibet indicates that China's controversial new mega-dam project may not cause the water crisis in India that many have feared. The research found that water flows downstream actually increased by over 50% during the dry season, suggesting the dams help regulate water levels. This finding provides a new perspective on a significant geopolitical and environmental issue between the two nations.</p>
