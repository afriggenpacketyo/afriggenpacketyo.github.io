          <p>Approximately 17,000 people have been evacuated from Manitoba, Canada, due to rapidly spreading wildfires, with additional evacuations ordered in Saskatchewan. Military aircraft and helicopters are being used to evacuate residents from remote areas, while firefighters struggle to contain the growing flames. Hot and dry weather conditions are expected to persist, exacerbating the situation, and smoke from the fires has spread across Canada and into parts of the US.

          <p>The UK's upcoming defense review will send a "message to Moscow" by outlining plans to deter "growing Russian aggression," according to Defence Secretary John Healey. The review is expected to conclude that the UK faces a "new era of threat" and will commit £1.5 billion to build new munitions factories. Healey highlighted the increasing cyber attacks from Russia on UK military networks, emphasizing the need to strengthen the armed forces and industrial base. The government also plans to procure long-range weapons and establish a new "cyber and electromagnetic command" to enhance defensive and offensive cyber capabilities.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have created an infrared contact lens that enables humans to see in the dark by converting infrared light into visible light. The lens combines conventional soft contact lenses with nanoparticles made of gold, sodium gadolinium fluoride, ytterbium, and erbium ions. While the resulting images are somewhat blurred due to light scattering, the lens allows users to recognize patterns and signals in the dark, even with closed eyes. The technology could have applications in surgical procedures, encryption, and rescue operations, although some critics argue that night vision devices are more effective.</p>
