          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter has unveiled a new, alternate cover for her upcoming album, "Man's Best Friend," which she humorously described as "approved by God." This decision follows significant online criticism of the original cover art, which some users found to be dehumanizing and tone-deaf. In recent interviews, Carpenter has addressed the intense scrutiny female artists face regarding their creative choices, from song lyrics to fashion. She defended her artistic expression, stating that she embraces her femininity and that her stage outfits help her feel comfortable while performing, despite occasional criticism from the public.</p>

          <p>North Carolina Republican Senator Thom Tillis has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026, a decision that came hours after former President Trump threatened to support a primary challenger against him. The conflict arose from Tillis's opposition to Trump's major spending and tax package, dubbed the "big, beautiful bill," due to concerns about its cuts to Medicaid. In his retirement statement, Tillis lamented the decline of bipartisanship and independent thinking in Washington, stating it has become an "endangered species." His departure opens up a key Senate seat in a state that has reliably voted Republican in recent presidential elections.</p>

          <p>NBA free agent Malik Beasley is currently under federal investigation for allegations related to gambling on league games. The U.S. district attorney's office is handling the probe, which is believed to focus on the 2023-24 season when Beasley played for the Milwaukee Bucks. The NBA has confirmed it is cooperating with the investigation. This inquiry follows other recent gambling-related scandals in the league, including the lifetime ban of Jontay Porter for betting activities.

          <p>Two tropical storms, Barry and Flossie, have formed on opposite coasts of Mexico, threatening to bring several days of heavy rainfall to the region. Tropical Storm Barry, the second named storm of the Atlantic season, is located off the country's southeast coast and is expected to make landfall soon. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Flossie has formed in the Pacific off the southwest coast. Forecasters predict Flossie will strengthen into a hurricane but is likely to remain offshore, though it will still cause significant rainfall across several Mexican states.

The wave of selling coincides with the stock reaching new highs, up over 17% this year despite concerns about potential sales curbs. CEO Jensen Huang has been a significant seller, offloading about $15 million worth of shares as part of a pre-announced plan to sell up to 6 million shares. This activity comes as Nvidia briefly regained its status as the world's most valuable company, fueled by strong investor confidence in its AI and robotics opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>

The BBC, which broadcast the set live, called the comments "deeply offensive" and announced the performance would not be available on its iPlayer service.

          <p>An opinion article argues that the United States is dangerously vulnerable to China's dominance in the rare earth minerals market, which is foundational to modern technology and defense. The author contends that for over 15 years, successive U.S. administrations have failed to address this dependency, allowing Beijing to weaponize its control over the supply chain. Recent Chinese export controls are cited as a clear sign of this leverage. The piece calls for a coherent, long-term national strategy that treats critical minerals as instruments of geopolitical power, urging the U.S. to build a complete, independent supply chain with reliable allies.

He highlighted projected cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs, warning it would strip 16 million people of health coverage and harm rural hospitals. Warner asserted that the bill prioritizes tax breaks for the wealthy at the expense of essential services and adds trillions to the national debt, predicting it will ultimately backfire on Republicans.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has threatened to cut federal funding to New York City if democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani wins the upcoming mayoral election. In a Fox News interview, Trump referred to Mamdani as a "pure communist" and stated that if elected, Mamdani would have to "do the right thing" or risk losing federal money. Mamdani, who recently won the Democratic primary, denied being a communist but reaffirmed his platform of raising taxes on the wealthy, stating, "I donâ€™t think that we should have billionaires." He emphasized that his focus is on creating a fairer city for all residents.</p>

          <p>The highly anticipated reunion tour for the iconic British band Oasis is set to begin this week, with their first performance scheduled at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff. The announcement of the tour last summer caused a frenzy among fans, leading to a rapid sell-out of tickets and some criticism over the sales process. For those who couldn't secure tickets, the BBC is offering a special livestream, "Oasis: Countdown to the Comeback," which will feature live coverage, special guests, and fan reactions from Cardiff. This week also sees the release of the new film "Jurassic World Rebirth" and the second season of "The Sandman."</p>

          <p>A new scam is targeting drivers in Atlanta, where teens known as "water boys" who sell bottled water at intersections are allegedly exploiting digital payment apps to steal large sums of money. Victims report that after agreeing to a small purchase, they handed their phones to the sellers, who then used apps like Cash App to transfer hundreds or even thousands of dollars. In some cases, QR codes were used to bypass security verifications, and one incident escalated to a carjacking. Authorities and experts are warning the public to be cautious, advising against handing over phones and to verify all digital transaction details themselves.</p>

          <p>The victory of Zohran Mamdani, an outspoken critic of Israel, in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary highlights a significant ideological shift within the party. His win in America's most Jewish city suggests that a critical stance on Israel is no longer a disqualifying factor for many Democratic voters, particularly younger progressives. The outcome reflects growing dismay over Israel's conduct in the Gaza war and a rejection of the notion that anti-Israel sentiment is inherently antisemitic. While some in the Jewish community express alarm, many others, including Jewish voters who supported Mamdani, prioritized issues like affordability over traditional positions on foreign policy.</p>

          <p>An intense, early-summer heatwave is sweeping across Europe, shattering temperature records and putting health services on high alert. In Spain, temperatures soared to a new June record of 46Â°C (114.8Â°F), while Italy placed 21 cities, including Rome and Venice, on high alert. The extreme heat is expected to persist, with London predicted to reach 35Â°C. Meteorologists attribute the increasing frequency and intensity of these heatwaves to human-driven climate change.

          <p>As heatwaves become more common, animal welfare experts are issuing urgent pleas for dog owners to take precautions to prevent heat-related illness, which can be fatal for canines. The RSPCA notes that dogs are more likely to suffer from overheating during exercise than from being left in hot cars. Key signs of heatstroke include heavy panting, lethargy, and excessive drooling. Owners are advised to avoid walks during the hottest parts of the day, check pavement temperatures, and provide plenty of cool water. If a dog shows signs of distress, it should be moved to a cool area and have cool water poured over its body before being taken to a vet immediately.</p>

          <p>The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Mariano Grossi, has stated that Iran could restart its uranium enrichment activities in "a matter of months." This assessment follows recent U.S. military strikes on three of Iran's nuclear facilities. While U.S. officials claimed the sites were "obliterated," Grossi indicated the damage was severe but not total, and that Iran retains the knowledge and industrial capacity to rebuild. He stressed the importance of resuming diplomatic talks and allowing IAEA inspectors back into the country to monitor the situation, highlighting that military action alone cannot definitively solve the issue.</p>

This development comes after the U.S. government ordered TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell its American operations last year due to national security concerns over user data.
