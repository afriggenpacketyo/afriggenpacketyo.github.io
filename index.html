          <p>A sake brewery in southwestern Japan, Fujii Shuzo, is offering a five-day seminar for foreign sommeliers to teach traditional sake-making techniques, which recently were added to UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage list. The course, organized by the British-based Sake Sommelier Academy, aims to broaden awareness and appreciation of sake outside Japan. Toru Fujii, the brewery's head, hopes that opening up to international participants will boost exports, particularly to Europe, as domestic sake consumption declines due to the rise of other alcoholic beverages. This initiative is viewed as a way to increase the value of Japanese sake globally. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An audio clip from President Biden's 2023 interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur has been released, revealing moments where Biden struggled to recall key dates, including the year of his son's death and the start of Trump's presidency. The release follows a transcript issued in 2024, which led Republicans to demand the audio, claiming it could show a decline in Biden's mental sharpness. While the Trump administration plans to release the full interview, the Biden administration had previously blocked the audio's release, citing executive privilege and potential hindrances to future investigations. This development occurs amidst ongoing concerns about Biden's health and his ability to run for re-election, with Democrats grappling with new revelations about his condition while in office.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that the United States will address the situation in Gaza, acknowledging that "a lot of people are starving" in the besieged Palestinian territory. His comments came after concluding a tour of Arab nations, including Qatar, which is a key partner in ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas. Trump's remarks follow warnings from UN agencies about dwindling supplies of food, fuel, and medicine in Gaza, which has been under blockade for over two months. This statement contrasts with Israel's repeated denials of a humanitarian crisis, which is why this statement is significant as it goes against the narrative that Israel has been trying to push.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation after posting an image on Instagram that was interpreted by some as a call for violence against President Trump. The image showed seashells arranged to form the numbers "86 47," which some officials believed referred to Trump's status as the 47th president and the slang term "eighty-six," meaning "remove." Comey deleted the image and claimed he didn't realize the numbers' association with violence. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated the post is under investigation, while Trump called it "a terrible thing" and Comey a "dirty cop."</p>

          <p>The Chicago area experienced a rare dust storm, leading to significantly reduced visibility on several Interstate highways and ground stops at Midway and O'Hare International Airports. The National Weather Service reported wind gusts reaching over 70 miles per hour, with some areas experiencing "mud rain" due to simultaneous showers and storms. The dust storm, combined with warm, windy conditions and low humidity, prompted a Wind Advisory and Red Flag Warning for high fire danger. While cooler, dry weather is expected this weekend, a rainy pattern is forecasted to return next week, with potential rainfall totals of 1 to 1.5 inches.</p>

          <p>A bronze sculpture of Melania Trump, located near her hometown of Sevnica, Slovenia, has been stolen. Police are investigating the theft, which residents speculate could be an act of vandalism or a means to melt the statue down for cash. The statue, which replaced a wooden version that was set on fire in 2020, had not been well-received by locals. The original wooden statue was commissioned by an American artist as an interrogation of President Trump’s harsh stance on immigration. Residents of Sevnica generally did not miss the statue, finding it unappealing and even embarrassing.</p>

          <p>As the Democratic Party faces record low approval ratings, several top Democrats are attempting to reposition themselves by expressing their doubts about President Biden's fitness for office during the 2024 campaign. Figures like Senator Chris Murphy and Representative Ro Khanna, who previously vouched for Biden's capabilities, now admit to recognizing his cognitive decline. Some officials complain that White House aides kept Biden isolated as his condition worsened, while others argue that the focus on Biden's condition overlooks the Harris campaign's shortcomings. This shift is creating potential divisions within the party as candidates vie for influence in the upcoming 2028 presidential primary.</p>

Additionally, lawmakers from high-tax states are objecting to the proposed cap on local tax deductions, creating further divisions within the party.

          <p>After a wildfire devastated Palisades Charter High School's newsroom, Temple University's sports media center offered assistance, resulting in a university paper featuring articles by the high school students. The insert included articles on price gouging after the wildfire and the school's return to in-person lessons, as well as poems and drawings by students from Pasadena Rosebud Academy, which was also destroyed in the fire. The project aimed to give students a focus after the tragedy and provide them with a platform to share their community's experience. The collaboration was particularly meaningful as it involved people from across the country supporting the students.</p>
