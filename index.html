          <h2>House Republicans Retreat from Aggressive Medicaid Cuts Amid Party Divisions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 14:39:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson has backtracked on aggressive Medicaid cuts initially considered by House Republicans to fund President Trump's domestic agenda, highlighting deep divisions within the party. Facing pressure from moderate Republicans, Johnson ruled out reducing federal payments to states for working-age adults eligible through the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion and changing the federal payment structure to a flat fee per person. This decision underscores the difficulty Republicans face in achieving their spending cut targets while maintaining enough votes to pass legislation. The move has drawn criticism from ultraconservative Republicans, who argue for deeper cuts to Obamacare programs to fund Trump's tax and spending plans.</p>

          <p>Actor Michael Pitt, known for his role in "Boardwalk Empire," was arrested and indicted in Brooklyn on charges including sexual abuse, criminal sex act, assault, and strangulation. The charges stem from alleged incidents in 2020 and 2021, with the indictment detailing multiple instances of alleged sexual abuse and assault against an unnamed individual. Pitt pleaded not guilty and was released until his next court date in June. His attorney asserts the charges are baseless and stem from a consensual relationship, claiming exonerating evidence will lead to the case's dismissal.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration, through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is planning to eliminate dozens of National Park Service grants, many of which are linked to climate change and diversity initiatives. The cuts, detailed in an internal agency document, aim to save $26 million by canceling grants to universities, state historic preservation offices, tribes, and youth corps. Programs targeted include climate resiliency studies, watershed protection efforts, and projects promoting diversity and inclusion. Critics argue these cuts are penny-wise and pound-foolish, sacrificing valuable knowledge and expertise while saving very little money.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company is increasing prices on three vehicle models produced in Mexico, citing higher U.S. tariffs on imported vehicles as a contributing factor. The price increases, affecting the Maverick, Bronco Sport, and Mach-E, will be up to $2,000 per model and apply to vehicles built after May 2. Ford expects a $1.5 billion hit to its operating profit from tariffs this year, although it is absorbing some of the tariff-related costs rather than passing the entire burden onto consumers. The Trump administration imposed a 25% tariff on vehicles assembled abroad in March.</p>

          <p>According to a higher education expert, interest rates on federal direct undergraduate loans could decrease slightly to 6.39% for the 2025-2026 academic year, compared to the current 6.53%. Graduate student loans are also expected to see a similar decrease, with rates potentially falling to 7.94% from the current 8.08%. These rates, set annually by the government, are based on the May auction of the 10-year Treasury note.

          <p>An article examines the origins of the "woke right" movement, which counters left-wing illiberalism with similar tactics of identity grievance and tribal striving. It argues that this movement predates the woke left, citing Pat Buchanan's 2011 book, "Suicide of a Superpower," as an early example. The article highlights Buchanan's emphasis on white identity and his critiques of liberal policies, drawing parallels to Trump's later political strategies. The analysis suggests that the woke right is not simply a backlash to wokeism but has deeper roots in right-wing thought.</p>

          <p>The deadline for travelers to show Real ID-compliant identification for domestic flights has arrived, but enforcement is limited, with Homeland Security focusing on immigration rather than safety provision. Despite warnings about potential delays, the TSA is advising travelers they will need a Real ID-compliant license or another accepted form of identification for future flights, but are not strictly enforcing the requirement now. This lack of enforcement suggests the administration's primary interest is in immigration control, using the Real ID deadline as a threat to those who may not qualify due to their immigration status.</p>

          <p>Stephen Curry will miss at least the next three games of the Golden State Warriors' playoff series against Minnesota due to a strained hamstring. The injury occurred during Game 1, where Curry scored 13 points in 13 minutes before leaving the court. The Warriors will have to navigate the series without their star player, relying on other players like Jimmy Butler, Buddy Hield, and Draymond Green. Curry's earliest return is projected to be Game 5 on May 14.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have approved an amendment that authorizes the sale of thousands of acres of federal public land in Nevada and Utah, states where the federal government owns a significant portion of the land. The proposed land sales or exchanges are primarily aimed at building affordable housing near Las Vegas, Reno, and St. George, Utah. Supporters argue that the high percentage of federal lands impacts local governments' ability to manage resources and promote economic development. Democrats and environmentalists criticize the amendment as part of a broader effort to transfer federal public lands to private entities.</p>

          <p>Chinese officials have stated that the upcoming meeting in Switzerland between U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his Chinese counterpart was requested by the Trump administration. China asserts it will enter the talks firmly opposed to U.S. tariff hikes and willing to participate only in a dialogue based on equality, respect, and mutual benefit. President Trump appeared to dispute China's characterization, declining to comment on whether he remained confident in reaching a deal. China currently faces a 145% tariff rate on goods bound for the United States.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve pausing interest rates, prospective home equity borrowers have more time to analyze their options between a home equity loan and a home equity line of credit (HELOC). While home equity loans were traditionally better during rate pauses due to their fixed rates, the current climate suggests a HELOC may be more advantageous. The likelihood of a Fed rate cut in the near future and the lower average interest rates of HELOCs make them a cheaper borrowing option. Borrowers should carefully consider their ability to manage variable rates before choosing a HELOC.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's decision to hold its benchmark rate steady could influence mortgage rates, although the Fed doesn't directly set them. While the rate pause may create favorable conditions for mortgage rates to decline, they are primarily influenced by the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note and various economic factors. Inflation trends, economic growth, investor sentiment, and global uncertainty all play a role in shaping mortgage rates. Prospective homebuyers and homeowners should stay informed, improve their credit scores, and shop around for the best mortgage rates.</p>
