          <p>EU leaders have issued a strong statement asserting that Ukraine's internationally recognized borders should not be changed through military aggression. This declaration highlights growing European anxiety over Russia's actions, particularly in nations with a history of Soviet occupation. The statement pledges continued military and financial support for Ukraine's self-defense and its path toward EU membership. However, Hungary notably dissented from the joint declaration, with its leader advocating for a separate EU-Russia summit.</p>

          <p>Crypto company Circle Internet Group reported a 53% year-over-year revenue increase to $658.1 million, largely due to a 90% growth in the circulation of its USDC stablecoin. Despite this, the company posted a net loss of $482.1 million, primarily from non-cash charges related to its recent IPO. CEO Jeremy Allaire expressed confidence, citing surging interest from major financial institutions following the passage of new crypto legislation.

          <p>Amid market volatility and inflation, many retirees are considering annuities for a stable income source. This article examines the safety of annuities, noting that their security depends on the financial strength of the issuing insurance company, not FDIC backing. It advises checking insurer ratings and highlights that state guarantee associations offer limited protection. The piece also explains how different annuity types carry varying risks and how inflation can erode the purchasing power of fixed payments over time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has intensified his pressure on the Federal Reserve, threatening a "major lawsuit" against Chairman Jerome Powell and demanding an immediate interest rate cut. In a social media post, Trump criticized Powell's handling of Fed building renovations and called him a "loser," blaming him for incalculable economic damage. This represents a significant escalation in the president's ongoing public campaign to influence the central bank's monetary policy. The Fed has so far held rates steady in 2025, defying Trump's demands for rapid cuts.</p>

These satellites are intended to power cellular-based broadband networks directly to standard mobile phones. The company plans to launch satellites every one to two months to build out its constellation for service in the U.S., Europe, and Japan.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice is moving to sanction a California-based lawyer, Joshua Schroeder, who attempted to block his client's deportation. This action is seen as part of the Trump administration's broader effort to crack down on immigration attorneys and pursue mass deportations. The DOJ's motion accuses Schroeder of making "meritless contentions" and seeks substantial monetary penalties. Advocates warn this move could be an attempt to intimidate lawyers and weaponize the justice system against those challenging the administration's immigration agenda.</p>

          <p>Israeli forces have launched intense air attacks on residential areas in Gaza City as they prepare for a ground occupation, according to the territory's civil defense agency. The bombardment has caused massive destruction, trapping residents and preventing the recovery of casualties. Concurrently, the UK, EU, and other allies issued a joint statement demanding immediate action to allow aid into Gaza, warning that "famine is unfolding." Israel denies there is starvation, blaming UN agencies for failing to distribute aid that has crossed the border.</p>

          <p>E.J. Antoni, President Trump's nominee to head the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), has suggested the agency should consider suspending its influential monthly jobs report. Antoni, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, criticized the report as flawed due to subsequent data revisions. He proposed that the BLS should instead rely on "more accurate, though less timely, quarterly data" until the monthly methodology is fixed. This controversial suggestion follows Trump's firing of the previous commissioner over a jobs report he found disappointing.</p>

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's executive order to seize control of Washington, D.C.'s police force explains the legal basis and constraints of this action. The 1974 Home Rule Act grants the president authority to federalize the city's police during a self-declared emergency, a power D.C.'s mayor acknowledges is difficult to contest. However, the same law explicitly limits this presidential control to a maximum of 30 days unless extended by Congress. The article notes that while Trump's claim of a crime "emergency" is questionable, the courts are likely to uphold his initial authority but should strictly enforce the 30-day time limit.</p>

          <p>California Ranch Foods, a food processing plant in Vernon, has pleaded guilty to misdemeanor workplace safety violations following a 2020 nitrogen gas leak that killed two employees. As part of a plea deal, the company will pay over $6 million, which includes a $1 million criminal fine, a $4 million donation to food banks, and $1.6 million in safety improvements. An investigation by Cal/OSHA found the workers suffocated after entering a cold room where a rusted, non-functional alarm failed to warn them of the lethal, oxygen-displacing leak.</p>

          <p>Former world No. 1 tennis player Monica Seles has publicly disclosed that she was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis, a chronic neuromuscular disease, three years ago. The nine-time Grand Slam champion decided to share her story to raise awareness, explaining that symptoms like double vision and muscle weakness affect her daily life. Seles, 51, described the diagnosis as another "hard reset" in a life that has included moving to the U.S. as a child and surviving a stabbing incident in 1993. She emphasized that she is adapting to her "new normal."</p>

          <p>Former Las Vegas Raiders coach Jon Gruden has won a significant victory in his lawsuit against the NFL and Commissioner Roger Goodell. The Nevada Supreme Court ruled 5-2 that Gruden cannot be forced into the NFL's internal arbitration process, which would be overseen by Goodell, a defendant in the case. The court found that because Gruden was a former employee when the dispute arose, the arbitration clause in the NFL Constitution was inapplicable. This decision clears the way for Gruden's lawsuit, which alleges a "malicious campaign" to leak his old emails and destroy his career, to proceed in open court.</p>

The Georgia Bureau of Investigation revealed that documents found at White's home expressed discontent with COVID-19 vaccinations. The slain officer, David Rose, was a 33-year-old Marine veteran who had recently graduated from the police academy.

          <p>The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for July showed that core inflation, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.3% for the month and 3.1% annually, its highest level in six months. This acceleration is stoking concerns that President Trump's tariffs are increasingly being passed on to consumers, with prices for goods like footwear and furniture showing notable increases. While overall headline inflation held steady at 2.7% due to lower gas prices, the persistent rise in the core metric complicates the Federal Reserve's path for potential interest rate cuts.

In a social media post, Trump claimed the bank was wrong about negative market repercussions and told Solomon he should "focus on being a DJ" instead of running a major financial institution. The criticism refers to a Goldman forecast from earlier in the year that predicted a potential recession, a call the bank quickly retracted after the administration paused some tariffs.</p>

          <p>The initial public offering (IPO) market has delivered powerful returns since the stock market's low point in early April, with the Renaissance IPO ETF surging nearly 50%. This performance has almost doubled the gains of the broader S&P 500 index over the same period, fueled by investor enthusiasm for AI and crypto-related companies like Coreweave and Circle. Analysts suggest this resurgence is reminiscent of a post-financial crisis rebound rather than the "crazy levels" of the 2020-2021 boom. Strong debuts from a few key companies have accelerated the timeline for other firms waiting to go public. (not investment advice)</p>
