The US is reportedly considering a proposal that would involve territorial concessions from Ukraine in exchange for a halt to the invasion. This intensified effort reflects the US's desire to find a resolution to the conflict, but the complex political landscape and conflicting demands make a breakthrough challenging. </p>
