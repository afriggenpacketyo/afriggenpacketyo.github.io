          <p>Senator Chuck Schumer is calling for a full inspector general investigation into the FAA due to ongoing disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport, which have included numerous delays and cancellations impacting hundreds of flights. Governor Phil Murphy has described the situation as unacceptable, raising concerns about the airport's ability to handle summer flight volumes. Schumer attributes the problems to air traffic controller shortages, FAA cuts, outdated technology, and depleting federal funds, noting that air traffic controllers have warned the FAA about these issues. United Airlines is cutting 35 roundtrip flights daily at Newark due to the chaos, and the FAA has instituted a "flow constrained area" to manage the situation.</p>

          <p>The Department of Education is resuming collections on defaulted federal student loans, ending a nearly five-year pause that began during the COVID-19 pandemic. A recent analysis shows delinquency rates among student loan borrowers are at an all-time high, with approximately 20% at risk of defaulting. Borrowers in default could face wage garnishment, withheld Social Security benefits, and damaged credit scores, with some seeing credit scores drop by as much as 175 points. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon stated that taxpayers should no longer serve as collateral for irresponsible student loan policies.</p>

A TransUnion analysis found that consumers facing default have seen their credit scores drop by an average of 63 points, with super prime borrowers experiencing declines of up to 175 points. Experts warn that the impact of default can be dramatic and immediate, making it harder for borrowers to obtain credit and potentially leading to higher interest rates on loans.

          <p>A shifting perception of the United States amid President Trump’s trade war is prompting Europeans to pivot decisively away from U.S. goods and services, according to a new assessment by the European Central Bank. European consumers are starting to avoid U.S. products and services in what appears to be a decisive and potentially long-term shift away from buying American. The E.C.B. study found that even households that could bear the brunt of higher prices were moving away from U.S. goods, and that consumers’ reactions may not just be a temporary response to tariff increases, but instead signal a possible long-term structural shift in consumer preferences away from U.S. products and brands.</p>

          <p>Zhao Xintong is on the verge of becoming the first player from China to win the World Snooker Championship, leading Mark Williams 17-8 in the final. Zhao, aiming to be the first amateur to triumph at the Crucible, extended his overnight lead and is just one frame away from victory. Williams briefly rallied to ensure the contest would extend to the evening, but Zhao capitalized on missed shots to move closer to a historic win. Zhao, who previously won the UK Championship, is hoping to join a select group of qualifiers to capture snooker's biggest prize.</p>

          <p>The Murdoch press no longer holds the sway over Australian elections it once did, with its consistent support for the Coalition failing to yield discernible impact since 2010. The decline is part of a wider trend of waning influence for mainstream media, as people increasingly access news from diverse sources. Trust in news is rising, but those who trust news are more likely to pay for it, and they also pay a higher price. The most trusted outlets are ABC and SBS, while News Corporation outlets rank lower. Belief in the power of the Murdoch press has been a bit of an excuse for progressives, who have spent far too much time railing against its excesses.</p>

A $1.5 million-per-plate fundraiser, hosted by MAGA Inc., features special guest David Sacks, who has been helping to rewrite crypto and AI rules. Additionally, a gala dinner at Trump National will offer access to Trump's inner circle to holders of the $TRUMP token, with entry based on a blockchain-based contest. The crypto community has cheered Trump-aligned appointees with a sweeping policy shift that's already delivered a spate of regulatory wins across multiple federal agencies.</p>

The party, after gaining control of ten councils, intends to prevent councils from displaying pride flags as well. Critics argue that this move undermines Britain's history of supporting allies against dictators, particularly during VE Day commemorations.

          <p>Israel's security cabinet has approved plans for an escalation of the military campaign in Gaza, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declaring that victory against Hamas will come from an even bigger barrage of military might in the weeks ahead. The campaign calls for “the expanding and the holding of territories” in Gaza by Israeli soldiers for an indefinite period of time, and Israeli officials say the understanding was that the Israeli military would move to capture more territory beyond what it was already holding. Two reservists who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to make comments to the news media said that they had received call-up orders beginning in June. A full-blown occupation would almost certainly spur international objections, as would the forced relocation of Palestinians from their homes in the north.</p>

But it’s another thing if you can actually get an official ID when you have some kind of nefarious intent. While the deadline is May 7, 2025, the enforcement might be “phased.”</p>
