          <p>China's ambassador to the UN, Fu Cong, accused the United States of fabricating lies to justify seeking control over the Panama Canal, reiterating China's commitment to the canal's permanent neutrality and Panama's sovereignty. This strong condemnation followed remarks by acting US ambassador Dorothy Shea, who expressed concerns about China's "outsized influence" over the canal's critical infrastructure and port operations, labeling it a potential threat to global trade and security. The exchange underscores growing diplomatic tensions between the two global powers, with the US having previously made unsubstantiated claims about secret Chinese control. Both nations are urged to seriously reflect on their roles and responsibilities in maintaining global stability.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani and his agent, Nez Balelo, are facing a lawsuit from a Hawaii real estate investor and broker who allege they were unjustly fired from a $240 million luxury housing development. The plaintiffs claim Ohtani and Balelo leveraged their celebrity influence to destabilize and dismantle their role in the project, which they initiated and brought Ohtani in to endorse. The suit accuses the defendants of tortious interference and unjust enrichment, arguing that Balelo's escalating demands led to their removal by a business partner, resulting in millions of dollars in lost compensation. This legal dispute brings to light the complexities and potential pitfalls of high-stakes celebrity endorsement deals in the real estate sector.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK job market is experiencing a gradual slowdown, with official figures from the Office for National Statistics indicating a 5.8% drop in job openings across most industries between May and July. This suggests that some companies are either not recruiting new workers or are not replacing those who have left, contributing to a cooling trend. Despite this, the slowdown is less sharp than some economists anticipated, with average wage growth remaining at 5% and the unemployment rate stable. The article also notes the impact of recent increases in the National Living Wage and employer National Insurance contributions on the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States Coast Guard has officially suspended its search for a missing fisherman after a 40-foot vessel, the Das Bug, capsized off the Oregon coast. The incident occurred in challenging conditions, including 7-foot swells and strong winds, leading to all four crew members being thrown into the water. While three individuals were successfully rescued by Coast Guard crews and treated for hypothermia, extensive search efforts over eight hours and 54 square miles failed to locate the fourth fisherman. This difficult decision leaves thoughts with the family and loved ones during this incredibly trying time.</p>

The resort remains committed to its S$6.8 billion expansion and investment plans, having already opened new attractions like Minion Land and the Singapore Oceanarium in 2025. Lee emphasized a strategic shift towards experiences over shopping, aiming to transform the resort into a premium lifestyle destination with future launches including Super Nintendo World.</p>

          <p>The parents of Harvey Willgoose, a 15-year-old schoolboy who was fatally stabbed by a fellow pupil, are advocating for the lifting of an anonymity order protecting his 15-year-old killer's identity. Harvey's mother, Caroline, expressed that her son's name was unfairly "tarnished" during the trial, while the perpetrator remains unnamed, prompting their demand for equal disclosure. Beyond this, the grieving parents are campaigning for enhanced school safety measures, specifically the installation of knife arches, and comprehensive education on the devastating consequences of knife crime. A decision on the anonymity order is anticipated during the killer's sentencing in October.</p>

The joint statement, from which Hungary notably abstained, underscored that a just and lasting peace must fully respect international law, including the principles of independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, and that borders must not be altered by force. This collective European stance reflects deep concerns that Trump might propose territorial concessions, which would effectively reward Russian aggression.

This prolonged pause is intended to facilitate further negotiations focused on rectifying trade imbalances, addressing alleged unfair trade practices, and increasing market access for US exporters. Despite the temporary relief, some business owners voice concerns about the persistent uncertainty that continues to hinder long-term planning. (not investment advice)</p>

Workers interviewed described appalling conditions, including grueling 18-hour workdays with minimal safety equipment, and strict confinement to construction sites under the constant surveillance of North Korean security agents. The vast majority of their earnings are confiscated by the North Korean state as "loyalty fees," with the small remainder withheld until their return home, a tactic designed to prevent defections. This deployment of labor is a direct violation of UN sanctions, with Russia reportedly using student visas as a loophole, and some workers may even be deployed to Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories for reconstruction.</p>

Patients who received this implant have experienced severe pain, immobility, and even addiction to painkillers, primarily due to the device slipping out of place, often requiring a second corrective operation. Concerns about the implant's performance were initially raised by the National Joint Registry in 2014 and by individual surgeons from 2016, but the manufacturer, Zimmer Biomet, was criticized for its reluctance to acknowledge the widespread problem. This issue has led to significant health complications for patients and is projected to incur millions of pounds in costs for the NHS.</p>

          <p>During a trial challenging the legality of President Trump's controversial deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles, Major General Scott Sherman testified that he personally never heard the term "rebellion" used to characterize the protests, despite its inclusion in Trump's executive order justifying the action. The lawsuit, initiated by California Governor Gavin Newsom, argues that the deployment potentially violated the 19th-century Posse Comitatus Act, which generally prohibits the military from enforcing domestic laws. Sherman's testimony further indicated that military support was considered necessary for protecting federal facilities and personnel, even in situations where no active physical threats were assessed, raising broader questions about the criteria for such federalized deployments.</p>

          <p>Colombian Senator Miguel Uribe Turbay, a 39-year-old presidential hopeful, has tragically died two months after being shot three times at a political rally in Bogota. His death painfully recalls the dark chapters of drug-fueled political violence in Colombia during the 1990s, a period that also claimed the life of his mother. While a teenage suspect was arrested at the scene, the identity of those who ordered the assassination remains unknown, prompting urgent calls for a thorough investigation and justice. Uribe, a prominent critic of the current government, symbolized hope for many, and his assassination has deeply alarmed Colombians, leading to heightened security for opposition politicians and underscoring the persistent challenges to political stability.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a frustrating 7-4 defeat to the Angels, marked by a poor performance from pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who allowed six runs in under five innings. This loss, combined with the team's recent offensive inconsistencies and struggles, has seen their National League West lead dwindle to a mere one game over the surging San Diego Padres. The Dodgers' record has fallen to 12-19 since early July, indicating a significant downturn. Manager Dave Roberts acknowledged the pressing need for increased urgency from the team, as their aspirations for a more straightforward and enjoyable title defense this season appear increasingly elusive.</p>

          <p>Nepal is implementing a new initiative to waive permit fees for 97 of its Himalayan mountains for the next two years, with the strategic goal of stimulating tourism in its more remote and less developed Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces. This policy stands in contrast to the rising permit fees for Mount Everest, which are set to increase to $15,000 during peak season. While mountaineering is a substantial revenue generator for Nepal, the historically low interest in these remote peaks suggests underlying infrastructure and accessibility challenges. The move also complements a proposed law that would require Everest aspirants to first summit a 7,000m peak, potentially positioning these newly accessible mountains as ideal training grounds.</p>
