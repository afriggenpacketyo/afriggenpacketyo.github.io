          <p>President Trump met with House Speaker Mike Johnson and Republican holdouts to address issues with the "One Big, Beautiful Bill Act." The meeting aimed to unify the GOP around the bill, which includes changes to Medicaid, state and local tax deductions, SNAP food assistance, and immigration policy. Holdouts are concerned about the bill's impact on the national deficit, while leadership emphasizes the bill's spending cuts. The White House released a letter urging passage, framing failure as a betrayal of promises. Optimism remains uncertain as negotiations continue.</p>

          <p>News of former President Joseph Biden's advanced prostate cancer has revived long-standing questions about the benefits versus the harms of a blood test that screens for the most commonly diagnosed cancer among men in the U.S.  Elevated PSA can be a marker for cancer. It also can signal a false positive or an inactive cancer, triggering a painful biopsy, and leading to overtreatment with punishing side effects, including impotence, incontinence and bowel dysfunction. A new era in prostate-cancer screening has arrived, Seibert believes. Today, instead of men immediately having their prostates biopsied when they get an elevated PSA test, he and an increasing number of prostate-cancer specialists recommend first getting an MRI and, when possible, watching and waiting.</p>

          <p>ICE officials and a prison contractor have refused to grant a contact visit between Mahmoud Khalil and his family, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, denying him the chance to hold his newborn son. The boy was born last month while Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student and Palestinian activist, remained in ICE custody in Louisiana. The ACLU said the refusal by ICE and the prison contractor GEO Group came after multiple requests from Khalil's legal team pointing to federal policies that encourage contact visits between children and their detained parents. Officials, they said, cited "a blanket no-contact visitation policy at the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center (CLIPC) and unspecified 'security concerns' relating to the presence of a mother and newborn baby in an unsecure part of the facility."</p>

          <p>Prosecutors in Florida are investigating the Hope Florida Foundation, a charity tied to Casey DeSantis, after it gave $10 million to political committees supporting Gov. Ron DeSantis. The nature of the investigation is unclear, but it follows scrutiny of the foundation's spending, including a $10 million contribution from a Medicaid contractor. Republican lawmakers have alleged potential conspiracy to commit money laundering and wire fraud.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Attacks on South Africa Echo His Own Use of Eminent Domain</h2>

          <p>President Trump criticized South Africa's land seizures from white farmers, falsely accusing the government of persecution. However, during his first term, Trump used eminent domain to take land for his border wall. This article highlights the hypocrisy of Trump's position, noting that he himself embraced the power of eminent domain as a developer and president. It contrasts Trump's claims with the experiences of farmers in South Texas who had their land seized for the wall.</p>

          <h2>Republicans Push Sweeping Domestic Policy Bill Amid Internal Divisions</h2>

          <p>Republicans are pushing for a House vote on a sweeping domestic policy bill to enact President Trump's agenda, but face internal divisions. The legislation would cut taxes, increase military and immigration enforcement spending, and slash health, nutrition, education, and clean energy programs. Major sticking points include the state and local tax deduction, Medicaid cuts, and ending clean energy programs. Democrats have criticized the bill for prioritizing tax cuts for the wealthy at the expense of social programs.</p>
