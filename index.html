          <p>President Trump has reignited trade tensions by threatening a 50% tariff on all goods from the European Union and a 25% tariff on iPhones not manufactured in the United States. These threats come ahead of trade talks with the EU, which Trump claims has been "very difficult to deal with." The EU has not immediately responded, but analysts believe Trump's post is intended to increase leverage before negotiations. Shares in both the US and EU have fallen following the announcement, and Apple's shares also dipped, as they had previously won relief on electronics tariffs.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston temporarily halted the Trump administration's ban on Harvard University enrolling international students. This decision came hours after Harvard filed a lawsuit challenging the ban, which the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) implemented after accusing the school of tolerating "anti-American, pro-terrorist agitators." Judge Allison Burroughs stated that Harvard had demonstrated that it would suffer immediate and irreparable harm if the ban were to take effect. The lawsuit calls the revocation a "blatant violation of the First Amendment" and the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution.</p>

          <p>The Atlantic reports on the plight of migrants deported to Panama from the United States under a third-country deportation agreement. These migrants, who had hoped to seek asylum in the U.S., now find themselves in a precarious situation, with limited options and uncertain prospects. The article details their experiences in Panama, including initial detention in a hotel, pressure to return to their countries of origin, and challenges in seeking asylum. It also highlights the efforts of local charities and lawyers to assist the migrants, who often express a desire to reach America.</p>
