          <p>A school shooting in Graz, Austria, has resulted in multiple deaths, according to local and federal officials. Police deployed special forces to the BORG Dreiersch√ºtzengasse high school after receiving reports of shots fired, prompting an evacuation and thorough search of the premises. Authorities have confirmed multiple fatalities but have not yet provided exact figures. The city of Graz, located in southeastern Austria, is the country's second-largest city with a population of approximately 300,000.

          <p>Ed Miliband defended the government's decision to partially reverse its earlier cut to the winter fuel payment, expanding eligibility to pensioners with annual incomes of ¬£35,000 or less. The government had initially withdrawn the payment from over 10 million pensioners but faced pressure from charities, unions, and backbenchers. Miliband argued that improved economic stability allowed for the change, costing around ¬£1.25 billion, which will be detailed in the autumn Budget. Critics argue the funds could be better used to address poverty among families with children, while Conservatives claim the government lacks a funding plan for the reversal. The government insists no registration is needed and an opt-out system will be developed.</p>

          <p>Houses were set on fire and police officers were injured in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, following a protest over an alleged sexual assault. The unrest occurred after two teenage boys appeared in court accused of sexually assaulting a teenage girl.

Jim Allister, leader of the Traditional Unionist Voice, attributed the violence to demographic changes due to ‚Äúunfettered immigration,‚Äù while the Police Federation reported at least 10 officers were hurt.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republicans in Congress are considering legislation that would cut billions in funding for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), potentially impacting many of their own constituents. A KFF survey reveals that 45% of adults enrolled in ACA health plans identify as Republicans. The proposed cuts, part of a multitrillion-dollar tax and spending package, could cause 15 million people to lose health insurance if ACA tax credits are not extended. This is because ACA plans are often used by self-employed individuals, a demographic that leans Republican, and because many red states did not expand Medicaid, making ACA subsidies more relevant for their residents.</p>

          <p>Ping An Bank in China is offering Pop Mart Labubu dolls to new customers who open savings accounts and deposit over 50,000 yuan (US$6,954) for at least three months. The campaign aims to attract young customers amid fierce competition among Chinese retail banks. Labubu, a popular collectible figure, has driven revenue and share price increases for Pop Mart. Chinese retail banks are struggling to attract and retain young customers due to low interest rates and declining population and income levels.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy National Guard troops to Los Angeles to address anti-immigration enforcement protests, without the governor's consent, has sparked debate over presidential powers. Legal experts are questioning the use of federal troops to quell civil unrest, citing the Posse Comitatus Act and the Insurrection Act. Trump is relying on a statute that allows troop deployment in cases of rebellion against the government, but its application in this situation is contested. California is suing the Trump administration, arguing that the deployment is illegal and exceeds the president's authority.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing scrutiny for its actions against colleges and universities, including withholding federal funding, restricting international students, and threatening accreditation and nonprofit status. Harvard University has been a particular target, with the administration alleging leftist indoctrination and failure to protect Jewish students. The federal government has canceled billions in university research funding, affecting various disciplines. These actions have raised legal questions, with Harvard suing the administration over the cuts and restrictions. The administration's moves are seen as an attempt to reshape academia and align it with the president's political agenda.</p>

          <p>Wall Street CEOs are increasingly worried about the potential loss of America's superpower status due to tariffs. Business leaders are cycling from denial and bargaining to public anger and depression over the economic impact of the tariffs.

Some CEOs are calling for more bargaining, especially with China, but others warn that the United States might need to accept an economic downturn.

          <p>Israel has begun deporting pro-Palestinian activists, including Greta Thunberg, after intercepting their Gaza-bound aid boat in the Mediterranean. The Israeli foreign ministry stated that Thunberg departed Tel Aviv on a flight to France after agreeing to be deported. However, France said some of its citizens refused to sign deportation orders and would face judicial proceedings. The activists aimed to deliver aid to Gaza in defiance of Israel's naval blockade, but Israel claims the blockade is necessary to prevent weapons from reaching Hamas. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition condemned the activists' kidnapping and demanded their release.</p>

The announcement comes after the UK government changed its rules about the driverless cars once again. It was originally aiming for the tech to come to British roads in 2026, then the date was changed to the second half of 2027. But it now says it is introducing an accelerated framework for small autonomous "bus and taxi like" commercial services to get them underway earlier. It is not yet clear whether the vehicles in Uber's trial will be available for customers to use - the firm says it is still working out the details. It has previously said it intends to add them as a regular option via its UK app as soon as legislation allows.</p>

Restricting international students could hamper the talent pool for US graduate schools, as about half of US STEM PhDs are conferred on international students.
