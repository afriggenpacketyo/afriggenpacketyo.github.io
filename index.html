        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senator Jack Reed has expressed concern over President Trump's dismissal of his own intelligence chief's assessment that Iran is not currently developing nuclear weapons. Reed suggests that Trump's rejection of this intelligence is politically motivated, potentially to justify a future attack on Iran. Reed highlights the importance of correcting the record if the intelligence chief made a false statement, but questions the timing of suddenly concluding she was wrong only after Israeli actions. Reed's comments underscore the tension between the administration's stance on Iran and the intelligence community's findings, raising questions about the basis for potential military action. The situation has potentially serious geopolitical ramifications.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NATO allies are convening for their annual summit amidst pressure from the U.S. to increase defense spending to 5% of their GDP, a figure comprised of 3.5% for defense and 1.5% for security-related infrastructure. While some nations are close to or willing to meet this target, others are struggling to reach the previously agreed-upon 2% threshold, leading to potential clashes during the summit. Experts suggest that the U.S. seeks concrete plans and commitments, while some European allies may attempt to dilute their pledges, especially given the economic challenges and unpopularity of massive defense spending increases. European aerospace and defense companies are closely monitoring the situation, awaiting concrete government procurement actions to scale up their production capabilities.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to reveal a 10-year industrial strategy aimed at boosting economic growth by lowering energy costs for over 7,000 businesses, potentially cutting bills by up to 25%. The British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will exempt manufacturers from certain green energy levies, reducing costs by up to Â£40 per megawatt-hour from 2027. The strategy also includes plans to upskill Britons, attract global talent, streamline planning processes, and increase research and development spending, with a focus on eight key sectors. Critics argue that the plan is an admission of the high costs of net zero, while supporters welcome the measures to address skills shortages, energy costs, and access to capital.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being the most sanctioned nation, Russia's economy has shown surprising resilience, even outpacing G7 nations in growth in 2024, largely driven by military spending and oil exports redirected to China and India. However, challenges loom as inflation remains high, interest rates have soared, and companies face worker shortages, leading to warnings of a potential recession. While some analysts predict a mild downturn with defaults and bankruptcies, others suggest the economy could face collapse, though this is disputed. Western sanctions continue to impact Russia's ability to import technology and diversify its economy, although they have not yet significantly impeded its ability to wage war in the short-term.

          <p>The U.S. has entered the conflict between Israel and Iran, conducting strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, a move that has heightened tensions and left investors and world leaders on edge. In response, Iran's parliament has voted to close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical oil transit chokepoint, causing oil prices to jump. While the final decision to close the Strait rests with Iran's national security council, analysts warn that oil prices could surge to $100 a barrel if the Strait is closed and Western forces intervene. The U.S. Secretary of State has called on China to prevent Iran from closing the Strait, given China's position as Iran's largest oil customer.</p>

This potential decision comes amid heightened geopolitical tensions and evolving security considerations in the Indo-Pacific region.

Palmer was shot six times in his garden in 2015, and Essex Police believe his killing was a planned execution linked to his criminal past. Despite initial missteps in the investigation, police are now appealing to the "criminal fraternity," believing that loyalties may have shifted, and someone may be willing to come forward. The renewed appeal emphasizes that regardless of Palmer's past, he was a father and partner, and his family deserves answers.</p>

          <p>NHS Lothian is considering establishing a ketamine clinic to treat severe depression, offering an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This move follows a private clinic in Lanarkshire that began offering ketamine-assisted therapy last summer. While ketamine is not licensed for routine depression treatment, it can be used 'off-label' by doctors. Advocates argue that ketamine can make patients more receptive to psychotherapy and should be more widely available, while caution is urged due to the drug's potential for misuse and serious health risks.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government on Monday appeared to show some support for U.S. strikes on Iran's key nuclear sites over the weekend, saying that they signaled Washington's resolve to block Tehran from racing toward possession of nuclear weapons. Noting that the "the most important thing" is to de-escalate the situation over Iran's nuclear activities, Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya said in a statement, "Japan understands that the U.S. action demonstrates its determination to de-escalate the situation while preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons." He also acknowledged that the United States has been "seriously pursuing dialogue" amid difficult circumstances surrounding the Iranian nuclear issue.</p>

          <p>Western leaders are calling for diplomacy amidst escalating conflict involving the U.S., Israel, and Iran, but are criticized for failing to address the root causes of the conflict. They are accused of being passengers in Israel's war, unwilling to question its wisdom and deferring to an Israel and White House detached from reality. The leaders' responses are seen as complacent and hypocritical, upholding a status quo of unconditional support for Israel while ignoring violations of international and human rights law. This approach is eroding public trust and exacerbating the divide between detached politics and the bloody reality of the conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming NATO summit in The Hague will center on increasing defense spending, potentially requiring Germany to significantly boost its military capabilities. NATO aims for member states to spend 5% of their GDP on defense, a substantial increase from the current 2% target, with Germany supporting a plan to allocate 3.5% to defense and 1.5% to security-related infrastructure. This would necessitate a massive financial commitment from Germany, raising questions about resource allocation and political support. The summit will also address the need for additional troops in Europe, posing recruitment challenges for the German military, which may necessitate a reconsideration of compulsory military service.</p>

          <p>The NATO summit in The Hague is expected to focus on increasing defense spending, a key demand of U.S. President Donald Trump, with the goal of deterring Russia and rebalancing the alliance.

The ambitious goal of spending 5% of GDP on defense could transform European societies, shifting priorities from social justice to military power, leading to resistance in some countries. The summit is also expected to address the situation in Ukraine, although its aspirations to join NATO are unlikely to take center stage.</p>

Immigration law experts say the Trump administration's strict enforcement policies have reduced discretion previously afforded to military families. While Marine Corps recruiters continue to promote enlistment as a path to immigration benefits for families, government memos show that the agency tasked with helping military family members gain legal status now refers them for deportation.</p>

If no candidate secures a majority of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed to the voters' second choices, continuing until a winner emerges. The system aims to ensure that the elected candidate has broad support and prevents fringe candidates from winning in crowded fields. While the system offers benefits like preventing wasted votes, it also presents challenges such as complexity, reduced transparency, and potential for delayed results.</p>
