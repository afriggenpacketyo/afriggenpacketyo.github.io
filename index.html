          <p>Southeast Asia has successfully reduced its tobacco consumption by 40% since 2010, moving from the region with the highest tobacco use per capita to the second highest, according to the World Health Organization. This significant public health achievement has been driven by government regulations, awareness campaigns, and unique national policies like India's mandatory health warnings in media. Despite this progress, challenges remain, particularly with the pervasive use of smokeless tobacco products and the rise of e-cigarettes among adolescents, which require more targeted control measures.</p>

He celebrated the end of the war, stating the "long and painful nightmare is finally over" for both Israelis and Palestinians, and urged Israel to translate its military victories into lasting peace. His speech was met with a warm reception, and he was nominated for the Israel Prize, the nation's highest honor.</p>

The author suggests these actions, which caused significant market volatility, are designed to mask ineptitude and that Trump lacks the leverage he believes he has over China. The article frames the approach as a continuation of a Western pattern of using threats and sanctions with the expectation of compliance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The World Health Organization has issued a stark warning about the increasing prevalence of drug-resistant bacterial infections, with one in six lab-confirmed cases in 2023 showing resistance to antibiotics. This trend threatens to make common infections and minor injuries deadly, as treatment options are diminishing and the pipeline for new medicines is insufficient. The report highlights that these antimicrobial-resistant superbugs directly cause over a million deaths and contribute to nearly five million deaths annually worldwide.</p>

          <p>Despite soaring sticker prices for college, author Ron Lieber explains that most families do not pay the full amount due to widespread "behind-the-scenes" tuition discounting. Private colleges, on average, offer discounts of around 56% through merit aid, part of a "high-tuition, high-aid" model that can be confusing for students and parents. While this makes college more affordable than the list price suggests, it creates a lack of transparency and makes financial concerns a primary factor in school selection for many families.</p>
