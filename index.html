The artwork, featuring a multicolored ribbon symbolizing autism surrounded by emojis, was unveiled during World Autism Acceptance Day in Abuja. This initiative, accompanied by the campaign "Impossibility is a myth," aims to raise awareness and funds for the Zeebah Foundation, which supports individuals with autism and their families.

          <p>Block shares experienced a significant drop of over 20% after a disappointing quarterly report triggered a wave of analyst downgrades centered on concerns about Cash App. The company missed revenue, gross profit, and payment volume expectations, leading to a slashed full-year guidance due to macro uncertainty and weak consumer spending. Analysts flagged stagnant Cash App user growth and muted consumer demand as key issues, with CEO Jack Dorsey acknowledging a lack of focus on network density. Despite new features, Cash App's monthly active users remained flat, and inflows rose less than expected, further fueling investor concerns.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs on economic growth and inflation, which complicates decisions about interest rate cuts. While a strong labor market has allowed the Fed to maintain steady interest rates, the uncertainty caused by tariffs is prompting businesses to shelve investments and slow hiring. Concerns are rising that consumer pessimism could lead to reduced spending, potentially triggering layoffs and an economic slowdown, even as the latest jobs report showed better-than-expected payroll growth and a stable unemployment rate. The central bank is now debating whether tariff-related price pressures will be temporary or lead to persistent inflation.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods are expected to significantly impact retail inventories and holiday sales promotions, potentially leading to higher prices and fewer discounts for consumers. Small businesses that rely on Chinese manufacturing are already facing challenges, with some forced to halt production due to increased duties. Retailers are concerned about leaner inventories for events like Amazon Prime Day, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday, as they struggle to absorb the massive 145% tariff. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy acknowledged the uncertainty surrounding the tariffs' impact on the company's business, highlighting the potential for varying responses from retail partners.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry has lost his legal challenge to reinstate automatic police protection for his visits to the United Kingdom, a decision that stems from the government's 2020 decision to deny his family taxpayer-funded security after he stepped down as a senior royal. The judge acknowledged Harry's feelings of being badly treated by the system, but ruled that the government's decision was not illogical or inappropriate. Harry's lawyers had argued that he faces significant security risks, including threats from al-Qaeda, and that his life is at stake, but the court ultimately sided with the government's assessment.</p>

          <p>The Army is reportedly planning a potential military parade in Washington, D.C., on President Trump's birthday in June, which would include thousands of troops, vehicles, and aircraft. Planning documents detail a large-scale event involving over 6,600 soldiers, at least 150 vehicles, 50 helicopters, tanks, seven bands, and possibly thousands of civilians. The parade, likely to cost tens of millions of dollars, would coincide with the Army's 250th-anniversary festival on the National Mall, but no final decisions have been made, and concerns remain about the cost and potential damage to city roads.</p>

Rockstar is known for its long development cycles and perfectionist approach, but the 12-year gap since GTA 5's release has fueled impatience and jokes online, though it is expected to be a sales record breaker upon its eventual release.</p>

          <p>Legal experts and former prosecutors are raising concerns about the politicization of the Department of Justice (DoJ) under Attorney General Pam Bondi in the Trump administration. They allege that the DoJ has been used to target political opponents, support a harsh agenda against undocumented immigrants, and assist business allies, undermining the rule of law. Bondi is accused of establishing a "weaponization working group" to push a false narrative about investigations into Trump, and prioritizing personal loyalty to Trump among staff. These actions have led to rebukes from courts, resignations, and firings of veteran prosecutors, signaling a dangerous shift in the department's mission.</p>

          <p>Japan and the United States have agreed to expedite tariff discussions, aiming to reach a "mutually beneficial deal" as early as June. Following meetings between Japanese and U.S. officials in Washington, both sides agreed to hold intensive ministerial discussions from mid-May. Despite progress, gaps remain between the two nations, with Japan seeking a review of the tariff policy implemented by President Donald Trump. The talks also address the number of U.S.-made cars imported into Japan and the country's market access for U.S.-grown crops.</p>

          <p>Reporters Without Borders (RSF) reports that global press freedoms are at an "all-time low," particularly noting a deterioration under US President Donald Trump. The report highlights that more than half of the world's population lives in countries with a "very serious" situation regarding press freedom. The US has fallen in the rankings due to Trump's administration's actions, including cutting funding for state-funded broadcasters and considering legal action against The New York Times. Europe remains the safest region for journalists, while China, North Korea, and Eritrea are at the bottom of the rankings.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs are being criticized as unfairly punishing China for its ability to produce affordable goods efficiently, enabling it to dominate the global market. Richard Qiu, a Chinese businessman, argues that the tariffs have halted his U.S. sales, with buyers canceling orders due to the increased costs. While Trump insists the tariffs will bring manufacturing back to America, Qiu believes they are a response to China's success in providing good quality products at competitive prices. Despite the challenges, Qiu expresses resilience and determination to navigate the trade war, drawing on China's history of enduring hardship.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has renewed his calls for the U.S. Federal Reserve to lower interest rates following a stronger-than-expected jobs report for April. Trump asserted that there is "NO INFLATION" and the Fed should lower its rate to stimulate the economy. This statement continues his pattern of attempting to influence the central bank's decision-making process, challenging its independence. However, Trump has recently scaled back his criticism of Fed chair Jerome Powell, after previously suggesting he might replace him with someone more willing to bend to political pressure.</p>

As a result, prices will likely increase, and some options have become unavailable, with companies like Temu and Shein already adjusting their pricing and business models. Temu has announced it will stop selling goods imported from China directly to US customers, and the change is also intended to curb the flow of fentanyl into the U.S.</p>
