          <p>Global financial markets experienced a significant downturn following President Trump's announcement of new tariffs, sparking fears of a potential global trade war. Asian stock markets plummeted, with Japan's Nikkei 225 index taking a substantial hit, and U.S. stock futures also showed signs of renewed selling pressure. Trump administration officials defended the tariffs, stating they are necessary to reset global trade imbalances and bring jobs back to the United States. Economists warn that these broad tariffs could lead to increased inflation, reduced consumer spending, and slower economic growth, while China retaliated with tariffs on U.S. products, escalating trade tensions.

          <p>A recent WHO report reveals that a woman dies every two minutes due to failures in maternal healthcare, with 260,000 maternal deaths recorded in 2023, predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa. Leading health organizations warn that cuts to international aid by the US and the UK will jeopardize progress in reducing maternal deaths, potentially causing a shift backwards. The report highlights the inequalities between high- and low-income countries, with west Africa facing significantly higher risks of maternal death compared to southern Europe. The UNFPA warns that funding cuts will increase maternal death rates, emphasizing the urgent need for investment in skilled midwives, quality care, and political commitment to save lives. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A proposed bill in New York aims to prohibit police from making traffic stops for minor violations, such as having a taillight out or expired registration, to address racial disparities in arrests and traffic stops. The bill seeks to limit unnecessary stops and promote racial equity and public safety, as data shows racial minorities are disproportionately affected by arrests and traffic stops in the state. Critics argue that the proposal is pro-criminal and would make roads less safe, referencing a case where a traffic stop for a missing license plate led to the capture of a serial killer. The debate highlights the tension between addressing racial bias in policing and ensuring public safety through law enforcement. </p>

          <p>Thousands of supporters of far-right politician Marine Le Pen gathered in Paris to protest her conviction for embezzling public funds and subsequent ban from running for office. The rally, organized by Le Pen's National Rally party, was framed as a protest against a politically motivated verdict, but observers noted its resemblance to a campaign rally. Le Pen's protégé, Jordan Bardella, accused France's judges of attempting to silence the opposition, while counter-rallies were held by left-wing parties warning against a "Trumpist turn" in France. The event underscores the deep divisions within France regarding justice, power, and the future of French democracy. </p>

Prime Minister Netanyahu has stated that Israel will maintain security control in Gaza even after Hamas is defeated and push Palestinians to leave. Human rights groups express concern that this land control could be used for long-term occupation and amounts to ethnic cleansing. </p>

          <p>Amidst escalating trade tensions following President Trump's announcement of reciprocal tariffs, investors are seeking safe-haven assets, with analysts suggesting the Japanese yen and Swiss franc as prime candidates. The yen is favored due to its cheap valuation and potential narrowing of interest rate differentials, while the Swiss franc is seen as another strong hedge. Some strategists suggest exploring "exotic" hedges like the Brazilian real, citing its low exposure to global trade. Investors are also piling into bonds and gold as risk-off positioning dominates the markets, reflecting concerns over global economic stability.

          <p>Billionaire investor Bill Ackman has warned that the U.S. is heading toward an "economic nuclear winter" due to President Trump's tariff policies, which he believes are eroding confidence in the country as a trading partner. Ackman, who previously endorsed Trump, criticized the administration's decision to impose tariffs on multiple countries simultaneously, leading to fears of a global economic slowdown. He also took aim at Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, citing a potential conflict of interest. The hedge fund manager urged Trump to call for a timeout for negotiations to resolve unfair tariff deals, or face severe negative consequences for the U.S. economy.

Asian countries, heavily reliant on exports, are particularly sensitive to the impact of the tariffs, with Vietnam and Bangladesh facing substantial levies.

          <h2>Trump Defends Tariffs Amid Market Turmoil, Signals Potential for Deals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-07 00:00:35 EDT</div>

          <p>President Trump has defended his sweeping tariffs, claiming they are necessary to strengthen the U.S. economy, even as global stock markets plummet and fears of a recession rise. While Trump expressed openness to discussing new deals with world leaders, top officials sent conflicting signals about the administration's strategy. Some officials indicated the tariffs were leverage for near-term dealmaking, while others suggested a long-term bid to remake the world economy. The uncertainty surrounding Trump's endgame is fueling anxiety among Republican lawmakers and raising concerns about the potential for economic disruption.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Severe weather, including tornadoes and flash flooding, has caused widespread destruction across parts of the Midwest and South, resulting in at least 20 deaths. New tornado warnings were issued in Alabama and Mississippi, while flash flood warnings were in effect for several counties in Kentucky, Mississippi, and Tennessee. Many areas are already heavily waterlogged by days of severe storms, leading to rapidly swelling waterways and prompting a series of flash flood emergencies. The extreme flooding is also affecting interstate commerce, potentially leading to shipping and supply chain delays. </p>

          <p>Universities in the US are facing attacks, with the Trump administration targeting academic freedom and freedom of speech under the guise of punishing alleged "antisemitism" and "anti-white racism." The attacks are primarily financial, with universities that support dissenting opinions facing funding freezes or cuts. The article suggests ways to support US-based academics, including boycotts, sensitive journalism, university havens, and government initiatives. It emphasizes the need for a broader strategy and investment in European academia to attract researchers from the US. </p>

          <p>Abigail Disney, grand-niece of Walt Disney, has expressed strong criticism of billionaires who cannot live on $999 million, labeling them as "kind of a sociopath." She argues that wealth accumulation is often due to systemic issues and luck rather than merit, and that excessive wealth concentration threatens democracies. Disney, who has donated a significant portion of her inheritance to causes centered on women, advocates for higher taxes on the wealthy and improved wages and conditions for workers. She also reflects on the rise of Trumpism, attributing it to a cultural shift that began in the 1980s, where wealth is venerated. </p>

          <p>President Trump defended his sweeping tariffs on imports, describing them as "medicine" needed to fix the U.S. economy, despite the shockwaves they sent through global stock markets. Top officials stressed that the tariffs would be implemented as planned, downplaying recession fears. However, Asian stock markets plunged, and JP Morgan predicted a 60% chance of a U.S. and global recession. The UK Prime Minister warned that "the world as we knew it has gone," and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is expected to meet with Trump for trade talks.

          <p>Many senior venture capitalists are leaving big firms, citing reasons such as slow decision-making, a focus on increasing assets rather than working with founders, and a desire to return to the basics of venture capital. Some investors are capitalizing on changes in the industry, leaving big firms for the benefits of smaller ones. The venture capital industry has transformed as big legacy firms attracted exponentially more dollars globally. But not all departures are voluntary, and some are being pushed out due to the industry downturn.
