        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A prominent Chinese policy adviser, Professor Zheng Yongnian, argues that China's think tanks must develop an "indigenous knowledge system" to effectively project the country's soft power. He contends that these institutions should move away from Western academic models and focus on China's unique practical and empirical experiences. This self-centered approach, according to Zheng, is crucial for accurately explaining Chinese practices to the world and anticipating the nation's future development. By building on its own governance models, China can create a more authentic and compelling global narrative.</p>

Alcaraz, the defending Wimbledon champion, enters the match with a 24-match winning streak and a recent history of victories over Sinner.

          <p>A new art exhibition in Manhattan, curated by his granddaughter, celebrates the life and work of Dutch-American painter Joop Sanders, who passed away in 2023 at the age of 101. As the last surviving member of the original Abstract Expressionist movement, Sanders was a contemporary of figures like Willem de Kooning. The article explores his significant contributions to the art form and the reasons his fame was perhaps more subdued, including a period spent in Europe during the movement's peak. The retrospective serves as a reintroduction of his influential work to the public and a personal tribute from his family.</p>

          <p>A new Senate committee report discloses that the U.S. Secret Service denied or failed to fulfill at least ten requests for additional security resources for Donald Trump's 2024 campaign prior to the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. The requests included enhanced counter-drone systems and additional counter-assault and sniper personnel. The report accuses former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle of providing false testimony to Congress regarding these denials. It highlights significant communication failures and a lack of a formal process for resource requests as key contributors to the security breakdown.</p>

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples therapy details five simple yet effective habits that people in the happiest relationships practice during the workweek. These rituals include establishing a mini-morning routine to connect before the day begins and sending thoughtful, non-logistical check-in messages. Other key habits are taking individual time to decompress after work, prioritizing a small amount of dedicated "us time" each evening, and ending the day with a brief, quiet emotional check-in. The article suggests these intentional acts can significantly strengthen a couple's bond amidst the chaos of daily life.</p>

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary, Heidi Alexander, has announced that the government plans to make electric vehicles (EVs) cheaper to purchase in an effort to boost adoption. While not confirming specific details, reports suggest this could involve substantial grants for drivers. The move is a response to the high upfront cost of EVs, which remains a major barrier for many consumers. This initiative is part of a broader £63 million investment in charging infrastructure, including funding for special gullies to help residents without driveways install charge points, as the UK moves toward its 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales.</p>

          <p>Julia Klöckner, the new president of Germany's Bundestag, is facing criticism for ordering the removal of rainbow flags from parliamentary offices, citing a rule against displaying signs on windows and facades. This move follows her earlier decision to not fly the Pride flag over the parliament building on Christopher Street Day, a tradition since 2022, arguing for institutional neutrality. Critics from opposition parties accuse her of having a "bigoted understanding" of neutrality at a time when LGBTQ+ rights are under pressure. The decision has sparked a debate about political symbols and solidarity within Germany's highest legislative body.</p>

          <p>In his first interview since the tragic death of player Diogo Jota, Liverpool manager Arne Slot spoke about how the team is coping with the loss. Jota and his brother died in a car crash in Spain on July 3rd. Slot advised his players to be true to their emotions, whether they need to laugh or cry, and to handle the situation with the same authenticity that Jota himself always showed. The club has retired Jota's number 20 shirt, and tributes are planned for the team's first pre-season match, as the players, staff, and fans navigate their collective grief.</p>

          <p>Following Donald Trump's threat to impose 30% tariffs on most EU imports, French President Emmanuel Macron has called for the European Union to "defend European interests resolutely." He urged the European Commission to accelerate preparations for credible retaliatory measures, mobilizing all available instruments if a deal is not reached by August 1. While other European leaders, particularly from Germany and Italy, have called for calm and a pragmatic negotiated solution, Macron's stance signals a readiness for a potential trade war. The threat has caused shock and division within the bloc over the best strategic response. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's National Nuclear Corporation has announced that its new "National No 1 Uranium" project has produced its first barrel of natural uranium. Located in the Ordos basin of Inner Mongolia, the project is being promoted as a "green, safe, intelligent and efficient" approach to uranium mining. This method, likely in-situ leaching which avoids traditional tunnels and waste piles, is aimed at exploiting the country's large sandstone-type uranium deposits. The development is positioned as a key step in boosting China's self-sufficiency and competitiveness in the global nuclear energy sector.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has torn up a 2023 civil rights settlement that mandated Alabama to address a chronic raw sewage crisis in Lowndes County, a poor, majority-Black region. The administration dismissed the agreement as an "illegal" diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiative, part of a broader assault on such programs. The original settlement had stopped the state from criminalizing residents who couldn't afford proper septic systems and had allocated funds for solutions. The termination removes the federal mandate and funding, leaving the resolution of the long-standing public health hazard in doubt.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the wake of deadly floods in the Hill Country, this analysis explores why Texas, the most disaster-prone state in the U.S., consistently resists investing in preventative measures. The article points to a political culture of rugged individualism and small-government ideology, heavily influenced by the fossil fuel industry's opposition to climate change initiatives. It highlights past examples, like the failure to fully upgrade the power grid after the 2021 winter storm or build the "Ike Dike" after a 2008 hurricane. This pattern of prioritizing post-disaster recovery over pre-disaster resilience leaves the state increasingly vulnerable.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A review of recent polling, including new data from Gallup, indicates that the Trump administration's hardline immigration policies and mass deportations may be backfiring politically. Public disapproval of the president's handling of the issue has reached new highs, with a majority of Americans and a supermajority of independents now opposed. The data suggests that while the concept of deportation had some support, the reality of ICE's heavy-handed tactics, such as workplace raids and family separations, is unpopular. Paradoxically, sympathy for immigrants has reportedly reached its highest point in over two decades during Trump's second term.</p>

          <p>The article highlights the direct impact of U.S. tariffs on consumers through the story of a man who was required to pay an unexpected $1,170 fee to receive a side table he purchased from Mexico. This fee, levied by U.S. Customs and paid to the delivery company UPS, was a direct result of tariffs on imported goods. Experts explain that while businesses pay these taxes, the cost is often passed directly to the consumer, sometimes as a separate charge required upon delivery. This experience serves as a stark example of how trade policy can translate into significant and often surprising costs for everyday shoppers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A child has tragically died at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool after contracting measles, the BBC has learned. The hospital has seen a significant increase in seriously ill children with the virus, treating 17 cases since June alone. Health officials attribute the surge to a decline in uptake of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, with vaccination rates in the region falling below the 95% target recommended by the World Health Organization. This death underscores the serious, and in rare cases fatal, risks of the highly contagious disease, prompting renewed calls for parents to ensure their children are vaccinated.</p>
