          <p>Dan Tana, a former professional soccer player who founded the legendary West Hollywood Italian restaurant bearing his name, has passed away at the age of 90. Opened in 1964, the eatery became a cherished institution, famous for its classic red-sauce dishes and its discreet service to a loyal clientele of Hollywood A-listers like Elizabeth Taylor and George Clooney. Though Tana sold the restaurant in 2009, its old-world charm and status as a celebrity hotspot have endured, cementing its place in Los Angeles's cultural and culinary history. The article notes his passing with respect for his legacy.</p>

          <p>A planned visit by United States trade representatives to New Delhi has been called off, signaling escalating trade frictions between the two nations. The cancellation comes as India faces significant U.S. tariffs, including a 25% duty on exports and an additional 25% penalty related to India's purchase of Russian crude oil. India has criticized these measures as unfair, highlighting that the U.S. and its European allies also continue to trade with Russia. The postponement adds uncertainty to negotiations aimed at resolving the trade disputes between the major economic partners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Erin has intensified to become the first hurricane of the Atlantic season, lashing Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands with heavy rain and wind. While currently a Category 4 storm, it is forecast to remain a major hurricane and track northwest between Bermuda and the U.S. mainland. Although meteorological models predict Erin will stay offshore, its power is expected to generate large waves and life-threatening rip currents along the East Coast from August 20th to 27th. Coastal areas, particularly North Carolina's Outer Banks, are on alert for significant beach erosion and dangerous surf conditions.</p>

          <p>Scientists in China have created a new method for making biological tissues, including brains, transparent to allow for exceptionally clear three-dimensional imaging. The technique produces vivid and highly accurate images by preserving the organ's original structure while enhancing the brightness of fluorescent dyes used to mark specific cells. According to the research article, this process creates an "ionic glassy tissue" that remains structurally sound and can be stored for long periods at low temperatures. This breakthrough could provide unprecedented views into the inner workings of complex biological systems, advancing neurological and other medical research fields.</p>

          <p>Following a meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, President Donald Trump has reportedly expressed support for a Russian peace proposal that would involve Moscow taking full control of Ukraine's Donbas region. In exchange, Russia would agree to freeze the current front lines in other occupied areas like Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. This position marks a significant shift, as President Trump is now advocating for a direct peace agreement rather than a ceasefire, a move he is expected to press upon Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during their upcoming White House meeting. European leaders have cautiously welcomed the efforts to end the conflict.</p>

The Padres' performance was marred by significant errors, including three runners caught stealing in the first two innings and a costly dropped fly ball that allowed two runs to score. Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell delivered six shutout innings against his former team, while the offense capitalized on numerous walks issued by Padres starter Dylan Cease. The win not only extended the Dodgers' division lead but also clinched the season's head-to-head series against their rivals.</p>

Experts suggest that increased public awareness may also be contributing to more people seeking early medical care. Officials are reminding the public to use insect repellent, wear protective clothing in wooded areas, and perform thorough checks after being outdoors to prevent tick-borne illnesses.</p>

His defense admitted he was the killer but argued he was not guilty by reason of insanity, claiming severe childhood abuse by his mother caused him to develop dissociative amnesia. The judge acknowledged the abuse but ultimately found him guilty, bringing a long-awaited conclusion to the infamous canal murders.</p>

The deployment follows an executive order that federalized local police forces and activated D.C.'s own National Guard members.

With Stafford's availability for the season opener in question, backup quarterback Stetson Bennett's performance is under increasing scrutiny.

This innovative aircraft would feature a wing that sits perpendicular to the fuselage for efficient takeoff and subsonic flight, then pivots as it accelerates. At transonic speeds, it would swing to a 45-degree angle to mitigate shock waves, and at hypersonic speeds of Mach 5, it would align parallel with the fuselage, transforming the entire vehicle into a streamlined "waverider." This adaptable design aims to overcome the traditional aerodynamic compromises between low-speed lift and high-speed performance.</p>

          <p>An executive counselor and couples' therapist outlines five common psychological reasons why individuals, even those who seem to have perfect lives, risk everything for an affair. The article suggests that infidelity is often not about sex but about deeper emotional needs and unresolved personal issues. These triggers include a lifetime of repressed emotions from always being "good," the self-destructive recoil from perfectionism, a history of poor boundaries learned in childhood, escaping an emotionally withholding or abusive marriage, and the life reassessment that often follows a significant personal loss. Understanding these underlying factors is key to addressing the root causes of such decisions.</p>

          <p>Claire's, the accessory and jewelry chain once a staple for tweens and teenagers, has appointed administrators in the UK and Ireland after struggling with falling sales and intense competition. For decades, the brand was a go-to destination for affordable items like friendship necklaces, glittery hair clips, and ear piercings. However, the retail landscape has shifted dramatically with the rise of online fast-fashion giants like Shein and Temu, which can replicate social media trends at lower prices and faster speeds. The article notes that as young consumers' tastes are increasingly shaped by older social media influencers, Claire's has struggled to maintain its relevance.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Chargers wide receiver Quentin Johnston was carted off the field after sustaining a concussion during a preseason game against the Rams. The injury occurred on the third play from scrimmage when Johnston took a helmet-to-chin hit from a Rams safety after an incomplete pass. The game was stopped for several minutes while he received medical attention before being taken to a hospital as a precaution. The injury to Johnston, who led the team in touchdown catches last season, is a significant concern for the Chargers as they prepare for the upcoming regular season.</p>

          <h2>Unusual Heat and Dryness in UK Lead to Signs of an Early Autumn</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the ongoing summer heatwave, signs of an early autumn are appearing across the United Kingdom, with trees shedding leaves and autumn fruits like blackberries ripening weeks ahead of schedule. Experts explain this phenomenon is not a true seasonal shift but rather a stress response from nature to the prolonged hot and dry conditions, which may be among the warmest on record. This "false autumn" could have negative consequences for wildlife, as an early fruit harvest may leave birds with less food for the winter, and hardened soil makes it difficult for animals like badgers to find earthworms.</p>

          <p>A homeless man in Washington D.C., Bill Theodie, was forced to move from his encampment just four days after President Trump posted a photo of him on social media as part of a call for a crackdown on homelessness. Trump's post, made during his motorcade ride, demanded the immediate removal of such encampments, which he called "slums." Shortly after, city officials, fast-tracking their removal process, used a bulldozer to clear the site where Theodie had lived for years. The article provides a personal perspective on the human impact of the administration's new policy, which involves forcibly relocating unhoused individuals.</p>

          <p>The body of British property tycoon Harry Roy Veevers has remained in a Kenyan mortuary for over 11 years due to a bitter legal feud between his two families. Following his death in 2013, his sons from his first marriage accused his second wife and their daughters of poisoning him to inherit his estate, a claim they denied. The dispute led to the exhumation of his body and a decade-long inquest that concluded this week without determining a cause of death due to decomposition. A magistrate has now ordered the body released for reburial, but with the family still deeply divided, the tycoon's final resting place remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>A group of students about to receive their GCSE results have opened time capsule letters they wrote to their future selves as 11-year-olds in March 2021. The letters, written just after returning to school from a lengthy COVID-19 lockdown, reveal their anxieties about the pandemic and their hopes for the future. The students' reflections highlight the unique challenges their cohort faced, with their entire secondary education shaped by disruptions like remote learning and social bubbles. Four years later, the students looked back on their younger selves' aspirations, providing a poignant snapshot of resilience and personal growth through a difficult period.</p>

          <p>During his summit in Alaska, President Donald Trump hand-delivered a personal letter from First Lady Melania Trump to Russian President Vladimir Putin concerning children affected by the war in Ukraine. While officials stated the letter raised the issue of child abductions, the released text is more abstract, speaking of restoring children's "melodic laughter" and protecting their innocence. The letter does not explicitly mention the thousands of Ukrainian children that Russia has been accused of forcibly transferring, a practice deemed a war crime by the International Criminal Court. Ukraine's foreign minister nonetheless expressed gratitude for the first lady's attention to the issue.</p>

          <p>Villa Baviera, a Chilean town once known as Colonia Dignidad, is grappling with its dark history as it operates as a tourist destination. The site was formerly home to a secretive German sect led by Paul Schäfer, who subjected residents to forced labor and sexual abuse, and collaborated with the Pinochet dictatorship to torture and kill political prisoners. Now, the Chilean government plans to expropriate part of the land to create a memorial for the victims, a move that has divided the community. While victims' families support the plan, some current residents, who also view themselves as victims of Schäfer's regime, fear the expropriation will displace them once again.</p>
