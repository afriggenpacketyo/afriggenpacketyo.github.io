        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump unveiled plans for a massive missile shield system, dubbed the "Golden Dome," aimed at protecting the U.S. from missile threats, potentially costing tens to hundreds of billions of dollars. The project, reminiscent of Reagan's "Star Wars" program, will be led by Gen. Michael Guetlein. Trump's push for the shield, similar to Israel's Iron Dome, gained traction after watching Israel deflect missiles during Iranian attacks in 2024. Critics question the necessity of such a system for the U.S., given its geographic advantages, while others worry about the financial strain on other vital programs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Liberty Steel is in a critical situation as its plants in Rotherham and Sheffield face potential closure due to unpaid debts, risking 1,450 jobs. A court decision could force the company into liquidation if an adjournment is not granted, prompting discussions with creditors. Government sources indicate they are unwilling to directly intervene to pay off debts but may consider involvement if insolvency occurs. The company has struggled financially since the collapse of its main lender, Greensill Capital, leading to severe constraints on raising third-party finance.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Senator Chris Van Hollen engaged in a heated exchange during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. The confrontation arose after Van Hollen criticized the State Department for revoking visas of individuals disrupting college campuses, likening Rubio to Joseph McCarthy. Rubio defended the visa revocations, asserting that visas are a privilege, not a right, for those coming to the U.S. to study. The exchange escalated when Rubio accused Van Hollen of supporting human traffickers, leading to interruptions and demands for substantiation.</p>

          <p>President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" faces challenges in the House due to Republican dissidents concerned about spending cuts and the national debt. Key disagreements include the extent of cuts to Medicaid and other social security programs, as well as state and local tax deductions. Some lawmakers are pushing for steeper cuts to avoid increasing America's public debt, while others oppose any reductions to Medicaid. The bill's tax breaks total approximately $4.9 trillion, partially offset by cuts to healthcare and green energy tax breaks.</p>

          <p>Nearly 2 million federal student loan borrowers are in limbo as they await approval or denial for affordable repayment plans, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education. This backlog complicates matters as the Trump administration restarts collection activity, potentially leaving borrowers at risk of default. The American Federation of Teachers sued the Trump administration for temporarily shutting down access to income-driven repayment plan applications on the Education Department's website.</p>

          <p>Former President Biden's recent diagnosis of advanced prostate cancer has sparked questions about screening practices, as guidelines advise against it after age 70. Despite regular screening, some men can develop aggressive cancers undetected until advanced stages. Experts emphasize that the PSA test is not perfect and fast-growing cancers can arise between screenings. Even with a normal PSA, aggressive cancers can still develop, highlighting the limitations of screening and the potential for overestimation of its diagnostic power.</p>
