          <p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan's office vehemently rejected President Trump's "bigoted" and "appalling" comments, made during a UN General Assembly address, where Trump falsely suggested London was moving towards Sharia law and had deteriorated under Khan's leadership. These claims, which align with long-standing far-right conspiracy theories targeting Khan as the first Muslim mayor, were met with strong defense from numerous British politicians, including members of the Prime Minister's government. They underscored London's reputation as a safe and inclusive global city. This article details the revival of a contentious, nearly decade-long public feud between the two figures, characterized by Trump's persistent criticisms of Khan's tenure and the city's crime rates, which are presented with counter-arguments from UK statistics.</p>

          <p>Jerome Cohen, a highly respected and pioneering scholar of Chinese law, has died at the age of 95, leaving a profound legacy spanning over six decades. As professor emeritus at New York University’s School of Law and founder of its US-Asia Law Institute, Cohen was instrumental in shaping global discourse on China’s legal system, trade, and human rights. He holds the distinction of being the first American to practice law in the country under Communist rule, and his extensive writings on Chinese criminal procedure are considered groundbreaking. Cohen was renowned for his dual role as an advocate for Chinese dissidents and a proponent of continued engagement with Beijing, making a significant and lasting impact on the field.</p>

          <p>A new oral weight loss drug, orforglipron from Eli Lilly, has shown "meaningful weight loss" and cardiometabolic improvements in phase 3 clinical trials, potentially offering an alternative to injectable GLP-1 medications. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found participants on the highest dose lost an average of 27.3 pounds, with significant percentages achieving 10-15% body weight reduction and improved blood sugar. Its safety profile is consistent with existing GLP-1s, featuring mild to moderate gastrointestinal side effects. Eli Lilly aims for approval by 2026 for obesity and type 2 diabetes, though some medical professionals express caution regarding its non-peptide nature and long-term effects.</p>

          <p>California's Senate Bill 576, aimed at quieting loud commercials on streaming services, has passed the Legislature and awaits the governor's signature. The legislation, prompted by consumer frustration, would mandate that streaming advertisements do not exceed the volume of the content they accompany, mirroring existing regulations for traditional television. Initially, streaming industry groups voiced opposition, citing the complexity of controlling ad volumes from diverse sources. However, their stance changed to neutral after the bill was amended to prevent private legal action. This article details the legislative progress and notes that federal regulators are also considering expanding their Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation Act to include streaming platforms, as a surge in complaints highlights this persistent issue for viewers.</p>

Recent actions, such as Hubei province's enforcement of back taxes on undeclared overseas income, have seen wealthy individuals facing substantial tax bills. This intensified crackdown on foreign earnings, previously subject to lax enforcement, signals a broader governmental effort to enhance revenue collection and ensure the financial stability of local administrations across the country, informing key policy priorities within the new plan.</p>

This initiative, unveiled at a UN sideline event and developed with World Bank support, plans to invest in low-risk assets, distributing returns to tropical nations at up to $4 per hectare of standing forest. Payments are tied to maintaining annual deforestation below 0.5 percent, with penalties for forest degradation, and a significant portion allocated to Indigenous peoples. Brazilian President Lula da Silva, who committed $1 billion from Brazil, emphasized this as a crucial investment against climate chaos, urging global participation before COP30.

          <h2>Federal EV Tax Credits Spur Last-Minute Rush Before September 30 Expiration</h2>

          <p>Car buyers are accelerating their electric vehicle (EV) purchases to capitalize on federal tax credits, offering up to $7,500 for new and $4,000 for used EVs, before their expiration on September 30. These credits are ending due to President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." The approaching deadline has propelled EV sales to record levels in August, with new and used EV sales surging by 17.7% and 59% respectively, year-over-year. Dealerships are also contributing to the rush by offering significant incentives to reduce inventory. While September 2025 is projected to be a record month for EV sales, industry experts anticipate a challenging sales environment post-expiration, leading some automakers to already slow EV production.

          <p>A powerful late summer monsoon swept through Southern California last week, unleashing devastating mudslides and flash floods that resulted in significant destruction and a tragic loss of life. The storm, which heavily impacted the San Bernardino County mountains and foothills, destroyed three homes and damaged over a dozen others, with one family losing their home and most pets. Most tragically, flash flooding in Barstow swept away a vehicle, killing 2-year-old Xavier Padilla Aguilera and injuring his father.

          <p>Aakash Singh, a high-ranking official within the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) who is currently directing aggressive prosecutions of minor crimes and protesters in Washington D.C., pleaded guilty to a DUI charge four years ago. His subsequent elevation to associate deputy attorney general, a role typically held by senior career attorneys, is considered unusual by former federal prosecutors given his criminal history. Singh, promoted after the Trump administration took office, has reportedly advised prosecutors to impanel new grand juries if initial attempts to secure felony indictments are unsuccessful. This article highlights concerns about potential hypocrisy and an unconventional career trajectory within the DOJ, drawing criticism from legal experts regarding the appropriateness of such a promotion and the aggressive prosecutorial tactics.</p>

          <p>President Trump's strong warnings against acetaminophen (Tylenol) use during pregnancy, linking it to autism, have created significant confusion, despite medical groups refuting these claims. This article thoroughly examines the scientific evidence, noting that while some studies suggest an association between acetaminophen use and autism, others, particularly a large Swedish sibling study, found no causal link after accounting for genetic factors. Medical experts underscore that untreated fever and pain during pregnancy carry considerable risks, making acetaminophen a crucial and often the safest over-the-counter option. The article strongly advises parents and expectant parents to consult their medical providers for reliable guidance, rather than non-expert opinions, on this complex health issue.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's nearly hour-long address at the United Nations General Assembly offered a stark and "unplugged" exposition of his core ideology, marked by criticisms of globalism, multilateralism, and the UN's effectiveness. He praised American exceptionalism and his own accomplishments, but lambasted the UN for its perceived failures and role in migration. Trump also directed strong criticism at European allies, accusing their renewable energy policies and open immigration approaches of leading their countries "to hell." This article highlights the speech's combative and isolationist themes, noting the audience's silent reception compared to past laughter, and his significant, albeit qualified, assertion that Ukraine could win back its territory with European and NATO support.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump unexpectedly canceled a crucial meeting with top Democrats, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, significantly escalating the risk of a federal government shutdown. The meeting, intended to resolve funding impasses, was called off by Trump, who cited "unserious and ridiculous demands" from Democrats, specifically their insistence on extending Affordable Care Act tax credits. Democrats swiftly condemned Trump's decision, accusing him of "chickening out" and holding the nation hostage, asserting that he would bear responsibility for any shutdown. This article highlights the deepening political deadlock and sharp rhetoric as the September 30 funding deadline rapidly approaches, underscoring fundamental partisan disagreements over healthcare and fiscal policy.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell characterized the confluence of rising inflation and a slowdown in hiring as a "challenging situation," indicating increased concern for the labor market. His remarks followed the Fed's initial interest rate cut this year, with projections for two additional quarter-point reductions in 2025. Powell underscored the central bank's dual mandate to manage inflation and achieve maximum employment, highlighting the difficult position policymakers are in: raising rates could trigger a downturn, while lowering them might exacerbate inflation. This article details the complex economic environment, further complicated by President Trump's persistent pressure on the Fed for lower rates and his controversial actions concerning board members.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>FCC Chair Brendan Carr's public threats against TV networks, specifically targeting Disney-owned ABC over late-night host Jimmy Kimmel's comments, have ignited a significant debate concerning free speech and regulatory authority. Carr, aligning with President Trump's criticisms of media coverage, implied potential license revocations if networks failed to discipline Kimmel, leading to his temporary suspension. However, Kimmel's subsequent reinstatement suggests boundaries to such pressure. This article posits that Carr's threats are likely legally untenable given First Amendment protections and historical FCC practice, serving instead as a strategic maneuver to exert influence over media companies, particularly regarding merger approvals. It highlights how some ABC affiliates, like Nexstar and Sinclair, continue to refuse to air Kimmel's show, prioritizing favorable regulatory standing for their business expansion.</p>
