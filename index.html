          <p>Liverpool clinched the Premier League title, ending a 35-year drought and equaling Manchester United's record of 20 titles. The victory, celebrated at Anfield, saw fans and players erupt in joy, a stark contrast to the subdued celebrations of the 2020 title win due to the pandemic. Head coach Arne Slot, succeeding Jurgen Klopp, led the team to victory, earning praise from captain Virgil van Dijk who emphasized that no one thought they would win the Premier League title. Klopp's influence remained evident, with Slot paying tribute to his predecessor amid the celebrations, underscoring a seamless transition and continued success for the club.</p>

          <p>A conference at Donald Trump's Doral resort in Miami featured Andreas Kalcker, a promoter of chlorine dioxide as a cure for various ailments despite warnings from health authorities about its dangers. Kalcker markets the bleach as a solution to eliminate pathogens, claiming it is a medical breakthrough, but the FDA has cautioned against its use, citing potentially life-threatening side effects. This event highlights the proliferation of alternative health approaches, particularly with Robert Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic, potentially leading the Department of Health and Human Services. The event raises concerns about the promotion of unproven and dangerous remedies under the new administration.</p>

          <p>A massive explosion and fire at the Shaid Rajaei port in southern Iran resulted in at least 40 deaths and around 1,000 injuries, with the incident purportedly linked to a shipment of a chemical ingredient used to make missile propellant. The explosion occurred amidst ongoing negotiations between Iran and the United States regarding Tehran's nuclear program, raising suspicions of sabotage. While Iranian officials deny the explosion was an attack, private security firms suggest it was caused by the improper handling of missile fuel, specifically ammonium perchlorate from China.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams did not draft a cornerback during the NFL draft, leading to speculation that they might pursue a reunion with three-time All-Pro cornerback Jalen Ramsey.

A reunion would require working out contract adjustments, but it makes sense for the Rams, who won Super Bowl LVI with Ramsey and Aaron Donald leading the defense.</p>

          <p>President Trump's meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky has offered Ukrainians a glimmer of hope that the US will not force them into a peace plan favorable to Russia. Trump questioned why Putin would continue to attack Ukraine while the US is trying to broker peace. This stance contrasts with previous efforts to push Ukraine towards a deal that would cede territory and abandon NATO aspirations.</p>
