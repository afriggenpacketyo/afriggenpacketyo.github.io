          <p>Chinese firms are being urged to deepen their economic integration within Southeast Asian nations to mitigate the impact of U.S. tariffs on transshipped goods. An economist from the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office advised that becoming more ingrained in local ASEAN economies offers a long-term strategy against unpredictable U.S. trade policies. The U.S. has warned of a 40% tariff on imports diverted through countries like Vietnam, creating significant pressure for Chinese businesses to establish genuine local roots rather than just using the region for transshipment. This shift in strategy is seen as crucial for stability as Chinese exports face high tariff rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An explosion at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department training facility in East L.A. has resulted in the deaths of three deputies from the Arson Explosives Detail. The incident, which occurred Friday morning, is the department's largest single loss of life since 1857. Officials reported that the blast happened in the parking lot of the Special Enforcement Bureau, possibly while work was being done to render a recovered grenade safe. An investigation involving local and federal agencies is underway to determine the exact cause of the tragic event, though authorities have stated there is no ongoing threat to the community.</p>

          <p>A sheriff's officer in Jacksonville, Florida, has been suspended following the emergence of viral video showing him punching a driver during a traffic stop. The driver, William McNeil Jr., filmed the officer smashing his car window and pulling him out after he refused to exit the vehicle. Police later released bodycam footage showing McNeil refusing commands after being stopped for not wearing a seatbelt. While a state prosecutor found no criminal misconduct by the officers, an internal review is ongoing, and the involved officer has been stripped of law enforcement duties pending its outcome.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and Japan have finalized a significant trade deal, which includes lowering U.S. tariffs on Japanese auto imports from 25% to 15%. President Trump announced the agreement, stating it also involves a $550 billion investment from Japan into the U.S. and opens Japanese markets to American goods like cars and agricultural products. The news caused a surge in Japanese automaker stocks, with companies like Toyota and Honda seeing significant gains. This development provides short-term relief for Japan's auto industry, a cornerstone of its economy that had been hit hard by previous tariff threats. (not investment advice)</p>

The piece highlights Jon Stewart's criticism of CBS's parent company for the cancellation, framing it as a financial decision influenced by political appeasement.

          <p>A 29-year-old man, Fernando Ramirez, has been charged with 37 counts of attempted murder and assault after allegedly plowing his car into a crowd outside an East Hollywood nightclub. The incident occurred after Ramirez was ejected from the venue; he returned and drove into a group of people, injuring at least 36 individuals. After the crash, bystanders pulled Ramirez from the vehicle and assaulted him. Authorities, who are still searching for a person who shot Ramirez during the altercation, called it a "miracle" that no one was killed in the initial attack, crediting the swift response of emergency services.</p>

Recent attacks, including army airstrikes and alleged RSF attacks on villages, have killed hundreds of civilians and escalated the violence.

          <p>The Hershey Company has announced it will raise prices on its candy products by a "low double-digit" percentage to combat the unprecedented cost of cocoa.

This price adjustment will affect the company's entire confection portfolio, which includes iconic brands like Reese's and KitKat. In response to the volatile cocoa market, Hershey also plans to focus more on its "snacking powerhouse" strategy by expanding its product lines in less cocoa-intensive categories like salty snacks.</p>

The article cites Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's past writings, which express concern over "social engineering" and the role of women in the armed forces.

The decline in local amenities and a drop in the local primary school's enrollment are cited as evidence of the area becoming less livable for families.
