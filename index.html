          <p>A new report from the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC) suggests that the Wagner Group systematically used military equipment supplied to Mali's armed forces. Evidence, including open-source photos and interviews with Malian military sources, indicates mercenaries appropriated armored vehicles, machine guns, and drones from countries like China and Turkey. This diversion of equipment could constitute a violation of the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) by Mali, potentially leading to diplomatic consequences. The report notes that even after Wagner's official dissolution into Russia's Africa Corps, the practice likely continues with many of the same personnel.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has called off the planned deployment of federal agents to San Francisco following a direct phone call with Mayor Daniel Lurie and lobbying from billionaire tech CEOs. The reversal came just as abruptly as the initial decision, which had sparked a crisis in the Bay Area. Trump stated on social media that he based the decision on his conversation with Lurie, who reportedly asked "very nicely," and input from "friends of mine." This incident highlights the president's capricious leadership style, where major domestic security decisions appear to be influenced by personal relationships and politeness rather than established protocols or objective needs.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, is confronting a series of racist and Islamophobic attacks from political opponents, including former Governor Andrew Cuomo and allies of Donald Trump. Opponents have labeled him a "terrorist sympathizer" and a "jihadist candidate," while also using manipulated images and AI-generated ads to smear his campaign. Despite the vitriol, which observers call unprecedented in its personal nature, Mamdani has been credited with handling the attacks with grace. The attacks highlight the racial and religious biases present in the high-stakes mayoral race as Mamdani aims to become the city's first Muslim mayor.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California has passed a new law, effective January 1, that permits the year-round hunting of non-native mute swans, classifying them as an invasive species. Wildlife officials argue the move is necessary to protect the state's dwindling wetlands, as the large, aggressive birds consume vast amounts of vegetation and displace native waterfowl. Mute swans, originally introduced from Eurasia for ornamental purposes, can alter ecosystems and have been known to act aggressively towards humans and pets. While conservation groups support the law as a tool for managing a problematic species, animal advocacy organizations have condemned it as inhumane.</p>

          <p>As the federal government shutdown extends into its fourth week, federal employees are experiencing increasing economic stress and uncertainty, with many about to miss their first full paycheck. Workers are reportedly making desperate arrangements, such as seeking side jobs or liquidating assets, to survive without pay while still being required to work in some cases. The political deadlock in Washington continues, with House Speaker Mike Johnson and Democrats unable to reach a budget agreement. The situation is compounded by rhetoric from the Trump administration, which has threatened to withhold back pay and framed the shutdown as an opportunity to cut federal programs.</p>

          <p>A Chicago-area pastor, Rev. Quincy Worthington, recounts witnessing terrifying and escalating tactics by ICE agents against peaceful protesters outside a facility in Broadview. He describes agents using pepper spray, pepper balls, rubber bullets, and batons on demonstrators, including an incident where his friend, another pastor, was shot in the head with a pepper ball. Despite the violence, Worthington states his faith compels him to continue attending the protests to stand up for human rights and protect what he calls the sacredness of every person. The events have led to a temporary restraining order preventing ICE from using chemical munitions at that location.</p>

          <p>In rural communities across the Deep South, particularly in Louisiana, residents who gained health coverage through Medicaid expansion are now facing significant uncertainty. A new law signed by President Trump is projected to cut nearly $1 trillion from Medicaid over the next decade, potentially leaving hundreds of thousands in Louisiana uninsured. The law introduces new work reporting requirements and more frequent eligibility checks, which advocates fear will create bureaucratic hurdles that cause people to lose coverage. For residents in economically struggling areas like East Carroll Parish, where Medicaid has been a crucial lifeline, the impending cuts threaten to reverse recent gains in public health.</p>

After a period on the backbenches during Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, she returned to the shadow cabinet under Keir Starmer and served as Leader of the House of Commons after the 2024 election. Powell views her new role as a "bridge" between the party leadership and its members, aiming to unite the party's diverse voter base around a fairer economy.</p>

          <p>San Diego-based defense technology firm Shield AI has revealed a new AI-piloted fighter jet, the X-BAT, designed to operate without runways, GPS, or constant communication links. The aircraft features vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capability, allowing it to be deployed from ships or small, improvised sites, directly countering China's strategy of targeting US airfields with long-range missiles. The jet's onboard AI, called Hivemind, enables it to react to its environment, identify threats, and select targets autonomously, though a human will always make the final decision for lethal force. Shield AI aims for the X-BAT to be combat-ready by 2029, offering advanced performance at a fraction of the cost of manned fighters.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's intense military buildup targeting Venezuela's regime appears to contradict the president's "America First" pledge to end foreign military entanglements. This hawkish stance, which includes authorizing CIA operations and deploying significant military assets, is reportedly driven by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has successfully advocated for a tough approach over more pragmatic, oil-focused policies. Rubio's influence, supported by key White House staff, has framed the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and leader Nicolás Maduro as "narco-terrorists," providing justification for military action. This policy shift reflects a reassertion of US influence in Latin America, potentially driven by Rubio's own political ambitions.</p>

          <p>According to a Goldman Sachs report, major Chinese companies are strategically shifting their focus away from the United States and toward less-developed markets like Southeast Asia. This pivot allows them to leverage cost advantages while building out new supply chains. Since 2018, Chinese exports to non-US markets have grown at a compound annual rate of 7.5%, while exports to the US have slightly declined. Concurrently, China is moving up the value chain by exporting more sophisticated, higher-margin products. This diversification is a response to trade tensions and allows Chinese firms to maintain overseas revenue growth despite challenges in the U.S. market.</p>

The article highlights how Andrew and his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, have been a liability to the monarchy for decades, abusing their positions for personal gain.

A female tarantula may eat her suitor before, during, or after mating, forcing the male to be quick and cautious. While their venom is not dangerous to humans, these large, hairy spiders can flick irritating hairs from their abdomens as a defense mechanism.

          <p>A woman's search for the cause of a rare genetic disorder led to the uncovering of a decades-long deception by a Duke University fertility specialist. After a 23andMe DNA test revealed seven half-siblings she never knew, Summer McKesson discovered that Dr. Charles Peete had used his own sperm to inseminate numerous patients, including her mother, without their knowledge or consent in the 1980s. The revelation has connected multiple families who now believe Peete fathered at least 12 children through this practice, which experts call a profound ethical violation and medical malpractice. For McKesson, the discovery is a matter of life and death, as her genetic conditions could be linked to the doctor's advanced paternal age.</p>

          <h2>Trump Abruptly Halts US-Canada Trade Talks Over Disputed Political Advertisement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-25 05:27:29 EDT</div>

          <p>President Trump has announced the termination of trade negotiations with Canada, citing a television advertisement from the province of Ontario that he deemed egregious. The ad featured excerpts from a 1987 Ronald Reagan speech cautioning against the dangers of high tariffs and trade wars. This sudden halt could impact prices for American consumers on goods like cars, auto parts, and home appliances that rely on Canadian steel and aluminum, which are currently subject to steep tariffs. The move jeopardizes efforts to reduce these levies and casts uncertainty on the upcoming joint review of the USMCA free trade agreement next year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa has caused at least four deaths and significant destruction as it moves through the Caribbean, with forecasters warning it could soon strengthen into a hurricane. In Haiti, three people were killed by a landslide and a falling tree, while a fourth fatality was reported in the Dominican Republic, where nearly 200 homes have been destroyed. The U.S. National Hurricane Center has warned of potentially "catastrophic" flash flooding and landslides across Jamaica and Hispaniola, with some areas expected to receive up to 25 inches of rain.

          <p>Chef Roy Choi, known for his Korean-Mexican fusion food truck Kogi, is promoting a more vegetable-forward cooking style in his latest cookbook. He suggests that home cooks can make vegetables more appealing by adopting professional kitchen techniques, such as prepping ingredients in advance. Choi recommends washing and cutting all vegetables at the start of the week and preparing homemade sauces like teriyaki or ponzu to have on hand for quick, flavorful meals. He also advocates for the use of MSG as a "secret weapon" to add a savory, umami flavor that can make healthier dishes more crave-worthy and satisfying.</p>

The match is the first El Clásico to feature two English players in opposition and provides a major stage for Bellingham to prove his form to England's manager.

          <p>Demonstrations are taking place across Germany in response to controversial remarks on urban migration made by Chancellor Friedrich Merz. During a visit to Potsdam, Merz linked his government's efforts to combat illegal immigration to "how our cities look," a comment critics have decried as divisive. Despite the backlash, a recent survey found that a majority of respondents agreed with the chancellor's statements. The incident has highlighted deep divisions on the issue of migration within Germany, with protests planned for Hamburg, Nuremberg, and other cities, as deportation numbers from the country have also seen a significant rise this year.</p>

          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei recently rejected President Trump's offer to resume nuclear talks, signaling the nation's continued commitment to its nuclear program despite intense international pressure. Experts suggest Iran believes demonstrating strength is a key strategic tool, even as its regional influence through proxies like Hamas and Hezbollah has weakened. Following the reinstatement of UN sanctions, Iran has reduced cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) but has not fully withdrawn from agreements. This places the regime in a dilemma, as it attempts to project power without provoking a direct military strike from Israel or the U.S.</p>

          <p>Viral social media posts claiming that Germany has canceled hundreds of its famous Christmas markets for 2025 are false. While a few small, local markets have been called off for reasons like low revenue or venue renovations, major markets in cities like Berlin, Dresden, and Cologne are scheduled to proceed as planned. The false claims appear to originate from a single, questionable article that cited unaffordable security costs and misrepresented the status of markets in several towns. In reality, while security costs have risen since past attacks, there is no evidence of widespread cancellations, and preparations for the festive season are well underway across the country.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has accepted a $130 million donation from an anonymous donor to help pay military service members' salaries during the ongoing government shutdown. President Trump announced the gift, describing the donor as a "patriot" and a "friend of mine" who wished to remain anonymous. While the Pentagon expressed gratitude, the unprecedented nature of the donation has raised ethical concerns, particularly regarding the anonymity and whether it could create conflicts of interest or the appearance of foreign influence. The large sum covers only a small fraction of the billions needed for military pay, as the shutdown approaches its fifth week with no resolution in sight.</p>

          <p>As the UK prepares for shorter days and longer nights, new initiatives are being launched to help people cope with Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), a type of depression linked to reduced daylight. In Scotland's northern isles, where winter daylight can be as short as six hours, a 'Wintering Well' project is providing therapeutic lamps and activity guides through local libraries. The project, led by the University of Glasgow, aims to shift attitudes toward winter by encouraging outdoor activity and building new 'light routines.' Experts suggest creating cozy interior environments and learning from Scandinavian cultures' positive approach to winter can also help mitigate the symptoms of SAD.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused the United States of "fabricating a new war" after the Pentagon ordered the deployment of the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R Ford to the Caribbean. This move significantly increases U.S. military presence in the region, where ten air strikes have already been conducted against alleged drug trafficking vessels. President Trump has designated Maduro as a "narco-terrorist," fueling fears in Venezuela that the military buildup is a pretext for regime change. Maduro's accusation comes as military analysts question the necessity of such a large force for counter-narcotics operations alone.</p>
