          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. military conducted successful bombing attacks on three nuclear sites in Iran, with Israel confirming they were in full coordination during the planning of the strikes. Iranian officials acknowledged the attacks but downplayed the severity of the damage, while the US claims the facilities were completely obliterated. These strikes mark a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict between Iran and Israel. The US used GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators, or "bunker buster" bombs, to target the uranium enrichment plant at Fordo, a facility vital to Iran's nuclear ambitions and believed to be deeper underground than the Channel Tunnel.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have created a two-kilowatt fiber laser capable of operating without heating or cooling systems in extreme climates, ranging from -50Â°C in the Arctic to 50Â°C in the Sahara Desert. This portable device, designed for defense and industrial purposes, contrasts with similar lasers that require large cooling units. The team, led by Chen Jinbao, overcame the challenge of stabilizing laser performance across wide temperature swings through innovative design choices, including 940-nanometer pump lasers and strategic placement of components. The laser emits a lethal 1,080nm beam and represents a technological breakthrough in wide-temperature operating fiber lasers.</p>

          <p>As the use of artificial intelligence grows, researchers are uncovering more instances of potentially harmful AI responses, including hate speech and copyright infringements. The lack of regulations and insufficient testing of AI models exacerbate these issues. Red teaming, where individuals test AI systems to uncover potential harm, is one way to evaluate risks. Researchers recommend adopting standardized AI flaw reports and incentives to improve the understanding of risks posed by AI tools and users. Marrying user-centered practices with governance and policy would ensure a better understanding of the risks posed by AI tools and users.</p>

          <p>CBS News is revisiting the 1989 Pelley family murder case in Lakeville, Indiana, where 17-year-old Jeff Pelley was convicted of killing his father, stepmother, and two stepsisters.

The bodies were discovered by parishioners when the family didn't show up for church services. The episode, titled "Murder on Prom Night," explores the circumstantial evidence and timeline that led to Pelley's conviction, as well as the impact on his surviving sister, Jessi Toronjo.</p>

          <p>Following President Donald Trump's strikes on Iran, concerns have been raised about potential retaliation, both for Americans in the Middle East and at home. A principal worry is cyberattacks by Iranian state actors targeting the banking system or energy grid. A Department of Homeland Security bulletin urged critical infrastructure entities to assess and strengthen their security. There is also fear of attacks by foreign nationals or American citizens inspired to strike the U.S. Iranian forces have previously targeted American interests, and Iranian nationals have carried out major cyberattacks.</p>

          <p>Germany has seen a doubling in the number of Turkish citizens becoming German citizens in 2024, making Turkey second only to Syria in this regard. The increase is attributed to the country's attractiveness for life, work, and study. Dual citizenship, facilitated by Germany's June 2024 reforms, is a major incentive, as is the ability to travel visa-free to more countries. Political repression and economic challenges in Turkey are also driving the trend, though many Turks still feel rooted in their culture and consider Turkey home.</p>

It also discusses the potential consequences of the strikes, including Iran's possible retaliation through both conventional and unconventional means.
