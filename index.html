            <h2>Search Continues for Key Wreckage in Fatal Hudson River Helicopter Crash</h2>

            <p>Dive teams are actively searching the Hudson River for the remaining wreckage from a helicopter crash that killed six people. The NTSB has recovered the main fuselage and parts of the tail, but is still looking for the main rotor and gearbox, which could provide critical clues about the crash's cause. The helicopter, which had completed several tour flights earlier in the day, did not have flight recorders or onboard video. Preliminary investigations suggest a rotor may have broken off, causing the crash, but the NTSB is not speculating on the cause as the investigation continues. Experts emphasize the importance of recovering the missing parts to determine if the crash was due to mechanical failure, drone interference, or bird strikes.</p>

            <p>President Trump has exempted smartphones, computers, and other electronic devices from tariffs, including those imposed on Chinese imports, in a move welcomed by US tech companies. The decision, backdated to April 5th, also includes semiconductors, solar cells, and memory cards. This decision comes after concerns that gadget prices could skyrocket, as many are manufactured in China. The White House indicated the exemptions were made to ensure companies had more time to move production to the US, though these electronics remain subject to a 20% tariff related to fentanyl.</p>

            <p>LSU head coach Brian Kelly commented on Nico Iamaleava's departure from Tennessee due to NIL contract disputes, predicting such situations will become more common. Heupel, Tennessee's head coach, cited Iamaleava's decision to skip practice during NIL negotiations as the cause for the split. Kelly believes changes are coming to NIL regulations as college sports navigate this new landscape. Some programs are forgoing spring games due to concerns about players entering the transfer portal or being enticed by other programs' NIL packages.</p>

            <p>A former co-worker of Rex Heuermann, the suspect in the Gilgo Beach serial killings, recounted an unnerving experience where he tracked her down on a cruise. She had booked a cruise vacation for her 40th birthday and Heuermann asked her where she was going. She told him, "I'm going to be in the middle of the ocean. You're not going to find me in the middle of the ocean." … He said," Oh, yes, I can." On the second day of her trip, she found a note from him that said, "I told you I could find you anywhere." Heuermann is charged with the murders of Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman, and Amber Costello and is the prime suspect in the death of Maureen Brainard-Barnes.</p>

            <p>Iran and the United States will hold further negotiations next week regarding Iran's nuclear program, as reported by Iranian state television following a round of talks in Oman.

President Trump stated that the talks were "going okay" but offered no further details. The negotiations are focused on sanctions relief and Iran's enrichment capabilities, with the U.S. seeking dismantlement of Iran's nuclear program.</p>

            <p>The UK government has taken control of British Steel's plant in Scunthorpe after the Chinese-owned company, Jingye, threatened closure due to financial losses. Parliament passed emergency legislation to ensure the plant's two blast furnaces continue operating, safeguarding the UK's ability to produce virgin steel. Jingye still owns the site, but the government now has sweeping powers to control management and workers to make sure production continues. The government intervened to secure raw materials needed to keep the furnaces running after Jingye sought an excessive amount of money for them, making nationalization a likely outcome.</p>

            <p>Big tech companies have secured a significant exemption from Donald Trump’s trade war as the US president exempted smartphones, computers and other electronics from the 125% levies imposed on imports from China as well as tariffs imposed on other countries. Experts had previously warned tariffs would cause electronic consumer prices to spike in the US, with Apple reportedly chartering cargo flights to bring in 600 tons of iPhones from India rather than China amid the cratering trade ties between the two countries. The move will benefit many countries in South-east Asia, for whom tech exports are a key part of their US trade.</p>

            <p>The Indian "pot belly," once a symbol of prosperity, is now a major health concern as obesity rates in India surge. A Lancet study warns that the number of overweight or obese adults could reach 450 million by 2050. Abdominal obesity, or excess fat around the belly, is linked to chronic conditions like Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Studies have found that South Asians, including Indians, tend to have more body fat than white Caucasians at the same Body Mass Index, increasing their risk of metabolic diseases.</p>

The show will feature British comedic talent and promise the same "live, fast-paced style" as its American cousin. The US show has been a springboard for comedic talents for 50 years, and attracts major young stars. Some experts believe that there are different comedic traditions, and that UK sketch groups often form through friendships and showcase their talent at the Edinburgh Fringe, whereas many US comedians train at improv and sketch clubs.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has informed a federal judge that Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man wrongly deported to El Salvador, is alive and detained in the country. Abrego Garcia is being held at El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center, according to a State Department filing. The filing follows a judge's order for daily updates on efforts to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. after the Supreme Court upheld her original order to bring him back.</p>

            <p>Amanda Knox claims she was stopped by police at a Seattle airport while boarding a flight to Dublin to promote her new memoir. She stated that officers questioned her about her past imprisonment for the murder of her roommate, of which she was acquitted in 2011 after spending four years in an Italian prison cell. Knox said she was asked what she did to end up in prison, to which she replied that she didn't do it. She said that police then questioned her about writing books and her podcast, which covers coercive police interview methods.</p>

            <p>The UK government's intervention to take control of British Steel is viewed as a temporary measure, with nationalization becoming increasingly likely. Emergency legislation was rushed through Parliament to secure raw materials and prevent the closure of the Scunthorpe plant. Concerns remain about the complexity of international supply chains and trading turmoil due to President Trump's tariffs. The government hopes to secure private investment, but public ownership is now the anticipated outcome.</p>

            <p>Rory McIlroy moved closer to finally winning the Masters with a commanding third-round performance which leaves him two shots clear going into Sunday's finale. The 35-year-old from Northern Ireland carded a six-under 66 - featuring two eagles - to head a star-stacked leaderboard with a score of 12 under after 54 holes. McIlroy's advantage looked destined to be bigger but the complexion of the task ahead changed when Bryson DeChambeau narrowed the gap with three birdies in his final four holes - including a 50-foot putt from the fringe of the 18th green.</p>

            <p>Scottie Scheffler, the world's No 1 golfer, is in the unfamiliar position of trying to scrap his way up past McIlroy, and everyone else in his way, into first place at the Masters. Scheffler played a good round of bad golf, in which he made a lot of mistakes and managed to scramble back from them over and again. He ended up in a bunker at the 2nd, the 4th, the 5th and the 7th, and somehow he still managed to come through the first nine in level par. At the 5th, Scheffler snapped. He hit his drive in the one place he wanted to avoid, towards the pair of big bunkers down the left side of the fairway.</p>

            <p>President Trump is urging Congress to pass legislation making daylight saving time permanent, eliminating the need to change clocks twice a year. He tweeted his support, citing its popularity and the cost savings for the government. This follows ongoing efforts in Congress, including the Sunshine Protection Act, to adopt daylight saving time permanently. While some support the change, others, including sleep experts, suggest a permanent standard time would be more beneficial for health and well-being.</p>
