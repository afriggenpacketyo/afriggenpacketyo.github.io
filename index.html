          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency, under the Trump administration, has announced a plan to end the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. This program, in place since 2009, mandates over 8,000 industrial facilities to report their emissions of gases like methane and carbon dioxide. The administration argues this move will save businesses billions in regulatory costs, while critics, including former EPA officials and health experts, warn it will obscure crucial pollution data needed for public health and climate policy decisions.</p>

          <h2>'Spinal Tap II' Sequel Falls Short of Original's Satirical Genius, Review Suggests</h2>

          <p>The long-awaited sequel, "Spinal Tap II: The End Continues," reunites the original cast but fails to recapture the magic of the 1984 mockumentary classic, according to this review. While offering some smiles of nostalgia, the film's reliance on celebrity cameos from figures like Paul McCartney and Elton John undermines the satirical tension that made the original a masterpiece. The review concludes that the sequel feels more like a collection of outtakes than a fresh comedic take, ultimately a nostalgia lap that lacks the original's sharp wit.</p>

          <p>The 33-hour manhunt for the suspect in Charlie Kirk's assassination ended with the arrest of 22-year-old Tyler Robinson. The breakthrough came after the suspect's father reportedly recognized him from FBI photos, leading to a confession and the family's cooperation with law enforcement. Investigators also uncovered messages on the Discord platform and found inscriptions on bullet casings, including "hey fascist! CATCH!", providing insight into a potential motive for the attack on the conservative figure.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has placed an agent on administrative leave and revoked his security clearance after he made negative comments about Charlie Kirk on Facebook following the activist's death. The agent, Anthony Pough, wrote that Kirk had "spewed hate" and was facing "karma." In a memo to staff, Secret Service Director Sean Curran emphasized that agents must remain politically unbiased and that actions drawing public attention for the wrong reasons will not be tolerated.</p>

          <p>Stellantis has officially canceled the development of its all-electric Ram 1500 pickup truck, citing a slowdown in consumer demand for battery electric vehicles in North America. The project had already faced multiple delays. Instead of a fully electric model, the company will focus on launching an extended-range version next year, which will be named the Ram 1500 REV and includes a gasoline engine to generate electricity. This move reflects a broader reassessment of EV strategy under new leadership at Stellantis.</p>

          <p>A significant water supply failure at the U.S. naval base in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, has forced the relocation of detained migrants and raised further doubts about the facility's capacity. The disruption, caused by damage to an underwater pipeline, affected the Migrant Operations Center, prompting officials to move migrants to a different part of the base. Critics argue this infrastructure failure demonstrates that the base is ill-equipped to handle the large number of migrants the Trump administration intends to send there.</p>

          <p>The state of Massachusetts has filed a lawsuit against the predictions market platform Kalshi, alleging that it is operating as an illegal sports gambling business without the required license. Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell stated that Kalshi's "events contracts" on sports outcomes constitute sports wagering and must comply with state laws. Kalshi, which is regulated by the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission, has previously argued that its federal oversight supersedes state-level gaming regulations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis notes that in the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination, leading Democratic figures have been united and unequivocal in their condemnation of the attack and political violence. Despite this, some on the right have focused on isolated, anonymous social media posts to claim the left is celebrating the killing. The article argues this reflects a structural difference between the parties, with Democrats marginalizing violent sentiment while President Trump has appeared to justify right-wing radicalism as a response to crime.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the significant political and cultural impact of the late Charlie Kirk, particularly on Gen Z. It credits him and his organization, Turning Point USA, with redefining conservatism for a younger generation, making it a "cool" cultural identity and building a massive grassroots network on college campuses. Kirk's mastery of the modern media landscape and his willingness to engage in controversial debates tapped into Gen Z's rejection of establishment norms, creating a lasting influence that will likely persist after his death.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is urging a federal appeals court to overturn a ruling that prevents President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The administration wants a decision before a key interest rate meeting next week, arguing the president has broad authority to remove officials "for cause." Trump moved to fire Cook, a Biden appointee, over allegations of misrepresentation on mortgage documents, a charge her attorney calls unsubstantiated, amid the president's ongoing public pressure on the Fed to lower interest rates.
