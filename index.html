          <p>Apple is experiencing a notable divergence in its strategic initiatives, celebrating the box office success of its blockbuster film "F1," which highlights its strong services growth and cultural influence. However, this victory is juxtaposed with significant struggles in its artificial intelligence division, particularly with its "Apple Intelligence" suite. Wall Street and consumers are increasingly concerned by the underwhelming progress of Siri compared to competitors like OpenAI and Google, which have more sophisticated AI assistants. The company faces pressure to innovate its AI capabilities to maintain its market leadership, as its current strategy in this area appears less clear than its successful entertainment ventures.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 11:25:03 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The devastating flash floods in Texas were caused by extreme rainfall, with some areas receiving over 20 inches of rain over the holiday weekend. This deluge, fueled by remnant moisture from what was formerly Tropical Storm Barry, fell on the dry, packed soil of the Texas Hill Country, which is naturally prone to rapid runoff. The Guadalupe River's north and south forks were overwhelmed simultaneously, causing the river to swell by 26 feet in just 45 minutes during the predawn hours. Forecasters warn that the already saturated region could see several more inches of rain, maintaining a high risk of further flash flooding.</p>

          <p>Lithuania's central bank, Robinhood's lead regulator in the EU, is investigating the company's new tokenized stock offerings following a public warning from OpenAI. Robinhood recently launched a product allowing EU users to invest in private companies like OpenAI and SpaceX through blockchain-based tokens. However, OpenAI stated it did not partner with Robinhood, did not approve any equity transfer, and warned that the tokens are not actual OpenAI equity. The regulatory inquiry will assess the legality and compliance of these instruments and the clarity of information provided to consumers, adding pressure to Robinhood's venture into private market access.

          <p>A new tax and spending bill, touted as eliminating federal income taxes on Social Security, does not actually remove the tax but instead introduces a new temporary deduction for seniors. The legislation creates a "bonus" deduction of up to $6,000 for individuals and $12,000 for couples over 65 with incomes below certain thresholds, which is set to expire in 2028. Policy experts clarify that this provides some relief but primarily benefits higher-income seniors, while doing little for low-income recipients who already pay no federal tax. Critics also raise concerns that the measure could further strain Social Security's finances by reducing federal revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

Some experts lean toward 1-year CDs, which offer flexibility and the chance to reassess as the Federal Reserve is projected to cut rates within the next 18 months. This option is ideal for those with short-term savings goals. Conversely, 5-year CDs are recommended for individuals who don't need immediate access to their funds, such as those nearing retirement, as they can lock in current high yields for a longer period. The consensus is that the best choice depends on an individual's financial goals, timeline, and risk tolerance. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite Apple boosting production in other countries like India, experts argue a complete move to the U.S. is infeasible and would drastically increase product costs.</p>

          <p>Bayern Munich's participation in the Club World Cup ended in disappointment with a quarterfinal loss to Paris St. Germain, continuing a trend of defeats against top European clubs. The loss was compounded by a severe injury to star player Jamal Musiala, who suffered a fractured leg and dislocated ankle and will be out for months. This setback highlights the club's recent struggles in the transfer market, having failed to secure top targets like Florian Wirtz. With Musiala's absence, pressure is mounting on sporting director Max Eberl to strengthen the squad, though he has faced challenges in both acquiring new talent and generating income from sales.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Mark Green of Tennessee has officially announced his resignation from Congress, effective July 20, further shrinking the GOP's already slim majority in the House of Representatives. Green, who chairs the Homeland Security Committee, stated he is leaving to start a private sector business aimed at helping America compete against the Chinese Communist Party. His departure reduces the Republican majority to 219-212, which could create additional challenges for House Speaker Mike Johnson in passing legislation. Green's seat is in a solidly Republican district, but it will remain vacant until a special election is held, temporarily tightening the margins for the majority party.</p>

          <p>Apple has filed an appeal against a 500 million euro fine from the European Union, which the company called "unprecedented." The European Commission imposed the penalty in April, ruling that Apple had violated the Digital Markets Act (DMA) by restricting app developers from informing users about cheaper offers outside the App Store. Apple argues that the EU is mandating how it runs its store with business terms that are confusing for developers and harmful to users. This legal battle is a significant test of the DMA's power to regulate major tech platforms and their control over their ecosystems, with companies like Spotify and Epic Games closely watching.</p>

Starovoyt, the former governor of the Kursk region, had been appointed transport minister only last year. His dismissal and subsequent death come amid turmoil in the Kursk region, where his successor as governor was detained for fraud related to misused funds for border fortifications, and Russian airports have faced chaos from frequent Ukrainian drone attacks.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to extend statutory bereavement leave to parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy. Currently, paid leave is only available for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. The new proposal would provide at least one week of unpaid leave, recognizing the grief and loss associated with early miscarriages. Campaigners, including Labour MP Sarah Owen and broadcaster Myleene Klass, have praised the move as a huge step forward in acknowledging this type of loss as a bereavement rather than an illness. The exact details of the policy will be determined following a consultation, but it aims to ensure no one has to return to work before they are ready.</p>

The issue is highlighted by incidents where a legislator makes a confusing or nonsensical comment to a reporter, only for their staff to walk it back or contradict it later. This creates a conundrum for reporters, who must balance their duty to report a lawmaker's performance with the need for accuracy and the risk of being accused of playing "gotcha" politics. While some interactions are newsworthy indicators of a lawmaker's fitness for office, others can create confusing news cycles, with no clear consensus on the best approach.</p>

The threat adds another layer of complexity to the administration's ongoing trade negotiations, as a July 9 deadline for deals has been extended to August 1.

A boss's apology should acknowledge what went wrong and present a clear plan to fix the issue and prevent its recurrence. Waiting too long can signal a lack of care, while speaking too quickly without a plan can erode credibility. Experts stress that leaders must sound human and show vulnerability without making the apology about themselves. Using passive language, reading from a script without emotion, or failing to take ownership can make an apology seem disingenuous, ultimately harming trust and company morale.</p>
