          <p>Rahm Emanuel's Wall Street Journal article argues that China could restore internal cohesion to American politics by serving as an external threat.  The article critiques Emanuel's premise, arguing that this perspective ignores the complexities of US-China relations and overlooks alternative explanations for domestic political divisions.  It challenges Emanuel's assertion of a “China threat” and suggests that his analysis is overly simplistic and potentially misleading. The article suggests that the author of the opinion piece is not considering alternative views of the situation.</p>
