          <p>A federal judge has extended a temporary block on President Trump's proclamation that would prohibit foreign Harvard University students from entering the U.S. until next Monday. Harvard's lawyers argued that Trump's proclamation violates its First Amendment rights and is outside the authority of the executive branch, claiming it is retaliation and viewpoint discrimination against the institution after Harvard publicly refused to comply with demands made by the Trump administration. The government argued it does not trust Harvard to vet, host, monitor, or discipline foreigners, citing concerns about Harvard's "foreign entanglements" with the Chinese government. The judge questioned the government's arguments, stating that the concerns raised likely apply to more than just Harvard.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reiterated his intention to expand deportations in major U.S. cities, particularly those governed by Democrats, and he stated that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) should focus on cities like New York and Chicago in addition to Los Angeles. Trump accused Democrats of using illegal immigration to influence elections and grow the Welfare State, despite noncitizens not being able to vote in federal or state elections. This announcement follows nationwide protests against the administration's immigration crackdown. Trump also acknowledged that his aggressive policy was taking away long-time workers from the farming and hospitality industries, leading to new guidance to pause raids on farms, restaurants, and hotels.</p>

          <p>In the Sean "Diddy" Combs trial regarding sex trafficking and racketeering, a juror was dismissed due to inconsistent statements about his residency and replaced with an alternate. The court raised serious concerns about the juror's candor and whether he shaded answers to get on, and stay on the jury. The trial resumed with testimony from a paralegal detailing messages sent by Combs' personal assistant, some of which referred to setting up a "hotel night." Summary witnesses also testified about data records, credit card statements, and phone calls. The prosecution is nearing the end of its case, with Combs pleading not guilty and facing a potential life sentence if convicted.</p>

The agreement includes a golden share for the U.S. government, granting the president veto power over decisions to relocate U.S. Steel's headquarters, move the company outside the U.S., rename U.S. Steel, transfer production or jobs outside the U.S., and close or idle plants before certain time frames. While Trump refers to the deal as a "partnership," U.S. Steel will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America.

          <p>The New Jersey Supreme Court has ruled that a grand jury can investigate allegations of clergy sexually abusing children, after the Camden diocese reversed its long-standing opposition. The diocese previously argued that a court rule prevented the state attorney general from impaneling a grand jury, but the new bishop ended the church's opposition. The court concluded the state has the right to proceed with its investigation and present evidence before a special grand jury. The Camden diocese has committed to cooperating with the effort, and the state attorney general's office praised the decision and reiterated its support for survivors of sexual abuse.</p>

Personal lines of credit may also offer lower interest rates than credit cards, especially for those with good credit.

          <p>At Home, a home decor and furniture retailer with over 200 locations, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company aims to eliminate $2 billion in debt and secure $200 million in capital for restructuring. Twenty-six At Home stores across the U.S. are scheduled to close. The company, owned by Hellman & Friedman, has been struggling with rising tariffs and entered a forbearance agreement with lenders after missing an interest payment. The company expects to transition ownership to its lenders, and voluntary Chapter 11 proceedings are taking place at the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.</p>

          <p>Vance Luther Boelter, accused of killing Melissa Hortman and her husband and injuring John Hoffman and his wife, allegedly attempted to kill two other state lawmakers, according to Minnesota officials. Boelter, disguised as a police officer, visited the homes of three other state lawmakers, with one lawmaker being on vacation and another encountering Boelter before he went to the Hortman residence. Officials say Boelter had planned his attack carefully, researching the victims and their families. Boelter faces six federal charges, some of which make him eligible for the death penalty.</p>

The proposal comes after incidents of federal officers covering their faces during raids in various California cities.</p>

The groups say the requirements are at odds with federal laws that require them not to discriminate on the basis of gender identity, to aid underserved racial and ethnic groups, and to emphasize immigrants with some programs and not to discriminate based on legal status.
