          <p>Actor Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson has garnered significant fan attention after debuting a noticeably leaner physique at the Venice Film Festival. He was in Italy to promote his new film, "The Smashing Machine," in which he portrays former MMA fighter Mark Kerr. The role required a significant physical transformation, including hours in makeup and prosthetics, and has already generated awards buzz for the actor, who expressed a hunger to take on more dramatic roles beyond his action-star typecasting.</p>

          <p>Baroness Sue Gray, a Labour peer and former senior civil servant, has questioned the UK government's plan to restrict a key civil service internship scheme exclusively to students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. While acknowledging the good intentions, Gray argued from her own working-class background that she learned a great deal from exposure to people from different walks of life. She called for the evidence base behind the decision, suggesting that while opening up the civil service is important, this specific method may be counterproductive.</p>

The Orange County Sheriff’s Department credited the community for reporting the suspicious activity, emphasizing that such vigilance can prevent potential crimes before they occur and highlighting the importance of the "if you see something, say something" principle.</p>

          <p>In a sharply critical op-ed, nine former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have condemned Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s leadership. They argue his recent actions, including the firing of CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez, are undermining the nation's public health system. The former leaders, who served under both Republican and Democratic administrations, claim Kennedy's decisions are driven by politics over science and are creating a crisis at the vital public health agency.</p>

          <p>In a departure from the standard "evacuate immediately" protocol, the Los Angeles County Fire Chief is now supporting the idea of training some residents to stay and defend their homes during wildfires. Chief Anthony Marrone acknowledged the hard reality that there will never be enough firefighters to protect every structure in massive, fast-moving blazes. The new approach emphasizes that with proper training, equipment, and home hardening, homeowners can become a crucial part of the firefighting effort and save their properties.</p>

This measure, mandated by Congress in 2018, is designed to prevent unauthorized entry during critical moments, such as when pilots need to use the lavatory, providing more robust protection than the beverage carts currently used by flight attendants.</p>

The 1878 law generally bars the use of the military for domestic policing. The judge's opinion detailed how the administration attempted to circumvent the law with a memo creating a "constitutional exception," an argument the court dismissed as not grounded in history, jurisprudence, or common sense, and warned of its dangerous implications.</p>

          <p>Popular tourist destinations from Mexico City to Barcelona are experiencing a rise in protests as local residents voice their anger over the negative impacts of overtourism. Demonstrators are targeting travelers with slogans like "Gringos leave," citing soaring housing costs, crowded public spaces, and the erosion of local culture driven by an influx of digital nomads and tourists. Experts note that while these confrontations can raise awareness, they often lead to symbolic policy changes rather than addressing the root causes of the problem.</p>

          <p>While a federal judge ruled the Trump administration's use of the National Guard in Los Angeles was illegal, testimony from the trial revealed a more subtle threat to democratic norms. Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman testified that a federal official questioned his "loyalty to the country" for hesitating over the legality of a proposed operation. This exchange highlights a growing pressure on military leaders to prioritize personal fealty to the president over their constitutional oaths, a trend that experts warn is eroding critical military independence.</p>

          <p>Court documents related to the death of actor Matthew Perry have revealed details of an underground drug network that supplied him with ketamine.

          <p>Following a market decline driven by profit-taking in major tech stocks, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to maintain confidence in the strong companies they own for long-term growth. He attributed the pullback to typical September profit-taking by institutions and broader investor anxiety over a recent tariff ruling and the upcoming jobs report. Cramer cautioned against panic selling, suggesting that for well-researched portfolios, such downturns are "garden-variety pullbacks" and not a sign of fundamental weakness in market-leading companies.

          <p>The landslide victory of Zack Polanski as the new leader of the Green Party of England and Wales represents a significant shift in the UK's political landscape. His blunt, digitally-savvy, and left-leaning style poses a new challenge for the Labour Party, which is already facing pressure from other factions on the left. Polanski's leadership could potentially attract disillusioned voters but also risks narrowing the party's appeal in more conservative rural areas where it recently gained ground, creating a strategic dilemma for the Greens.</p>

While Allen noted that he disagrees with nearly all of Trump's politics and voted for Kamala Harris, his praise for Trump's professionalism and charisma was met with criticism. The incident is seen as part of a trend where figures like Allen and Maher normalize a controversial political leader, separating the persona from the political actions.</p>

While the odds of winning are 1 in 292.2 million, the final payout is impacted by state income taxes on top of the mandatory 37% federal tax. Winners in states with no income tax like Florida or Texas would receive significantly more than those in high-tax states like New York, which has the lowest after-tax payout for lottery prizes in the country.

          <p>The arrest of Irish comedy writer Graham Linehan in Britain for allegedly "inciting violence" with online posts critical of transgender activism has intensified concerns about free speech in Europe. Critics argue that broad hate-speech and harassment laws are being selectively enforced, turning police into arbiters of progressive values and creating a chilling effect on public discourse. The case exemplifies a wider debate over whether such laws, intended to protect minorities, are now being used to silence political opponents and create a perception of "two-tier justice."</p>
