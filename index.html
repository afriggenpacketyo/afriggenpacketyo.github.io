          <p>Iran held a large state funeral in Tehran for approximately 60 individuals, including high-ranking military commanders and nuclear scientists, who were killed during a recent 12-day conflict with Israel. The ceremony was attended by large crowds and prominent officials, including Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian. Among the dead were Mohammad Bagheri, chief of staff of Iran's armed forces, and Hossein Salami, head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards. The event follows a ceasefire and occurs amid escalating rhetoric, with U.S. President Donald Trump not ruling out further military action against Iran's nuclear program.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions rugby team began their Australian tour with a commanding 54-7 win against the Western Force in Perth. Despite a competitive first half where the Force maintained significant possession, the Lions were more clinical, leading 21-7 at the break. The tourists pulled away in the second half, scoring a total of eight tries in front of a record rugby crowd of 46,656. The decisive victory was slightly marred by a worrying hamstring injury to scrum-half Tomos Williams, who had scored two tries before being forced off the field.</p>

          <p>In a 6-3 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled against the use of nationwide injunctions, a significant change in the remedial powers of lower federal courts. The case, Trump v. Casa, concerned an executive order on birthright citizenship, but the ruling focused solely on the scope of judicial relief, not the order's constitutionality. Justice Amy Coney Barrett's majority opinion argued that such broad injunctions are a recent invention with no historical basis. While this ends the practice, the Court left open other avenues for broad relief, such as class-action lawsuits and providing "complete relief" to plaintiffs, which could still have a nationwide effect.</p>

          <p>Arizona Diamondbacks player Ketel Marte has disclosed the comment from a fan that brought him to tears during a recent game in Chicago. Marte stated that a fan shouted he had "sent a message to your mother last night," a deeply painful taunt as Marte's mother died in a car accident in 2017. The 22-year-old fan has since been banned indefinitely from all MLB stadiums and has reportedly expressed remorse. Marte, who was comforted on the field by his manager, expressed gratitude for the support he later received from fans at a home game.</p>

          <p>This opinion article from Fox News argues that major news networks are displaying bias by not labeling New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani as "extreme" or a "socialist," a label they frequently apply to conservatives. The author claims that networks like ABC, CBS, and NBC have framed Mamdani's progressive platform in positive or neutral terms, focusing on his charisma and populist ideas while downplaying his anti-Israel rhetoric. The piece contrasts this with what it describes as the media's readiness to label Republicans as "ultraconservative," suggesting a double standard in political coverage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Zohran Mamdani's upset victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary is being credited to the power of the grassroots Palestinian liberation movement. This opinion piece argues that his vocal support for Palestine, once a political liability, became a key asset due to a shift in public opinion driven by sustained activism. The campaign successfully mobilized a coalition of progressive organizers, students, and groups like Jewish Voice for Peace, who were already engaged in opposing establishment politics. Mamdani's win is presented as evidence that a pro-Palestinian stance can now be central to a winning domestic political campaign.</p>

          <p>LGBTQ advocates argue the Trump administration is employing a "divide and conquer" strategy by primarily targeting transgender rights, aiming to create division within the broader community. Since taking office, President Trump has issued executive orders to limit gender identity recognition on official documents and has targeted diversity initiatives, mirroring the conservative Project 2025 agenda. Critics contend these actions, along with anti-trans rhetoric, create a hostile environment and threaten hard-won protections, while some conservative gay groups defend the administration, arguing the policies do not affect them.</p>

          <p>Recent Israeli covert actions against Iran, including assassinations and sabotage, are causing alarm among security analysts in Taiwan. Experts fear that China could replicate these sophisticated intelligence and infiltration tactics against the island. Taiwan's geographic proximity and deep cultural ties with mainland China are seen as vulnerabilities that could allow Chinese intelligence to operate more easily. The concern is that Beijing may be laying the groundwork for a similar campaign of covert warfare, having already penetrated Taiwan's political and defense sectors.</p>

          <p>As it turns 20, Reddit is confronting the existential threat posed by AI chatbots that scrape its user-generated content for training data. The company is fighting back by suing AI firms like Anthropic for unfair business practices while also licensing its data to others like Google and OpenAI. To compete directly, Reddit has launched its own AI tool, Reddit Answers, which generates responses based solely on conversations from its platform, providing a direct link to human discussions. This strategy bets on the enduring value of authentic human interaction over the "annotated sterile answers from AI."</p>

          <p>China's recent decision to halt exports of heavy rare earth elements has highlighted its dominance over the global supply chain and created panic within the auto industry. These minerals are essential for manufacturing both gasoline and electric vehicles, used in components from catalytic converters to motors and batteries. While China mines 70% of the world's rare earths, it controls about 90% of the complex processing, giving it a powerful economic lever. The export restrictions have already caused factory shutdowns for some European automakers and Ford, signaling a volatile future for industries dependent on these critical materials.</p>

The trend is bolstered by growing regulatory clarity, such as the Senate's GENIUS Act, which sets guidelines for issuers.

          <p>This analysis posits that the global economy is experiencing a rare, fundamental transformation akin to the shift that occurred after the Great Depression. The author argues that the era of American-led globalization is ending, driven by a turn towards right-wing populism and economic nationalism, catalyzed by figures like Donald Trump. This "reboot" involves changing not just economic policies (software) but the underlying institutions and markets (hardware). The article suggests we are in a contested period where the new governing ideas for capitalism are being decided, with competing visions from the populist right, techno-futurists, and a fractured left.</p>

          <p>Rongjiang county in China's southwestern Guizhou province is preparing for another deluge after record-breaking floods recently killed at least six people. Authorities have ordered evacuations in several areas as more heavy rain is forecast. Earlier in the week, the county was hit by "exceptionally large floods" that inundated low-lying areas, damaged infrastructure, and set new records for rainfall and water levels. The region's largest shopping center was submerged before the floodwaters began to recede, but the new threat has renewed emergency measures.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is scheduled to hold a crucial procedural vote on President Trump's major tax and spending package, though its passage remains uncertain due to internal Republican disputes. The sprawling bill proposes cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs to fund tax reductions and priorities in immigration and defense. However, disagreements over the extent of Medicaid cuts and other provisions persist, and the Senate parliamentarian has ruled that some controversial sections violate budget reconciliation rules, forcing last-minute changes to the legislation.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has declared that reforming the nation's benefits system is a "moral imperative," calling it broken and failing. His statement at the Welsh Labour Party conference comes after a backbench revolt forced his government to soften planned cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip). While the government conceded that stricter criteria would only apply to new claimants, some Labour MPs and the Unite union are pushing for the entire proposal to be dropped. Starmer insists on the need for reform to prevent benefits from becoming a "snare" for those who can work.</p>

While he has largely avoided politics to focus on the family business, he expressed being "wholly unimpressed" by many current politicians.

Advocates say the timing is catastrophic, as Afghanistan faces widespread food shortages and curtailed international aid following the Taliban's takeover.

The report found that nearly 40% of workers have taken a second job or accepted positions they weren't interested in simply to manage their debts, which most commonly include credit card balances, mortgages, and auto loans. This financial pressure is preventing some from pursuing aspirations like starting a business or returning to school. Experts advise that while a side job can be a short-term fix, focusing on long-term income growth through raises, promotions, or upskilling is a more sustainable strategy.</p>

This historic shift involves a constitutional change to suspend Germany's "debt brake," allowing for nearly $400 billion in defense spending by 2029 without cutting social programs.

          <p>This article revisits the 1972 murder conviction of Elmer "Geronimo" Pratt, a Black Panther leader in Los Angeles, a case that his lawyer, Johnnie Cochran Jr., believed was a politically motivated frame-up. Pratt was convicted based on the testimony of a witness later revealed to be an FBI informant, part of the COINTELPRO campaign to neutralize Black nationalist groups. After 27 years in prison, eight in solitary confinement, Pratt's conviction was overturned in 1997 when courts found that prosecutors had hidden critical evidence. The case stands as a stark example of official corruption and the fight to undo a profound injustice.</p>

          <h2>California Uses 19th-Century Law to Challenge Trump's Use of Troops for Law Enforcement</h2>

          <p>California is leveraging a law from the Reconstruction era, the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, in its legal battle to limit President Trump's use of military troops for immigration enforcement in Los Angeles. The act forbids the use of the military for civilian law enforcement, and a federal judge has ordered the government to provide evidence regarding the troops' activities. The law was originally passed by Southern Democrats to end the use of federal troops in protecting Black voters, effectively enabling the Jim Crow era. Now, California is using this law with a complex history to argue against federal overreach.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: The LGBTQ+ Movement's Strength Lies in its Diversity, Not Respectability</h2>

          <p>This opinion column pushes back against recent efforts by conservative gay figures, like Richard Grenell, to promote a form of "respectability politics" by distancing "normal gays" from transgender issues. The author argues that the spirit of Pride has always been rooted in its diversity and the contributions of its most marginalized members, including the drag queens and gender-nonconforming individuals who initiated the Stonewall Riots. The piece asserts that progress for the LGBTQ+ community has never come from a monolithic, heteronormative front, and that attempts to create such a divide are disingenuous and harmful.</p>

          <h2>Burglary Ring Repeatedly Robs California Home, Leading to Bear Infestation</h2>

          <p>Authorities in Butte County, California, have charged 11 people in connection with a burglary ring that repeatedly ransacked a woman's remote home, causing her to flee in fear. The repeated break-ins caused such extensive damage to the property that a group of bears was able to move in, exacerbating the destruction. The 64-year-old homeowner first reported a burglary in April, but the thieves returned multiple times. Investigators have arrested 11 suspects and identified six others in a case that highlights a bizarre intersection of crime and wildlife intrusion.</p>
