          <p>Qualcomm has announced its plan to re-enter the data center market with new processors designed for artificial intelligence, specifically engineered to link with Nvidia's GPUs. This move marks a significant diversification strategy for Qualcomm, traditionally known for smartphone processors, as it ventures into chips for cars and PCs. CEO Cristiano Amon highlighted that over 85 PC designs are in development using Snapdragon X Series chips. Qualcomm's new chips are being promoted for their power efficiency and ability to run AI processes on-device, enhancing speed and security by reducing reliance on cloud processing.

          <p>In Fremont, Ohio, a train struck two women walking on a railway bridge, resulting in their deaths, according to Mayor Danny Sanchez. Authorities are conducting an overnight search for a 5-year-old child who went missing after the incident. A 1-year-old child was rescued from the Sandusky River and hospitalized, though their condition remains unclear. The victims were part of a family visiting from Fort Wayne, Indiana, to fish in the Sandusky River, a popular spot for white bass fishing during the spring, the article reports.

          <p>Satellite imagery reveals that Russian forces are expanding military infrastructure near the Finnish border, a move that NATO officials are closely monitoring. The build-up includes new tents, warehouses for military vehicles, renovated fighter jet shelters, and increased activity at a helicopter base. While officials state this is not on the scale of the build-up before the Ukraine invasion, it reflects Russia's perception of threat following Finland's NATO membership. Finnish defense officials anticipate Russia will redeploy thousands of troops to the border once the high-intensity phase of the Ukraine war subsides, potentially tripling the number of Russian troops stationed there.</p>

          <p>An Iraqi couple, accused of being members of the "Islamic State" (IS) militant group, are set to face trial in Germany for allegedly enslaving two Yazidi girls. The couple is charged with genocide, human trafficking, and crimes against humanity for allegedly holding the girls captive in Iraq and Syria, subjecting them to forced labor, sexual assault, humiliation, and torture. Prosecutors argue that these actions were part of IS's systematic sexual assault of Yazidi women and girls, aimed at dismantling the group's continuity and identity.

The author asserts that China's strategic investments in industries like AI, electric vehicles, and robotics, coupled with a supportive state-driven economic policy, are creating a 'Chinese century.' In contrast, the author contends that the U.S., under its current administration, is undermining its own strengths through tariffs, cuts in research funding, and a disregard for global markets.
