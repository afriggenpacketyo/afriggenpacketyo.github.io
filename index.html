        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses how China and Russia are reinterpreting the history of World War II to challenge the existing post-war global order. By framing the war as a two-front struggle where they bore the primary burden of defeating fascism, they aim to position themselves as inheritors of the anti-fascist tradition. This narrative downplays the role of the US and other Allied nations, emphasizing the Asian and European fronts where China and the Soviet Union resisted Japanese militarism and Nazi aggression. The strategy seeks to reshape the world order established after 1989, questioning the US hegemony in international law and the role of smaller nations within that system.</p>

          <p>Cassie Ventura testified in the Sean Combs sexual assault trial, detailing disturbing experiences, including being forced to participate in "freak offs" with male escorts while Combs watched. She described how Combs allegedly hired escorts and paid them up to $6,000, wanting her to evaluate the men to ensure they were not police officers. Ventura stated that she used drugs at all the "freak offs" as a way to cope with the experience, needing a buffer to not feel emotion or the act of sexual activity with strangers she didn't want to be with. She also recounted asking Combs for drugs in advance of these encounters.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has changed the league's policy on permanent ineligibility, allowing bans to expire upon death, leading to the reinstatement of Pete Rose, "Shoeless" Joe Jackson, and 15 other players. Rose was banned for betting on baseball, while Jackson was implicated in the 1919 Black Sox scandal. The Hall of Fame will now consider these players, though induction is not guaranteed due to character clause considerations. This decision comes after years of debate and petitions, potentially opening the door for posthumous recognition of their contributions to the sport.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) acknowledged that as few as three radar controllers were monitoring Newark's airspace on a recent Monday night, despite a target of 14, due to an ongoing national shortage of air traffic controllers. This staffing issue has contributed to flight cancellations and delays at Newark Liberty International Airport. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy emphasized that safety is the priority, even if it means reducing the number of flights. The FAA is working to address these challenges, including technological upgrades and initiatives to improve staffing levels, although some experts believe the system is still operating safely.</p>

          <p>Ross Douthat's article explores the concept of successful right-wing art, questioning whether art can be inherently political or if the artist's role is simply to present truth. He references Christopher Scalia's book, which encourages conservatives to appreciate literary culture for its philosophical insights. Douthat argues that both right-wing and left-wing perspectives can capture aspects of reality in a non-propagandistic way, citing V.S. Naipaul's novels and the "Star Wars" series "Andor" as examples. He concludes that politically themed art succeeds when it unsettles viewers and conveys unexpected truths, fostering sympathy for different worldviews.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has strengthened the US-Saudi relationship during his visit to Saudi Arabia, announcing a $142 billion arms deal and other investments potentially worth $1 trillion. Speaking in Riyadh, Trump also declared the US would lift sanctions on Syria to give the country "a chance at greatness". The visit was marked by lavish ceremonies and praise for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Trump emphasized that economic development and commerce are key to transcending violence and division in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has repeatedly stated he would not cut Medicaid, but a House Republican bill to fund his agenda proposes significant cuts to the program. The bill includes work requirements, more frequent eligibility checks, and penalties for states offering Medicaid to undocumented immigrants. While Trump has claimed the administration is only targeting "fraud" and "abuse," the Congressional Budget Office estimates the proposal would result in millions losing health insurance. This discrepancy highlights the tension between Trump's promises and the actions of his party in Congress.</p>
