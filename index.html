          <p>Approximately 400 passengers on a high-speed train from Vienna to Hamburg were stranded inside a tunnel for over six hours due to a power failure. The outage disabled the air conditioning and lighting, creating a hot and dark environment for those aboard. The evacuation was prolonged when some passengers attempted to walk out of the tunnel, forcing a power shutdown for safety reasons. Ultimately, all passengers were safely evacuated by bus back to Vienna, with two receiving on-site medical treatment but no hospitalizations.</p>

          <p>The Cincinnati Bengals have officially signed first-round draft pick Shemar Stewart, ending a contentious months-long contract dispute. Stewart, a defensive end from Texas A&M, had held out over disagreements regarding the structure of future guarantees in his rookie deal. The conflict involved public statements from both the player and team executives, with Stewart not participating in training camp. The newly signed contract is a fully guaranteed $18.97 million deal, making him the final 2025 first-round pick to sign.</p>

          <p>An American Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 8, bound for Miami, was evacuated on the runway at Denver International Airport after a landing gear incident during takeoff. All 173 passengers and six crew members were safely deplaned and transported back to the terminal. The airline later confirmed a maintenance issue with a tire, and the fire department extinguished a related fire. While operations were temporarily disrupted with a ground stop, the airport has since returned to normal, and passengers will continue on a replacement aircraft.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge has been placed on the injured list with a flexor strain in his right elbow, but an MRI revealed no acute damage to his ulnar collateral ligament. This news came as a relief, as it avoids a potentially season-ending injury for the two-time AL MVP. Judge, who leads the majors in several offensive categories, received a PRP injection and is expected to be out for 10 to 14 days. He hopes to return initially as a designated hitter once the strain has healed.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in 20 to 30 years, with average July temperatures running below normal and daytime highs struggling to pass the mid-60s. Meteorologists attribute the chill to a misplaced high-pressure system and increased coastal upwelling, which brings cold ocean water to the surface, cooling the air. This has resulted in persistent gray, drizzly weather, contrasting sharply with the oppressive heat seen in other parts of California. While some residents are enjoying the temperate conditions, climatologists warn that the region's hottest months are often still to come.</p>

The outcome of this case, and several others, could invalidate many of the trade deals and tariffs enacted during his term.

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi completed a two-day visit to the Maldives aimed at reinforcing diplomatic and economic relations with the island nation. The visit comes after a period of strained ties, as Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu was elected on a pro-China platform and previously secured the withdrawal of Indian military personnel. During the visit, Modi announced a $565 million credit line and inaugurated several India-funded infrastructure projects. The diplomatic effort is seen as a strategic move by India to counteract growing Chinese influence in the key Indian Ocean region.</p>

          <p>England's hopes for victory against India in the fourth Test are clouded by uncertainty over captain Ben Stokes' fitness. After taking five wickets in the first innings, Stokes did not bowl on day four, with the team's assistant coach citing stiffness and soreness. Stokes, who has a history of injuries and recently had hamstring surgery, appeared weary in the field, raising concerns about his ability to bowl on the final day. His availability is crucial for England's attack as they push to win the match at Old Trafford.</p>

          <p>President Trump's response to a question about a potential pardon for convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell has drawn sharp criticism. When asked, Trump stated it was something he was "allowed to do" but had "not thought about," an answer one CNN analyst called a botch of the "easiest question in human history." Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of underage girls. The non-committal answer has fueled speculation and bewilderment, given the severity of Maxwell's crimes.</p>

Speaking ahead of the Euro 2025 final, Chadha said the success of England's Lionesses and the growth of women's football made it a good time to revisit the characters. The original film, starring Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley, was a cultural hit credited with inspiring a generation of female players. Chadha is targeting a 2027 release to coincide with the film's 25th anniversary.</p>

          <p>An attempt to create a safer environment for aid distribution in Gaza by holding a "women only" day ended in tragedy with at least two women killed.
