          <p>China's economy grew by 5.2% in the second quarter, exceeding economists' predictions and keeping the nation on course to meet its annual 5% growth target. Despite this, signs of weakness persist, with retail sales growth slowing and the real estate market continuing to struggle. The stronger-than-expected GDP figure may reduce immediate pressure on policymakers to implement large-scale stimulus measures. Officials acknowledged the need to boost domestic consumption and support the property sector to ensure sustainable growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia has announced it expects to soon resume sales of its H20 artificial intelligence chips to China, after receiving assurances from the U.S. government that export licenses will be granted. The sales were previously halted in April due to U.S. export controls designed to limit Beijing's access to advanced technology. The potential reversal follows lobbying efforts by CEO Jensen Huang, who argued the restrictions were harming American tech leadership. This development is seen as a significant positive for Nvidia, potentially boosting its market share in China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Japanese Government Bond Yields Reach Multi-Decade Highs Amid Fiscal Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 00:35:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's 10-year government bond yield has surged to its highest point since 2008, driven by mounting concerns over the country's fiscal stability ahead of an upcoming election. Political discussions around potential consumption tax cuts have fueled investor anxiety about Japan's massive public debt. This uncertainty is creating doubt about the government's commitment to fiscal discipline, prompting what some analysts call a reaction from "bond vigilantes." The situation is compounded by underlying factors that could lead the Bank of Japan to implement another rate hike sooner than anticipated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Intense storms on Monday night triggered flash flood warnings and caused significant disruption across the New York City area, including parts of New Jersey and Westchester County. Heavy rainfall led to flooded subway stations, severely delaying transit services and prompting officials to ask commuters to postpone travel. Roads and highways became impassable, with numerous vehicles stalled and requiring rescue operations. New Jersey's governor declared a state of emergency as emergency services responded to numerous calls for help from residents trapped by the rapidly rising waters.</p>

Prosecutors plan to present evidence that Craig used a work computer to search for "undetectable poisons" and how to acquire them. The defense is expected to challenge the admissibility of this electronic evidence, setting up a critical legal battle over digital forensics in the high-profile case.</p>

Lawyers for the victim's family argue the driver-assistance system failed to warn the driver or apply the brakes.

          <p>According to analysts, the United States is unlikely to obtain public commitments from its key allies, Japan and Australia, regarding their specific actions in a potential conflict with China over Taiwan. The reported U.S. push for such pledges is seen by some as a tactic to amplify the "China threat" narrative and encourage increased defense spending and military cooperation. Experts suggest that both Japan and Australia would prefer to maintain strategic ambiguity rather than making explicit promises that could escalate regional tensions. This reveals Washington's potential concerns about its ability to manage the situation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed a 17% tariff on most fresh tomatoes imported from Mexico, terminating a long-standing trade agreement. The move is a response to long-held complaints from U.S. growers, particularly in Florida, who argue that Mexican producers have been selling tomatoes at unfairly low prices. Supporters believe the tariff will protect the domestic industry, but critics warn it could lead to higher consumer prices for tomatoes and potential retaliatory measures from Mexico. The decision impacts a trade relationship where the U.S. sources approximately 70% of its fresh tomatoes from its southern neighbor. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists at Tel Aviv University have discovered the first evidence of an animal responding to sounds made by plants, suggesting a previously unknown layer of ecosystem interaction. The study found that female moths avoided laying eggs on tomato plants that were emitting ultrasonic sounds associated with distress, such as dehydration. While plants are not sentient, they produce these sounds through physical processes when stressed. This groundbreaking research opens up the possibility that many animals may use these plant-based acoustic cues to make decisions about pollination, feeding, or shelter.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the journal Pediatrics reveals a dramatic increase in the rate of young children under six accidentally swallowing nicotine pouches, with cases soaring by 763% between 2020 and 2023. Researchers analyzing U.S. poison center data found that while these pouches are smoke-free, they contain nicotine, which can be highly toxic to children. Despite making up a small fraction of total nicotine ingestions, pouch-related incidents were more likely to result in serious medical outcomes or hospital admission, prompting calls for greater safety measures and awareness.</p>

          <p>A man has been arrested in Victorville, California, on suspicion of filing a false report after a teddy bear appearing to be made of human skin was found at a gas station. The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department determined the object was not made of human remains and was part of a prank. The creator, a South Carolina artist, confirmed she had shipped one of her creations to a customer in the area but was unaware of their intentions. Authorities stated that such incidents waste valuable emergency resources and can delay responses to genuine crises.</p>

          <p>Dan Bongino, the deputy director of the FBI, is reportedly considering resignation following a heated dispute with Attorney General Pam Bondi over the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case files. Bongino, a former right-wing podcaster, allegedly stormed out of a meeting and is said to be furious about the public fallout. The controversy stems from the recent release of a DOJ memo concluding Epstein's death was a suicide and that a rumored high-profile client list does not exist, contradicting narratives previously pushed by some in the MAGA movement, including Bongino and Bondi.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has formally requested that the Supreme Court reject an appeal from Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking crimes. Maxwell's lawyers argued that a non-prosecution agreement Epstein signed in 2007 should have protected her from federal charges. However, the DOJ countered that the agreement was limited to a specific Florida district and that Maxwell was, at best, an incidental beneficiary. This follows lower court rulings that also rejected her argument for immunity from prosecution.</p>

A drought declaration enables water companies to implement their management plans, which can include measures like hosepipe bans. While weather patterns are the primary driver, officials note that climate change and increasing water consumption are heightening the risk of future water shortages across the country.</p>

          <p>Parts of central North Carolina are grappling with the aftermath of what researchers are calling a "1,000-year flood," after Tropical Storm Chantal dropped up to 10 inches of rain in just a few hours. The extreme rainfall caused the Eno River to overflow, flooding communities and prompting emergency crews to rescue nearly 80 people in Durham County alone. This event highlights a growing pattern of more intense storms, where warmer air holds more moisture, leading to severe and rapid flooding. Such events damage infrastructure, endanger lives, and underscore the increasing impacts of climate change.</p>

Port executives attribute the surge to a "tariff whipsaw effect," as importers raced to get goods into the country before President Trump's trade tariff deadlines, particularly those on Chinese products. While the numbers show an 8% increase over last year, officials caution this is not a sign of a booming economy but rather a temporary distortion caused by shifting trade policies. They anticipate a significant drop in cargo volume once new tariffs take effect. (not investment advice)</p>
