        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alaska Airlines is set to launch its inaugural flights to Europe, offering nonstop service from Seattle to Rome beginning next May. This new route is made possible by Alaska's acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines, which provided the necessary long-haul jets for the expansion. The service will operate four times a week using Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner jets, already part of the combined fleet, and tickets will go on sale this fall. Alaska Airlines intends to expand its long-haul international destinations from Seattle throughout the decade, solidifying its position as a global gateway. </p>

          <p>Donald Trump initially expressed sympathy for Joe Biden after the announcement of Biden's cancer diagnosis, but this sentiment quickly shifted as Trump reverted to attacking his former rival. Trump's initial message of support was followed by social media posts questioning the timeline of Biden's diagnosis and promoting conspiracy theories about Biden's cognitive abilities. Trump Jr. also made unsavory comments about Jill Biden's role in the situation, while Trump himself reposted a message referring to Biden as a "decrepit corpse." This shift underscores the ongoing political animosity between the two figures, even in the face of serious health concerns.</p>

          <p>According to a recent survey by Morning Consult, favorable views of China have surpassed those of the United States globally for the first time since tracking began in 2020. The shift occurred between January and late April, with China achieving a net favorability rating of 8.8 compared to the US's -1.5. The US's standing has diminished in 38 of the 41 markets tracked, while China's standing improved in 34, except for Russia, where views of the US improved under President Trump's new term. This change marks a significant blow to US soft power, with 16 countries switching from pro-US to pro-China during the surveyed period.</p>

          <p>Meta has entered into a 20-year agreement with Constellation Energy to purchase 1.1 gigawatts of nuclear power from the Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois.

The agreement will also expand Clinton's output by 30 megawatts, with the power contributing to the regional grid rather than directly powering Meta's facilities.

          <p>The National Weather Service (NWS) is facing severe staffing shortages as the Atlantic hurricane season begins, raising concerns about the agency's ability to accurately forecast and prepare for weather-related disasters. Due to budget cuts initiated by President Trump, the NWS has lost approximately 10% of its workforce, with about 550 employees departing since January. Lawmakers and former agency leaders have warned of potentially catastrophic consequences if the agency is not adequately staffed during this busy period. Despite NOAA's plans to rehire some employees, understaffed local forecast offices remain a significant concern, potentially limiting the agency's ability to provide timely warnings and support to affected regions.</p>

The OECD notes that new import duties have raised the effective tariff rate to 15.4%, the highest since 1938, leading to higher consumer costs and inflation. The organization forecasts that inflation in the U.S. will spike in mid-2025, reaching 3.9% by the end of the year.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has cautioned that Donald Trump's tariffs are expected to negatively impact global economic growth. The OECD has reduced growth forecasts, attributing the expected slowdown to increased trade barriers and widespread uncertainty created by Trump's policies. The organization also slashed the outlook for the US economy this year from 2.2% to 1.6% and predicted growth would slow again in 2026. The OECD warned that the US faces risks from rising inflation, contradicting Trump's campaign promises.</p>

          <p>Mount Etna, located on the Italian island of Sicily, is Europe's largest and most active volcano, claiming several titles, including being the world's most active "stratovolcano." With over 500,000 years of eruptive history, Etna is one of the best-monitored volcanoes globally and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The volcano poses a constant threat of debris and dust to nearby populations, and lava flows have been known to reach the Ionian Sea. Mount Etna's volcanic soil supports a variety of flora and fauna, contributing to the region's unique ecosystem.</p>

The police have arrested the suspect, who they say spent hours loitering outside her home, and described the incident as a "gruesome and cold-blooded murder."

          <p>Wildlife advocates are criticizing a proposal for a three-week bear hunt in Florida, which could lead to the slaughter of nearly 200 black bears. Opponents are calling the hunt a trophy hunt based on bloodlust, not science, and say it would reintroduce long outlawed practices including bear baiting. They also claim the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) is using outdated and incomplete data to justify the hunt and falsely insist the killings are necessary as a conservation measure. The FWC's existing bear management plan, updated in 2019, did not propose the reintroduction of hunting, and stated that bears were still listed as a threatened species in Florida as recently as June 2012.</p>

          <p>Male beauty standards are shifting towards hypermasculinity, influenced by manosphere and incel-adjacent spaces, leading some young men to pursue extreme measures like shaving off eyelashes or undergoing hair transplants. This shift prioritizes impressing other men over attracting women, often accompanied by misogynistic attitudes. Ironically, this pursuit of unrealistic standards has resulted in body dysmorphia among young men, mirroring issues traditionally associated with women.

          <p>Millennials entering their 40s are experiencing a unique midlife crisis shaped by economic instability, evolving values, and a different set of milestones compared to previous generations. Unlike the traditional stereotype involving drastic life changes, millennials often grapple with a sense of being in a "generational waiting room," facing financial setbacks and societal pressures. While economic factors play a role, many millennials are reevaluating their careers, relationships, and personal identities, seeking fulfillment and meaning in new ways. The reevaluation is a result of economic and lifestyle changes which have defined the millennial experience, leading to a shift in perspective on what constitutes a successful and fulfilling life.</p>

          <p>The global food system, responsible for a third of climate emissions, faces a reckoning as climate change intensifies, necessitating changes as monumental as ending reliance on fossil fuels. Addressing the challenge requires producing more food with less land, necessitating new crops, foods, policies, and behaviors. Innovations include reengineering plants, developing feed additives for livestock, and improving photosynthesis, yet climate finance for land-based solutions lags significantly behind energy solutions. The shift will demand personal and political changes as significant as those required to abandon fossil fuels, but unlike fossil fuels, food is non-negotiable.</p>
