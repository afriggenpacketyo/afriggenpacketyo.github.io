          <p>A severe blizzard on the north face of Mount Everest has stranded around 1,000 climbers at camps below the main base camp. Chinese state media reports that the climbers are located at an altitude of roughly 4,900 meters, with damaged tents and some casualties, although no fatalities have been confirmed. Rescue operations are currently underway but are significantly hindered by continuous heavy snowfall and strong winds, which have made access roads impassable. The extreme weather is part of a larger system that has also caused deadly landslides and flooding in neighboring Nepal.</p>

          <p>A woman was shot by federal agents in Chicago's Brighton Park neighborhood during an incident where, according to the Department of Homeland Security, agents were rammed and intentionally boxed in by multiple cars. DHS stated the agents fired after one of the drivers allegedly brandished a semi-automatic weapon. The woman, Marimar Martinez, and another man, Anthony Ian Santos Ruiz, are now facing federal charges for assaulting an officer. The event, which led to protests and further clashes, occurred amidst heightened tensions surrounding U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in the city.</p>

          <p>Penn State's head football coach, James Franklin, is facing significant criticism from fans following a 42-37 defeat to the previously winless UCLA Bruins. This marks the Nittany Lions' second straight loss, severely diminishing their prospects for the College Football Playoff. The game started poorly for Penn State, with UCLA executing a surprise onside kick early on, setting a tone of disarray that Franklin acknowledged as a series of uncharacteristic mistakes and penalties. Despite the challenging schedule ahead, quarterback Drew Allar expressed continued belief in the team's ability to reach the playoffs.</p>

          <p>The world transfer record in women's soccer has been broken five times in 2025 alone, with the latest move for midfielder Grace Geyoro reaching approximately €1.6 million. This surge in spending, primarily from clubs in England's WSL and the USA's NWSL, indicates significant commercial growth and increased investment in the sport. However, experts express concern that these escalating fees are widening the financial gap between the elite leagues and others, such as Germany's Bundesliga. This financial disparity could hinder competitive balance, concentrating top talent in only a few wealthy leagues and leaving others behind.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research indicates that the United States is approaching herd immunity against the human papillomavirus (HPV), the primary cause of cervical cancer, due to a successful and long-running vaccination program for both girls and boys. A recent study published in JAMA Pediatrics found significant declines in HPV infections even among unvaccinated women, suggesting strong community-wide protection. While this progress is a major public health victory, experts caution that maintaining high vaccination rates is crucial to sustain this protection.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an interview on "Face the Nation," Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth strongly condemned the actions of federal ICE agents in Chicago, accusing the Trump administration of lying about the circumstances of a recent shooting and employing "Gestapo tactics." Duckworth stated that agents are being overly aggressive, separating families, and attempting to intimidate residents, rather than responding to a genuine threat as the administration claims. She urged protesters to remain peaceful but to videotape all interactions with federal agents to document what she describes as a misuse of federal power. Duckworth also criticized the deployment of the National Guard to the city as unnecessary.</p>

          <p>The UK's Conservative party has unveiled an aggressive new immigration plan, pledging to remove 750,000 migrants within five years. Unveiled at their annual conference, the proposal would ban anyone entering the UK without permission from ever claiming asylum and would replace court appeals with reviews by Home Office officials. The plan involves creating a strengthened "Removals Force" with a doubled budget and would seek to deport individuals to their home countries or "safe" third countries. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch stated this approach is necessary to control the UK's borders, drawing inspiration from Trump-era policies in the United States.</p>

As the government shutdown enters its fifth day, the administration is preparing for this contingency while expressing hope that Democrats will become more "reasonable" and agree to a funding bill. The stalemate centers on Democrats' demands to include a permanent extension of enhanced healthcare premium tax credits in the legislation. Republicans argue these issues should be debated separately, escalating the standoff and raising the possibility of significant economic disruption for government workers.</p>

Under the new rules, senior officers can consider the "cumulative impact" of multiple demonstrations at a single location, potentially forcing organizers to move or shorten events. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated the move is intended to balance the right to protest with the public's right to live without fear, citing recent intimidation felt by the Jewish community.

          <p>Hungary's governing Fidesz party, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orban, has become one of the EU's biggest spenders on social media political advertising, often outspending all parties in entire countries combined.

In response, Fidesz is pivoting to an online activist initiative called the "fight club" to mobilize supporters as "digital freedom fighters." This shift comes as the party faces a strong challenge from opposition figure Peter Magyar, whose campaign has achieved significant organic reach online without paid advertising.</p>

          <p>Crucial peace talks aimed at ending the war in Gaza are scheduled to begin in Egypt, with delegations from Israel and Hamas, along with US and Qatari mediators, in attendance. The negotiations center on a 20-point plan that proposes an immediate halt to fighting and the release of 48 hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Despite the upcoming talks, Israeli airstrikes and tank fire have continued in Gaza, and an Israeli government spokesperson clarified that no formal ceasefire is in place. Hamas has entered the talks without its usual "red lines," a move seen as a sign of external pressure from mediators and a recognition of its limited leverage.</p>

The U.S. Geological Survey reported that the shaking was "weak" and felt by some residents indoors, but it was not strong enough to cause damage.

          <p>China is intensifying its strategic efforts to attract elite scientists and academics from top overseas universities as part of its long-term development goals. A recent high-profile appointment at Tsinghua University for a former Harvard statistician highlights a growing trend of renowned Chinese-born scientists returning home. This "homecoming" is a key component of China's plan to gain a competitive edge in science and technology. The initiative aims to build a "snowball effect" by cultivating a world-class research environment that draws in more top minds. This push is seen as crucial for the country's ambitions in its upcoming 15th five-year plan.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of mourners gathered in Salford to attend the funeral of Melvin Cravitz, a 66-year-old man killed in the terrorist attack at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation in Manchester. The attack occurred on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in Judaism, when an assailant rammed a car into worshippers and stabbed several people. Mr. Cravitz was remembered by his family as kind and caring, and a neighbor described him as friendly with everyone. The service was attended by community members and the synagogue's rabbi, who had helped prevent the attacker from entering the building. Police have several suspects in custody in connection with the attack.</p>

The U.S. National Hurricane Center has issued tropical storm watches for a large portion of the Mexican coastline, from Jalisco to the Baja California peninsula. While the storm's center is expected to remain offshore and travel parallel to the coast, it is projected to bring dangerous surf, heavy rain, and the risk of flash flooding to southwestern Mexico through Monday. As of Sunday morning, Priscilla had maximum sustained winds of 65 mph and was moving north-northwest.</p>

A 40th-minute goal from Danish striker Mikael Uhre was enough to secure the title and the top seed for the upcoming playoffs. The achievement marks a significant turnaround for the club under coach Bradley Carnell, who took over in January after the team failed to make the playoffs last season. Elsewhere in the league, Inter Miami, led by three assists from Lionel Messi, defeated the New England Revolution 4-1.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has identified Ohio's only national forest, the Wayne National Forest, as a site for increased lumber production under an executive order targeting 100 million acres of forest nationwide. This move has alarmed local environmental groups, who warn that large-scale clear-cutting could devastate the ecosystem, which has been slowly recovering from early 20th-century coal mining. Experts are concerned that logging could release pollutants trapped in the soil into waterways, increase the risk of wildfires and landslides, and destroy a vital public recreation area. The administration argues the move is necessary for economic reasons.</p>

          <p>Democrats are leveraging the politics of a government shutdown in a high-stakes effort to challenge the Trump administration's policies, particularly concerning healthcare. By blocking Republican funding measures, Senate Democrats are demanding the inclusion of priorities like the extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits. This strategy, though politically risky, is seen by progressive activists as a necessary move to rein in a president they view as a threat to democratic norms. The party is unifying around the healthcare issue, betting that voters will blame Republicans for the shutdown and reward Democrats for fighting for popular benefits.</p>

In southwestern Michigan, the decommissioned Palisades Nuclear Plant is being brought back online and will also host the nation's first small modular reactors (SMRs), a move supported by local officials for its promise of economic stability. Tech giants like Microsoft and Google are also investing in nuclear power to meet their energy needs.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to psychologist Mark Travers, the most common subject of fights between couples is not money or chores, but rather the tone of voice used when discussing these issues. Research shows that nonverbal cues, especially tone, carry more emotional weight than the actual words spoken, and a harsh or sarcastic tone can quickly escalate a simple conversation into an argument. The article suggests that partners can de-escalate conflict by becoming self-aware and immediately apologizing for a harsh tone. It also recommends calmly pointing out a partner's tone or using a "reset phrase" to interrupt a negative cycle.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is considering a proposal, prompted by President Trump, to end the requirement for public companies to file quarterly reports, potentially moving to a semi-annual schedule. While this could save companies time and money, it poses a significant threat to the business models of the "Big Four" accounting firms—Deloitte, EY, KPMG, and PwC—which earn substantial revenue from auditing these reports. Experts estimate that the firms could lose up to 15% of their annual audit fees, potentially leading to cost-cutting and reduced hiring. The change could also encourage more private companies to go public. (not investment advice)</p>
