          <p>Due to rising geopolitical tensions between the United States and China, wealthy Chinese investors are increasingly diverting their real estate investments away from the US market. Data indicates a significant shift in demand towards markets in Thailand, Australia, and Canada, with the US no longer being the top choice as it was in 2023. Property agents cite geopolitical friction, protectionism, and increased scrutiny of property deals as factors discouraging Chinese buyers from investing in US homes. This trend marks a notable decline in Chinese investment in US real estate since its peak in 2017.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a bill into law establishing a $1 billion school voucher program, a significant victory for school choice advocates. The program will provide families with up to $10,000 per year to cover private school tuition or homeschooling expenses, with increased amounts for children with disabilities. Supporters argue it will expand educational options for students in underperforming public schools, while critics contend it will drain resources from public education and benefit wealthier families. The program is capped at $1 billion for the first year and could potentially cost up to $4.5 billion annually by 2030.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ezra Klein argues that Donald Trump's selection of JD Vance as his vice president marked a pivotal moment, foreshadowing a second term characterized by unwavering loyalty and a departure from the constraints of his first administration. Unlike potential candidates who represented the pre-Trump Republican Party, Vance embodied the MAGA movement and embraced an accelerationist approach. This decision, influenced by figures like Don Jr., Elon Musk, and Tucker Carlson, signaled a shift towards a 'royal court' dynamic where Trump is surrounded by courtiers rather than advisers, prioritizing obedience over dissent and paving the way for a more unrestrained presidency.</p>

This decision, celebrated by anti-corruption activists, highlights concerns that such programs create security risks and facilitate money laundering and tax evasion. While Malta's Prime Minister has pledged to rework the system, the ruling raises questions about the future of 'golden visa' programs, which offer residency permits in exchange for investment, and whether they will face similar scrutiny.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked a lower court ruling that ordered the Trump administration to reinstate Voice of America (VOA) employees, throwing the broadcaster's future into uncertainty. The publicly funded broadcaster has been off air since March after an executive order effectively gutted the network. The appeals court ruled that the lower court lacked jurisdiction to order the VOA employees to return to work, prompting concerns that the network may cease to exist in any meaningful form.</p>

          <p>A recent survey indicates that nearly 30% of individuals in common-law relationships in Japan cite the country's surname law as a reason for not legally marrying, as it requires couples to adopt the same last name. The survey, conducted by Asuniwa, found that the rate is even higher among people in their 20s, with over 60% of that group stating they would consider legal marriage if separate surnames were permitted. While some political parties support introducing the option of separate surnames, conservative members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party oppose the change, citing concerns about traditional family values.</p>
