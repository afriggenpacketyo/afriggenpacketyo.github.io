          <p>A vessel carrying approximately 154 migrants, reported to be Ethiopian nationals, capsized off the coast of Yemen. The UN's International Organization for Migration (IOM) confirmed that dozens were killed, with many more still missing, though a small number of survivors were found. Despite a decade-long civil war, Yemen remains a perilous transit route for migrants from the Horn of Africa seeking opportunities in wealthier Gulf nations. The IOM has described this migration path as one of the world's most dangerous, with tens of thousands attempting the journey this year alone amid regional poverty and conflict.</p>

          <p>A group of at least 51 Democratic state legislators has fled Texas for Chicago to deny Republicans the necessary quorum for a vote on a new congressional map. The proposed map, backed by former President Trump, would significantly favor the GOP and could add up to five Republican seats. Democrats argue the plan is a "Trump gerrymander" and that Republicans are holding disaster relief funds hostage to push it through a special session. This tactic of breaking quorum has historical precedent in Texas politics, though new rules impose fines on lawmakers who leave the state.</p>

          <p>A small earthquake with a magnitude of 3.0 was reported in the New York City area, with its epicenter near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. The U.S. Geological Survey confirmed the event, which caused brief shaking and confusion but resulted in no reported injuries or significant structural damage. Residents described the tremor as feeling like a loud boom or an impact against their homes. This minor quake follows a more notable 4.8 magnitude earthquake that occurred in the same region in April 2024, though officials emphasized that the latest tremor was not a cause for alarm.</p>

          <p>Economist Jeffrey Sachs from Columbia University has stated that the United States' confrontational stance toward China could become a self-fulfilling prophecy of war. He argues that while trade frictions will likely continue, both nations have mutual interests in cooperation and possess economic leverage over one another, which should limit escalation. Sachs advises that China should diversify its export markets beyond the U.S. and Europe, focusing on growing relationships with nations in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. He characterizes the ongoing trade war as being initiated by the U.S. and calls for American prudence to de-escalate tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Rescue workers in Chile have recovered the body of the fifth and final miner who was trapped after a tunnel collapse at the El Teniente copper mine. This brings the total death toll from the incident to six, including one worker killed at the time of the collapse. The collapse was triggered by a 4.2 magnitude tremor, and authorities are now launching a criminal investigation into the event. The state-owned mining company, Codelco, expressed its condolences as the search and rescue operation concluded at the world's largest underground copper mine, located southeast of Santiago.</p>

          <p>The Krasheninnikov Volcano on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted for the first time in at least four centuries, sending an ash cloud thousands of feet into the air. The eruption occurred just days after a powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake struck the region, leading seismologists to speculate the quake may have triggered the volcanic activity. While an aviation alert was issued, the sparsely populated area is not under immediate threat. Experts suggest that while the earthquake alone may not have caused the eruption, its seismic waves could have been the final catalyst for a volcano that was already close to erupting.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, announced that applications for a $50 billion rural hospital stabilization fund will be available in early September. The fund was established as part of legislation signed by President Trump, which also included significant cuts to Medicaid. The money is intended to mitigate the impact of these cuts on rural hospitals by supporting workforce development and technology like telehealth. The broader legislation also introduced stricter work requirements for some Medicaid recipients, which the CBO estimates will cause 10 million people to lose coverage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A number of former career attorneys from the U.S. Department of Justice are running for public office for the first time, motivated by what they describe as the politicization and dismantling of the agency under President Trump. These candidates, running in local, state, and federal races, are openly criticizing the administration's policies and the purge of career staff from their former posts. Citing concerns over the erosion of anti-corruption efforts and civil rights enforcement, they are leveraging their public service backgrounds to campaign on a platform of restoring the rule of law, a notable shift for typically non-partisan career prosecutors.</p>

          <p>Following the British and Irish Lions' series victory in Australia, Ireland centre Bundee Aki shared a remarkable personal story. He revealed that his wife, Kayla, had given birth to their fifth child, a daughter named Aine, in the back of a car while on the way to the hospital in New Zealand. The birth happened just before the first Test match of the tour, and Aki learned the news via a video call shortly before a team meeting. The 35-year-old player, who had not yet met his newborn, praised his wife as a "powerful, strong woman" after sharing the unique and happy family news.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of active wildfires across Canada are sending smoke across the border, leading to poor air quality and hazy skies in the U.S. Midwest and Northeast. States including Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and New York have issued air quality alerts, advising residents to limit outdoor activities due to health risks. Canada is experiencing its second-worst wildfire season on record, with wind patterns pushing the polluted air southward. Forecasters predict this pattern may continue, potentially causing prolonged periods of poor air quality for affected U.S. regions as hundreds of fires continue to burn out of control.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is proposing a compensation scheme for consumers who were victims of mis-sold car finance, with payouts likely to be less than £950 per deal. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while not finding hidden commissions broadly unlawful, did deem excessively high commissions to be unfair. The FCA will consult on a scheme to address these unfair cases, which could cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion and cover agreements dating back to 2007. The regulator advises affected customers to complain directly to their lender. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israel's far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, led prayers at Jerusalem's Temple Mount, a highly sensitive holy site, escalating tensions and drawing international condemnation. The site, known to Muslims as the home of the Al Aqsa Mosque, is revered as Judaism's holiest place, but a long-standing agreement forbids Jewish prayer there to maintain stability. Ben-Gvir's provocative act, which he has repeated during the Gaza war, is seen by Palestinians as a threat to the status quo. Prime Minister Netanyahu's office later stated that the policy preventing Jewish prayer at the site remains unchanged.</p>

The Smithsonian clarified that the removal was due to the temporary placard not meeting museum standards for presentation and was not requested by any government official.

The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation alleges Brown and Thomas assisted Drummond after the targeted attack, and a reward is being offered for his capture.</p>

          <p>Canada's Trade Minister, Dominic LeBlanc, stated that his government was "disappointed" by the U.S. decision to impose a 35% tariff on certain Canadian goods but remains committed to negotiations. LeBlanc characterized recent talks with U.S. officials as constructive, even though they did not result in a deal to avert the new duties. The Trump administration justified the tariffs by citing a lack of progress on immigration and fentanyl flows, a claim Canada disputes. LeBlanc emphasized the shared economic interests between the two nations and expressed a willingness to find a resolution. (not investment advice)</p>
