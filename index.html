          <p>China has announced an 18-point plan to upgrade its IT manufacturing sector, aiming for self-sufficiency in key technologies like semiconductors, AI, and satellite navigation, while also circumventing US tech restrictions. By 2027, the plan targets deeper AI integration and the development of specialized service providers, with over 85% of manufacturers using computer numerical control in key processes. By 2030, China intends to establish a core industrial database to facilitate breakthroughs and advance its IT manufacturers to the high end of the global value chain, solidifying its industrial system. This initiative, released by multiple government bodies, marks the closing phase of the ‚ÄúMade in China 2025‚Äù plan.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani hit his MLB-leading 20th home run, his third in as many games, propelling the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 9-5 victory over the Cleveland Guardians. Ohtani reached the 20-homer mark in just 53 games, marking the fastest pace in his major league career; his two-run shot extended the Dodgers' lead in the fourth inning. Daniel Schneemann's three-run homer narrowed the gap, but the Dodgers widened their lead with additional runs and a three-run homer from Max Muncy. Dustin May earned the win, while Tanner Bibee took the loss, as Ohtani finished with one hit, two RBIs, and two walks.</p>

          <p>Japan has enacted a law requiring 300 to 400 major companies to participate in a carbon emissions trading system starting in fiscal year 2026. The revised law targets firms producing 100,000 tons of CO2 or more annually, covering industries like steel and car production, and accounting for nearly 60% of domestic greenhouse gas emissions. Companies will receive a maximum emission allowance and must purchase carbon credits for emissions exceeding this limit from those with a surplus. While incentivizing emissions reduction, the system may lead to price increases for consumers as companies pass on decarbonization costs.</p>

          <p>A military simulation in Oklahoma, organized by MilSim West, drew approximately 300 participants who paid to engage in a 40-hour mock battle between NATO and Russian forces using pellet guns and blank ammunition. The event, titled ‚ÄúFall of Salsk,‚Äù is set in a dystopian world where George W. Bush is still president and NATO invades Russia. While the organizers emphasize the event is purely fantasy, many participants use the ongoing conflict in Ukraine as inspiration for their uniforms and gear, sometimes purchasing surplus items from military stores. The simulation provides camaraderie and an outlet for airsoft enthusiasts, but also raises questions about the ethical implications of re-enacting a current war.</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration pursues a nuclear deal with Iran, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly considering military action against Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities. This divergence in strategy has caused tension between Trump and Netanyahu, with Israel fearing that Trump may allow Iran to keep its enrichment facilities in his eagerness for a deal. Israel has taken steps to weaken Iran's defenses and argues that Iran's vulnerability makes this the right time for an attack. The US, however, believes that negotiation backed by the threat of military action is the best approach.</p>

          <p>In the Karen Read trial, a crash expert testified that data from Read's Lexus SUV indicated it reached 74% throttle and traveled at 23 mph shortly before John O'Keefe's death. The expert, Dr. Judson Welcher, matched the vehicle's black box data to O'Keefe's cellphone data, placing Read's vehicle at the scene. He also conducted an experiment suggesting that scratch marks on O'Keefe's arm were consistent with contact from Read's SUV taillight. The prosecution argues this evidence supports their claim that Read struck O'Keefe with her car, while the defense argues against the reliability and interpretation of the data.</p>

          <p>A report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) suggests that a People's Liberation Army (PLA) attack on Taiwan is unlikely in the near future but remains a possibility, particularly due to the risk of miscommunication with the US under President Donald Trump. The report highlights strained US-China relations, characterized by deep distrust and a lack of dialogue mechanisms, despite some tactical improvements during the Biden administration. The report emphasizes that Trump's first term saw the US prioritize the Indo-Pacific region, acknowledging Chinese coercion and influence undermining US and regional interests.</p>

The new requirements have sparked industry warnings of supply disruptions and added to disputes between the Modi administration and foreign companies. While the Indian government says the policy addresses a genuine security issue, companies are concerned about insufficient testing capacity and scrutiny of sensitive source code.</p>

Circle, profitable with $64.8 million in net income in the latest quarter, did not provide a reason for this decision, but it likely reflects venture capital firms' need for liquidity after a period of meager returns.

          <p>A new report from Oxford Economics indicates that recent college graduates are facing increased difficulty in finding employment. Unemployed recent graduates account for 12% of the rise in the national unemployment rate since mid-2023, and the unemployment rate among those aged 22-27 is nearing 6%, exceeding the national average. The report attributes this trend to a mismatch between an oversupply of graduates and waning business demand, particularly in the tech sector, which is also vulnerable to automation. Economic uncertainty, largely driven by President Trump's tariff policies, is also slowing hiring, potentially leading to continued unemployment among recent graduates. (not investment advice)</p>
