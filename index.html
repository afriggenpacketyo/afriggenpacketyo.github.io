          <p>Germany's Defense Minister plans to order 15 more F-35 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin, adding to a previous order of 35. This move is part of Germany's significant expansion of its defense budget, a direct response to the perceived threat of Russian aggression in Europe. The jets are intended to replace the country's aging Tornado fleet and are capable of carrying US nuclear bombs stored in Germany under NATO agreements.

          <p>A posthumously published memoir by Virginia Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein, reveals her fears of dying as a "sex slave" and details harrowing accounts of abuse. Titled "Nobody's Girl," the book alleges she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew on three separate occasions, claims he has consistently denied. The memoir describes a web of powerful individuals involved in the abuse orchestrated by Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, placing renewed scrutiny on the Royal Family and Prince Andrew, who previously reached a financial settlement with Giuffre.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to introduce new vocational courses called V-levels for students aged 16 and older in England. These qualifications are designed to replace existing Level 3 BTECs and other technical courses, aiming to simplify what ministers describe as a "confusing landscape" of post-GCSE options. The initiative is part of a broader white paper on education and skills, which also proposes an alternative to GCSE resits in Maths and English to help students avoid a "demoralising roundabout" of exams. The goal is to create a clearer vocational path into careers alongside traditional A-levels.</p>

          <p>A fragile ceasefire in Gaza was tested as Israel launched retaliatory airstrikes after reporting that Hamas militants had killed two of its soldiers in an attack. The Israeli military stated it hit dozens of Hamas targets with aircraft and artillery in response to what it called a "bold violation of the ceasefire." While Hamas denied involvement in the clashes, hospital sources in Gaza reported at least 38 fatalities from the Israeli strikes. Despite the flare-up, both sides later indicated a resumption of the ceasefire, though the incident has strained ongoing negotiations and aid deliveries.</p>

          <p>Premier League club Nottingham Forest is reportedly in advanced talks to hire Sean Dyche as their new manager following the recent dismissal of Ange Postecoglou. Postecoglou was sacked after a 3-0 loss to Chelsea, which left the team in the relegation zone with only one win in eight league games. Dyche, the former manager of Everton and Burnley, has emerged as the leading candidate to take over at the club. The appointment would mark a quick managerial change for Forest, which has already seen two managers depart this season.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams head coach Sean McVay showcased his strategic adaptability in a 35-7 victory against the Jacksonville Jaguars, despite being without star receiver Puka Nacua. McVay deviated from his usual offensive scheme, heavily utilizing a "13 personnel" formation with three tight ends, a strategy the Rams had barely used all season. This tactical shift proved highly effective, as quarterback Matthew Stafford threw for five touchdowns on fewer than 200 passing yards. The win highlights McVay's ability to adjust his game plan to compensate for key player absences and exploit defensive weaknesses.</p>

The effect is most pronounced in peripheral areas that previously had poorer transport links, such as Ealing and Slough, where improved connectivity has made them more desirable.

          <p>UK Housing Secretary Steve Reed has stated his job is "on the line" over the government's pledge to build 1.5 million new homes in England during the current Parliament. However, housing industry experts have expressed significant doubt that the target, which requires building 300,000 homes annually, will be met. The Home Builders Federation noted that construction is currently "flatlining" at around 200,000 homes per year due to a cumbersome planning process and other challenges. In response, Reed insisted the government will implement reforms, such as forcing councils to adopt local development plans more quickly.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is set to hear arguments regarding the legality of Alina Habba's position as the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey. A lower court judge previously ruled that Habba, a former lawyer for President Donald Trump, was not lawfully serving in the role and that her actions since July could be voided. The Justice Department is appealing this decision, arguing her appointment is valid under federal statute. The case centers on a series of personnel moves made by the Trump administration to install her after her initial temporary term expired without senator support.</p>

          <p>A team of thieves disguised as construction workers executed a brazen daytime robbery at the Louvre Museum in Paris, stealing priceless jewelry that once belonged to Emperor Napoleon and his wife. The perpetrators used a mobile freight elevator to access a second-floor window before smashing display cases and making off with at least eight items of "inestimable heritage value." The entire heist took less than seven minutes, prompting the museum to close for the day as police launched a major investigation. French President Emmanuel Macron has vowed that the historic items will be recovered.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has explicitly linked the country's economic struggles to the 2020 Brexit deal in remarks made to the International Monetary Fund. She stated that the UK's long-standing productivity challenge has been "compounded by the way in which the UK left the European Union," citing an official estimate of a 4% long-term negative impact on the economy. This represents a significant shift in the government's rhetoric, openly acknowledging the economic downsides of the trade deal on a major international stage. The argument is expected to be a key theme in the lead-up to the November Budget. (not investment advice)</p>

According to media reports citing sources close to the investigation, Martin died in Oakland police custody early Saturday morning. Police were reportedly responding to a home break-in when a "brief struggle" occurred, after which Martin became unresponsive. The incident is now under investigation by multiple agencies, as is standard for in-custody deaths.

          <p>China's economy grew by 4.8% in the third quarter compared to the previous year, a figure in line with expectations but representing the slowest pace in a year. While industrial production exceeded forecasts, a significant concern arose from an unexpected contraction in fixed-asset investment, which fell 0.5% in the first nine months of the year. This drop, described by one economist as "rare and alarming," was driven by a deepening slump in the property sector. The weak investment data suggests downward pressure on future growth and highlights ongoing challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study has found that revised medical guidance recommending the early introduction of peanut products to infants has successfully prevented an estimated 60,000 cases of peanut allergies. The research, published in Pediatrics, analyzed health records before and after guidelines were changed starting in 2015. It found that peanut allergies in children under three declined by over 40% after the recommendations were fully implemented. This real-world data confirms the effectiveness of the landmark 2015 LEAP trial, which upended decades of advice that had called for delaying the introduction of potential allergens.</p>

The research, published in the journal Science, suggests that the enhanced efficiency of this protein in naked mole-rats plays a key role in their anti-aging capabilities.

The issue stems from Fitzgerald's alleged role as an intermediary in Comey's disclosures to the media shortly after his firing by President Trump in 2017. Prosecutors argue that because Fitzgerald was involved in the release of information later deemed classified, he could be a witness in the case.
