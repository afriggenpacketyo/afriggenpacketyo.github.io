          <h2>Opinion: Israel's Gaza Food Distribution System Criticized as Ineffective and Dehumanizing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 05:00:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article by Alex de Waal argues that Israel's food distribution points in Gaza are a facade that fails to address the mass starvation crisis. He contends the system, run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, provides less than half the necessary food and is inaccessible to the most vulnerable, such as mothers and the elderly. The distribution sites are described as dangerous "death traps" located in military zones, forcing desperate people to risk their lives for insufficient aid. De Waal concludes the operation is an alibi to avoid accusations of starvation while Palestinian society is systematically destroyed.</p>

          <p>A 25-year-old Cuban woman seeking asylum was apprehended by ICE agents directly after her hearing in an El Paso immigration court, despite a judge scheduling her next appearance for 2026. This incident is part of a wider pattern where the Trump administration is reportedly increasing arrests within courthouses to fast-track deportations through expedited removal. Advocacy groups report that this tactic targets migrants attending their required hearings, creating fear and undermining due process, regardless of whether their cases are dismissed or ongoing.</p>

          <p>Rapper Snoop Dogg has collaborated with the Zac Brown Band on a new country-rap song titled "Let It Run," which he describes as "gangster gumbo."

This collaboration is not Snoop Dogg's first venture into country music, as the article notes his previous work with artists like Willie Nelson and Ernest.

          <p>The U.S. housing market is experiencing a paradoxical situation where the median price for an existing home reached an all-time high in June, even as the volume of sales hit a nine-month low. This trend is driven by a strong high-end market and an increase in all-cash buyers, who are leveraging existing housing equity. However, high mortgage rates and record prices are shutting out many first-time and middle-income buyers, creating a market of "haves and have-nots." The article notes that while new home construction could offer some relief, it too is slowing due to high interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Representatives for Syria's Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have stated that disarmament is a "red line" as political negotiations with the Damascus government stall. The declaration comes amid heightened sectarian violence in Syria and concerns over the integration of Kurdish forces into the national army. The situation is complicated by Turkey, which views the SDF as a threat and has warned against any moves toward Kurdish autonomy. This complex geopolitical dynamic puts the future of the semi-autonomous Kurdish region in northeast Syria at a critical juncture.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced that the UK is collaborating with Jordan to organize aid airdrops into Gaza, as international concern over the humanitarian crisis grows. This move comes as the government faces significant political pressure to formally recognize a Palestinian state, with over 220 MPs from nine parties signing a letter in support. Critics of airdrops describe them as largely symbolic and inefficient, arguing that the only effective solution is for Israel to open all border crossings to allow a flood of aid. The UK is also accelerating efforts to evacuate critically ill children from the territory for medical treatment.</p>

In contrast, Cambodia's younger armed forces are significantly smaller and rely heavily on older equipment, with China emerging as their key defense partner and arms supplier.

          <p>A labor strike against Republic Services, a major private waste-management company, has left trash overflowing in several American cities for over three weeks. The Teamsters union, representing the striking workers, is demanding better pay and benefits, arguing their compensation is far below industry standards. The dispute, which began in the Boston area, has spread to other states, impacting millions of residents and causing public health concerns. While some local disputes have been resolved, negotiations in Massachusetts have stalled, leaving cities to manage the malodorous consequences.</p>

          <p>Officials have confirmed that one of two grenades recovered by Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies is missing following a deadly explosion at a training facility. The blast, which killed three deputies from the Arson Explosives Detail, occurred when one of the grenades unexpectedly detonated after being deemed inert. Authorities are now conducting a wide-area search for the second device, which they believe was brought to the facility but has not been located since the incident. The department has implemented new policies to treat all explosive devices as live to prevent a future tragedy.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Dismisses Trump Administration Lawsuit Against Illinois Sanctuary Policies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 00:04:58 EDT</div>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration against the state of Illinois, Cook County, and the city of Chicago over their "sanctuary" policies. The lawsuit, filed in February, accused the jurisdictions of thwarting federal immigration law. However, the judge ruled that their policies, which limit local cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, are protected by the Tenth Amendment. The ruling affirms their right to not participate in enforcing federal immigration law, marking a significant legal victory for sanctuary jurisdictions.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is reportedly planning to remove all 16 members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). According to a source, Kennedy views the independent panel, which recommends essential health services like cancer screenings for insurance coverage, as being too "woke." An HHS spokesperson stated that no final decision has been made, but the move follows the abrupt cancellation of a recent task force meeting. This action could significantly alter how preventive healthcare is covered for millions of Americans.</p>
