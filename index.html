          <p>Burberry is set to reduce its global workforce by approximately 1,700 roles as part of a comprehensive turnaround strategy led by CEO Joshua Schulman, with the goal of saving Â£60 million by 2027. These cost-cutting measures, which follow a previous Â£40 million reduction, will impact office-based positions, stores, and the Castleford factory, representing about 20% of the company's total headcount. Despite sales declines across all regions, particularly in Asia-Pacific, Burberry shares rose 8.5% after the announcement, and Schulman remains optimistic about the brand's future. The company also cited geopolitical tensions and potential tariff impacts as key downside risks.</p>

          <p>Sony Group shares experienced volatile trading but ultimately rose following the announcement of a 250 billion yen ($1.7 billion) share buyback and better-than-expected operating income for the last quarter of the fiscal year. Despite beating analyst estimates with an operating income of 203.6 billion yen, this figure still represents an 11% decrease compared to the previous year. Sony also detailed plans for a partial spinoff of its financial unit, which will be classified as a discontinued operation in the company's accounting, and the company's outlook for the current financial year ending in March 2026 was described as lackluster.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Pennsylvania has ruled that the Trump administration can use the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan citizens identified as members of the Tren de Aragua gang, marking the first time a federal judge has approved the use of this wartime law for such deportations. The judge, however, mandated that the administration provide at least 21 days' notice to those facing removal under the AEA, ensuring they have an opportunity to object. This decision contrasts with rulings from other federal judges, including one in Texas, who temporarily barred the administration from using the AEA for deportations in their regions, citing due process concerns.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's policies, including proposed tariffs and rhetoric against renewable energy, are creating uncertainty and potentially slowing the growth of the clean energy sector in the United States. Despite incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), tariffs on imports, particularly from Southeast Asia, could raise costs for renewable energy projects and impact consumers. While the clean energy sector has experienced significant growth in recent years, Trump's focus on fossil fuels and attempts to halt green energy funding pose challenges. Experts believe that the sector will continue to grow, but at a slower pace, and the US risks isolating itself in the global shift towards cleaner energy sources.</p>

The book also reveals that the White House was determined to conceal the reality of Biden's condition, even at the risk of his own health, while he faced a tough reelection bid against Donald Trump. The book further alleges that Biden aides were angry at the former president for running again, and that Biden's doctor warned staff that they were trying to kill him by overworking him. The article claims that Biden didnâ€™t even recognize George Clooney at a fundraiser.</p>

          <p>BBC Director General Tim Davie has outlined plans to combat a 'crisis of trust' in UK society by expanding fact-checking services, countering disinformation, and enhancing local journalism. Davie argues that the BBC can play a key role in strengthening democracy, boosting education and economic growth, and improving digital access. He also proposed a national plan to switch off traditional broadcast transmissions in the 2030s and transition to internet-only delivery of programs, potentially launching a streaming media device with simplified user interface for those not yet benefiting from IP services. The BBC aims to become a global leader in trusted information and support a cohesive, democratic society.</p>

          <p>State Farm customers in California are facing a 17% increase in homeowners insurance premiums following a judge's ruling and adoption by California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara, to help the company recover from financial losses due to the Los Angeles-area wildfires. This increase, which is lower than the initially requested 21.8%, will provide State Farm with a $400 million cash infusion from its parent company. The decision has sparked controversy, with fire survivors and State Senator Sasha RenÃ©e PÃ©rez criticizing the approval and requesting an investigation into alleged payment delays. In response, Lara assured residents that he is focused on ensuring State Farm pays claims fully and fairly and that the decision was made to protect all customers and the insurance market.</p>

Trust is a critical factor in hiring, often outweighing other qualifications, and families seek candidates who can fulfill multiple roles, making it difficult to find the perfect fit. Compensation packages are increasing to attract and retain talent, but younger employees are often reluctant to work in family offices due to the lack of a clear corporate structure and perceived career risks.</p>

          <p>British businesses are expressing concerns that the UK government's plans to tighten immigration rules will lead to labor shortages, particularly in sectors heavily reliant on migrant workers like health and social care. The new proposals include raising English-language requirements and skill levels for work visas, aiming to prioritize British workers. However, businesses worry that Brits cannot or will not fill the gap, citing challenges in recruiting domestic workers and the essential role of migrant staff in providing care. The government's move comes amid increasing pressure to address immigration concerns, but industry leaders warn that training alone cannot solve the impending labor shortages.</p>

          <p>A charter plane carrying 59 white South Africans arrived in the United States as refugees, admitted under a program initiated by President Trump, who cited a 'genocide' and violence against white farmers. However, this claim is disputed by South African officials and experts, who assert there is no persecution of white Afrikaners and that crime affects all races. The move is seen by some as Trump positioning himself as a savior of white privilege, while others view it as a result of strained relations between the US and South Africa due to the latter's ties with BRICS countries and its lawsuit against Israel.</p>

          <p>A bag containing an inflammable signal flame tube fell from a U.S. military helicopter over the Motobu peninsula in northern Okinawa Prefecture in Japan, prompting a search by the U.S. Marine Corps. According to the Marine Corps, the UH-1 helicopter inadvertently dropped the 18-kilogram bag during a routine drill, and there were no confirmed civilian injuries in the area where it landed. The Okinawa Defense Bureau is urging residents to contact them if the bag is found, as the southern island prefecture hosts a significant portion of U.S. military facilities in Japan.</p>

The proposal, presented by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi to U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff, involves Iran enriching uranium to a low grade and shipping it to other Arab countries for civilian use, with potential oversight from international representatives. While a spokesman for Mr. Witkoff denied that the proposal had come up in the talks, Iranian media outlets have been actively discussing the plan, raising questions about its feasibility and implications for regional security.</p>

          <p>U.S. retail egg prices experienced a slight decrease in April, falling to an average of $5.12 per dozen after reaching a record $6.23 in March, marking the first month-to-month drop since October 2024. Despite this decline, egg prices remain near historic highs due to a persistent outbreak of bird flu that has significantly reduced the population of egg-laying hens. The April average price was still 79% higher than the same month a year ago, prompting efforts from the Trump administration to invest in biosecurity measures and increase egg imports from other countries. The antitrust division of the U.S. Department of Justice is also investigating Cal-Maine Foods, the largest U.S. egg producer.</p>

          <p>U.S. energy officials are reassessing the risks associated with Chinese-made power inverters after discovering undocumented communication equipment inside some devices, potentially allowing unauthorized access to power grids. These rogue components, including cellular radios, could circumvent firewalls and enable remote control of inverters, potentially destabilizing power grids and triggering blackouts. The U.S. Department of Energy acknowledges the need for greater transparency from manufacturers and is working to address disclosure gaps through inventories of software components. As U.S.-China tensions escalate, utilities are preparing for potential bans on Chinese inverter manufacturers and seeking alternative sources.</p>

Families visiting the facility have also expressed concerns about safety and the potential exposure of children to sex offenders. While G4S, the company managing the prison, claims incidents are being addressed, critics argue that the prison is failing to meet its rehabilitation goals due to a lack of resources and skilled officers.</p>
