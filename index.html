          <p>President Trump announced he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin very soon to discuss the ongoing war in Ukraine, with a location to be revealed shortly. This comes as a Trump-imposed deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face severe secondary sanctions expires. Trump expressed his belief that a peace deal is possible, suggesting a potential agreement could involve complicated territorial swaps to benefit both nations. The announcement follows a period of escalating pressure from the Trump administration, which had become increasingly frustrated with the lack of progress toward ending the conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent Member of Parliament, Rupert Lowe, admitted to mistakenly identifying a team of charity rowers off the Norfolk coast as "illegal migrants." He had posted a picture on social media with an urgent call for authorities to intercept the vessel and demanded mass deportations. After HM Coastguard confirmed the boat's occupants were raising money for motor neurone disease research, the MP apologized for the false alarm. He subsequently pledged to donate £1,000 to their cause, and the rowers, who include a former Royal Marine, found the incident "hilarious."</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has voided a lower court's criminal contempt order against Trump administration officials regarding the deportation of Venezuelan migrants. The case originated when a district judge found officials had willfully disregarded his order to halt deportations to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act. However, the D.C. Circuit Court ruled 2-1 in favor of the administration, arguing the planes were already outside U.S. airspace when the order was issued. The decision marks a significant victory for the administration amid ongoing legal battles over its aggressive immigration policies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed all federal agencies to permanently erase records of employee COVID-19 vaccination status, noncompliance with past mandates, and exemption requests. Issued by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the guidance is framed as a reversal of "harmful pandemic-era policies" from the previous administration. Agencies are now prohibited from using an individual's vaccination history in any employment decisions. Unless an employee chooses to opt out, all related information must be removed from their personnel files, with agencies required to certify compliance by September 8th.</p>

          <p>Billy Long is leaving his post as IRS commissioner after only two months on the job to become the U.S. ambassador to Iceland. His brief tenure occurred during a period of significant turmoil and staff reductions at the agency, which has seen its workforce shrink by roughly 25% this year. Long, a former congressman with no background in tax administration, was a controversial pick due to his past efforts to repeal the tax code. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will temporarily lead the IRS, which has cycled through several leaders since January.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a landmark peace agreement at the White House, officially ending decades of conflict over the South Caucasus region. Brokered by the Trump administration, the deal establishes a major new transit corridor named the "Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity" connecting the two nations. Both leaders credited President Trump with achieving a breakthrough that had eluded international mediators for years.

          <p>Apple's stock experienced its largest weekly gain since July 2020, rising 13% and adding over $400 billion to its market capitalization. The surge followed CEO Tim Cook's White House meeting with President Trump, where Apple announced plans to spend $100 billion on American companies and parts over the next four years. This move, which includes buying more U.S.-made chips, was praised by Trump, who suggested the company would be exempt from future tariffs. The announcement alleviated investor concerns about the potential negative impact of tariffs on Apple's profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

This new inquiry, authorized by Attorney General Pam Bondi, follows recent declassifications by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. Gabbard has accused the Obama administration of knowingly promoting a false narrative about Russian interference to undermine Donald Trump's campaign. The move signals an effort by the current administration to re-examine and potentially discredit the conclusions of multiple previous investigations into the matter.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered that actress Blake Lively's nearly 300-page deposition be struck from the public court record in her sexual harassment and retaliation lawsuit against director Justin Baldoni. The judge sharply criticized Baldoni's legal team for filing the entire uncertified transcript when their motion only cited two pages. He concluded the filing served no proper litigation purpose and appeared intended to invite public speculation and use Lively's response for their own public-relations campaign. The ruling is a procedural victory for Lively in the contentious legal battle.</p>

          <p>Shares of the salad chain Sweetgreen dropped by 23% after the company significantly cut its full-year financial outlook for the second time in two quarters. The company now projects negative same-store sales for 2025 and lowered its revenue forecast, citing a number of challenges. Executives pointed to a more cautious consumer environment, headwinds from the transition of its loyalty program, and persistent operational issues within its restaurants. The CEO described the previous quarter as "really, really rough," reflecting deep-seated problems for the brand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article highlights the benefits of integrating short movement breaks into the workday as a secret weapon for enhancing creativity and focus. Drawing on insights from author Kelly Corrigan, it suggests that simple activities like a three-minute dance break or taking phone calls while walking can effectively reset one's mood and overcome mental blocks. The key insight is to work with the body's natural energy rhythms rather than fighting against them. These micro-adjustments are presented not as distractions, but as an essential part of the creative process itself.</p>

          <p>Israel's decision to approve a military plan to take control of Gaza City has sparked strong condemnation from the United Nations and numerous countries, including the UK, France, Canada, and Australia. The UN's human rights chief warned the move would lead to massive forced displacement and unbearable suffering, while Germany halted military exports to Israel. Despite the international backlash and opposition from within Israel, defense officials stated that their resolve will not be weakened. The plan aims to disarm Hamas and establish an alternative civil administration in the territory.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Some economists are warning that President Trump's sweeping new tariffs on trade partners could increase the risk of stagflation, a painful economic condition characterized by high inflation and stagnant growth. The new import duties are expected to raise costs for businesses, which would then be passed on to consumers, fueling inflation. Simultaneously, these higher costs could lead businesses to reduce hiring and curb expansion plans, slowing down economic growth and potentially weakening the job market. This combination of factors presents a challenging scenario for the U.S. economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tonia Haddix, a Missouri woman featured in the HBO documentary series “Chimp Crazy,” has been sentenced to 46 months in prison for perjury and obstruction of justice. The charges stemmed from her false claim that a chimpanzee named Tonka, who had appeared in several movies, had died. In reality, she was hiding the primate in her basement to prevent his court-ordered transfer to a sanctuary, a case initiated by the animal rights group PETA. Haddix admitted to the deception in the documentary, stating that Tonka was "on the run with me."</p>

          <p>The artificial food dye titanium dioxide, a chemical that whitens products like ice cream and salad dressing, is largely being excluded from the food industry's recent pledges to remove synthetic colors. While companies are phasing out petroleum-based dyes like Red 40, they are reluctant to give up titanium dioxide because it is uniquely effective and difficult to replace without altering a food's texture and appearance. This is happening despite the European Union banning the chemical in 2022 over concerns that it could damage DNA, highlighting a significant gap in the U.S. food-dye crackdown.</p>

The comment was a direct response to Starmer's statement calling Israel's plan "wrong" and urging reconsideration.

This development comes just over a week after Hojlund himself publicly affirmed his commitment to staying at Old Trafford, even with the prospect of increased competition for his position. The transfer speculation is amplified by the news that Manchester United has reportedly agreed to terms with another forward, Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig. Hojlund's future at the English club now appears less certain amid these developments.</p>
