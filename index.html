          <p>China is building a deep-sea habitat to study gas hydrates, a potential energy source far exceeding the Persian Gulf's oil reserves.  The project focuses on research in methane-rich cold seep zones, but scientists warn of potential environmental risks.  The initiative is not solely about energy, but also about ocean protection and asserting China's influence.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new tariffs unexpectedly include remote Antarctic territories, including Heard and McDonald Islands, home to a vast penguin and seal population.  The move highlights the broad scope of the tariffs and raises questions about their rationale, given the islands' lack of human inhabitants and minimal economic activity.

          <p>Analysts predict China's response to new US tariffs will focus on domestic stimulus and strengthening trade ties with other partners rather than retaliatory tariffs.  China's economic strategy involves boosting domestic consumption and diversifying export destinations.  The existing 20% tariff on Chinese exports to the US, combined with the new tariffs, brings the total to 54%, impacting economic growth.</p>
