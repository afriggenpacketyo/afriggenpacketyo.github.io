          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, demanding immediate improvements to a New York City immigration holding facility. The order addresses complaints from detainees about severe overcrowding, unsanitary conditions, and lack of basic hygiene products, mandating capacity limits and regular cleaning. Detainees described horrific stenches, inedible food, and open toilets, with one account detailing a guard squirting water into mouths like they were animals. The ruling is a response to a lawsuit filed by civil liberties groups highlighting what they termed "inhumane and horrifying conditions."</p>

          <p>Mexico has extradited 26 inmates, including alleged key operatives of the Jalisco New Generation and Sinaloa cartels, to the United States to face charges for violent offenses and organized crime. This marks the second major prisoner transfer this year, reflecting ongoing collaboration between the two nations to combat drug trafficking. The move comes as the White House continues to pressure Mexico for stronger action against cartels. Mexican officials confirmed the transfer proceeded on the condition that none of the individuals would be subject to the death penalty.</p>

          <p>After fleeing the state to prevent a quorum and block Republican-led redistricting legislation, Texas House Democrats have reportedly confirmed their intention to return to Austin. Sources indicate the Democrats feel they have successfully killed the current special legislative session, which is set to expire soon. However, Republican Governor Greg Abbott has vowed to call another special session immediately upon their return. This tactic mirrors a similar walkout by Democrats in 2021, which aimed to stall an election security bill.</p>

Mateer stated the descriptions were "inside jokes" and denied ever betting on sports, which is prohibited by NCAA rules for student-athletes. The transactions in question occurred while he was a freshman at Washington State. Oklahoma's athletic department affirmed its commitment to educating athletes on gambling rules and stated it was unaware of any NCAA investigation into the matter.</p>

          <p>The UK's National Police Chiefs' Council has issued new guidance encouraging police forces to disclose the ethnicity and nationality of suspects in high-profile and sensitive cases. The change aims to combat misinformation and increase public trust through transparency, particularly in an era of rapid information spread on social media. This policy shift follows public debate over several recent cases where the withholding of such information was believed to have fueled speculation and social unrest. Decisions will still be made on a case-by-case basis, considering legal and ethical factors.</p>

          <p>The UK's automotive industry is at a critical point, with vehicle production hitting its lowest level since 1953 for the first half of the year. Recent closures of major plants, including Vauxhall's in Luton and Honda's in Swindon, symbolize a long-term decline exacerbated by Brexit uncertainty, the pandemic, and high energy and labor costs. Experts warn that falling below a critical mass of production could cause the entire ecosystem of suppliers and skilled labor to collapse.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly stated that Ukraine will not surrender the Donbas region in any peace deal, warning that it would become a "bridgehead" for future Russian offensives. His comments come as Russian troops have reportedly made a significant 10km advance near the eastern town of Dobropillia ahead of the planned Trump-Putin summit. Zelenskyy acknowledged the advance but suggested it was an informational tactic by Moscow to create an appearance of momentum. He remains adamant that Ukraine's territorial integrity is not negotiable, despite speculation about potential land swaps.</p>

          <p>D’Marcus Riggins, a 17-year-old high school basketball player, was shot and killed in Sylacauga, Alabama, just an hour after calling his mother to ask if a friend could come over.

His mother described him as being "full of life, dreams, and love." Police have not yet made any arrests, and a reward is being offered for information leading to the shooter.</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly criticized Goldman Sachs, suggesting CEO David Solomon should fire the bank's chief economist or "just focus on being a DJ." The rebuke came after a Goldman Sachs research note, led by chief economist Jan Hatzius, warned that American consumers will bear an increasing share of the costs from the administration's tariffs. Trump disputed this, claiming tariffs are bringing "massive amounts of CASH" into the U.S. Treasury and are paid for by foreign governments and companies. The incident highlights the administration's sensitivity to economic analyses that contradict its policy narratives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump and Vice President JD Vance are scheduled to participate in a virtual meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other European leaders on Wednesday. This discussion will take place just two days before Trump's high-stakes, in-person summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. The pre-meeting with Zelenskyy comes after the Ukrainian leader reported receiving signals via a U.S. envoy that Russia may be ready for a ceasefire. The virtual call appears to be an effort to coordinate with and reassure allies ahead of the direct talks with Moscow.</p>

          <p>This opinion article posits that China's massive new hydropower dam on the Yarlung Tsangpo (Brahmaputra) River, while a source of anxiety for downstream nations like India and Bangladesh, could also be a catalyst for improved water diplomacy. The project, aimed at advancing China's clean energy goals, has significant geopolitical implications due to its potential impact on water flow. With other regional water-sharing treaties in South Asia under strain, the author suggests that transparent engagement and confidence-building measures around the dam's operation could help establish a more stable mechanism for managing transboundary water resources.</p>

          <p>Approximately 800 National Guard troops have begun arriving in Washington D.C. after President Trump ordered their deployment and took federal control of the city's police force. The president justified the move by labeling the capital a "lawless city," a claim contradicted by recent Department of Justice data showing a significant drop in violent crime. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser, who initially called the move "unsettling," stated the city would utilize the extra personnel. The unarmed troops will not have arrest powers but will support local law enforcement.</p>

          <p>In a town hall for Census Bureau employees, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick acknowledged that Congress has the ultimate authority over the national census, not the president. This marks the first such admission from a top Trump official following the president's call for a "new" census. Lutnick also suggested that the census should differentiate between legal residents and those in the U.S. without legal status, a controversial idea amid a Republican push for mid-decade redistricting. His remarks highlight the legal and practical hurdles facing any attempt to alter the census schedule or counting methodology before 2030.</p>

          <p>Rangers have progressed to the Champions League play-off round, where they will face Club Brugge, despite losing 2-1 to Viktoria Plzen in the second leg of their qualifier. While they advanced on aggregate, the performance raised concerns for manager Russell Martin, who criticized the team for being "sloppy with the ball." Rangers conceded 27 shots in the match, relying heavily on goalkeeper Jack Butland to secure their passage. The team's defensive frailties and inability to maintain possession have been a recurring pattern early in the season, which they will need to address for the next round.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has released a significantly altered version of the State Department's annual global human rights report, which tones down criticism of allies like El Salvador and Israel while increasing scrutiny of others like Brazil and South Africa. The 2024 report on El Salvador, for example, states there were "no credible reports of significant human rights abuses," a stark reversal from the previous year's findings. The report also largely omits references to LGBTQ+ rights and introduces new framing around "Western values," reflecting a shift in the administration's foreign policy priorities away from traditional human rights advocacy.</p>
