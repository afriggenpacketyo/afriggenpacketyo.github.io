          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping cautioned against "tariff wars" and advocated for global peace and stability in a veiled criticism of the United States. Speaking at the China-Celac forum in Beijing, Xi emphasized that "bullying or hegemonism only leads to self-isolation." His remarks align with China's broader strategy to gain support from other nations against the backdrop of trade tensions with the U.S., despite a recent 90-day tariff pause agreement. Washington is also attempting to increase its influence in Latin America, including pressuring Panama regarding Chinese control over the canal.</p>

          <p>The auction of the Riggio family art collection at Christie's in New York saw underwhelming bidding, signaling a potential slowdown in the art market. The auction, featuring works by modern masters like Mondrian and Picasso, totaled $272 million including fees, but fell short of pre-sale expectations. Experts attributed the muted enthusiasm to economic uncertainty related to President Trump's tariffs. Despite some successful sales, such as a Monet painting fetching nearly $43 million, the withdrawal of a major Warhol painting highlighted weakness in that market. The auction results suggest a shift from the frothy art market of 2022, requiring auction houses to work harder to secure sales.</p>

          <p>A Democratic National Committee (DNC) panel recommended redoing the election of David Hogg and Malcolm Kenyatta as party vice-chairs, citing violations of the party's charter. The resolution stems from a challenge by Kalyn Free, who lost to Hogg, alleging that the DNC improperly combined questions and tallied votes. This comes amid controversy over Hogg's efforts to mount primary challenges against some Democrats. DNC Chair Ken Martin expressed disappointment and expects DNC members to resolve the matter fairly.</p>

          <p>Proposed funding cuts by the Trump administration threaten NOAA's ongoing collection of CO2 samples, a program started by Professor Ralph Keeling's father. This program, which has been monitoring CO2 levels since the 1960s, provides critical data for understanding climate change. Ralph Keeling expressed concern that these cuts would eliminate decades of unbroken data collection, impacting the nation's ability to project future climate change impacts.
