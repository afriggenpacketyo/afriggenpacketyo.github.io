          <h2>European Pharmaceutical Industry Anticipates Potential Impact of Trump's Tariff Policies</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Europe's pharmaceutical industry is preparing for potential disruptions due to President Trump's plans to impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals, ending decades of tariff exemptions aimed at affordability. The move could significantly impact European drug exports to the U.S., including blockbuster drugs like Ozempic, cancer treatments, and cardiovascular medications. The U.S. is the largest market for these name-brand drugs, and the tariffs could lead to higher prices and reduced availability for American consumers. The industry faces uncertainty as it assesses the potential consequences of these tariffs on its operations and profitability.</p>

          <p>Australia is considering capping the number of international students to address the growing unaffordable housing crisis, a significant shift for a country that once heavily relied on international education as a major export. Politicians are debating whether limiting international student intake will ease rental and housing prices, which have become a top concern for voters ahead of the upcoming election. While some argue that a reduction in international students will help stabilize the housing market, others express concerns about the economic impact on Australia's education sector and the potential loss of valuable talent and research contributions.</p>

          <p>Tensions are escalating between China and South Korea due to the construction of large steel structures in a disputed area of the Yellow Sea, with some critics comparing it to China's island-building activities in the South China Sea. China maintains that the structures are for commercial fish farming, but South Korea fears they are intended to bolster China's territorial claims. The dispute could hinder efforts to improve relations between the two countries, particularly as China seeks support from its neighbors in opposing U.S. tariffs, with analysts warning that the situation has fueled anti-China sentiment in South Korea.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has deported three American children, aged 2, 4, and 7, along with their Honduran-born mothers. The deportations occurred in Louisiana amidst the Trump administration's increased efforts to deport undocumented migrants. One of the children had a rare form of metastatic cancer and was deported without medication or medical consultation. The ACLU has called the deportations illegal and inhumane, stating that the mothers were not given a fair opportunity to decide whether they wanted their children to remain in the United States.</p>

          <p>FBI agents arrested Milwaukee Judge Hannah Dugan for allegedly obstructing justice by directing an undocumented immigrant out of her courtroom to avoid ICE agents waiting to arrest him. The arrest has sparked condemnation from Democratic leaders and protests in Milwaukee. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the arrest, stating that it sends a message to judges that the Trump administration will prosecute those who obstruct justice by aiding criminal defendants in evading immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>In response to U.S. trade tariffs, there is growing discussion in China about aligning with like-minded nations, reminiscent of the 1955 Bandung Conference. The Bandung Conference, held at the height of the Cold War, saw Asian and African countries unite to promote solidarity and advocate for a fairer international system. As the U.S. imposes trade tariffs, China may seek to build similar alliances to push for a more equitable global order, fostering economic, cultural, and political cooperation while rejecting the bipolarization of the current international landscape.</p>

Ryoma Kimata and Kokomo Murase led Japan to a one-two finish in the men's event and a podium sweep in the women's event, respectively. The success is attributed to the desire of each snowboarder to outperform their competition and established training methods, including year-round access to outdoor warm-weather big air jumps.
