          <p>DoorDash has announced its acquisition of SevenRooms, a restaurant booking platform, for $1.2 billion in cash, a deal expected to close in the second half of 2025. Simultaneously, the company reported first-quarter revenue that fell short of expectations, leading to a 4% drop in shares. Despite the revenue miss, DoorDash's adjusted earnings per share exceeded forecasts at 44 cents versus the expected 39 cents. In addition to the SevenRooms acquisition, DoorDash has agreed to a $3.9 billion deal with British food delivery service Deliveroo, both intended to expand the company's services and support its financial goals.</p>

          <p>More than 25 protesters were arrested at the University of Washington after occupying an academic building, demanding the school sever ties with Boeing due to the ongoing conflict in Gaza. The group, Students United for Palestinian Equality and Return, stated that those arrested included individuals injured during the arrests. University spokesperson Victor Balta reported that the charges included trespassing, property destruction, and disorderly conduct, with potential referrals to the King County Prosecutor's Office and the Student Conduct Office. The protesters sought to rename the Interdisciplinary Engineering Building and end all donations from Boeing, citing the company's long-standing relationship with the university and its $10 million donation towards the building's construction.</p>

          <p>Ferrari reported a 17% increase in first-quarter profit, driven by strong demand for personalized vehicles, with a net profit of 412 million euros. Despite this positive performance, the luxury carmaker warned that potential U.S. tariffs on EU car imports could negatively impact profitability this year, potentially reducing EBIT and EBITDA margins by 50 basis points. In response to the tariffs, Ferrari had previously announced a 10% price increase on certain models, adding up to $50,000 to the price of a typical Ferrari. Other European auto giants have reported downturns in quarterly profits due to Trump's trade policies.</p>

          <p>A brief outage at Newark Liberty International Airport caused air traffic control computer screens to go dark for 60 to 90 seconds, disrupting communication with aircraft and prompting the FAA to halt departures. The incident, attributed to telecommunications and equipment issues at the Philadelphia TRACON, led several controllers to take medical leave, citing the event as traumatic. United Airlines has canceled 35 round-trip flights per day to ease congestion, and is allowing passengers to reschedule without fees. The CEO of United Airlines, Scott Kirby, cited chronic understaffing at the air traffic control facility as a major factor in the ongoing delays.</p>

          <p>Wales' First Minister Eluned Morgan has pledged to challenge the Labour Party in Westminster when its policies negatively affect Wales, emphasizing her commitment to the Welsh people over party loyalty. In a major speech, Morgan stated she would not remain silent if the UK government makes decisions that harm Welsh communities, using the analogy of the sitcom Gavin and Stacey to illustrate the difference between what is right for Essex and what is right for Barry, Wales. She called for a halt to planned cuts in disability benefits, a rethink of winter fuel allowance reductions, and greater benefits for Wales from offshore wind projects. Morgan also argued that the Barnett formula, which determines Wales' funding, needs to be changed to better reflect the country's needs.</p>

Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour hailed the decision as securing the future of prediction markets in America.

          <p>Two California high schools, Truckee and North Tahoe, are set to leave the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association (NIAA) due to Nevada's new policy prohibiting transgender athletes from competing in girls' sports.

The NIAA's decision to allow only biological females to compete against girls conflicts with California laws.

          <p>Friedrich Merz failed to be elected German chancellor in the first round of parliamentary voting, falling short of the required majority with only 310 votes out of 630. This unexpected setback has prompted a halt in the parliamentary session to discuss next steps, and triggered losses in the German Dax stock market index. A second vote must occur within 14 days, requiring an absolute majority. Despite this initial failure, analysts still expect Merz to eventually be elected chancellor, though the situation has raised doubts about his ability to fully rely on his coalition parties and pursue his agenda.</p>

The case hinges on whether the legislature's actions violated Libby's First Amendment rights and the rights of her constituents to representation. The Supreme Court's decision in Bond v.

          <p>The LA Galaxy's struggles continue as the defending MLS champions remain winless, matching the league's longest winless streak to start a season. In a recent game against Sporting Kansas City, the Galaxy lost despite dominating possession and outshooting their opponents 11-0, with the lone goal being an own goal. The team's general manager, Will Kuntz, acknowledges the bad luck and injuries plaguing the team, including the loss of key midfielder Riqui Puig. Coach Greg Vanney's future is uncertain as the team struggles to score, ranking near the bottom of the league despite strong passing statistics.</p>

          <p>The Taiwan dollar experienced a significant pullback after a historic surge that saw it reach multi-decade gains, fueled by speculation of pressure from Washington to strengthen the currency. It weakened over 3% against the U.S. dollar after a 9% rally, with experts attributing the volatility to exporters converting U.S. dollar reserves and life insurers hedging U.S. dollar debt. Despite official denials, analysts suggest that exchange rates might be part of U.S.-Taiwan trade conversations, as President Trump has advocated for a weaker dollar to boost U.S. exports.</p>

          <p>Despite trade tensions with the U.S., China has not significantly de-dollarized its economy, according to an Oxford Economics report. The report suggests that China's export orientation requires substantial dollar assets, and weakening the yuan is a more likely response to trade tensions than selling U.S. assets. While some market commentaries have speculated about China selling U.S. Treasury-issued assets, the report indicates that China is unlikely to pursue a disruptive sale of its U.S. Treasury holdings.</p>
