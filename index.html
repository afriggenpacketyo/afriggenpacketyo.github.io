        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy recorded zero growth in July, following a 0.4% expansion in June, according to the Office for National Statistics. Economists anticipate a slowdown in the latter half of 2025, posing a dilemma for the Bank of England which is balancing sticky inflation with fiscal concerns ahead of the Autumn Budget. Despite stronger-than-expected Q2 growth, a course correction in trade and public spending is expected to decelerate GDP growth. The central bank is projected to hold rates steady in September, with attention shifting to its November meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Three advanced specialized island-landing vessels, part of China's 'Dong Gong' fleet, have been identified with hull numbers 401, 402, and 403, indicating their active service in the PLA's Eastern Theatre Command. These barges are designed with extendable legs to lift the craft clear of the water during landing, and feature extended bridge decks and cable-stayed bridge towers. Their deployment signifies an enhancement in China's maritime capabilities, particularly for potential island landing operations. This development was noted by internet users and confirmed by a former Chinese military instructor.</p>

The reporter questioned White's new Saudi-backed boxing venture and its implications for the Muhammad Ali Act, which protects boxers' rights. White, who is pushing to amend the act, cut the reporter short, leading to an awkward moment during the event. The fight itself is set to be a historic clash between two top boxers, broadcast globally on Netflix.</p>

Kirk, co-founder of Turning Point USA, was fatally shot at Utah Valley University. Authorities have recovered a high-powered rifle believed to be the murder weapon and released new video and photos of a person of interest. Cox stated that officials intend to pursue the death penalty if the case goes to trial, with the FBI offering a $100,000 reward.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has warned Mexico against its plan to raise tariffs on Asia-made cars to 50%, threatening countermeasures and urging Mexico to "think twice." Mexico's proposed tariffs, which require Congressional approval, are part of a broader budget proposal affecting $52 billion in imports. China emphasizes its role as a key trade partner and criticizes the US for tariff abuse, urging countries to safeguard free trade. The move comes as Chinese auto manufacturers have significantly invested in Mexico, making it a top destination for Chinese car exports. (not investment advice)</p>
