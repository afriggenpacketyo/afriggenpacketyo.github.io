          <h2>Nigel Farage Demands Apology Over Online Safety Law Remarks</h2>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has called for Technology Secretary Peter Kyle to apologize for suggesting Farage's opposition to the online safety law aligns him with sex offenders like Jimmy Savile. Reform UK argues the law fails to protect children and suppresses free speech, advocating for its repeal. Kyle defended the measures as a significant step forward in curbing harmful online content for children, despite acknowledging some users find workarounds. The dispute highlights the contentious debate surrounding the new online safety regulations in the UK.</p>

          <p>Overnight Russian attacks in Ukraine killed at least 22 people, striking a prison in Zaporizhzhia and medical facilities in Dnipro, including a maternity hospital. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy condemned these as "conscious, deliberate strikes." The attacks persist despite President Trump's escalated ultimatum for Russia to cease hostilities within 10-12 days or face sanctions and tariffs. Moscow has rejected these deadlines, with former president Dmitry Medvedev warning against "playing the ultimatum game" with Russia, suggesting it could broaden the conflict.</p>

          <p>Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi announced he would cover the educational expenses for 22 children from Jammu and Kashmir, orphaned by the May military conflict between India and Pakistan. These children are from the Poonch district, a border area heavily affected by shelling and drone attacks that resulted in 28 deaths. The initiative, led by Gandhi's Congress party, aims to support the children's education through graduation. This humanitarian effort comes as India's parliament debates "Operation Sindoor," the military strikes that sparked the conflict.</p>

          <p>A gunman armed with a high-powered rifle killed a New York City police officer and three other individuals inside a Midtown Manhattan office building. The suspect, Shane D. Tamura, 27, of Las Vegas, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch stated surveillance video showed Tamura entering the building and immediately opening fire on Officer Didarul Islam, a four-year veteran. Mayor Eric Adams mourned Islam, who leaves behind a pregnant wife and two sons, calling the incident a "violent, despicable attack."</p>

          <p>India's Home Minister Amit Shah confirmed that three suspected militants involved in the April Pahalgam attack in India-administered Kashmir were killed in a gunfight. The operation, conducted in the mountainous Dachigam area, comes over three months after the attack killed 26 people, mostly Hindu men. Shah stated forensic evidence linked the recovered rifles to the attack, identifying the militants as Pakistani nationals and members of Lashkar-e-Taiba.

While some variable-rate loans directly link to the Fed's benchmark, others, like mortgages, are more tied to Treasury yields and the broader economy.

          <p>China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) announced plans to "tighten oversight" in crowded manufacturing sectors like electric vehicles (EVs) and solar power. The ministry aims to phase out outdated production capacity using upgraded standards to combat excessive competition. This initiative is part of Beijing's broader strategy to revive domestic demand and promote high-tech consumer goods. Concurrently, the State Administration for Market Regulation pledged to regulate "low-quality, cut-price competition" to ensure market stability and quality. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>World Rugby's chief executive, Alan Gilpin, has rejected Australia coach Joe Schmidt's claim that a key decision in the second Test against the British and Irish Lions contravened player welfare guidelines. Schmidt had questioned the non-overturn of Hugo Keenan's match-winning try, citing a clearout that appeared to strike a player's head. Gilpin emphasized the sport's heavy investment in player welfare while defending officials who make decisions under immense pressure. Despite calls for public disclosure of review findings, World Rugby stands by its referees, acknowledging the game's complexity and occasional controversy.</p>

          <p>Google is introducing an optional "AI Mode" search feature in the UK, which generates conversational answers using its Gemini AI platform, with fewer links to external websites. This significant shift aims to cater to more complex user queries, but it raises concerns among publishers and businesses reliant on search traffic, who fear reduced click-through rates and impact on advertising revenue. Google maintains that the AI mode will unlock new "information-seeking journeys" and remains committed to sustainability despite the high energy demands of AI data centers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest the UK could be an unexpected beneficiary of the new EU-U.S. trade agreement, despite its focus on EU goods. With the EU facing a 15% tariff on U.S. imports compared to the UK's 10% levy, British exports become relatively cheaper, potentially boosting trade and attracting EU manufacturers to relocate. Additionally, the EU's avoidance of a more severe 30% tariff regime averts a major downturn that would have impacted UK exports to the bloc. While both the UK and EU face a tougher trade environment, the UK's lower tariff rate offers a competitive edge. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India has overtaken China as the leading exporter of smartphones to the U.S., with its share of U.S. imports soaring to 44% in Q2, a 240% increase year-on-year.

While China's share dropped to 25%, and Vietnam's reached 30%, India's ascent reflects a broader supply chain diversification strategy.
