          <p>Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein who alleged she was sexually trafficked to Prince Andrew, has died at the age of 41. Her family confirmed that she took her own life at her farm in Western Australia after struggling with lifelong abuse. Giuffre's lawyer described her as an incredible champion for other victims. Giuffre's allegations against Epstein and Prince Andrew brought significant attention to the issue of sexual abuse and trafficking. The family described her as a “fierce warrior” against sexual abuse and sex trafficking and a “light that lifted so many survivors”.</p>

The funeral mass itself may present moments for unexpected encounters, such as leaders shaking hands with adversaries.</p>

          <p>President Trump's administration has launched a series of attacks on the media, including banning reporters, attempting to defund publicly-funded outlets, and signing executive orders targeting law firms that oppose his views. Courts have pushed back on some of these actions, reaffirming the importance of the First Amendment. Experts warn that these attacks threaten press freedom and democratic stability, creating an environment of misinformation and government control over the narrative. The Trump administration is widely expected to introduce a memo to block federal funding for NPR and CBS in coming weeks.</p>

          <p>The Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has released interim guidance on single-sex spaces following a UK Supreme Court ruling. The guidance states that 'woman' and 'sex' in the 2010 Equality Act refer to biological sex, meaning transgender women can be excluded from women-only spaces. The EHRC emphasized that trans people should not be left without any facilities to use. The guidance provides examples for schools, hospitals, shops and associations. A two-week consultation is expected to launch in May, with an updated code of practice due by the end of June.</p>

          <p>A mini-heatwave in the UK is expected to benefit nature, with migratory birds arriving and butterflies emerging. Wildlife charities are urging people to be cautious to prevent wildfires, as conditions are incredibly dry in some areas. The Met Office says a brief spell of warmth at the end of April isn't a bad thing for wildlife - and there shouldn't be much impact to water sources such as ponds. Climate change is already having a big impact on our wildlife, but a temporary blip like this is an end of April dividend for wildlife.</p>

          <p>Luigi Mangione pleaded not guilty to federal murder and stalking charges related to the death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Supporters gathered at the courthouse, claiming Mangione is a 'political prisoner'. The case has garnered attention due to Mangione's high-profile capture and the Attorney General's decision to seek the death penalty. Former Army intelligence analyst and whistleblower Chelsea Manning was towards the front of the courthouse line on Friday.</p>

The event saw its busiest day on April 13 when 124,000 people entered the venue, but the number has remained below 100,000 since. A daily average of some 150,000 visitors is needed to achieve the goal of 28 million, according to organizers, demonstrating the need for more promotional efforts to increase numbers.</p>

          <p>A third round of nuclear talks between Iran and the United States are planned, aiming to avert conflict in the Middle East. President Trump stated that he believes he can make a deal with Iran, highlighting his past decision to abandon a previous nuclear agreement. The talks could reshape regional and global security by reducing the chance of conflict and preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons. A deal could also transform Iran’s economic and political landscape by easing American sanctions and opening the country up to foreign investors.</p>

          <p>In Canada's Alberta, there is a growing separatist movement. Some western Canadians, fed up with a decade of Liberal rule, are openly calling for separation. The threat to Canada's sovereignty from US President Donald Trump has dominated the election, but the country also faces a challenge from within. The possibility of a split has long been a talking point in this conservative-leaning province. But two factors have given it new momentum: Trump's comments about making Canada the 51st US state, and the subsequent boost that has given the Liberal Party in the polls ahead of Monday's federal election.</p>

          <p>A Kyiv resident recounts a night of intense Russian shelling following the end of a supposed Easter ceasefire, and the author discusses the implications of potential peace agreements between Trump and Putin, which they fear will result in humiliation for Ukraine. The author describes hiding in the bathroom as bombs fell, and the air filled with smoke. The author argues that if they fail to reach an agreement on their terms, with Trump’s tacit consent and the world’s non-interference, Putin will continue to rape Ukraine and its civilian population. At 6.33am, the air-raid alert in Kyiv finally gives the all clear.</p>

          <p>Google's Chrome chief testified that only Google can run Chrome due to its deep interdependencies with other Google services. The Justice Department is seeking to force Google to sell Chrome as part of an antitrust case. Google is the only company that can offer the level of features and functionality that its popular Chrome web browser has today, given its “interdependencies” on other parts of the Alphabet Inc. unit, the head of Chrome testified. The divestiture of Chrome is feasible from a technical perspective.</p>
