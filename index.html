          <p>At least 81 Palestinians were killed and over 400 injured in recent Israeli strikes across Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. One notable incident involved a strike near a stadium in Gaza City that was housing displaced people, resulting in at least 11 deaths, including children. These attacks continue despite ongoing international efforts to broker a new ceasefire and hostage release deal, with talks reportedly stalled. Meanwhile, a rally in Tel Aviv called for the release of remaining Israeli hostages, urging an end to the conflict.</p>

          <p>Samuel Woodward, a former high school classmate of Blaze Bernstein, has been found guilty of first-degree murder with a hate crime enhancement for the 2018 stabbing death of the 19-year-old. Prosecutors successfully argued that Woodward, a member of the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen, targeted Bernstein because he was gay and Jewish. The case, which faced years of delays, concluded with a verdict that carries a sentence of life in prison without parole. In response to the tragedy, Bernstein's parents founded "BlazeItForward," a movement to promote kindness and counter the hate that led to their son's murder.</p>

          <p>France is leading a significant investment in satellite operator Eutelsat, aiming to establish a European competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink. Despite the French state becoming the largest shareholder, experts express skepticism about Eutelsat's ability to match Starlink's scale in the near future. Eutelsat's OneWeb constellation has only 650 low-Earth orbit satellites compared to Starlink's more than 7,000, and it faces challenges in replacing aging satellites. Analysts suggest Eutelsat is better positioned to serve specialized government and enterprise markets that prioritize European sovereignty over raw capacity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Quemoy, a group of islands administered by Taipei but located less than 10 kilometers from mainland China, serves as a unique case study in cross-strait relations. Once a heavily militarized front line, the island has transformed into a quiet community caught between two political systems. Despite its history as a symbol of Taipei's governance, the island's unique position reveals the practical limitations of influence for both Beijing and Taipei. Its residents navigate a reality shaped by close proximity to the mainland while being governed from afar, illustrating a complex geopolitical dynamic.</p>

          <p>Five NATO countries bordering Russia or Belarus—Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland—have announced their withdrawal from the 1997 Ottawa Convention, which bans anti-personnel mines. The move is a response to the perceived threat from Russia, with the nations planning to restart production and deployment of land mines for border defense. This strategy aims to create a significant deterrent, but it is highly controversial due to the long-term danger mines pose to civilians. Critics describe the plan as a new, explosive "Iron Curtain" that could render large areas uninhabitable for decades.</p>

          <p>Despite its international isolation, Afghanistan is experiencing a small but growing influx of tourists, a development the Taliban government is actively encouraging. Officials see tourism as a vital source of revenue that can benefit the impoverished population and help build international relations. While visitor numbers are modest, they are increasing, drawn by the country's landscapes and history, and facilitated by a relative decrease in violence since the Taliban takeover. However, the trend raises ethical questions for visitors, given the government's severe restrictions on the rights of women and girls.</p>

          <p>France has enacted a new ban on smoking in many public areas, including all beaches, parks, and near schools and swimming pools, in an effort to create a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032. The rules are designed to protect children from passive smoking, which authorities say kills thousands annually. While the ban does not apply to e-cigarettes or the terraces of bars and restaurants, violators could face fines up to €700. The move comes as France, which has one of Europe's higher smoking rates, sees a gradual decline in tobacco use, supported by high taxes on cigarettes.</p>

          <p>A detailed investigation reveals a harrowing stalking campaign by a Church of England lay preacher, Venessa Pinto, against a volunteer, Jay Hulme, after he declined her romantic advances. The report chronicles how both Leicestershire Police and the Bishop of Leicester initially dismissed Hulme's complaints, with the bishop even accusing the victim of witchcraft. After a prolonged period of intense online harassment and threats, police eventually took action, leading to Pinto's conviction. The case highlights significant failures in safeguarding and institutional response within the Church of England and local law enforcement.</p>

These local rules can be even stricter than those issued by central government bodies.

          <p>A massive spending and tax cut package championed by President Donald Trump cleared a critical procedural hurdle in the Senate following a dramatic, hours-long vote. The measure advanced 51-49 after several Republican holdouts, including Senator Ron Johnson, switched their votes to "yes," narrowly avoiding the need for a tie-breaking vote from the Vice President. The legislation, which still faces a final vote and another passage in the House, has exposed deep divisions within the Republican party. Democratic leaders have vowed to slow the process by forcing the nearly 1,000-page bill to be read aloud. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A fast-moving brush fire, named the Lake fire, broke out near Silverwood Lake in San Bernardino County, quickly growing to 478 acres and prompting mandatory evacuations. The blaze, which started Saturday afternoon, forced over 100 people at the reservoir, including campers and boaters, to flee, with many being temporarily stranded before being escorted to safety. Fire crews are battling the fire from the ground and air, but it remains at zero percent containment. Strong wind gusts forecast for the coming days could further challenge firefighting efforts in the region.</p>

The venue management lost a long legal battle with its landlords, who acquired the building in 2017 and plan to continue operating it as a music venue under a different name. Fans and musicians, including Sheffield native Richard Hawley, have mourned the closure, comparing it to the loss of other historic northern venues like The Cavern Club.

Under the initiative, food businesses will be encouraged to make healthy food more accessible and appealing, potentially through promotions, loyalty point incentives, or product reformulation. Major retailers will report on their healthy food sales to increase accountability, though no specific targets are being imposed. The policy is part of a broader strategy to improve national health and relieve pressure on the NHS, as data shows obesity rates continue to climb, particularly among children.</p>

Without naming individuals, he alluded to past instances where he felt compelled to condemn remarks from both President Trump and Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a heatwave affects the UK, this article explains the science behind the "urban heat island effect," which causes cities to be significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas. This phenomenon is caused by the prevalence of hard, dark surfaces like roads and buildings that absorb and retain the sun's energy, releasing it slowly as heat. The lack of vegetation and water sources, which provide natural cooling in the countryside, exacerbates the effect. With climate change making heatwaves more frequent and intense, the growing populations of urban centers are expected to bear the brunt of extreme heat.</p>
