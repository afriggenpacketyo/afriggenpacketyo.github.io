The psychiatrist emphasizes that parents should trust their inherent abilities and cultural traditions rather than relying solely on influencers or clickbait. Prioritizing a child's unique interests and creating a joyful, supportive environment are key, and parents should focus on being genuine rather than striving for perfection. These guidelines aim to simplify parenting and promote healthy youth development.</p>

          <p>Mirra Andreeva, the Russian world number six, thanked a fan for gifting her a "lucky charm" before her French Open third-round victory against Yulia Putintseva.

Andreeva, who lost to Jasmine Paolini in the semi-finals last year, is considered one of the in-form players in Paris, having already claimed titles at Indian Wells and the Dubai Tennis Championships this season.</p>

          <p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported that Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, raising concerns about Tehran's nuclear ambitions. As of May 17, Iran possessed 900.8 pounds of uranium enriched up to 60%, a significant increase since February. The IAEA warned that Iran is the only non-nuclear-weapon state producing such material, and approximately 92.5 pounds of 60% enriched uranium is theoretically enough to produce one atomic bomb if enriched further to 90%. The IAEA urged Iran to fully cooperate with its investigation into uranium traces discovered at undeclared sites.</p>

The operation marks the fifth wave of arrests against political opponents, following the jailing of Istanbul's mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, who is seen as President Erdogan's main rival. Imamoglu, imprisoned on corruption and terrorism-related charges, sent a letter from prison condemning the arrests and questioning the government's actions.

          <p>Karla Flores, diagnosed with a chordoma wrapped around her brain stem, later had a second chordoma discovered on her spine during an MRI. Dr. Mohamed Labib at the University of Maryland Medical Center developed a unique surgical plan, accessing the spinal tumor through Flores' eye in a first-of-its-kind procedure. The "third nostril" approach involved removing part of her eye socket and cheekbone to reach the tumor, which was then successfully removed. Flores is recovering and has no evidence of cancer, and the procedure could offer a new method for operating on difficult-to-reach tumors.</p>

Moderna-manufactured vaccines triggered rashes and chronic hives in 7-18% of participants, leading to safety concerns and a pause in human trials. Simultaneously, the Trump administration's anti-vaccine stance has led to funding cuts for HIV and vaccine research, including the termination of Moderna's contract for mRNA-based flu vaccines. This combination of technical challenges and political obstacles threatens to undo progress toward ending the HIV pandemic, as researchers face limited resources and a culture of fear.</p>
