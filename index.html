          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage unveiled a five-year plan, "Operation Restoring Justice," to tackle illegal migration by detaining and deporting all migrants arriving via small boats. The party pledges £2bn for financial incentives and aid to countries willing to accept returnees, while also considering sanctions. The plan includes leaving the European Court of Human Rights and repealing the Human Rights Act to facilitate mass deportations, aiming to eliminate incentives for unauthorized arrivals. This article details the party's aggressive stance on immigration policy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has escalated his efforts to control the Federal Reserve by attempting to fire Governor Lisa Cook, appointed by Joe Biden for a 14-year term. Trump accused Cook of mortgage fraud, an allegation she denies, vowing to resist the dismissal. This article highlights the legal and political battle, with a Supreme Court ruling suggesting the president lacks the authority to remove a Fed official without just cause, emphasizing the central bank's crucial independence in managing inflation and economic stability. The move is seen as an attempt to influence interest rate decisions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that US military force against Mexican cartels would be ineffective, despite the Trump administration's directive for the Defense Department to use force. While Mexican President Sheinbaum has made progress in counter-narcotics operations, the author contends that past military strategies in Mexico only led to increased violence and cartel fragmentation. The piece suggests that profit motives drive the drug trade, making military solutions insufficient. It advocates for strengthening the DEA, improving border technology, and enhancing bilateral intelligence cooperation instead of military action.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-26 06:00:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Exclusive research reveals that viewers of high-profile US sports games, particularly NHL finals, are exposed to gambling logos and advertisements as frequently as every 13 seconds. The study by the University of Bristol found an average of 3.5 marketing messages per minute during NHL broadcasts, a significant increase since the federal ban on sports betting was overturned in 2018. Critics argue this constant barrage is dangerous for young and vulnerable individuals, prompting calls for federal legislation to regulate sports gambling marketing. The article highlights concerns about escalating gambling addiction.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Republicans, led by Donald Trump, are engaged in an escalating campaign to "fix" elections and secure permanent control of the US government. The author points to Trump's rhetoric about election fraud, his executive orders on voting, and state-level legislative efforts to restrict voting rights as evidence. The article highlights concerns that these actions, including efforts to redraw electoral maps and influence census data, are designed to suppress votes and undermine the integrity of the electoral process.

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order mandating the prosecution of individuals who burn the American flag, describing the act as "uniquely offensive and provocative." The order aims to restore respect for the flag and prosecute those who incite violence while desecrating this national symbol. This article provides a timeline of recent flag-burning incidents, often linked to anti-ICE, anti-Israel, or pro-choice protests, which Trump has frequently condemned. The order clashes with existing court precedents on free speech.</p>
