          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 4-4 deadlock due to Justice Amy Coney Barrett's recusal, upheld a lower court ruling preventing Oklahoma from establishing the nation's first taxpayer-funded religious charter school. The proposed St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School aimed to integrate Catholic teachings into its curriculum. This decision affirms that taxpayer funds cannot directly support religious schools, maintaining the separation of church and state under the First Amendment, as interpreted by the Oklahoma Supreme Court. The outcome underscores the ongoing legal and constitutional debates surrounding religious freedom and public education, particularly concerning the use of public funds for religious instruction. The court's decision leaves in place lower court rulings that said the arrangement would have violated the establishment clause of the First Amendment.</p>

          <p>The British government has accepted recommendations from pay review bodies, offering most teachers and doctors in England a 4% pay raise, which is higher than the initially budgeted 2.8%. Education unions have responded positively but cautioned that the raise may lead to budget cuts in schools unless additional funding is provided. Health unions, however, expressed anger over a smaller 3.6% rise for NHS staff, excluding doctors, with the British Medical Association planning to ballot members for possible strike action, deeming the rise "woefully inadequate". While the education department announced £615m to help cover the raises, it expects schools to contribute through improved productivity and smarter spending.</p>

          <p>An Indian-administered Kashmiri family faces potential separation after India blamed Pakistan for a militant attack and ordered Pakistanis out of the country. Zahida, a Pakistani wife of an Indian national, fears being forced to return to Pakistan, leaving behind her husband and son. Her husband, Bashir, a former militant who returned to India under an amnesty program, worries about the future of his family and the injustice of the situation. This situation highlights the complex human consequences of the ongoing conflict between India and Pakistan in the Kashmir region, particularly for families with cross-border ties.</p>

The attack is being investigated as a possible hate crime, and officials from both Israel and the U.S. have condemned the violence as antisemitic.

While murders of farmers are a problem in South Africa, statistics do not indicate that these murders are race-driven.

          <p>Democrats are criticizing the passage of President Trump's "One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act," saying it will cost Republicans seats in the next midterm elections. The bill is stuffed full of Trump's campaign trail promises and second-term priorities on tax cuts, immigration, defense, energy and the debt limit. Democrats are highlighting the GOP’s proposed restructuring of Medicaid, arguing that the changes will strip away people’s healthcare, force kids to go hungry, and deny communities the resources they need.</p>

          <p>Solar stocks experienced a sharp decline following the House Republicans' passage of a tax bill that terminates key clean energy credits. Residential solar installers like Sunrun plummeted as the legislation ends tax credits for companies that lease equipment to customers. Analysts describe the bill as a "worse than feared" scenario for clean energy. First Solar, however, fell just over 3% as the bill left the manufacturing tax credit relatively unscathed.</p>

          <p>The recent pause on the steepest tariffs on Chinese goods has led importers to boost orders from Asia, but not enough to eliminate the risk of retail shortages, according to a CNBC Supply Chain Survey. The majority of respondents are not seeing a restart in holiday orders from importers since the announcement of the trade war pause. Retailers tell CNBC that import taxes remain too high to complete full orders. Consumers should expect lower inventory across retail sectors and in the parts supply chains for American factories, leading to fewer product selections and likely higher prices.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's revocation of Biden-era rules on AI chip access signals a more targeted approach to curbing China's technological development, rather than an easing of restrictions. New guidance prohibits the use of advanced Chinese chips and restricts the use of U.S. chips for AI model training in China. Analysts suggest this shift could add uncertainty to ongoing trade talks between the U.S. and China. While the Biden administration sought to broadly restrict export of US chips, the Trump administration is taking a more tactical approach.</p>
