          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military had successfully attacked three Iranian nuclear facilities, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan. The strikes involved a full payload of bombs dropped on the Fordow site, and all U.S. planes safely exited Iranian airspace. Trump stated this was a historic moment and urged Iran to end the war, adding that no other military in the world could have executed such an operation. The U.S. had alerted Israel before the strikes and communicated to Iran that these were the extent of planned actions, with no regime change efforts intended.

          <p>Hong Kong's financial sector is experiencing a resurgence driven by China's tech-driven economy and shifting global power dynamics, positioning the city as a key fundraising hub. Credit rating downgrades and slower growth in the U.S. have led to capital flight to Asia, benefiting Hong Kong's stock market. Over 100 enterprises, including major mainland companies, are preparing for public listings on the Hong Kong stock exchange.

          <p>Following President Trump's announcement of U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, congressional leaders voiced varied reactions.

          <p>President Trump's decision to strike Iran has sparked a debate in Congress, with Republicans showing deference to the President's actions without congressional authorization. Concerns are being raised that Trump's actions may alienate some of his supporters who oppose overseas conflicts.

Lawmakers from both parties are concerned about potential retaliation from Iran and its proxies, including possible attacks within the U.S. (not investment advice).</p>

Despite Iran's denials, experts believe Fordo is critical to any potential nuclear weapons program. The facility's fortified location and advanced centrifuges have prompted discussions about using U.S.-produced "bunker-buster" bombs to disable it. The IAEA has expressed concerns about the lack of transparency at Fordo, especially since Iran reduced cooperation with international inspectors.</p>

          <p>Voting is underway in the Tokyo metropolitan assembly election, viewed as a key indicator for the upcoming House of Councillors race. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) aims to retain its seats despite low approval ratings. With no party holding a majority, the election focuses on issues such as inflation, political funding scandals, and child-rearing policies. The race features a high number of candidates, and the results will likely influence national political strategies.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Rebuke of Intelligence Chief Sparks Concern Over Political Motives</h2>

          <p>Senator Jack Reed criticized President Trump's dismissal of his intelligence chief, Tulsi Gabbard, as "shocking" and suggested political motives. Gabbard had testified that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon, but Trump contradicted her, stating that his intelligence community was wrong. Reed suggested Trump's shift was related to contemplating an attack on Iran, requiring a conclusion that Iran has the capacity and intent to develop nuclear weapons. This disagreement raises questions about the integrity of intelligence assessments.</p>

          <p>A yacht collided with a dock in the Hudson River near the Henry Hudson Parkway and West 125th Street, injuring 35 people. The incident occurred while the boat was attempting to dock, causing passengers to fall due to the impact.

          <p>Texas will require all public school classrooms to display the Ten Commandments under a new law that will make the state the nationâ€™s largest to attempt to impose such a mandate. The bill, which was signed into law by Governor Greg Abbott, is expected to draw a legal challenge from critics who consider it an unconstitutional violation of the separation of church and state. A similar law in Louisiana was blocked when a federal appeals court ruled Friday that it was unconstitutional. Arkansas also has a similar law that has been challenged in federal court.</p>
