          <h2>Harvard Sues Trump Administration Over Funding Freeze Amidst Policy Clashes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-21 21:00:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to halt a freeze of $2.2 billion in federal funding, escalating a conflict over the university's policies and leadership. Harvard President Alan Garber accuses the administration of trying to control academic decision-making, particularly following student activism related to the war in Gaza. The lawsuit alleges that the funding freeze violates Harvard's constitutional rights and impedes critical research, while the Trump administration claims it's ensuring universities combat anti-semitism. The legal battle highlights broader tensions between the White House and universities perceived as liberal strongholds.</p>

          <p>Chinese and French scientists have created a detailed map of the crab-eating macaque's claustrum, a brain region believed to be involved in consciousness. This map reveals connections between nerve cells in the claustrum and other brain regions, potentially aiding understanding of cognitive functions like memory integration and abstract thinking. The research also highlights structural and cellular differences between macaque and rodent claustrums, which could offer insights into the evolution of consciousness. While the claustrum's role in functions like sleep regulation and cognitive control is known, the new map provides a foundation for further investigation into the neural basis of awareness.</p>

          <p>A European Space Agency (ESA) project has launched an experiment to assess the feasibility of growing lab-grown food in space, aiming to reduce the high costs of feeding astronauts. The experiment involves sending a bioreactor containing yeast to orbit Earth for three hours before returning for analysis. If successful, this could lead to the development of a small food production plant on the International Space Station within two years. The ultimate goal is to create manufacturing facilities in space to produce ingredients like protein, fat, and carbohydrates, potentially even using 3D printers to create customized meals for astronauts.</p>

Khalil was arrested on March 8, deemed a threat to US foreign policy, and an immigration judge ruled him eligible for deportation. Abdalla vowed to continue fighting for her husband's release.</p>

          <p>US trade officials have finalized tariff levels on solar cells and panels imported from Southeast Asia. The decision follows a year-long trade case brought by American manufacturers who allege that their overseas rivals are flooding the market with unfairly cheap goods. The Commerce Department previously imposed preliminary anti-dumping and countervailing duties on solar equipment from Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam. The tariffs are intended to protect investments in US solar manufacturing, with dumping duties ranging from 6.1% to 271.28% and anti-subsidy countervailing duties between 14.64% and 3,403.96%.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that providing trials for every person the US seeks to deport would take an impractical 200 years. This statement comes amid increasing deportations of Venezuelan migrants, many without criminal records, based on a 1798 law historically used during wartime. Lawyers are challenging the administration's deportation practices, arguing that migrants are not being given due process to contest their cases. The Supreme Court has intervened, halting deportations under the Alien Enemies Act unless detainees are given the opportunity to challenge their removal.</p>

Both leading candidates are promoting plans for new energy infrastructure as Canada aims to reduce its reliance on the US. Liberal leader Mark Carney is promising to make Canada a global superpower in both conventional and green energy, while Conservative Pierre Poilievre seeks to invigorate the oil and gas sector and eliminate the industrial carbon tax. This marks a shift from the 2021 election when the environment was a top concern for voters.</p>

          <p>A federal court in Denver is hearing a legal challenge to the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants. Immigrants' rights groups argue that the administration is not providing adequate notice or due process to those facing deportation under the 1798 law. The ACLU and Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network contend that 24 hours' notice is insufficient for individuals detained in the Aurora ICE Processing Center to challenge their deportation orders. The case raises concerns about the erosion of civil liberties and echoes historical uses of the Act, such as during World War II.</p>
