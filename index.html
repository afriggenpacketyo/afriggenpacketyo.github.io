          <p>President Trump stated he is optimistic about achieving a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, mentioning he has his "own deadline" for negotiations without specifying it. He acknowledged the existing animosity between the nations but expressed confidence that they would eventually come to the table. Trump emphasized the urgency of the situation, noting that the Norwegian Prime Minister is assisting in efforts to expedite the peace process. This statement follows warnings that the U.S. might withdraw from negotiations if progress isn't made swiftly.</p>

          <p>Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, highlighted the surprising expense of users adding polite phrases like "Please" and "Thank you" to their chatbot prompts. While each interaction with a chatbot incurs costs in energy and server usage, Altman suggested the added politeness is a worthwhile investment. This reveals the underlying economics of AI interactions, where every word in a prompt contributes to the overall operational costs. The discussion underscores the growing importance of user behavior in shaping the efficiency and sustainability of AI services.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has appealed to the Supreme Court to reinstate its policy banning transgender individuals from serving in the military, citing concerns about troop readiness and cohesion. This request follows a lower court's decision to block the ban's enforcement, which the administration argues undermines military judgment and national interests. The policy, which was initially implemented and then rescinded by President Biden, reflects differing views on gender identity within the military. The Justice Department contends that the policy is based on medical conditions and related interventions, not discrimination.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England is closely monitoring the potential impact of U.S. tariffs on the U.K.'s economic growth, particularly if global trade slows down. Governor Andrew Bailey stated that the central bank will consider both growth and inflation impacts at its upcoming monetary policy meeting. While he acknowledged economic uncertainty is weighing on business and consumer confidence, Bailey downplayed the immediate risk of a U.K. recession. He also noted that any U.K. retaliation to U.S. tariffs, though unlikely, could push up inflation.</p>
