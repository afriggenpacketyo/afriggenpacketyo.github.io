          <p>Former Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden speaks out about her recent firing by President Trump, describing how she received an email without prior notification or explanation. Hayden believes her dismissal is part of a broader effort to diminish public access to information and inspiration, emphasizing the importance of libraries as bastions of democracy. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated Hayden did not fit the needs of the American people, citing concerns about DEI initiatives and inappropriate books. Hayden responded by expressing concern that there may not have been an awareness of what the Library of Congress does, clarifying its primary function is to fulfill research requests from members of Congress.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered the deployment of 2,000 National Guard members to Los Angeles in response to ongoing immigration protests and clashes between demonstrators and federal agents.

          <p>A CBS News poll reveals that the Trump administration's deportation program has net positive approval, influenced by perceptions of who is being targeted. Support is high among those who believe the program prioritizes dangerous criminals, but drops significantly if the focus is perceived to be broader. Half of Americans think Trump is deporting more people than expected, and most disapprove of the program, emphasizing due process. Views on the program's economic impact are also mixed, with more believing it will weaken the economy, and independents are less supportive than before. (not investment advice)</p>

These principles were formalized in a 2002 agreement with Asean, though China's expansive claims are contested by several member states.

However, the US has shifted away from nation-building and lecturing on governance, leading to a diminished perception of this threat.

          <p>This poem, "Under a Supermoon" by Arthur Sze, reflects on the beauty of minutiae and the exploding nature of life. The speaker contrasts the desire to explore space or the ocean depths with a focus on simple earthly pleasures, such as the scent of split piñon and juniper. The poem references Blake's idea that persistence in folly leads to wisdom. Ultimately, the speaker finds joy in the darkening craters of the moon, the smell of apples, and the realization that life is full of exploding stars.</p>

It suggests that the couple work on strengthening their emotional connection and individual well-being before making any decisions.

          <p>Newt Gingrich's latest book, "Trump's Triumph," is a flattering portrayal of President Trump, crediting him with saving America. However, the book's praise for Elon Musk is undermined by Musk's criticism of Trump's policies. The book also contains score-settling with establishment figures like George HW Bush and Mitt Romney. Gingrich claims Trump sided with the legacies of Barry Goldwater, Ronald Reagan, and himself, while overlooking differences on issues like Iran and immigration. The book's narrative is shaped by Gingrich's desire to stay in favor with those in power.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's efforts to bring back manufacturing jobs, the aviation industry is struggling to hire skilled workers, with a projected shortage of 25,000 aircraft technicians by 2028. The industry experienced layoffs and buyouts during the COVID-19 pandemic, exacerbating the existing retirement wave. Companies like GE Aerospace are ramping up hiring and offering on-the-job training, with base pay averaging $80,000 to $90,000 annually.

The author explores how the different versions of the story highlight the cultural and political forces shaping the two countries' perceptions of each other.

Pell Grants function as a foundation for financial support for low-income students, with over 92% of recipients coming from families with household incomes below $60,000.
