            <h2>US Stock Markets Experience Boost Following Tariff Rollback</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-14 11:01:56 EDT</div>

            <p>US stock markets opened higher after the White House announced a temporary tariff rollback on Chinese-made smartphones and some electronics. The exemption, though potentially short-lived, spurred gains in European markets and particularly benefited Apple's share price, given that a significant portion of its iPhones are manufactured in China. While most imports from China had faced a substantial levy, the rollback offered a momentary reprieve, especially for tech companies. The Nasdaq index saw a notable rise, reflecting the positive sentiment in the technology sector. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey indicated growing consumer anxieties regarding inflation, unemployment, and stock market performance amidst escalating global trade tensions in March. Respondents anticipated higher inflation rates and a surge in the probability of increased unemployment within the next year, reaching levels not seen since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey also reflected concerns about the stock market's future performance, with expectations for market gains declining. These findings align with other surveys reflecting consumer unease about the potential impact of tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump hosted El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele at the White House, amidst ongoing controversy surrounding the deportation of migrants to El Salvador, particularly to the CECOT mega-prison. Discussions likely included the use of CECOT to house deported migrants and the legal dispute over the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. Trump praised Bukele's handling of "violent alien enemies," while concerns persist regarding human rights abuses at CECOT. The Trump administration has deported hundreds of alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador, raising due process concerns.</p>

While Trump has expressed interest in negotiating an end to the war, Zelensky seeks to ensure that any decisions are informed by a direct understanding of the situation on the ground. European leaders have condemned the Sumy attack, highlighting the ongoing disregard for civilian lives.</p>

            <p>A bin strike in Birmingham is set to continue after union members overwhelmingly rejected the city council's latest pay offer, prolonging a month-long standoff that has resulted in significant rubbish accumulation. The dispute centers on the council's decision to remove Waste Recycling and Collection Officer roles, which the union argues will lead to substantial pay cuts for drivers. Despite efforts to clear the backlog, including assistance from military planners and neighboring authorities, residents continue to face disruptions and concerns about vermin. The council maintains that its offer is fair, but the union deems it inadequate.</p>

            <p>New York Helicopter Tours has ceased operations following a crash into the Hudson River that killed all six people on board, including a family of five from Spain. The FAA is reviewing the company's license and safety records, prompted by calls from Senator Chuck Schumer to revoke its operating certificate. The NTSB investigation revealed that the helicopter lacked flight data recording equipment. The crash has renewed debate about the safety of helicopter tours in New York City, with some calling for a ban.</p>

This is most evident in southern Gaza, where Israel is turning an area once home to a quarter-million people into a buffer zone, cutting off Rafah from Egypt. Israel says the war is to pressure Hamas to release hostages, but the takeover alters Gaza's map, surrounding it by Israel on all sides.
