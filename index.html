          <p>Leading defense and aerospace firms, including GE Aerospace, Northrop Grumman, RTX, and Lockheed Martin, have raised their financial outlooks for 2025. This revision follows strong third-quarter performances that surpassed Wall Street's profit expectations, driven by heightened global demand for defense products and commercial aviation components. The companies cite substantial backlogs and increased production capacity as key factors supporting their optimistic forecasts, reflecting a significant rise in U.S. defense spending. The positive adjustments in revenue and earnings guidance signal robust health within the sector despite broader economic uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

The ruling rejected attempts by the companies to prevent their top executives from appearing, stating their testimony is "uniquely relevant." The case alleges that these platforms were deliberately designed with addictive features that cause compulsive behavior and mental health issues in minors, marking a significant development in the legal battles against major technology firms over child safety.</p>

          <p>During a visit to Israel, Vice President JD Vance and presidential advisor Jared Kushner expressed that the fragile ceasefire in Gaza is progressing better than anticipated, despite recent tensions. Vance emphasized that while there will be "fits and starts," the situation is moving in the right direction and affirmed that no American troops would be deployed on the ground. The visit aims to reinforce the peace agreement brokered by the U.S., which has seen some progress with hostage and body exchanges, although skepticism remains among some Israeli analysts about the long-term viability of the deal.</p>

Borrowers are advised to contact their loan servicers directly for most requests, as these government contractors continue to operate normally for tasks like billing and processing applications. For more complex issues, nonprofit organizations and state student loan ombudsmen can provide additional support and guidance during this period.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery has initiated a formal review of its strategic options, including a potential sale of the company, after receiving unsolicited interest from multiple parties. The media giant, which had previously announced plans to split into two separate entities, confirmed it is now exploring all paths to maximize shareholder value. This development sent the company's shares surging by 10%, with sources indicating that major players like Netflix and Comcast are among the interested bidders. The move comes as WBD continues to navigate significant debt from its 2022 merger. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Wawa, a convenience store chain with a cult-like following, is successfully expanding into new markets by competing directly with quick-service restaurants. Known for its fresh, high-quality food like hoagies and breakfast sandwiches, Wawa is increasingly chosen by customers over chains such as Burger King and Starbucks, particularly for morning meals. Despite price increases in line with the industry, the company's customer loyalty remains strong, fueling an ambitious expansion plan to nearly double its number of locations by 2030. This growth is driven by a focus on quality food and community-oriented service.</p>

          <p>A 49-year-old man was arrested at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport after his family alerted police to his social media posts threatening to "shoot it up." The suspect, identified as Billy Cagle, was taken into custody unarmed inside the terminal, and police later found an AR-15 with ammunition in his truck. Officials believe he was returning to his vehicle to retrieve the weapon when he was apprehended. Atlanta's police chief stated that thanks to the family's report and swift law enforcement collaboration, a "tragedy was indeed averted" at the world's busiest airport.</p>

          <p>Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas that, over a 20-year period, traps approximately 84 times more heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide. While it has a shorter lifespan of about 12 years, it is responsible for up to 30% of the global warming that has occurred since the Industrial Revolution. About 60% of atmospheric methane comes from human activities, including agriculture, landfills, and, significantly, the energy sector through leaks and flaring during oil and gas production. Experts suggest that simple measures, like fixing leaks in fossil fuel infrastructure, could drastically reduce these emissions.</p>

The three survivors who have now quit have raised concerns that the inquiry's scope is being improperly widened to downplay the specific nature of their abuse and that potential chairs have conflicts of interest. Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips has denied the cover-up claims, but the resignations have thrown the inquiry into what the opposition calls "chaos," eroding trust in the process.</p>

          <p>The UK Foreign Office has added eight more countries, including Mexico, Japan, and Russia, to its travel advisory list concerning the risk of methanol poisoning from tainted alcoholic drinks. The warning follows several high-profile incidents involving British nationals and advises travelers to be cautious of counterfeit or homemade alcohol.

The guidance urges travelers to purchase sealed drinks from licensed venues and to seek immediate medical attention if they experience symptoms.</p>

          <p>Israel's military withdrawal to the "yellow line," which leaves it in control of over half of the Gaza Strip, serves as a key strategic element in the U.S.-brokered peace plan. This demarcation provides Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with maneuvering room, as further withdrawal is contingent on difficult negotiations over Hamas's disarmament and the transfer of power. While the U.S. pushes for continued peace talks, Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners may see the potential for negotiations to fail, which could make the yellow line a de facto border, creating a complex political dynamic.</p>
