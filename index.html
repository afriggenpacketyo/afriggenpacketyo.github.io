          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump announced that Israel has agreed to the necessary conditions for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza and urged Hamas to accept the proposal.

This development comes as the conflict continues to exact a heavy toll, with Gaza's health ministry reporting over 56,000 fatalities since the war began following Hamas's October 7th attack. The acceptance of the deal by Hamas remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>President Trump's signature "big, beautiful bill" is a sweeping 940-page piece of legislation that extends the 2017 tax cuts while making significant cuts to social welfare programs like Medicaid. The bill has sparked intense controversy over its projected $2.4 trillion addition to the national debt over the next decade. It has also created deep political rifts, drawing opposition from Democrats, causing dissent within Republican ranks, and leading to a public feud between Trump and his former ally, Elon Musk.</p>
