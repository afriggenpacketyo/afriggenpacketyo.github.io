          <p>House Republicans are pushing forward with President Trump's domestic agenda, including tax cuts and Medicaid changes, despite facing opposition from Democrats and internal dissent. The legislation, labeled the ‚Äúbig beautiful bill,‚Äù aims to extend Trump's 2017 tax cut and enact his campaign pledges on tips and overtime pay, with cuts to Medicaid and food stamps to offset costs. Speaker Mike Johnson expressed confidence in passing the bill quickly, but conservative lawmakers are pushing for deeper Medicaid cuts, while Republicans from high-tax states are concerned about limitations on state and local tax deductions. The bill faces further challenges in the Senate, where some Republicans have voiced concerns about its fiscal responsibility. (not investment advice)</p>

The announcement came just before a celebration for Rose, who died in September. Fawn praised Manfred for his graciousness during discussions about her father and expressed gratitude for the overwhelming love and support from Cincinnati fans. Rose, who admitted to gambling in 2004, had been ineligible for Hall of Fame consideration due to the ban, but this changes with the new ruling which is likely to be up to the Classic Baseball Era Committee in December 2027.</p>

          <p>A British maritime authority report reveals that the Bayesian superyacht, which capsized off Sicily last year killing seven people, was likely overturned by strong winds due to its design, particularly its tall single mast. The report noted that a deckhand delayed waking the captain and instead posted a video of the storm on social media, leading to a rapid catastrophe. Experts also questioned the boat's overall stability, citing the high center of gravity due to the mast. The report comes amid ongoing investigations, with Sicilian prosecutors naming the captain and crew members as suspects, and the family of the cook expressed concerns about failures in design, safety certification, and crew management.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing a 67% reduction in funding for a program supporting local newsrooms, citing budget constraints. The state will now provide $10 million instead of the initially planned $30 million for the News Transformation Fund, a joint initiative with Google. This decision is part of a broader effort to address a $12 billion budget shortfall, which includes reductions in healthcare for low-income undocumented immigrants and cuts in overtime hours for some government employees.

          <p>China-Philippine relations face a potential shift as President Marcos's allies failed to secure a majority in the midterm elections, potentially bolstering Vice President Duterte's political influence. Duterte, who is accused of misusing public funds and plotting to assassinate Marcos, is now likely to survive an impeachment trial in July. Analysts suggest that her more pragmatic stance on China could lead to improved relations if she succeeds in the 2028 presidential election. The election results indicate that Marcos has not fully eliminated the Duterte political dynasty's grip on power.</p>

This shift involves suspending refugee programs for other groups, halting foreign aid to South Africa, and expelling the South African ambassador. Influential advisors are pushing an agenda influenced by white victimhood, fueled by meetings with Afrikaner activists and a focus on eradicating diversity and inclusion programs. The administration views South Africa as a cautionary tale and has amplified misinformation about a ‚Äúgenocide of white people,‚Äù despite statistics indicating white farmers are not disproportionately targeted by violent crime.</p>

          <p>Santa Monica's City Council has approved a proposal to transform the Third Street Promenade into an entertainment zone by allowing visitors to purchase and consume alcoholic beverages outdoors. The initiative aims to boost foot traffic and support local businesses, which have suffered since the pandemic, by creating an "Entertainment Zone" between Wilshire Boulevard and Broadway, effective from 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. every Friday through Sunday. Participants must be 21 or older, wear a wristband, and purchase drinks from licensed businesses, with officials hoping to revitalize the once-thriving commercial district.</p>

          <p>Overdose deaths in the United States fell by nearly 30,000 last year, marking the most significant progress in over a decade, with fatalities declining across major drug categories and in most states. Public health experts attribute the improvement to changes in the illicit drug supply, increased access to treatment, and the use of naloxone. Despite the positive trend, the CDC praised President Trump for his declaration of the opioid crisis as a public health emergency in 2017, the new data was released as Mr. Trump‚Äôs health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was testifying on Capitol Hill about the administration‚Äôs proposed cuts to many federal health programs, including those addressing the drug crisis, experts fear that proposed funding cuts to federal health programs could undermine this progress.</p>

          <p>Missouri Republicans are attempting to reinstate a near-total abortion ban through a ballot measure in November 2026, after voters overturned a similar ban via a citizen-sponsored ballot measure. The proposed amendment would ban abortion except in medical emergencies or in cases of sexual assault or incest reported within 48 hours, also banning gender-affirming care for minors. This move contrasts with recent trends where voters have sided with abortion rights on state ballots. Abortion rights groups are calling the measure a deceptive assault on voters and are preparing to fight it.</p>
