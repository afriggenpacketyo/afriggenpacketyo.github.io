            <p>The ashes of Kenneth Wilson, lost in transit from the US to Doncaster, UK, have been returned to his family. Lisa Barrett in Doncaster had been expecting a sample of her father's ashes from her sister in Mississippi, as she was unable to attend his funeral in 2021. After Royal Mail initially stated the package was returned due to unpaid customs fees, it was eventually located, and the family was compensated with financial restitution and flowers. This experience, according to Ms. Barrett, brought her and her sister closer together, requiring them to set aside differences and work together to retrieve their father's ashes, marking the first time they had seen each other virtually since 2018.</p>

            <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. would begin direct talks with Iran in Oman, while also addressing new tariffs being levied on Israel and other nations. Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi confirmed the talks, framing them as an opportunity and a test for the U.S. Trump's meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu occurred amidst market volatility following the announcement of tariffs on imports from Israel, which are set to go into effect soon. Trump left open the possibility of tariff negotiations, while Netanyahu stated that Israel would eliminate its trade deficit with the U.S.</p>

            <h2>Analysts Say China Poised to Retaliate Against Further US Tariffs</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-08 03:12:51 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Economists suggest China is likely to retaliate against President Trump's threat of additional tariffs, as the marginal economic impact of these threats decreases with increasing tariff levels. Dan Wang of Eurasia Group notes that tariffs exceeding 35% would eliminate most profits for China's export sector, making higher tariffs inconsequential and prompting inevitable retaliation. Trump's warning followed the imposition of a 34% tariff by Beijing in response to the U.S.'s reciprocal tariff, potentially pushing combined duties on Chinese imports beyond 100%. This escalation raises concerns about further trade tensions and economic repercussions between the two nations.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>President Trump threatened to impose an additional 50% tariff on Chinese imports if China does not withdraw its plan to impose a retaliatory 34% import fee on American products. China's commerce ministry vowed to "fight to the end" if Trump doesn't back down from his latest threat. This escalation follows Trump's announcement of reciprocal tariffs on imports from about 90 nations, aimed at erasing trade imbalances. If implemented, U.S. tariffs on imports from China could reach a combined 104%, potentially increasing costs for American consumers and spooking Wall Street with fears of economic slowdown or recession.</p>

            <p>Iran has confirmed it will hold indirect talks with the United States in Oman, potentially opening a path for diplomacy regarding Iran's nuclear program. President Trump had announced "direct talks" but Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi clarified they would be indirect and high-level, mediated by a third party. This follows Trump's withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal and reimposition of sanctions, while Iran insists it is not building a nuclear weapon. The talks present an opportunity and a test, with Iran placing the onus on the U.S. to demonstrate trustworthiness.</p>

            <p>This article discusses the complexities of the Suzuka circuit in Formula 1 racing, addressing why drivers consider it a favorite despite limited overtaking opportunities. Fernando Alonso notes the circuit's unique challenge and the resurfacing in the first sector which reduced tire degradation and led to a one-stop race. Max Verstappen emphasized the intense focus required to drive at the limit for an hour and a half around the demanding track. Despite some criticism of the race's processional nature, drivers appreciate the challenge and intensity of Suzuka.</p>

            <p>Big-name journalists are increasingly leaving traditional television roles for independent platforms like Substack, drawn by the promise of greater freedom and direct audience connection. Hamish McKenzie, Substack's co-founder, highlights this shift as a significant media disruption. Former Fox News and NBC personalities such as Chris Wallace and Megyn Kelly have found success in independent ventures, while others like Chuck Todd and Dan Abrams are also exploring similar paths. These platforms offer writers and podcasters the ability to connect directly with their audience, often through paid subscriptions, allowing them to generate income from niche content.</p>

            <p>Despite an invitation from the Philippines to join the Squad security partnership with the United States, Australia, and Japan, India is unlikely to accept, focusing instead on expanding its regional engagement. This decision comes as tensions rise between Manila and Beijing over the South China Sea, while India and China have been working to restore normalcy in their relations. Analysts view India's efforts to expand engagement in the region as significant, even without formally joining the Squad. India has remained tight-lipped on the Squad proposal since it was revealed last month.</p>

            <p>Asian markets rebounded on Tuesday after experiencing significant losses on Monday, driven by President Trump's global tariffs campaign. Japan's Nikkei index rose 5.5%, recovering some of its losses, while South Korea's KOSPI and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 also saw gains. In the U.S., stock market futures were up ahead of Tuesday's opening after Monday's rollercoaster trading, where the Dow posted its largest intraday point swing ever.

            <p>Akkermansia muciniphila, a gut bacteria, can help prevent obesity by maintaining the gut barrier and calming the immune system. This bacteria lives in the large intestine and feeds off mucin, the mucus layer that separates human cells from microbes. Studies have shown that individuals with metabolic diseases have fewer A. muciniphila in their gut, while lean and athletic people have more. While A. muciniphila only consumes mucus, a high-fiber diet indirectly supports its growth by providing carbohydrates for other bacteria, which in turn produce substances that feed human cells in the colon.</p>

            <p>Birmingham, UK, is facing a sanitation crisis as a strike by garbage collectors enters its fifth week, leading to significant waste accumulation. The strike, led by members of Unite, stems from the elimination of a job position and pay cuts due to the city council's financial difficulties following a settlement over historic pay discrimination. The city council has declared a major incident and is bringing in additional cleanup crews, but the situation remains dire, with residents complaining of unsanitary conditions and limited waste disposal options. Talks are ongoing to resolve the dispute.</p>

            <p>A small family-run business in Buckinghamshire has incurred significant financial losses after their electric van became trapped in a mechanical stacked car park in central London for over two years. The van, parked at Rathbone Square in December 2022, has been inaccessible due to a "mechanical malfunction" in the car park. Despite assurances that repairs would be made, the business has been unable to retrieve the van, leading to mounting costs from hiring a replacement vehicle and loan payments on the trapped van. The owners estimate their losses to be around £40,000.</p>

Brooks attempted to avoid justice by repeatedly refusing to engage with the trial, using hunger strikes, and sacking his lawyers. The trial, which faced numerous delays, revealed that Brooks attacked Perks at his home, motivated by a disciplinary hearing where Perks was a witness against him. Despite Brooks's efforts to manipulate the system, the court proceeded with the trial in his absence, eventually finding him guilty.</p>

            <p>Former Bank of England deputy governor Charlie Bean suggests the Bank should cut interest rates to at least 4% in May to address the financial turmoil caused by President Trump's trade tariffs. Bean argues that the uncertainty created by the tariffs will delay investments and negatively impact consumer spending. Another former Bank rate setter, David Blanchflower, supports the call for an emergency meeting to consider a deep reduction in borrowing costs. The OBR previously forecasted that a similar global trade dispute would reduce the UK's national income by 1%. (not investment advice)</p>

The CPTPP is a 12-member trading bloc that includes countries like Australia, Canada, Japan, and the United Kingdom. China applied to join the grouping in 2021, but its bid remains pending.</p>
