          <p>The European Union has delayed the implementation of its first set of retaliatory tariffs on US goods until mid-April.  This decision aligns the timing of EU countermeasures against US tariffs on steel and aluminum. The EU spokesperson stated that this timeline adjustment doesn't reduce the impact of their response, with further retaliation potentially reaching €26 billion.</p>
