          <p>Over 150 unvaccinated students in Spartanburg County, South Carolina, are under a 21-day quarantine following measles exposures. The state has seen 11 cases this year, contributing to the highest national total since 1992, with 1,563 cases reported across 44 outbreaks. This surge comes as national MMR vaccination rates for kindergarteners have fallen to 92.5% from over 95% pre-pandemic, leaving many unprotected.

          <p>The Baltimore Ravens, now 1-5 after their fourth straight loss, anticipate the return of quarterback Lamar Jackson in Week 8 against the Chicago Bears. Jackson has missed two games due to a hamstring injury, during which the team's offense scored only 13 points. Coach John Harbaugh expressed hope for Jackson's comeback, acknowledging the challenge ahead. His return is crucial for the team's playoff aspirations, as he is considered a “generational player” by teammates.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have altered their pitching plan for the National League Championship Series against the Milwaukee Brewers, pushing Shohei Ohtani's next start to later in the series. Manager Dave Roberts announced Yoshinobu Yamamoto will start Game 2 instead, allowing him to stay on his regular five-day rest schedule. This adjustment also provides Ohtani more time to focus on his hitting, following a challenging offensive performance in the NL Division Series.
