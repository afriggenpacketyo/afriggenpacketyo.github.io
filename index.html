            <p>The Trump administration has frozen $2.2 billion in federal funding to Harvard University after the institution rejected demands to alter its policies regarding antisemitism and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. Harvard President Alan Garber stated the university would not compromise its independence or constitutional rights, arguing that the demands constituted governmental overreach. The administration contends that Harvard is not upholding civil rights laws and allowing harassment of Jewish students. This action follows similar funding cuts to Columbia University and reflects the administration's increased scrutiny of universities regarding antisemitism and DEI policies.</p>

            <p>A federal funding freeze by the Trump administration has halted approximately $350 million in key infrastructure projects for over 22 tribes and nonprofits across the country.

The EPA is reviewing the grants to ensure they align with administration priorities, leaving tribes uncertain about the future of these vital initiatives.

            <p>A severe sandstorm in Iraq has left over 1,800 people with breathing problems, impacting the central and southern regions of the country. The storm caused power cuts and flight suspensions, reducing visibility to less than one kilometer. Experts attribute the increasing frequency of these storms to climate change, exacerbating environmental challenges in the region. Health officials are providing assistance to those affected, highlighting the public health impacts of environmental degradation.</p>

            <p>Xpeng, a Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker, plans to use its self-developed AI chip, the Turing chip, in its semi-autonomous cars starting this quarter. The chip is claimed to be more powerful than Nvidia’s Drive Orin X and will be used in all production models. This move underscores the increasing competition in the EV market, with intelligence and autonomous driving capabilities becoming key differentiators. Xpeng aims to deploy these vehicles globally, including in markets like Hong Kong, pending regulatory approvals.</p>

            <p>The number of plays and musicals staged by UK's main subsidised theatres has decreased by almost a third in the past decade, according to BBC research. Funding cuts, rising costs, and the impact of the pandemic are cited as primary reasons. Some venues are co-producing more shows to spread costs, leading to larger-scale productions, but smaller shows are being squeezed out. The decline in opportunities is impacting young talent and the overall theatre workforce, with concerns about low pay and job insecurity.</p>

            <p>A CNBC Supply Chain Survey indicates that President Trump's tariffs are unlikely to result in a reshoring of supply chains to the United States. Companies surveyed believe that relocating supply chains could double costs and are more likely to move to lower-tariff countries. Automation is expected to dominate if manufacturing returns to the US, with concerns about labor costs and a consistent government strategy. The survey also reveals that a majority of respondents feel the Trump administration is "bullying corporate America."(not investment advice)</p>

The UN has verified 148 killings but warns the actual toll is much higher, including aid workers. The UK has announced a £120m aid package for Sudan.</p>

            <p>California's earthquake early warning system provided users with alerts before shaking was felt during a recent magnitude 5.2 earthquake. The ShakeAlert system, operational in California, Oregon, and Washington, relies on seismic sensors to detect shaking and send alerts. Residents reported receiving warnings on their phones seconds before the earthquake, allowing them to take protective actions. The system is available through the MyShake app and built-in Android features, demonstrating the effectiveness of early warning technology in mitigating earthquake risks.</p>
