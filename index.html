        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Honda Motor's first-quarter operating profit fell by 50%, significantly missing analyst estimates due to the impact of U.S. auto tariffs and a strengthening yen. Despite the profit plunge, the company's revenue exceeded expectations, and it raised its full-year profit forecast, anticipating a weaker yen ahead. The results highlight the significant pressure on Japanese automakers from ongoing trade headwinds, with competitors like Nissan also reporting losses. The industry is closely watching for the implementation of a new U.S.-Japan trade deal that promises to lower vehicle tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A BBC analysis reveals that Russia has more than doubled its missile and drone attacks on Ukraine since Donald Trump assumed the presidency in January, despite his calls for a ceasefire. The escalation followed a brief dip in attacks and has occurred alongside two temporary pauses in U.S. military aid to Ukraine. This intensification is fueled by Russia's increased domestic production of munitions, including ballistic missiles and Geran-2 drones. The report highlights the growing vulnerability of Ukrainian cities and the immense strain on civilian morale and air defense systems.</p>

          <p>Global plastic production is expanding at a rapid pace, projected to potentially triple by 2050 and significantly contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Derived almost entirely from fossil fuels, this growth serves as a lifeline for oil and gas industries. Despite over 140 nations implementing restrictions on single-use plastics, overall manufacturing capacity is increasing, particularly in the US, China, and Southeast Asia. International negotiations to cap production have been stalled by a small group of petro-states, prompting calls for alternative strategies like demand reduction and treaties among non-producing nations.</p>

          <p>President Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, has arrived in Moscow for discussions with Russian leadership aimed at securing a ceasefire in Ukraine. This visit comes as a White House-imposed August 8th deadline approaches, after which Trump has threatened to impose further economic sanctions on Russia if a deal is not reached. The diplomatic effort is occurring amid a record-setting month of Russian long-range attacks on Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed he has coordinated positions with President Trump, while the Kremlin has expressed openness to continued dialogue.</p>

Overall company sales and net profit were largely in line with expectations. However, the company's stock has been under pressure due to softer U.S. sales, increased competition, and disappointing trial results for a next-generation drug. In response, Novo Nordisk has pledged to cut costs and is also facing pressure from the Trump administration to lower U.S. prescription drug prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The BBC has begun airing a new series of MasterChef that was filmed before its hosts, Gregg Wallace and John Torode, were dismissed following an investigation into misconduct allegations. The decision to broadcast the pre-recorded season has drawn criticism from broadcast unions and women's rights groups. In response, the BBC stated it was the right choice for the contestants involved, though one participant was edited out at her own request. The episodes have been re-edited to reduce the hosts' on-screen presence and banter amid the ongoing controversy.</p>

          <p>A leading economic think tank, NIESR, has warned that UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves must implement "a moderate but sustained increase in taxes" to cover a projected £41.2 billion shortfall in public finances. The report suggests that without tax hikes, the government is on track to miss its self-imposed borrowing rules. This creates a difficult choice for the Chancellor between her fiscal targets, spending commitments, and manifesto promises not to raise key taxes on working people. The warning comes amid weakening economic growth and challenges from global trade uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A tactical analysis explores why the throw-in remains one of football's most underdeveloped set-pieces, despite its potential to be a significant weapon. The article references Rory Delap's iconic long throws for Stoke City as a rare example of a team maximizing this opportunity. It questions the lack of innovation, noting that throw-ins operate outside the offside law, creating unique tactical possibilities. The piece suggests that with specialized training and the application of set-piece strategies similar to those used for corners, teams could revolutionize this often-overlooked aspect of the game.</p>

The performance of these new models is reportedly comparable to some of OpenAI's smaller proprietary systems.

          <p>Ion Iliescu, the first freely elected president of post-communist Romania, has died at the age of 95. Iliescu rose to power during the chaotic 1989 overthrow of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, presenting himself as a stabilizing force. His legacy is complex; he is credited with guiding Romania toward democracy but also criticized for his role in the violent suppression of opposition protests, known as the "mineriads." For decades, he faced investigations related to the deaths that occurred during the 1989 revolution, though he was never ultimately compelled to stand trial.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Australian Institute of Marine Science reveals that the Great Barrier Reef has suffered its largest-ever annual decline in live coral cover over the past year. This devastating loss is a direct result of a severe and widespread mass coral bleaching event in early 2024, driven by unprecedented levels of ocean heat stress. Scientists observed the steepest declines in the reef's northern and southern regions since monitoring began in 1986. The report highlights the increasing volatility of the ecosystem, pointing to climate change as the primary driver of the stress and damage.</p>

Additionally, the 'planet theory' suggests that for skill positions like running back, the pool of elite athletes is vast, making it hard for newcomers to stand out. Unlike linemen, where unique size is a premium, athletes like Rees-Zammit must possess unparalleled athletic ability to overcome their deficit in lifelong football knowledge.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks extended their winning streak, defeating a surging Indiana Fever team 100-91. The Fever, who had won five straight games, were playing without their injured franchise star, Caitlin Clark. The Sparks, now fully healthy for the first time in over a year, were led by Kelsey Plum's 25 points and 11 assists, with strong contributions from Rickea Jackson, Dearica Hamby, and Azurá Stevens. The game was briefly interrupted in the second quarter when a sex toy was thrown onto the court from the stands, the third such incident in the WNBA in a week.</p>

          <p>The NFL and ESPN have entered into a nonbinding agreement for ESPN to acquire NFL Network, NFL Fantasy, and the distribution rights for the RedZone channel. As part of the deal, the NFL will receive a 10% equity stake in ESPN, which is valued at an estimated $2.2 to $2.5 billion. This framework, which still requires final negotiations and regulatory approval, would integrate NFL Network into ESPN's upcoming direct-to-consumer streaming service. The move is seen as a major step to bolster ESPN's content offerings while aligning with the NFL's long-term revenue goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is facing a shortage of rocket launch capacity as it races to build satellite internet constellations to compete with SpaceX's Starlink. The national priority project, Guo Wang, has recently accelerated its launch schedule, utilizing multiple Long March rockets and signaling it has preferential access to state-owned launch vehicles. This has left other ambitious projects, like Shanghai's Qianfan constellation, turning to private rocket companies to deploy their satellites. The competition for limited launch resources highlights a growing tension between national strategic goals and the aspirations of regional and commercial space enterprises in China.</p>

The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to govern D.C., and it could repeal the city's 52-year-old self-rule.

Abbott's petition argues that the lawmakers' indefinite absence constitutes an abandonment of their public duty. This move escalates the political standoff, which began with threats of civil arrest, into a legal battle over the power to remove duly elected officials.</p>

This potential drop in support could challenge Republican strategies, especially in states like Texas where the party aims to gain seats.
