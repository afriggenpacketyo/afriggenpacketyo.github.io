          <p>Devastating flash floods have struck Texas Hill Country, resulting in what officials are calling a "mass casualty event" with at least 24 confirmed fatalities. The Guadalupe River rose with shocking speed, catching communities and a children's summer camp by surprise, from which about two dozen campers remain missing. Search and rescue operations are extensive, involving helicopters and hundreds of personnel, as Governor Greg Abbott has declared a disaster to mobilize state resources. The National Weather Service reportedly underestimated the rainfall, contributing to the tragedy's severity.</p>

          <p>An arsonist set fire to the front doors of a synagogue in Melbourne, Australia, forcing about 20 worshippers to evacuate through a rear exit. Fortunately, no injuries were reported in the incident, which is being investigated by a counter-terrorism unit as a serious, hate-motivated crime. This attack follows a similar arson at another Melbourne synagogue seven months prior and occurred on the same night that protestors harassed diners at an Israeli-owned restaurant nearby. Victoria's Premier Jacinta Allan condemned the act as antisemitic and intended to traumatize Jewish families.</p>

          <p>A single mother in New Jersey reports being left with a $50,000 car loan after her dealership, Autosmart, allegedly failed to pay off her original loan as promised during a refinancing deal. This case highlights the dangers of auto loan refinancing scams, where fraudulent companies collect payments without settling the original debt, potentially ruining a consumer's credit and risking vehicle repossession. The Federal Trade Commission warns consumers to be wary of such schemes and to thoroughly research dealerships and read all loan documentation carefully before signing. The article advises victims to report fraud to the FTC and their state attorney general. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eight key nations within the OPEC+ alliance have agreed to a larger-than-expected oil production increase of 548,000 barrels per day starting in August. This decision, led by major producers like Saudi Arabia and Russia, accelerates the reversal of previous voluntary supply cuts. The group cited a stable global economic outlook and healthy market fundamentals, including low oil inventories, as the basis for their decision. This move continues a trend of gradually increasing output to meet summer demand and stabilize the market, with oil futures settling around $68 per barrel for Brent crude. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukraine's military has announced a successful strike on the Borisoglebsk airbase in Russia's Voronezh region, a key hub for Russian fighter jets. The attack reportedly hit a depot containing glide bombs and aircraft, marking another significant Ukrainian effort to degrade Russia's air capabilities. This came as Russia launched a massive wave of 322 drones and decoys at Ukraine, with most being shot down or electronically jammed. The escalating conflict coincides with diplomatic activity, including a call between Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and U.S. President Trump to discuss strengthening Ukraine's air defenses.</p>

The author points out that Combs was still found guilty of lesser charges related to prostitution and that his own defense team admitted to his history of domestic abuse against his ex-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura. The piece critiques the defense's strategy of portraying Combs as a victim of 'gold diggers' while leveraging his celebrity status to influence public opinion.

The job market is shifting, with increasing demand for AI-specific skills and a projected decline in routine office support and customer service roles.

For Iran, surviving the onslaught is seen as a victory that justifies continued defiance, and it has already moved to suspend cooperation with the IAEA nuclear watchdog. The war has shattered any remaining trust, making a grand diplomatic bargain unlikely and setting the stage for a prolonged, tense intermission rather than a lasting peace.</p>

Vance has also become a prominent defender of Trump's foreign policy, notably supporting the decision to strike Iran despite his previous non-interventionist stance.

          <p>Credit scoring company FICO has announced that it will begin incorporating data from 'buy now, pay later' (BNPL) loans into some of its credit scores this fall. This change reflects the growing popularity of services like Affirm and Klarna, which allow shoppers to pay for purchases in installments. For consumers, making on-time BNPL payments could help build credit history, while missed payments could negatively impact their score. Lenders support the move, as it provides a more complete picture of a borrower's debt obligations, addressing a previous blind spot in credit assessments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Democrats believe President Trump's recently passed tax-and-spending legislation provides a powerful campaign message for the 2026 midterm elections. They plan to focus on the bill's nearly $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, which they are framing as the 'largest cut to health care in American history.' While Trump is launching a campaign to promote the bill as an economic renaissance, polling shows the legislation is unpopular, and Medicaid itself is a widely supported program. Health care has historically been a potent issue in midterm elections, and Democrats hope to leverage it to win back control of the House.</p>

A major development was Robinhood's launch of on-chain tokenized U.S. stocks, making it the first publicly traded U.S. company to do so. Major financial players like Deutsche Bank and BlackRock are also building on Ethereum, valuing its stability, security, and dependability for creating tokenized funds and other assets. Despite market volatility, the trend suggests Ethereum is solidifying its position as the foundational plumbing for the future of Wall Street. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that President Trump's plan to host a UFC event on the White House lawn is more than a spectacle; it is a calculated piece of authoritarian political theater. The author, a former MMA commentator, draws parallels between Trump's use of the UFC and the way authoritarian leaders like Vladimir Putin leverage sports to project an image of strength and masculinity. The longstanding alliance between Trump and UFC CEO Dana White has intertwined the promotion with MAGA mythology, celebrating a brand of confrontational politics and nationalist machismo. The event is framed as the climax of this partnership, normalizing a cult of personality and violence.</p>

          <p>Following last month's US and Israeli strikes on Iran, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called for the negotiation of a 'new international agreement' to resolve the Iranian nuclear issue. Speaking in Paris, Wang expressed deep concern over escalating regional tensions and warned of a potential 'nuclear disaster.' He proposed that a new deal should place all of Iran's nuclear activities under the strict supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This move positions China as a potential mediator while intensifying its criticism of the US and Israeli military actions against its ally, Tehran.</p>

The author describes the event as an honest, if disgusting, spectacle that reflects a society defined by extreme consumption and the relentless pursuit of more. The piece satirically frames competitive eating as a form of punkish protest, holding a mirror to a world of overabundance, from food to information. It argues that in its sheer, grotesque excess, the contest is a strangely fitting and symbolic sport for our times, dramatizing a freedom that has 'bolted terminally out of hand.'</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the complex question of whether culture shapes visual perception, examining two recent studies with conflicting findings on optical illusions. One study suggests people from 'carpentered' Western environments perceive illusions differently than those from rural Namibia, while another study debunks this hypothesis for the famous Müller-Lyer illusion. The author, a neuroscientist, posits that perception is an active brain construction, a 'controlled hallucination,' making individual and group differences plausible. He argues for studying perceptual diversity within groups, not just between them, to move beyond simple cultural stereotypes and foster humility about our own way of seeing.</p>

Cases include a woman who put a broken bench out for a pre-arranged scrap metal collection and a man who temporarily left a bag of garden waste on a verge. WISE operates on a 'cost-neutral' model for councils, retaining a percentage of the fines it issues. Critics argue the company's tactics are heavy-handed and its penalty notices are intimidating, designed to make people pay rather than challenge minor, technical infractions in court.</p>

Business leaders and economists warn that even the tariffs already in place are filtering through to consumer prices. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has noted that the cost of tariffs must ultimately be paid, with some of it inevitably falling on the end consumer. (not investment advice)</p>

A survey by the UK Pride Organisers Network found that a vast majority of Prides have seen a drop in corporate sponsorship, with some losing over half their revenue compared to last year. This has led to cancellations in cities like Liverpool and Plymouth, and others, like Salford Pride, are charging for tickets for the first time. Organizers attribute the decline to corporations cutting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion budgets, particularly in the US, which has a ripple effect on UK funding.</p>
