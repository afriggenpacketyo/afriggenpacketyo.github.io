            <p>Severe gales, with wind gusts reaching up to 93mph, have led to the cancellation of hundreds of flights and suspension of train services in Beijing and northern China. Authorities issued an orange alert, urging residents to stay indoors and avoid non-essential travel. While some damage to vehicles and fallen trees were reported, no injuries occurred as most residents heeded the warnings. The strong winds are attributed to a cold vortex system originating over Mongolia and are expected to subside by Sunday.</p>

            <p>The Church of England's commitment to net-zero carbon emissions by 2030 is facing criticism from clergy and wardens who claim it is detrimental to rural churches. Restrictions on new oil or gas boilers have left many churches without heating, potentially endangering parishioners' health and impacting attendance. The cost of green alternatives, like heat pumps, is often prohibitive, especially for older, poorly insulated buildings. Some churches have resorted to breaking the law to provide heating for their congregations, highlighting the challenges of balancing environmental goals with the practical needs of maintaining historic places of worship.</p>

Hotel associations are scrambling to maintain foreign bookings amid anxieties about the U.S.'s global perception and potential economic pressures.

            <p>The article reflects on Stephen A. Smith's potential presidential run, drawing a parallel to Franklin D. Roosevelt's use of mass media to connect with the public during the Great Depression. The author suggests that Smith, like Roosevelt, should focus on articulating clear policies and solutions to address the nation's problems, rather than relying solely on celebrity and hot takes. The column emphasizes the importance of understanding and addressing complex issues, as Roosevelt did with the banking crisis, and cautions against vague slogans and personal attacks in political discourse.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has placed a check on President Trump's authority to swiftly deport individuals suspected of being members of foreign crime gangs, ruling that those facing deportation are entitled to a hearing before a federal judge. This decision ensures that individuals have the opportunity to challenge their removal and present their case. The ruling stems from a case involving the deportation of Venezuelans and Salvadorans, some of whom claimed they were wrongly labeled as gang members. While the court did not address the president's broad wartime powers, the decision is expected to slow down the pace of deportations.</p>

            <p>A three-year legal saga surrounding the death of Charles Givens, an inmate with health problems, at Virginia's Marion Correctional Treatment Center has concluded with a jury finding no liability for the five former correctional officers accused of his death. Givens' sister sued the guards for $15 million, alleging they beat him, leading to fatal internal bleeding, but the defense argued he died from a seizure-induced fall. Despite a medical examiner initially citing blunt force trauma, the jury sided with the defense, highlighting the challenges of proving abuse in prison settings.</p>

            <p>Ecuador's upcoming presidential election is crucial as the country grapples with record levels of drug gang violence and a struggling economy. Once peaceful, Ecuador has become a major hub for cocaine trafficking, leading to one of Latin America's highest homicide rates. The election is a rematch between incumbent Daniel Noboa, who declared drug gangs as terrorists and has sought international assistance, and Luisa González, a leftist tied to former president Rafael Correa. Voters are primarily concerned with combating the narco-fueled violence, but the country's economic challenges limit the resources available to address the crisis.</p>

            <p>A new study reveals that crows can distinguish between shapes with geometric regularity and those without, demonstrating a mathematical skill previously thought to be unique to humans. Researchers at the University of Tübingen found that crows could identify the outlier in a group of quadrilaterals, even when the differences were subtle. This discovery challenges the notion that geometric intuition is specific to humans and opens new avenues for investigating mathematical abilities in animals. The study suggests that human geometric abilities may build upon precursor capabilities present in the animal kingdom.</p>

            <p>The jury in Hunter Biden's gun trial has begun deliberations after closing arguments. Biden is charged with making false statements when purchasing a firearm in 2018, alleging he lied about his drug use on the federal form. The prosecution argued that Biden knowingly made false statements, while the defense contended that he did not intentionally deceive anyone. The outcome of the trial could have significant implications for Biden and his family.</p>

            <p>A measles outbreak in western Texas has worsened due to vaccine skepticism, with over 500 cases and two deaths, primarily affecting the Mennonite community. Health officials are struggling to counter vaccine hesitancy, even as the outbreak spreads to neighboring states. The community's avoidance of modern medicine and mixed messaging from federal officials, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have contributed to low vaccination rates. The outbreak highlights the challenges of addressing vaccine skepticism and the need for stronger messaging to promote immunization.</p>
