            <p>US stocks experienced a significant rally after President Trump announced a temporary pause on some tariffs, signaling a potential shift in trade policy. The S&P 500 saw its largest single-day gain since 2008, reflecting market relief following days of turmoil sparked by the initial tariff announcements. While tariffs on China were increased, the pause on other countries' tariffs suggests a willingness to negotiate, though the long-term impact on the US and global economies remains uncertain. This development follows market anxieties over potential economic recession due to escalating trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite the rally, markets remained below pre-tariff levels, and increased tariffs on China were also announced, adding complexity to the trade landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

The boy's mother expressed horror at the footage, arguing that calming rooms should provide comfort, not resemble padded cells. While the school maintains that investigations found no wrongdoing by staff, the incident raises broader questions about the regulation and oversight of calming rooms in schools.</p>

The initiative aims to address the policing "postcode lottery" by ensuring each community has dedicated neighborhood officers. The Labour government intends to deploy named local officers in each neighborhood and increase police ranks by 13,000 by 2029. Starmer argues that visible policing has declined, leading to unsolved crimes and increased anti-social behavior, emphasizing prevention as a core policing strategy.</p>

            <p>Despite the stock market's positive reaction to Trump's tariff pause, analysts caution that the US economy remains vulnerable. Trump's current trade policies, including a 10% universal tariff and a 125% tariff on China, are still more radical than previously anticipated worst-case scenarios. The market's optimism hinges on the assumption that Trump will further reduce tariffs, as his current stance could lead to increased prices and a higher risk of recession. The long-term impact on business confidence and investment decisions remains uncertain due to the volatility of US trade policy. (not investment advice)</p>

The order aims to restrict the firm's access to government buildings and security clearances, potentially hindering its ability to represent clients with federal interests. Trump's rationale is linked to the firm's involvement in alleged "election misconduct." Legal experts argue that the order is unconstitutional, infringing on freedom of expression and the right to counsel, and constitutes an anti-democratic effort to intimidate lawyers challenging the administration.</p>

            <p>Kash Patel has been removed as the interim head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), with Dan Driscoll, the secretary of the army, taking his place. This move places control of the ATF, the agency responsible for enforcing gun laws, under the Department of Defense for the first time. The Trump administration has expressed skepticism towards the ATF's mission and has considered merging it with the Drug Enforcement Administration. The decision to have the army secretary run the ATF could signal a reduction in its size and scope.</p>

            <p>UK scientists have developed a saliva test that analyzes men's DNA to identify those at highest risk of developing prostate cancer. The test targets men for biopsies and MRI scans, potentially detecting aggressive cancers earlier. While the test has shown promise in identifying high-risk tumors, it has not yet been proven to save lives and is not expected to be used routinely for several years. The development comes amid growing calls for routine prostate cancer screening, though concerns remain about the potential harms of current testing methods.</p>

            <p>House Republicans narrowly advanced a budget plan crucial for extending President Trump's tax cuts, following pressure from the president to overcome opposition within the party. The budget resolution, which still faces a final vote, serves as a blueprint for implementing Trump's priorities on border security, defense, energy, and taxes. Some Republicans have expressed concerns about the low level of spending cuts in the Senate resolution compared to the House version. Trump urged GOP holdouts to support the budget resolution, emphasizing the importance of unity and action.</p>

            <p>Following President Trump's decision to pause reciprocal tariffs for most countries while increasing tariffs on China, right-wing commentators have scrambled to justify the administration's trade policies. Some have defended the tariffs as a necessary measure for economic strength, while others have attempted to downplay their potential negative impacts. The shifting narratives reflect the challenge of reconciling Trump's evolving trade strategy with the need to maintain support from his base. The article critiques these justifications, highlighting the contradictions and potential consequences of Trump's trade policies.</p>

            <p>President Trump's decision to pause the imposition of "Liberation Day" tariffs for 90 days sparked a market rebound, but concerns remain about the underlying economic risks. While the pause is better than the original policy, it still involves significant tariffs that will likely lead to rising costs for American businesses and households. Uncertainty surrounding trade policy continues to dampen business spending and consumer confidence, increasing the risk of a recession. The US has gained little in return for the economic disruption caused by Trump's tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>
