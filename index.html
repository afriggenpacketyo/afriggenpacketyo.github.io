          <p>China has accused the United States of "double standards" after President Donald Trump announced an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods and critical software export controls, effective November 1. Beijing defended its recent rare earth export curbs as a legitimate measure for global stability, asserting minimal supply chain impact. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce warned of retaliatory actions if the US persists, escalating trade tensions shortly before a potential Trump-Xi meeting. This move reignites a trade war previously paused after earlier tariff exchanges.</p>

          <p>Alison Davis was found not guilty of murder in the 2023 death of her husband, Kevin Davis, who died from multiple skull fractures after allegedly falling down stairs. Police initially deemed it an accident but later suspected homicide after an autopsy, focusing on Alison due to inconsistencies in her statements and observed behavior. The defense argued Kevin's injuries were consistent with a fall onto a banister post, while prosecutors suggested a beating. The jury ultimately sided with the defense's medical expert, leading to Alison's acquittal after 17 months in jail.</p>

Manager Dave Roberts noted the Brewers' unique small-ball offense, which emphasizes getting on base and making contact rather than relying on home runs. Milwaukee's pitching staff, known for developing talent, ranked second in team ERA this season and previously swept the Dodgers in July. The Dodgers are assessing their strategy against a team with a strong, deep roster despite a smaller payroll.</p>

          <p>Austin Beutner, former L.A. schools superintendent and philanthropist, is expected to announce his challenge to Mayor Karen Bass in the 2026 election. Beutner criticizes Bass's response to the devastating Palisades fire, which destroyed thousands of homes and caused 12 deaths, citing issues like broken hydrants and inadequate firefighter deployment. His entry into the race could pose a significant threat to Bass, who is seeking a second term, potentially inspiring other prominent figures like Rick Caruso to join the mayoral contest. Beutner, a Democrat, expressed regret for his previous vote for Bass, describing Los Angeles as a city "adrift."</p>

          <p>William Bordsen, accused of the first-degree murder of his roommate Robert Murphy, is back in jail after a judge revoked his $400,000 bond. Initially, Bordsen claimed self-defense, alleging Murphy was drunk and started a fight. However, new evidence, including toxicology reports disproving Murphy's intoxication and cellphone video allegedly showing Bordsen taunting the dying victim, led to the reversal. The victim's family expressed relief, believing increased scrutiny on the criminal justice system contributed to the decision, and now seeks a conviction.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has directed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to ensure military personnel receive their paychecks on October 15, despite the ongoing federal government shutdown. This directive comes as thousands of other federal employees, approximately 40% of the workforce, have been furloughed or laid off without pay. The administration has begun unprecedented "reductions in force" (RIFs) across several agencies, including the CDC and Treasury Department, with more cuts anticipated. Republicans and Democrats continue to blame each other for the shutdown, which began on October 1.</p>

The article argues that populist pressures are eroding political will, leading leaders to backtrack on climate commitments and frame environmental policies as incompatible with affordability. The author proposes six steps democracies must take to develop stronger mechanisms that protect climate policy from political cycles.

They argue Mangione was not read his rights before questioning and that his backpack, containing a gun, was searched without a warrant. The defense also contends the federal charge, which relies on "crimes of violence" like stalking, is improperly applied as stalking is not a qualifying offense.

          <p>Britain is currently experiencing a widespread surge in respiratory illnesses, including common colds, flu, and Covid-19, leading to many people feeling unwell. Experts attribute this to the autumn season, with increased indoor mixing in schools and workplaces. Rhinovirus, causing common colds, is particularly prevalent, while new Covid variants are circulating, though immunity levels generally lead to milder infections. Flu is also showing an early uptick in younger age groups. Public health officials advise vaccination for eligible individuals and practicing good hygiene, like handwashing and staying home when sick, to protect vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of travelers are using AI chatbots like ChatGPT to plan their holidays, from suggesting destinations to crafting itineraries. While some users, like Alan Smith, found AI helpful in discovering unexpected gems like Castro Urdiales in Spain, others encountered inaccuracies. Hannah Read, for instance, was given false information about a ferry route from the UK to Norway. Experts advise fact-checking AI suggestions, especially for critical details like travel routes and opening times, as chatbots can be overly optimistic and affirming. Despite potential pitfalls, AI tools are gaining traction for streamlining initial holiday research.</p>

          <p>Microsoft is ending official support for its Windows 10 operating system on October 14, making millions of devices vulnerable to security threats as updates cease. Users are encouraged to upgrade to Windows 11 for free, though many older computers may not be compatible, raising concerns about unnecessary spending and environmental waste. Alternatively, users can opt for Extended Security Updates (ESU) until October 2026, which offers critical security patches but no technical support. This ESU option is free for those with a Microsoft account and the latest Windows 10 version, otherwise incurring a fee.</p>

          <p>An Indian national, Sahil Majothi, 22, has been captured by Ukrainian forces, marking the first known Indian detained in the conflict. Majothi's mother claims he was falsely accused in a drug case in Russia, where he was studying computer engineering. A video released by the Ukrainian army shows Majothi stating he joined the Russian army to avoid imprisonment, with promises of pay that were never fulfilled. India's foreign ministry is investigating the case, having previously urged its citizens to avoid serving in the Russian military due to significant risks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The autumn climbing season in the Himalayas is becoming increasingly dangerous due to shifting weather patterns, with meteorologists reporting monsoons extending into October and frequent extreme rainfall events. A recent shock blizzard stranded hundreds of tourists near Mount Everest's eastern face, resulting in one death and widespread hypothermia and altitude sickness. Officials also reported 60 deaths from landslides and flash floods on the Nepal side. Scientists link these extreme weather events to climate change, specifically higher atmospheric moisture and more frequent interactions between monsoons and westerly disturbances, leading to intensified storms.</p>

          <h2>Appeals Court Halts Deployment of National Guard Troops in Illinois</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-11 18:00:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An appeals court has ruled that National Guard troops sent to Illinois by President Donald Trump can remain under federal control but cannot be deployed. This decision pauses a federal judge's temporary block on deployment, which found no substantial evidence of a "danger of rebellion" in Illinois amid Trump's immigration crackdown. The ruling follows criticisms from Democratic senators, who were denied entry to an ICE facility near Chicago and questioned the administration's transparency. The court's order reinforces the long-standing aversion to military involvement in domestic policing, citing constitutional concerns.</p>
