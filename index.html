          <p>Bulgarian officials rescued approximately 75 individuals from two illegal care homes, which Justice Minister Georgy Georgiev described as "houses of horrors". Residents were subjected to brutal mistreatment, including beatings, sedation, and being bound. The facilities, operating under the guise of health centers, charged residents over 400 euros a month, and some residents were confined for years, with one attempt to escape resulting in severe beating. Five people have been arrested, and an investigation into kidnapping, violence, and negligence has been launched, as inspections of nursing homes and hospices are underway to combat property fraud targeting vulnerable individuals. The poor state of health facilities in Bulgaria has been criticized by international organizations, contributing to the rise of illegal centers. Optimism score is not included in the summary.</p>

          <p>Thousands of protesters took to the streets of Los Angeles in response to President Trump's deployment of the National Guard, leading to clashes with law enforcement. Demonstrations intensified, with protesters blocking a major freeway and setting self-driving cars on fire, resulting in police using tear gas and rubber bullets to control the crowds. Governor Gavin Newsom requested the removal of the Guard, deeming the deployment a breach of state sovereignty, while Mayor Karen Bass blamed the administration for provoking chaos.

          <p>President Trump's latest travel ban, targeting citizens from several of the world's poorest nations, is criticized as a racist policy that could cement racism as his most dangerous legacy. The ban, which restricts entry from countries with predominantly Black, Brown, and Muslim populations, is seen as a continuation of Trump's history of discriminatory rhetoric and policies. Critics argue that the ban lacks a clear national security basis and reflects a pattern of targeting people of color. The travel ban is part of a broader effort to restrict immigration and promote white identity politics, further normalizing discriminatory practices.

The bill's tax cuts disproportionately benefit the wealthy, while millions could lose health insurance due to the expiration of ACA tax credits and new Medicaid work requirements.

The proposed budget emphasizes a return to the moon and a manned voyage to Mars, but cancels 19 space exploration projects, jeopardizing valuable data and expertise.

          <p>Rolin Jones, showrunner for AMC's "Interview With the Vampire," humorously reflects on the phenomenon of fans tattooing lines from the show on their bodies. Specifically, the line “Be all the beautiful things you are and be them without apology, for all eternity,” which Jones himself wrote. He expresses a mix of horror and humility, acknowledging the intensity of the fans' connection to the show and its characters. He contrasts this with his initial intent of using the line to resolve a plot point, showcasing the unexpected impact of his writing. Optimism score is not included in the summary.</p>

          <p>Former Colombian soldiers, experienced in combat, are increasingly being recruited by Mexican cartels to train hitmen and participate in turf wars.

          <p>As the federal government reduces its responsibilities, particularly in areas like disaster relief, public health, and consumer protection, states should pool their resources to compensate, according to legal experts Aziz Z. Huq and Jon D. Michaels. Interstate collaboration can involve setting up regional research consortia, recreating public-health forecasting centers, and mobilizing criminal task forces to combat corruption. This approach allows states to maintain essential services and attract residents and businesses by prioritizing health and safety. The authors argue that such collaboration can rebuild a national compact without the political strings attached to federal funding. Optimism score is not included in the summary.</p>
