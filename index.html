          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) suggests that a "fundamental regime change" may be occurring in financial markets as investors reconsider the riskiness of U.S. assets due to trade tariffs. The ECB's Financial Stability Review notes that market volatility has spiked in response to global trade tensions caused by U.S. tariff policies. The article also points out that there have been shifts away from traditional safe havens like U.S. Treasuries and the U.S. dollar, potentially leading to broader shifts in global capital flows. ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos warned of a potential market correction due to elevated valuations and strong uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This New York Times article addresses questions surrounding President Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis, including why it went undetected and whether it explains his occasional affect. Science reporter Gina Kolata explains that Biden's cancer is aggressive and has spread to his bones, making it incurable but controllable with drugs. The article notes that Biden's physicians stopped testing his prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after 2014, possibly contributing to the delayed diagnosis. The piece also discusses the guidelines for prostate cancer screening in older men and whether Biden should have been tested more regularly given his position.</p>

          <p>This article discusses Charles Murray's 2015 book, *By the People: Rebuilding Liberty Without Permission*, which advocated for wealthy donors to fund civil disobedience against the regulatory state. The article argues that Murray's extreme anti-government sentiment and skepticism of democracy prefigured Trump's actions during his second term, including the gutting of federal agencies via DOGE. The piece contends that Murray's ideas help explain why mainstream conservatives have been comfortable with Trump's disregard for the rule of law, as they share his belief that the American government is no longer worthy of respect.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. announced that the redesigned 2026 Toyota RAV4 will only be offered as a hybrid or plug-in hybrid model, eliminating the traditional gas engine option. The decision is driven by the growing popularity of hybrids and the need to meet fuel economy regulations. Toyota's electrified vehicle sales accounted for 43.1% of its domestic sales in 2024, and RAV4 sales increased 9.3% last year, with hybrids making up roughly half of those sales. The all-hybrid RAV4 lineup includes interior and exterior design changes, as well as upgrades to performance and technologies.</p>

Israeli authorities issued evacuation orders for parts of northern Gaza prior to military activity, but the hospitals themselves were not ordered to evacuate. The Israeli military claims its forces are operating around the hospitals targeting Hamas infrastructure but have not entered the facilities, however, reports indicate perimeter walls have been demolished and airstrikes have damaged the hospital's power supply.

          <p>Target CEO Brian Cornell cautioned that tariffs pose "massive potential costs" for the company, though price hikes will be considered a "very last resort." The retailer reported a drop in sales over the recent quarter, attributing it to consumer concerns about tariffs and a boycott related to the company's diversity, equity, and inclusion policy. Cornell also lamented the decline in consumer confidence due to inflation fears and recession warnings triggered by Trump's tariffs. A recent trade agreement between the U.S. and China has eased some tensions, but an array of tariffs remains in place.</p>

          <p>Despite pledges to halt funding for fossil fuels, Japan remains a leading public financier of natural gas projects, investing $93 billion in oil and gas from 2013 to 2024. This includes $56 billion in overseas liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects, while clean energy projects received $24.5 billion. Japan's approach involves direct overseas investment in LNG export projects, benefiting from access to LNG supply and reselling surplus. This strategy is viewed as "greenwashing" as LNG involves more emissions than coal and Japan's loopholes in its G7 pledge allow for investments in "abated" fossil fuel projects, which use carbon capture storage.</p>

          <p>Human rights groups and digital rights advocates are raising concerns that Pakistan's cybercrime law, the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA), is being used to silence critical voices, particularly journalists. The amended law criminalizes the dissemination of false information online that could incite fear or unrest, leading to detentions and accusations of censorship. Critics argue that the government is attempting to control the narrative and suppress dissent, while the government defends the law as necessary to limit the spread of disinformation.
