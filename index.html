        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares in Japanese retail giant Seven & i Holdings dropped over 7% after Canadian firm Alimentation Couche-Tard withdrew its $47 billion takeover offer. Couche-Tard cited a "persistent lack of good faith engagement" from Seven & i's leadership as the reason for terminating the talks. In response, the 7-Eleven operator expressed disappointment, refuting the Canadian company's statements as inaccurate. The failed deal highlights the challenges foreign companies face in acquiring major Japanese corporations, with some analysts pointing to a strong sense of national corporate protectionism.

          <p>Prince Harry visited Angola to support the Halo Trust, a charity dedicated to clearing landmines, following in the footsteps of his mother, Princess Diana, who famously raised global awareness for the cause in 1997. During his visit, the Duke of Sussex met with children in a village near a minefield and emphasized the ongoing threat these explosives pose to civilians. The Halo Trust has cleared over 120,000 landmines in Angola, which is still dealing with the remnants of its civil war. The visit highlights continued international efforts to make the region safer.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has fired Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York and the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey. The dismissal memo reportedly cited presidential powers under Article 2 of the Constitution. Comey was a prominent prosecutor who led cases against Sean "Diddy" Combs and helped secure the conviction of Ghislaine Maxwell. Her father was famously terminated as FBI director by President Trump in 2017 amid the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports fell for the second consecutive month, contracting by 0.5% in June as trade tensions with the United States continue to escalate. Shipments to the U.S. dropped by 11.4%, largely impacted by a 25% tariff on Japanese automobiles, a critical component of the nation's economy. With exports making up nearly 22% of its GDP, the continued decline is fueling fears that the Japanese economy could enter a technical recession. The situation is complicated by upcoming elections in Japan, making concessions on agricultural imports politically difficult. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite the administration's focus on deporting the "worst of the worst," newly obtained ICE data reveals a different reality for the first half of the year. Of the roughly 100,000 people deported, less than 1% had homicide convictions, and most documented infractions were for non-violent offenses like traffic violations. While the administration highlights cases involving violent criminals, the data shows that about 15% of deportees had assault convictions and only 3.26% were suspected gang members or terrorists. This suggests the wide net of deportation has primarily ensnared immigrants without serious criminal histories.</p>

The earthquake occurred at a shallow depth about 50 miles south of Sand Point, but officials stated that large, widespread waves were not expected. The event caused no major damage but served as a reminder of the region's location along the seismically active Pacific "Ring of Fire," where North America's strongest-ever earthquake was recorded in 1964.</p>

In the Nebraska raid, the business owner was considered a victim of a criminal operation that used stolen identities.

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence has called on the Trump administration to release all government files related to the investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein, stating that "the time has come" for transparency. His stance directly contrasts with President Trump, who recently dismissed the matter as a politically motivated "hoax." Pence emphasized that the names of victims should be protected but that the facts should be made available to the American people. The Justice Department recently concluded its review, identifying over 1,000 victims but finding no evidence of a blackmail "client list."</p>

          <h2>Justification for Foreign Aid Cuts Questioned Amid Lack of Evidence</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration's move to claw back $7.9 billion in foreign aid, justified by claims of widespread "waste, fraud and abuse," is facing scrutiny due to a lack of supporting evidence. Former and current officials report that the decision to terminate thousands of USAID programs was based on a superficial keyword search for politically charged terms like "gender" or "climate," rather than a thorough review of program effectiveness. Despite administration claims, the former USAID inspector general stated he saw no evidence of rampant issues and warned that dismantling the agency would make oversight nearly impossible.</p>

          <p>The investigation into the fatal Air India crash in Ahmedabad is reportedly focusing on the actions of the plane's captain. According to the Wall Street Journal, a cockpit recording indicates the captain may have cut the fuel flow to the engines shortly after takeoff, prompting a question from the first officer. A preliminary report from India's accident investigation bureau confirmed the fuel switches were moved to the "cutoff" position, but it did not assign blame. The crash, which killed all 260 people on board, occurred after the Boeing 787 lost thrust and was unable to gain altitude.</p>

          <p>The southern African nation of Lesotho has declared a two-year state of disaster following the severe economic fallout from U.S. tariff threats. Although the proposed 50% tariffs are on hold, the announcement alone has caused U.S. buyers to halt orders from Lesotho's garment factories, which are central to its economy. The country, known for producing denim for major U.S. brands, is now facing factory closures and the potential loss of 40,000 jobs. The situation highlights the profound and immediate impact that U.S. trade policy can have on smaller, dependent economies.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Coca-Cola has agreed to switch from high-fructose corn syrup to cane sugar in its beverages sold in the United States. The move follows advocacy from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has raised concerns about the health impacts of corn syrup. While Coca-Cola has not explicitly confirmed the change, it stated that more details on new product innovations would be shared soon. The decision was praised by the president but drew criticism from the Corn Refiners Association, which warned of job losses and increased reliance on foreign sugar.</p>

          <p>This opinion column argues that Emil Bove, President Trump's nominee for the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, is fundamentally disqualified for a lifetime judicial appointment. The author cites Bove's record as Trump's former personal lawyer and his current role in the Justice Department, where he has allegedly purged staff and pushed the administration's agenda. A recent whistleblower complaint alleged Bove instructed lawyers to defy court orders, further fueling opposition. The piece calls on the Senate to exercise its constitutional duty and reject a nominee whose primary credential appears to be personal loyalty to the president.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer asserted that any attempt by President Trump to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell would ultimately harm the president as much as the markets. He argued that Wednesday's market volatility, spurred by reports of a potential firing, demonstrated investor disapproval of the idea. Cramer suggested that while some economic indicators might justify an interest rate cut, the overall data remains mixed, and Powell has no reason to act other than to stop political pressure. He concluded that the resulting market instability would be a self-inflicted wound for the administration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A package of three cryptocurrency regulation bills has stalled in the House of Representatives for a second day due to opposition from within the Republican party. After initial conservative resistance was seemingly resolved, a new bloc of Republicans, including some who authored the legislation, objected to last-minute changes. The stalemate has cast doubt on whether House Republicans can unify to pass crypto-focused legislation, even with President Trump's intervention. The legislative gridlock is a significant setback for the crypto industry, which had hoped for regulatory clarity during what was billed as "Crypto Week." (not investment advice)</p>
