          <h2>Credit Card Debt Forgiveness Offers Significant Savings for Borrowers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 15:45:33 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With national credit card debt exceeding $1.21 trillion and average interest rates over 21%, many borrowers face overwhelming financial burdens. This article explains how credit card debt forgiveness, or settlement, can substantially reduce a $20,000 balance by 30-50%, potentially saving thousands. It details that a 50% settlement could cut total payments from an estimated $42,000 (with minimum payments) to $10,000, resolving debt years faster. While offering aggressive relief, the process impacts credit scores and may incur tax liabilities on the settled amount (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home equity loans offer a cost-effective way to borrow, especially for homeowners with equity, even after recent Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. A $20,000 home equity loan currently has monthly payments ranging from approximately $194 to $246 over 15 or 10 years, only marginally less than earlier in the year. Despite the muted impact of rate cuts, these loans maintain fixed rates, offer future refinancing potential, and provide tax advantages for eligible home projects. Borrowers should carefully calculate costs, as their home serves as collateral (not investment advice).</p>

School board president Jackie Norris stated that there is no confirmed information regarding the reasons for Dr. Roberts' detention or the next steps. Roberts, 52, who began his term in July 2023 and is noted as being born to Guyanese immigrant parents, was reportedly in ICE custody in western Iowa, though a specific jail employee denied his presence.

International health workers reported severe, unprecedented trauma injuries in Gaza, with two-thirds from explosions. Meanwhile, Microsoft disabled some services to a unit within the Israeli military after a review found its AI and cloud products were used for mass surveillance of Palestinians. Former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair is reportedly seeking a senior role in post-war Gaza administration, and UK Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy condemned the situation in Gaza, recognizing Palestinian statehood.</p>

          <p>Lawmakers and legal observers are raising alarms over the indictment of former FBI director James Comey, calling it a "dangerous abuse of power" by President Donald Trump. Democrats on the Senate intelligence and judiciary committees stated that the charges, filed after a US attorney was reportedly forced out for not finding grounds to indict Comey, reflect Trump's promise to weaponize the justice system against critics. They argue the system relies on decisions based on evidence, not personal grudges, and that this undermines the rule of law. Comey's public actions regarding Hillary Clinton's emails in 2016 are often cited as having inadvertently aided Trump's initial election victory.</p>

          <p>Hip-hop producer Metro Boomin, whose real name is Leland Tyler Wayne, was found not liable by a federal jury in his civil sexual assault case after nearly a year of litigation.

Wayne's legal team denied the "frivolous and unequivocally false" allegations, which they called a "pure shakedown." While grateful for the verdict, the Grammy-nominated artist lamented the significant personal and professional toll the case took on him and his family.

          <p>The National Personnel Records Center, a branch of the National Archives, improperly released a mostly unredacted version of Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill's military records to an ally of her Republican opponent in the New Jersey governor's race. The disclosed documents included sensitive personal information like her Social Security number and home addresses, potentially violating privacy laws. The NPRC admitted a technician failed to follow standard procedures and initiated a review, apologizing to Sherrill. This incident raises concerns about the weaponization of personal records for political gain, especially for veterans, and comes amid scrutiny of Sherrill's past military service.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk and Prince Andrew are among prominent figures named in the latest release of Jeffrey Epstein's files by the House Oversight Committee.

The documents also show contacts with other notable individuals like Bill Gates and Peter Thiel. This release adds to the ongoing public scrutiny surrounding Epstein's associates and highlights the extent of his connections to powerful figures.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising credit card delinquencies and high debt, this article details the timeline and consequences of late credit card payments. While an unofficial grace period of 1-5 days may exist, a payment 30 days past due can be reported to credit bureaus, damaging credit scores. At 60 days, interest rates may increase to a penalty APR, and by 90 days, aggressive collection efforts begin, potentially leading to account closure. Beyond 120-180 days, debt may be charged off and sold to collection agencies. Proactive communication with issuers and setting up automatic payments are crucial strategies to mitigate damage (not investment advice).</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 14:17:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article critically examines the common rhetorical tactic of dismissing free speech concerns by accusing critics of hypocrisy. It argues that relying on charges of hypocrisy deflects from principled defenses of liberal norms and is only useful for judging individuals, not ideas. The author highlights that the "cancel culture" phenomenon was not solely a liberal-on-conservative issue but also involved intense internecine feuding within progressive institutions. The piece concludes that presuming opponents are hypocrites allows one to avoid making a case against liberal values, ultimately undermining the pursuit of genuine principles in public discourse.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's visit to the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black led to significant security measures that caused thousands of fans to miss early action. Despite gates opening hours before play, heavy congestion at entry points and around the course, exacerbated by traffic issues and a power line explosion, created chaotic scenes. Fans who paid high prices for tickets expressed frustration over the disruptions caused by the stringent security, which included Secret Service presence and hovering helicopters. This marks the first time a sitting president attended the Ryder Cup, but the logistical impact overshadowed some of the event's early excitement.</p>

The FAA stated this step forward is based on a thorough review of Boeing's production quality, allowing inspectors to focus surveillance elsewhere.
