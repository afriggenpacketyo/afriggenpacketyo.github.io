          <p>England defeated West Indies in the second T20 match at Bristol, securing a series win with a game to spare. Jos Buttler's strong performance, along with contributions from Harry Brook and Jacob Bethell, helped England chase down a target of 197. Despite a late surge from West Indies in their innings, England's batting lineup proved too strong, sealing a four-wicket victory with nine balls remaining. Adil Rashid's expensive over proved a costly factor as the series concludes at Southampton on Tuesday and there are areas for improvement.</p>
