          <p>Maurene Comey, a former federal prosecutor known for her work on high-profile cases involving figures like Jeffrey Epstein, is suing the Justice Department over her termination. The lawsuit alleges her firing was unlawful, unconstitutional, and politically motivated due to her father being former FBI Director James Comey, a public critic of the administration. Comey, who had an exemplary record and recently received an outstanding performance review, was dismissed without cause or explanation. The complaint seeks her reinstatement and protection from further adverse actions without due process.</p>

          <p>China's market regulator has announced that a preliminary investigation found U.S. chipmaker Nvidia to be in violation of the country's anti-monopoly laws. The probe relates to Nvidia's 2020 acquisition of Israeli tech company Mellanox and conditions attached to that deal's approval. This development adds to the escalating tech tensions between Washington and Beijing, occurring as trade talks begin and China launches separate investigations into U.S. chip imports and restrictions. Nvidia has stated its compliance with all laws and will continue to cooperate with government agencies.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Vice President JD Vance hosted Kirk's radio show to pay tribute to his friend and political ally. Vance described Kirk as a key figure in his own political career and instrumental in the administration's 2024 election success and staffing. During the broadcast, Vance and other guests, including White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, vowed to bring the killer to justice and dismantle what they described as left-wing extremist networks. A memorial service for Kirk is scheduled, and he will be posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.</p>

The nurse, Lexi Kuenzle, claimed she was suspended in retaliation for reporting Dr. Matthew Jung's comments. Following an internal investigation, the hospital accepted the doctor's resignation and confirmed the nurse was never fired and will return to her scheduled shifts without loss of pay. Kuenzle stated that the doctor had openly expressed hatred for Kirk and said he "deserved it."</p>

          <p>A homicide investigation in Downey, California, was complicated by a secondary crime when a man stole an ambulance from the scene. Police were initially responding to a fatal stabbing near the Downey Library, which led to the lockdown of a nearby high school where a suspect was apprehended. While emergency personnel were attending to the victim, a different individual, believed to be unconnected to the stabbing, hijacked a Downey Fire Department ambulance. After a police chase, the ambulance crashed into a parked car, and the 52-year-old suspect was taken into custody.</p>

          <p>The American Federation of Teachers (AFT) is seeking class action status for its lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that the Department of Education is unlawfully denying borrowers access to loan forgiveness and affordable repayment plans. The complaint highlights significant backlogs, with over a million applications for Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans and tens of thousands for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) pending. The union argues these delays are causing active harm to borrowers who have met their obligations but have not received the debt cancellation they are legally entitled to.</p>

He stated that the party's time in office was marked by failure and that it no longer represents the principal opposition to the left.

This action suggests some minor tightness in the financial system as banks sought overnight cash to meet funding obligations. The SRF acts as a backstop to prevent disruptive funding shortages. The demand for cash coincided with a large Treasury security settlement, pushing the cost of overnight borrowing slightly above the interest rate the Fed pays on bank reserves.

          <p>President Donald Trump published a letter urging NATO allies to stop buying Russian oil and gas, vowing major U.S. sanctions on Russia once they comply. However, analysts in Brussels believe the message is unlikely to shift the EU's course. The demand puts pressure on Hungary and Slovakia, two member states still reliant on Russian energy, but is seen by some as an excuse for the White House to delay its own actions. Experts argue Trump is setting an impossibly high bar for U.S. intervention by requiring unanimity from all NATO members, including Turkey, thereby shifting blame for inaction onto European allies.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, a number of individuals have faced professional consequences for their public remarks about his death. Those fired or placed on leave include a sports reporter, an MSNBC analyst, a university employee, and a Secret Service agent. Legal experts note that private companies generally have the right to terminate employees for public comments that could harm the company's reputation or violate workplace policies. These incidents highlight the debate over free speech protections for private-sector workers and the potential repercussions of speaking out on politically charged events.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that a "framework" deal has been reached with China regarding the ownership of TikTok's U.S. operations. The commercial terms have reportedly been agreed upon, potentially paving the way for a U.S.-controlled ownership structure, with President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping expected to finalize the details. This development comes as TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, faces a looming deadline to divest its U.S. business or face a shutdown in the country.

The attack on Qatar, a key U.S. ally and mediator in the Gaza conflict, drew international criticism.

The purchase follows discussions about a new compensation plan that could grant Musk a larger stake in the company, which he has been pushing to focus more on artificial intelligence, robotics, and autonomous driving technology.

          <p>Congressional Budget Office Director Phillip Swagel stated that President Donald Trump's tariffs have likely contributed to higher-than-expected inflation. While acknowledging that a weakening economy would typically lower inflation, Swagel indicated that the administration's trade policies have exerted upward price pressure. In a long-term forecast, the CBO also projected that the revenue generated from these tariffs could reduce the U.S. budget deficit by $4 trillion over the next decade. The future of the tariffs remains uncertain, pending a Supreme Court hearing on the president's authority to impose them. (not investment advice)</p>
