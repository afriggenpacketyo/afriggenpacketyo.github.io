          <p>American fund managers are actively lobbying Congress to amend Section 899 of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," fearing it could trigger a rapid withdrawal of foreign investments from the U.S. stock markets. The Investment Company Institute (ICI) warns that this provision, designed to penalize foreign-owned firms from countries with "unfair foreign taxes," inadvertently impacts most foreign investments in U.S. equities. The ICI suggests that the U.S. fund management industry, with around $18 trillion invested in U.S. stock markets, would suffer "collateral damage." Foreign investors hold substantial assets in U.S. markets, and their potential retreat could negatively affect U.S. companies and investors (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>An opinion piece discusses the potential consequences of the United States' crackdowns on academia, suggesting it could lead to a brain drain. The author argues that restricting international students would diminish the talent pool for US graduate schools, especially in STEM fields, where international students constitute a significant portion of PhD recipients. With decreasing applications from China and Europe, and more American students exploring academic options abroad, the US risks compromising its human capital. The piece concludes that if the goal is to slow China's technological progress, these restrictions may be ineffective, as many Chinese students who studied abroad have returned to contribute to their home country's academic and technological advancements. The United States' loss may be other countries' gain.</p>

The Liaoning group notably traveled further east than Guam, marking the first time a Chinese navy carrier has reached beyond the second island chain.

          <p>Following a protest over an alleged sexual assault in Ballymena, disorder broke out with people throwing objects at police and setting houses on fire.

Two teenage boys appeared in court accused of the sexual assault, with their solicitor stating they would deny the charges. Hundreds participated in a peaceful march earlier in the day before the violence escalated later on, leading to police intervention to block off streets.</p>

Dobrindt said the government would allocate "substantial financial resources" to strengthen the defense mechanisms of Germany's security agencies.

          <p>Japan plans to release an additional 200,000 tons of rice from government stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers in an effort to curb elevated prices of the staple food. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi expects the released rice to be sold at lower prices, distributing it to smaller supermarket chains, specialty shops, and major retailers. This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, raising concerns about emergency preparedness.

These disputes underscore the limits of Beijing's non-interference policy, which, while intended to avoid entanglement in domestic affairs, has incurred economic costs as nationalism rises in some nations.

          <p>A recent government report indicates that Japan continues to lag behind many other countries in addressing gender inequality, particularly in increasing the representation of women in leadership positions. The report, reviewed by a task force led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, acknowledges that efforts to close gender gaps by 2030 remain insufficient. The government aims to advance gender equality by ensuring more opportunities for women to participate in decision-making across various fields, focusing on local economies and small businesses. The policy cites a lack of entrepreneurial role models and advisory resources outside major cities, with plans to build a support network for entrepreneurs and address the gender pay gap.</p>

          <p>Official figures suggest that UK companies are holding back on hiring or are not replacing departing workers, causing a drop in job vacancies. The number of available jobs decreased between March and May, while the unemployment rate increased, indicating a weakening in the labor market. Some firms may be hesitant to recruit new workers due to increased employer National Insurance contributions and a rise in the minimum wage. The rise in average wages has slowed, but remains above the rate of inflation, and this trend suggests a cautious approach by businesses in response to rising employment costs.</p>

          <p>Chinese exports to major industrial centers in Southeast Asia have increased significantly in the first five months of the year, driven by growing consumer markets and offshore factory investments. Shipments to Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia have risen sharply, outpacing the global increase in Chinese exports. Pressured by import tariffs imposed by the U.S., Chinese manufacturers are increasingly shipping goods to factories in Southeast Asia for final production and re-export, including to the U.S. Analysts note that this diversification helps offset losses from high US tariffs and strengthens economic ties between China and Southeast Asian countries.</p>

Philippe Sands, a human rights lawyer, suggests these events are part of a broader effort to create a sense of emergency and test the limits of public tolerance.

Customers are urged to return the affected cans for a full refund or discard them, as the mislabeling poses a risk to individuals who need to avoid sugar, such as those with diabetes.

          <p>Criminal gangs are exploiting loopholes in Europe's drug regulations to smuggle ketamine, often swapping it for substances like salt during transit, as the market for the drug booms. In some countries, ketamine is regulated as a medicine, which faces less scrutiny during import and transit, and this allows smugglers to transport it across multiple borders before diverting it into the black market. Organized crime groups are reportedly making more money from ketamine than other illegal drugs like cocaine, and consumption in the UK has risen sharply, linked to cognitive problems and bladder damage. European police forces are planning to liaise with Indian authorities to tackle the problem, but greater international cooperation is needed to combat the trafficking network.</p>
