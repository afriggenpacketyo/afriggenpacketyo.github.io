        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Liverpool has agreed to a deal to sign England center-back Marc Guehi from Crystal Palace, pending final clearance from the London club. The transfer, which follows Liverpool's record-breaking summer spending spree, aims to solidify a defense that has appeared vulnerable early in the season. While a fee has been agreed upon and Guehi is set to complete a medical, Crystal Palace is reportedly hesitant to finalize the transfer until they can secure a replacement. Guehi's arrival would be another major signing for Liverpool, pushing their total summer expenditure to a Premier League record of over £450 million.</p>

          <p>Houthi forces in Yemen have escalated their targeting of international aid workers, recently detaining at least 11 United Nations personnel in Sanaa. This raid on UN offices is part of a broader crackdown following an Israeli airstrike that killed several Houthi government officials. Experts suggest the Houthis are using these detentions as leverage and to consolidate internal power amidst growing paranoia about foreign spies. This pattern of abducting aid workers has become a recurring response to security events, exacerbating the severe humanitarian crisis in a country where millions depend on international aid for survival.</p>

          <p>Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, 81, was seriously injured in a car crash in New Hampshire after stopping to assist a domestic violence victim. A spokesperson confirmed the incident was not a targeted attack, stating that Giuliani's rental vehicle was struck from behind at high speed after he had called 911 for the woman. He sustained multiple injuries, including a fractured thoracic vertebra, and is expected to be discharged from the hospital within days. New Hampshire State Police are currently investigating the two-vehicle collision, and no charges have been filed yet.</p>

Kennedy Jr., stating his actions are endangering American health. In a New York Times op-ed, they cite the recent firing of CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez, the cancellation of mRNA vaccine research, and the replacement of a key vaccine advisory committee with vaccine skeptics. The former directors warn that these moves dismantle the nation's public health infrastructure, leaving the U.S. vulnerable to future pandemics and other health threats, and they are urging Congress to exercise its oversight authority.</p>

          <p>A powerful 6.0 magnitude earthquake has devastated remote villages in eastern Afghanistan, with the death toll reported to be over 800 people. Survivors describe scenes of shock and despair, with entire communities in Nangarhar and Kunar provinces reduced to rubble. The mountainous terrain and landslides are severely hampering rescue efforts, forcing the Taliban government to rely on helicopters to reach the injured. Many residents are now homeless and sleeping outdoors, while rescue volunteers work to pull people from collapsed mud-brick homes.

          <p>Following Congress's decision to cut $1.1 billion in federal funding, hundreds of PBS and NPR stations across the United States are facing a severe financial crisis. Stations are launching emergency fund drives, cutting jobs, and reducing local programming to cope with the sudden budget shortfall. While some communities have responded with generous donations, many smaller and rural stations are struggling to fill the gap. National networks are reducing dues to help, and a philanthropic effort is underway, but the long-term viability of many stations remains uncertain, threatening a vital source of local news and emergency information for many Americans.</p>

          <p>An American man has died in the Bahamas following a collision between a jet ski and another vessel off the coast of Paradise Island. The incident is currently under investigation by the Royal Bahamas Police Force. This event occurs amidst heightened safety concerns for tourists in the region, particularly regarding jet ski rentals. The U.S. Embassy in Nassau previously issued a security alert warning that American women have been sexually assaulted by jet ski operators. The alert advises U.S. citizens to avoid renting jet skis and to remain vigilant, as government employees are prohibited from using them due to the associated risks.</p>

          <p>Renowned Canadian author Margaret Atwood has penned a satirical short story to criticize a new policy in Alberta that requires school libraries to remove books with 'explicit sexual content.' The move comes after her iconic novel, 'The Handmaid's Tale,' was among over 200 books removed by the Edmonton Public School Board. Atwood's new story ironically depicts perfectly chaste characters to highlight the absurdity of the ban, which she has also condemned on social media. The controversy reflects a growing trend of book challenges, similar to those seen in the United States, targeting classic literature alongside contemporary works.</p>

          <p>A new study by French scientists reveals a significant divergence in the body size evolution of wild and domestic animals starting in the Middle Ages. Researchers analyzing 8,000 years of animal bones found that while both groups previously followed similar size cycles, a shift occurred around 1000 AD. Wild species like foxes and deer began to shrink due to habitat loss and intensified hunting. In parallel, domesticated animals such as chickens, sheep, and cattle grew larger as humans implemented more systematic selective breeding and controlled management, highlighting the increasing and lasting impact of human activity on the natural world.</p>

A board-certified psychiatrist explains this behavior as a sign of parasocial relationships, where fans form one-sided bonds with media figures, blurring the line between fiction and reality. This phenomenon, amplified by social media anonymity, may point to a broader societal void and a longing for human connection.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has dealt a significant blow to President Trump's trade policy, ruling that he exceeded his authority by using national emergency declarations to impose widespread tariffs on most U.S. trading partners. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president unlimited power to set tariffs, a role constitutionally assigned to Congress. While the ruling strikes down the legal basis for many of the tariffs, the court has allowed them to remain in effect temporarily to give the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court, which the president has vowed to do.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving after 12-year-old Logan Carter died from a fall at a playground in Winsford, Cheshire. Police are investigating reports that an e-bike was used to spin a children's roundabout at high speed, leading to the fatal incident. The local community has been left in shock, with mourners leaving flowers and tributes at the taped-off playground. In a statement, Logan's family described him as a boy full of life with an 'infectious personality' who will be deeply missed.</p>

          <p>A shallow 6.0 magnitude earthquake has caused widespread destruction in eastern Afghanistan, with over 800 fatalities confirmed and the number expected to rise. The mountainous terrain of the affected provinces, Nangarhar and Kunar, combined with landslides, is severely impeding rescue operations, making it difficult to ascertain the full scale of the disaster. The country's capacity to respond is critically hampered by the economic collapse and suspension of foreign aid that followed the Taliban's takeover in 2021. This new catastrophe places immense strain on a nation already facing a severe humanitarian crisis, with millions in need of assistance.</p>

According to media reports citing a diplomatic cable, consular officers have been instructed to refuse visas for purposes such as business, study, or tourism to nearly all Palestinian applicants. This move expands on a recent pause for visitors from Gaza and the denial of visas to dozens of Palestinian officials. The State Department did not explicitly confirm the policy but stated it was taking steps in compliance with U.S. law and national security, further tightening the Trump administration's stance.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has called on pharmaceutical companies to publicly release data to 'justify the success' of their COVID-19 drugs. His comments follow a recent FDA decision to limit the approval of new vaccines to high-risk individuals and a major leadership shakeup at the CDC, where the director was fired and several top officials resigned. Trump's demand for transparency comes amid an overhaul of federal health agencies by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic.

This collaborative approach, combined with financial independence, fosters a deep sense of ownership and motivation among its members.

          <p>A controversial post-war plan for Gaza, reportedly being reviewed by the Trump administration, envisions a 'Gaza Riviera' built through mass displacement and a decade of U.S. trusteeship. The 38-page document proposes the 'voluntary' relocation of Gaza's entire population in exchange for digital tokens, to be replaced by AI-powered smart cities and a manufacturing hub. Financed by private investment, the plan would place Gaza under U.S. control for ten years while Israel maintains security oversight.

Other hikers and staff from a nearby refuge hut administered first aid before the pair was airlifted to a hospital, but the man succumbed to his injuries.
