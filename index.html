          <p>Republican Senator Chuck Grassley encountered strong disagreements from constituents at a town hall in Northwood, Iowa, similar to previous tense exchanges. A key point of contention was the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, deported to El Salvador, with constituents questioning due process. Grassley defended the administration's actions, citing aspects of the Supreme Court's ruling, but faced boos when suggesting Biden's policies were to blame. The senator acknowledged the stronger language used compared to other town halls, attributing it to heightened feelings about Washington's policies.</p>

          <p>With only weeks remaining, the Trump administration is urgently pursuing numerous individual trade deals to offset the global chaos caused by its tariffs. While officials aim for quick agreements, trade experts doubt the feasibility of such rapid negotiations, typically spanning months or years. The tariffs, intended as leverage, are instead creating financial strain for businesses, particularly small U.S. businesses reliant on imports from China. Some U.S. trade with China has nearly ceased due to escalating tariffs, potentially leading to bankruptcies if trade barriers persist. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Jones Road Wildfire in Ocean County, New Jersey, has consumed over 12,500 acres and is approximately 40% contained, prompting a state of emergency and the evacuation of 5,000 residents. While one business was destroyed, no homes have been damaged, and no injuries or loss of life have been reported. Fire officials attribute the fire's rapid spread to ongoing dry conditions and expect the acreage to increase as they conduct burnout operations to fully contain the blaze.

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is lobbying state leaders in Sacramento for financial assistance to close the city's nearly $1 billion budget gap. The city faces rising personnel costs, wildfire recovery expenses, legal payouts, and a weakening economy. Bass is seeking a relief package to avoid potential layoffs, but the state is also facing its own budget challenges due to healthcare costs and revenue declines related to President Trump's tariff policies.</p>

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up, marking the second consecutive day of significant gains, but the market's durability remains uncertain due to Trump's volatile rhetoric.</p>

          <p>The stock market rallied on Wednesday following comments from President Trump and other officials regarding tariffs, trade, and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The market's drastic swings this week highlight investor sensitivity to the latest headlines amid uncertainty about the White House's intentions. Initial enthusiasm stemmed from Trump's statement that he had "no intention" of firing Powell, helping lift markets after previous concerns about the Fed's independence.</p>

          <p>Google is requiring some remote employees to return to the office three days a week or risk losing their jobs, a move reflecting a broader trend of companies tightening remote work policies. Several units within Google have informed remote staffers that their roles may be at risk if they don't comply with the hybrid work schedule. This decision comes as Google looks to cut costs and invest heavily in artificial intelligence, and some remote staffers were offered voluntary buyouts as an alternative.</p>
