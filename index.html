          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to proceed with terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 300,000 Venezuelan migrants. This ruling freezes a lower court's decision that had found the termination to be illegal, allowing the administration to roll back protections that permitted these individuals to live and work in the U.S. without immediate threat of deportation. The decision has drawn criticism from migrant advocacy groups and a dissent from Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who argued it was a misuse of the court's emergency docket that would disrupt many lives.</p>

          <p>Manchester United ended Chelsea's perfect start to the Women's Super League season with a hard-fought draw, though the team was left feeling they could have secured a victory. An impressive volley from Anna Sandberg equalized an earlier goal from Chelsea's Wieke Kaptein, marking only the second time United has taken points from the six-time champions in league history. Despite creating numerous chances, United's manager Marc Skinner expressed disappointment at not winning, but praised his team's "brave performance." The result is seen as a statement of United's growing competitiveness and ambition in the league.</p>

          <p>Actor and singer Tyrese Gibson has turned himself in to authorities in Fulton County, Georgia, on an animal cruelty warrant and was released on a $20,000 bond. The charges stem from an incident where his four Cane Corso dogs allegedly escaped his property and killed a neighbor's smaller dog. Authorities issued the warrant after Gibson reportedly failed to cooperate in surrendering the dogs, which officials intend to deem as dangerous. In a statement, Gibson expressed his condolences to the family who lost their pet and said he had already made the difficult decision to rehome the dogs.</p>

          <p>Bournemouth winger Antoine Semenyo has been instrumental in the club's unexpected rise to second place in the Premier League, following a 3-1 comeback victory against Fulham. The Ghanaian international scored two goals and provided an assist, bringing his season total to six league goals, second only to Erling Haaland. Despite the club selling off £200m worth of talent in the summer, Semenyo's decision to sign a new five-year contract has proven crucial. His recent form, praised by his coach and teammates as "world class," has been a key factor in Bournemouth's remarkable success.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government shutdown is set to continue into a second week after the Senate failed to pass competing spending proposals from both Republicans and Democrats. The primary point of contention remains healthcare funding, with Democrats seeking to protect low-income subsidies and Republicans accusing them of trying to fund healthcare for undocumented immigrants. The White House has warned of potential mass layoffs of federal workers if the stalemate persists, describing the measure as "fiscal sanity."

          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld a lower court's injunction blocking the Trump administration's executive order aimed at narrowing birthright citizenship. The First Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the attempt to deny automatic citizenship to children born in the U.S. to undocumented immigrants or temporary visa holders is likely unconstitutional. In its ruling, the court referenced historical rejections of similar efforts, citing the 14th Amendment. This decision marks another legal setback for the administration's policy, which has been blocked by multiple federal judges since it was introduced early in the president's term.</p>

The survey highlights a pessimistic outlook on national unity, with a majority believing people of different political views cannot come together. This sentiment exists despite a general belief that politics, rather than people themselves, is the primary driver of division. The poll also found that fewer than half of Americans feel comfortable publicly expressing their political views, contributing to a climate of apprehension.</p>

In a letter to colleagues, Ben'Ary stated that the department's political leadership has violated core principles, thereby jeopardizing national security.</p>

          <p>Amid the government shutdown, President Trump has highlighted Russ Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget and a key figure in "Project 2025," as his enforcer for cutting federal agencies. Vought, who has a history as a conservative budget hawk, is being tasked with identifying "Democrat agencies" for potential permanent reductions, an opportunity the administration sees in the current funding lapse. While Trump previously distanced himself from the ultra-conservative Project 2025 blueprint, he is now using it as leverage against Democrats. Vought has already begun halting funds for projects in Democrat-led states.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest manager Ange Postecoglou is under increasing pressure after failing to secure a victory in his first six matches, culminating in a Europa League defeat where some fans chanted for his dismissal. Despite the poor results, it is understood that the club's hierarchy currently retains its support for the Australian manager, citing mitigating factors like controversial refereeing decisions. However, the upcoming Premier League match against Newcastle is seen as a potentially decisive fixture. The performance, as much as the result, will be significant in determining the board's view on Postecoglou's future.</p>

          <p>Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has acknowledged the pressure he is under following a poor start to the season, stating that criticism from club legends like Wayne Rooney is "normal" given the team's performance. Having won just 18 of his 49 matches in charge, Amorim admits he cannot "run away from the results." While senior sources at the club indicate that owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe remains supportive, the manager understands that results are necessary to continue the project. The club is also reportedly planning mid-season friendlies to compensate for lost revenue from not competing in European competitions.</p>

          <p>The UK Conservative party has announced it will withdraw the country from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) if it wins the next general election. Party leader Kemi Badenoch stated the move is necessary to "protect our borders, our veterans, and our citizens," following a party legal review that concluded the ECHR constrains migration reform. This marks a significant policy shift for the party, which has faced internal divisions on the issue and growing pressure from the rival Reform UK party. The Labour party criticized the decision as a sign of weakness and a policy that Badenoch herself had previously argued against.</p>

          <p>Musician and producer Sean "Diddy" Combs has been sentenced to 50 months in federal prison following his conviction on two prostitution-related charges. The sentence was delivered after a high-profile trial that featured harrowing testimony from victims, though a jury acquitted him of more severe charges like racketeering and sex trafficking. Before the sentence was announced, Combs addressed the court, tearfully apologizing for his actions, which he described as "disgusting, shameful and sick," attributing them to drug use and being out of control. The judge acknowledged the irreparable harm caused to two women.</p>

          <p>Shares for General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis saw significant gains following reports that the Trump administration is considering tariff relief for vehicles produced in the United States. The potential changes could eliminate many of the costs from the 25% tariff on imported vehicles and parts, which have cost the companies billions. According to a Republican senator, the plan would reward companies with final assembly operations in the U.S., making them largely immune to the tariffs. Ford's stock reached a new 52-week high on the news, as investors reacted positively to the prospect of reduced financial burdens for the automakers. (not investment advice)</p>

While a repeat of last year's semi-final outcome, Leigh provided a much tougher challenge this time around.

          <p>Georgia-based journalist Mario Guevara has been deported to El Salvador after being detained for over 100 days by U.S. immigration authorities. His arrest occurred in June while he was covering a political protest, and although local charges were dropped, ICE took him into custody. An appeals court denied his final request to remain in the U.S., ruling that despite his First Amendment right to report, he had not filed the correct paperwork for permanent residency. Civil liberties groups have condemned his detention and deportation as government retaliation for his reporting on law enforcement, calling it a threat to press freedom.</p>
