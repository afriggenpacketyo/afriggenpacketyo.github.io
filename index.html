          <h2>Economists Warn Proposed 50% Copper Tariff Could Inflate Consumer Prices</h2>

          <p>President Trump's proposal to impose a 50% tariff on copper imports is raising concerns among economists about potential price hikes for consumers. Copper is a crucial component in numerous products, including appliances, electronics, electric vehicles, and infrastructure like the electrical grid. Experts warn that increasing the cost of this vital metal could fuel inflation and negatively affect various industries. The administration argues the tariff is necessary to rebuild America's domestic copper industry and reduce reliance on foreign imports for national security. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent back-to-back floods in New Mexico and Texas yielded vastly different results, underscoring the importance of community preparedness. In Ruidoso, New Mexico, where officials anticipated floods due to recent wildfire burn scars, the damage was contained with three fatalities despite a record river surge. In contrast, a similar inundation in Texas caught officials by surprise, leading to at least 120 deaths. The article suggests that recent experience with natural disasters significantly informs a community's response and ability to mitigate harm.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines' stock surged after the company reinstated its profit forecast for 2025, signaling a stabilization in travel demand. While the full-year earnings forecast is lower than initial projections from January, the outlook for the crucial summer travel season surpassed Wall Street expectations. CEO Ed Bastian noted that while booking patterns have shifted to be closer to travel dates, demand remains strong, particularly for premium cabin sales. The airline plans to make "surgical" capacity cuts after the peak summer season to align with the adjusted demand levels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new analysis indicates that federal flood maps significantly underestimated the risk in Kerr County, Texas, where a recent deadly flood occurred at Camp Mystic. Data from a private firm suggests nearly double the number of homes were at risk compared to FEMA's assessment, which is based on historical river data rather than rainfall modeling. Separately, the CDC reports that U.S. measles cases have hit their highest level in 33 years, with nearly 1,300 cases this year. The rise is attributed to falling vaccination rates and growing vaccine hesitancy.</p>

The conference focuses on practical partnerships in key sectors like energy and infrastructure, with leaders emphasizing that rebuilding Ukraine is a resilient investment, not a risk.

          <p>China's Ministry of State Security announced it has cracked three separate foreign spying plots, urging public officials to be vigilant against overseas threats.

The legislation will allow ICE to more than double its detention capacity from 41,500 to 116,000 beds. Advocacy groups express alarm, warning that the funding will fuel indiscriminate enforcement tactics that undermine due process and lead to widespread family separation. The bill also incentivizes state and local governments with grants to cooperate on detention efforts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Colombian soldier was killed and two others were wounded when an explosive device strapped to a donkey was detonated in the country's northwest. The attack, which occurred in the Antioquia department, has been attributed to the National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrilla group. An official stated the animal was loaded with explosives and directed toward a platoon of soldiers. This incident highlights the escalating violence in the region following the suspension of peace talks between the government and the ELN earlier this year.</p>

          <p>Employees at an IHOP restaurant in Lee’s Summit, Montana, allege they have not received paychecks for nearly six weeks and are working without air conditioning. Staff members have filed complaints with the Department of Labor but say they are afraid to quit for fear of forfeiting the back pay they are owed. The franchise owner, AJTX Management, is reportedly facing multiple employment-related lawsuits and has not responded to inquiries. The case highlights violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs timely payment of wages and safe working conditions.</p>

The UK Health Security Agency has issued yellow heat health alerts for all regions of England, warning of potential impacts on health services. This marks the third time this year that parts of the UK will exceed the official heatwave threshold, which requires at least three consecutive days above a set temperature. Climate scientists reiterate that such heatwaves are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change.</p>

          <p>Health experts in South Africa are expressing deep concern as cuts to U.S. foreign aid begin to impact HIV treatment programs. The U.S. President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (PEPFAR) has been a cornerstone of the global HIV response, but recent funding reductions have forced the closure of clinics that served vulnerable populations. UNAids warns that such cuts risk reversing decades of progress, which saw a 66% decrease in AIDS-related deaths in South Africa since 2010. The funding loss also threatens vital South African-led research into new HIV vaccines and preventive drugs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following its use in New York City's mayoral primary, a discussion is growing about how ranked-choice voting (RCV) could reshape California's political landscape. Proponents argue RCV saves money by eliminating runoffs, discourages negative campaigning, and can increase representation for women and people of color. If implemented statewide, RCV would interact uniquely with California's top-two primary system, potentially giving underrepresented parties a better chance in competitive races. However, the ultimate effect on the political makeup of representation, whether promoting centrism or extremism, remains a subject of debate.</p>

          <p>Detectives are investigating new historical sexual abuse allegations against a convicted former Church in Wales bishop, Anthony Pierce, and another former vicar. A BBC investigation reveals that concerns about Pierce were first reported to church officials in 1986, yet he was later promoted. Another figure, Darren Jenkins, was jailed for sexually assaulting a boy. Victims are now calling for an independent inquiry, stating the church failed to act on warnings and allowed predators to rise in its ranks. The Church in Wales has apologized for its failings.</p>

          <p>A contentious redistricting plan in Tarrant County, Texas, is being criticized as a partisan effort by Republicans to secure political advantage ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The newly approved map shifts people of color out of a competitive precinct, a move critics label as racial gerrymandering, while the county judge openly admitted it was done to elect another Republican. Experts suggest this is part of a broader GOP strategy to offset potential congressional losses in other states. The move highlights the deep partisan divisions and the use of redistricting as a tool to entrench power.</p>

          <p>This opinion column argues that while President Trump may promise aid to disaster-stricken areas like the Texas flood zone, his administration must be held accountable for policies that weaken federal emergency response capabilities. The author points to proposed and enacted budget cuts to agencies like the National Weather Service and FEMA, as well as a federal hiring freeze, as actions that could compromise public safety. The article contends that raising questions about the government's preparedness in the face of increasingly severe, climate-change-fueled disasters is not inappropriate politicization but a necessary act of accountability.</p>

More than half of the cases involve allegations of excessive force, with a dedicated task force reviewing body-camera footage and interviewing witnesses. The department's response to the demonstrations was criticized by many as heavy-handed and indiscriminate, leading to multiple lawsuits.

These concerns are shared across partisan lines, demographics, and geographic locations, indicating widespread unease about the state of the country's system of government. While Democrats are the most fearful, a significant portion of Republicans and independent voters also expressed that democracy is threatened.

The focus is now shifting to rebuilding, with hundreds of permits issued, but the emotional and financial toll remains immense. Investigations into the fires' causes are ongoing, with a leading theory being that the Palisades fire was a rekindling of an earlier blaze.</p>
