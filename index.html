          <p>President Trump has criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for refusing to recognize Russian control of Crimea, claiming it harms peace negotiations. Trump stated that a deal to end the war was "very close" but that Zelensky's refusal to accept U.S. terms would prolong the conflict. This follows Vice-President JD Vance's outline of a U.S. vision for a deal that would involve both Ukraine and Russia conceding territory, highlighting divisions over the path to resolution.</p>

          <p>Over six million illegal vaping products have been seized in England over the past three years as Trading Standards officers crack down on illicit trade. The crackdown comes ahead of a ban on single-use disposable vapes, which are seen as a major driver of the illegal market. These illicit vapes can have tank sizes and nicotine strengths exceeding legal limits, posing significant health risks, and are often supplied through sophisticated networks involved in other serious crimes.</p>

          <p>President Trump's job approval rating has steadily declined during his first three months in office, according to a New York Times polling average. His approval rating has fallen to approximately 45 percent, a decrease from 52 percent shortly after his inauguration. This trend indicates that about half of the country now disapproves of his performance, reflecting a slightly faster decline compared to his predecessors and his own previous term.</p>
