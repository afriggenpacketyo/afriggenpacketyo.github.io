          <p>The European Union faces the challenge of negotiating trade deals with both the United States and China in an era of heightened geopolitical competition. The EU aims to secure economic benefits from both superpowers, but striking a deal with one could jeopardize relations with the other. The United States seeks to pressure the world to cut ties with China, while China is also edging closer to negotiations with the US, potentially leaving Europe in a precarious position. Officials in Brussels describe this delicate balancing act as a "high-wire act."</p>

          <p>Shachi Kurl's article in the New York Times discusses the challenges facing Canada under Prime Minister Mark Carney, including economic anxieties, strained relations with the U.S. under President Trump, and complex international relationships. Canadians are concerned about a potential recession and feel betrayed by Trump's trade war and annexation desires. Canada's relationships with China and India have deteriorated, while prospects across the North Atlantic look more promising. The article suggests Canada needs to reframe its place in the world and focus on securing its economic and strategic future beyond America, which will require Carney to step up on the world stage.</p>

          <p>India will include caste details in its next census, a decision with potentially significant socio-economic and political implications. The move, announced by Information Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, demonstrates the government's commitment to societal values and interests. The census is likely to lead to demands for raising quotas for government jobs and college admissions, particularly for Other Backward Classes (OBCs). While supporters say this data is crucial for social justice programs, opponents fear it could deepen social divisions. The last caste-based census was conducted by British rulers in 1931, and since then, independent India has only counted Dalits and Adivasis.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has eliminated the de minimis rule, a loophole that allowed Americans to buy cheap goods from China tariff-free. This move, effective Friday, aims to protect U.S. manufacturers but is expected to raise prices for American consumers who shop online. The de minimis rule allowed products up to $800 to avoid tariffs, leading to a surge in shipments from e-commerce platforms like Shein and Temu. Concerns about fentanyl smuggling and threats to U.S. jobs in warehousing and logistics contributed to the decision to end the exemption.</p>

The program's administrator, Dr. John Howard, was reinstated after a layoff, but questions about his authority caused a freeze on certifications. A federal memo confirmed the resumption of processing enrollments and certifications, signaling a turning point after weeks of confusion. The restoration of certification means the program can now review and approve claims from responders and survivors who have developed new conditions linked to the attacks.</p>

          <p>The elimination of the de minimis rule, which allowed tariff-free imports of small parcels, is disrupting the e-commerce trade between China and the United States. This policy change, which took effect Friday, subjects most packages from mainland China and Hong Kong to tariffs, impacting both American shoppers and Chinese exporters. American consumers are seeing higher prices, while some factories in southern China have suspended operations. The change poses a major challenge for China's export-driven economy and could lead to job losses, as the previous system had allowed even small factories in China to be global businesses.</p>

This signaling comes as tariffs appear to be impacting Chinese producers, with a recent report showing the sharpest monthly slowdown in factory activity in over a year.

          <p>President Donald Trump has closed the de minimis loophole, a duty-free exemption for low-value packages, leading to increased prices for US customers of online retailers like Shein and Temu. These Chinese online retail giants previously relied on this exemption to ship low-value items directly to the US without duties or import taxes. The move is aimed at tackling illegal importation of synthetic opioids and addressing concerns about damage to American businesses. Packages from mainland China and Hong Kong with a value of up to $800 now face a 120% tax rate or a flat fee.</p>

          <p>Amidst rising tensions with India, a weary Pakistani public is grappling with economic hardship, political instability, and the fear of armed conflict. Conversations focus more on inflation, unemployment, and a political system that feels unrepresentative. The military, traditionally a unifying force, now faces more complicated public sentiment due to political turmoil and crackdowns. While expressions of loyalty to the military persist, they are often tempered by frustration and anger, as the country navigates one of its worst economic crises in decades.</p>

          <p>The United States has secured a deal to share rights to Ukraine's mineral reserves, including elements crucial for high-tech applications, but faces formidable challenges in extraction due to the ongoing war. Experts say that ending the war is the first hurdle, as surveys are outdated and energy infrastructure needs repair. Despite these challenges, the deal offers potential for the U.S. to reduce its vulnerability to China's dominance in mineral extraction and processing. Ukraine's government estimates the country has 5% of the world's most critical raw materials, but progress is unlikely while the war continues.</p>

His comments came shortly after Washington signed a deal with Kyiv to share the profits of Ukraine's rare earth minerals in return for future US security assistance. Vance said the question facing the US administration now was how it could help Russia and Ukraine "find middle ground" to end the conflict that has been raging for more than three years.
