          <p>An early morning incident in Los Angeles resulted in 30 injuries after a driver intentionally plowed his vehicle into a crowd outside a Hollywood nightclub. Police identified the suspect, who was subsequently attacked by bystanders and shot before being arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon. The shooting suspect remains at large. Seven victims are in critical condition, and the event has been described as a "heartbreaking tragedy" by the city's mayor, prompting a massive response from emergency services.</p>

          <p>A tourist boat named Wonder Seas, carrying 53 passengers, capsized in Vietnam's Ha Long Bay during a sudden storm, resulting in at least 37 fatalities. Most of the victims were Vietnamese families from Hanoi. Rescue efforts have been complicated by heavy rain but have so far saved 11 people, including a 10-year-old boy who survived in an air pocket. Authorities have launched an investigation into the cause of the accident as search operations for the remaining missing individuals continue.</p>

          <p>Despite a ceasefire declared by Syria's interim president, sectarian clashes between Bedouin and Druze communities continue in the southern province of Suweida, with over 900 reported deaths in a week. Government forces deployed to quell the violence have been accused of participating in attacks on the Druze. The conflict has drawn international attention, with the U.S. demanding an end to the violence and Israel intervening with strikes against government targets to protect the Druze minority. The situation remains volatile, with reports of ongoing fighting and looting.</p>

          <p>Australian boxer Tim Tszyu was defeated by American Sebastian Fundora via a seventh-round technical knockout in their world title rematch in Las Vegas. This marks Tszyu's third loss in his last four fights, a significant downturn after an undefeated 24-fight streak. Despite showing courage and landing some effective shots, Tszyu struggled with Fundora's height advantage and a significant cut above his eye, ultimately telling his corner he could not continue into the eighth round. The loss places his international career at a critical juncture.</p>

          <p>Linda Duffey Gwozdz was convicted of second-degree murder for the 2007 shooting death of her husband, Patrick Duffey, after her first trial ended in a hung jury. Her defense claimed the shooting was a tragic accident that occurred while the couple was playfully reenacting a cartoon, with Linda believing the gun was unloaded based on her husband's "No more buwwets" comment. Prosecutors argued she intentionally shot him twice while he slept, a theory supported by firearms and blood spatter experts in the second, more streamlined trial.</p>

          <p>Technology played a pivotal role in solving the 2016 murder of Nicole Vander Heyden in Wisconsin. Her boyfriend, Doug Detrie, was initially the prime suspect but was exonerated by data from his Fitbit, which showed he was inactive during the time of the murder. Investigators then used DNA from the crime scene to identify George Steven Burch, whose movements were tracked using his phone's Google Dashboard data, placing him at the crime scene, where the body was found, and where her belongings were discarded. Burch was subsequently convicted of the murder.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government will implement a new, non-waivable "visa integrity fee" of at least $250 for all nonimmigrant visa applicants, effective from the 2025 fiscal year. This fee is in addition to existing visa application costs and a separate, increased Form I-94 fee. The provision allows for the fee to be reimbursed if visitors comply with their visa terms, such as not overstaying. However, with implementation details still unclear, the Congressional Budget Office anticipates few reimbursements, estimating the measure will reduce the federal deficit by nearly $29 billion over a decade.

          <p>The use of nicotine pouches, also known as white snus, is rapidly increasing among young people in the UK, with some users as young as 11. These products, which are currently unregulated by age, can contain extremely high levels of nicotine and are causing significant gum damage, according to dentists. While less harmful than smoking, the pouches are highly addictive, and experts are concerned about non-smokers trying them for the first time. A proposed bill would ban their sale to minors, but it has not yet passed.</p>

          <h2>Solar Panels for UK's 'Great British Energy' School Program Were Sourced from China</h2>

          <p>An investigation revealed that solar panels installed in the first English schools under the government's Great British Energy (GBE) initiative were manufactured by Chinese firms. This has drawn criticism due to concerns over alleged forced labor in China's solar panel supply chains, particularly in the Xinjiang region. While the government stated the contracts complied with modern slavery rules, critics argue that taxpayer money should support British or other ethical suppliers. The situation highlights the global dominance of Chinese manufacturing in the renewable energy sector and the associated ethical challenges.</p>

          <p>A growing number of drivers in the UK are avoiding steep "kiss-and-fly" charges at airports like Edinburgh by parking in nearby lay-bys and waiting for passengers to arrive. With fees at some major airports reaching £6 or more for a brief 10-minute stop, drivers coordinate via phone and then quickly pick up their friends or family from unofficial points to beat the charges. This behavior highlights public frustration with rising airport fees, which have increased at more than half of the UK's busiest airports over the past year.</p>

          <p>Russia is conducting a systematic campaign in occupied parts of Ukraine to erase Ukrainian identity and instill pro-Russian sentiment in children. This effort involves forcing children to participate in patriotic parades, learn the Russian curriculum from textbooks that justify the war, and attend "bravery lessons" from Russian soldiers. State-sponsored youth groups like the military-affiliated Yunarmia are central to this "brainwashing" campaign, which international law prohibits. Thousands of children have also been forcibly deported to "re-education camps" in Russia, prompting an ICC arrest warrant for President Putin.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is underway in the UK regarding the potential benefits and drawbacks of shortening the traditional six-week school summer holiday. Proponents argue that a shorter break could reduce learning loss, ease the burden of childcare and food costs for working parents, and potentially lower holiday prices by spreading them out. However, many teachers oppose the idea, citing the need for the long break to recharge and plan. The issue is divisive, with some regions already adopting shorter summer breaks in favor of a longer October half-term.</p>

          <p>The global transition to green technologies like electric cars is driving a massive demand for lithium, causing a severe environmental crisis in Chile's Atacama salt flats, home to the world's largest reserves.

Indigenous communities report that their traditional way of life is being destroyed by the water shortages, raising questions about whether the solution to one environmental crisis is creating another.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is advocating for a shift in public mindset from risk-averse saving to investing, suggesting that savers with funds in low-interest accounts should be notified of investment opportunities. The government aims to encourage more people, particularly women who invest less than men, to move money into stocks and shares ISAs to boost the economy. While a controversial plan to cut the cash ISA allowance has been paused, the push continues with new ad campaigns, though experts caution that this could backfire if new investors face short-term losses.
