        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by AlixPartners for CNBC estimates how tariffs could raise the price of goods like clothing and shoes. The models factor in production costs, duties, logistics, and retailer profitability. For instance, a men's cotton sweater made in China could see a 19% price increase under current tariffs and a 93% spike under the highest proposed duties, while Vietnam-made shoes could rise by 8% and 36%, respectively. Retailers are exploring strategies to mitigate these costs, but consumers could still face higher prices depending on the final tariff rates and retailers' ability to absorb the levies.

          <p>The Trump administration's immigration policies are targeting unaccompanied children and their caregivers, leading to fear and chaos in families. New policies expedite the removal of unaccompanied minors and strip them of legal representation. There are reports of children being used as "bait" to arrest and deport adults. Advocates describe a concentrated attack on children, causing emotional distress and isolation. One example is a 10-year-old girl who witnessed her mother's arrest during a routine check-in, leaving her and her siblings traumatized.</p>
