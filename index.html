          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for improved mechanisms to regulate the exercise of power as a key strategy in combating corruption. Speaking at an event, he stressed that power is granted by the people and must be clear, transparent, and traceable to prevent abuse. This statement comes as millions of officials participate in an education campaign focused on Xi's austerity rules, which Beijing views as crucial for maintaining the party's public image and legitimacy. The initiative aims to identify and address systemic shortcomings and loopholes in the power structure.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate held a prolonged "vote-a-rama" session to advance President Trump's "One Big, Beautiful Bill," a cornerstone of his second-term agenda. The legislation, which combines increased spending on border security and defense with cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs, is projected to add nearly $3.3 trillion to the deficit over ten years. Democrats used the marathon of amendment votes to challenge controversial provisions, while Republican leadership worked to secure enough votes for passage ahead of a self-imposed July 4 deadline. The bill must return to the House for approval of the Senate's changes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major banks and financial analysts are divided on the potential economic impact of President Trump's "One Big, Beautiful Bill." Some institutions, like Citi and Nomura, argue the legislation will provide a necessary boost to the U.S. economy by preventing the expiration of 2017 tax cuts and stimulating investment. However, other experts and the Congressional Budget Office express serious concerns, highlighting that the bill is projected to add over $3 trillion to the federal deficit. Critics also point to poorly designed tax cuts and the administrative burden on the IRS as significant drawbacks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Iowa has officially become the first U.S. state to remove "gender identity" from its civil rights code, eliminating non-discrimination protections for transgender and nonbinary individuals in areas like housing and employment. The new law, which took effect Tuesday, also defines sex based on reproductive organs at birth and prevents changes to birth certificates. This legislative reversal, part of a broader trend in Republican-led states, has been met with protests and condemnation from LGBTQ+ advocates, who fear it will lead to increased hostility and discrimination. The law also ends Medicaid coverage for gender-affirming care in the state.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit a new, highly remote immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades, which the White House has highlighted for its secure and inhospitable location. Informally known as "Alligator Alcatraz," the site is surrounded by swampland and wildlife, a feature the administration is using to send a strong deterrent message about illegal immigration. The facility has drawn criticism from immigrant advocates and Native American leaders over its potential environmental impact and what they call its cruel messaging. State officials, however, have promoted the site's difficult-to-escape nature as a key security benefit.</p>

The trust, which funded influential research on inequality by organizations like the IFS and Resolution Foundation, was shut down without notice, a move Toynbee links to a broader corporate backlash against Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles.

The author notes that despite France's significant role in the transatlantic slave trade, French audiences often learn about it through Hollywood productions. The article praises recent, rare films like "No Chains No Masters" and "Fanon" for finally tackling these subjects but laments their marginalization within the French film industry.

          <p>The Chinese yuan has appreciated against the U.S. dollar and is forecast to continue its gains through 2025, with some analysts predicting it will break the 7-per-dollar level within six months. This trend is supported by China's macroeconomic data, which has been more resilient than expected, particularly in exports. Concurrently, growing investor concerns about the sustainability of U.S. government debt and loose fiscal policy are contributing to a weaker outlook for the dollar. The People's Bank of China has reflected this strength by setting its daily reference rate at its strongest level in months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Four employees of the Turkish satirical magazine LeMan have been arrested for publishing a cartoon that officials claim depicts the Prophet Muhammad. The interior minister condemned the drawing as "shameless," and a formal investigation has been launched for "publicly insulting religious values." The magazine denies the cartoon depicts the prophet, stating it was misinterpreted and intended to portray a Muslim killed by Israel. The incident has sparked protests in Istanbul and drawn parallels to the 2015 Charlie Hebdo attack, raising serious concerns about press freedom in Turkey.</p>

The index rose to 50.4, contrasting with the official government PMI which reported a third consecutive month of contraction. Analysts attribute the divergence to differences in survey timing and company coverage, with the Caixin survey potentially reflecting a delayed positive response to a U.S.-China tariff reduction.

The government argues the reforms are necessary to control the spiraling welfare bill and ensure the system's long-term stability.
