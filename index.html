          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-25 12:39:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UN World Food Programme (WFP) has announced it has run out of food aid in Gaza after a seven-week Israeli blockade, with its last food stocks delivered to hot meals kitchens which are expected to deplete their supplies soon. The UN highlights Israel's obligation under international law to ensure supplies for Gaza's 2.1 million Palestinians, though Israel insists it is complying and there is no aid shortage. The blockade, initiated on March 2 and intensified after a ceasefire collapse, has caused food prices to skyrocket and raised severe nutrition concerns, prompting the WFP to urge immediate action to open borders for aid. More than 116,000 tonnes of food assistance are ready to be delivered once border crossings reopen.</p>

          <p>Former Republican congressman George Santos has been sentenced to 87 months in federal prison after pleading guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Santos, known for his elaborate fabrications and misuse of campaign funds, admitted to lying to Congress, fraudulently collecting unemployment benefits, and bilking campaign donors.

          <p>Despite President Trump's calls for a quick peace in Ukraine, President Putin is increasing the ferocity of Russia's airstrikes on civilian targets, even admitting to bombing a restaurant because people were "drinking vodka" there. Putin met with White House envoy Steve Witkoff, their fourth encounter in three months, fueling optimism in Moscow about potential energy deals and sanctions relief. This creates a tense negotiation with Trump, who posted "Vladimir, STOP!" in response to a deadly missile attack on Kyiv.

          <p>President Trump has labeled Harvard University an "[antisemitic], far-left institution" and a "threat to democracy" amid escalating tensions over funding. The Trump administration has threatened to pull federal funding from Harvard if it doesn't reform its governance, leadership, and admissions practices, particularly concerning international students and those deemed "hostile" to American values. Harvard has responded by filing a lawsuit against the administration over its "unlawful" freezing of funds. The conflict stems from criticism of Harvard's handling of antisemitism and anti-Israel unrest on campus following Hamas' Oct. 7 massacre.</p>

          <p>President Trump's ongoing attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stem from differences over interest rate policy, with Trump favoring lower rates to boost the economy. This pressure on the Fed breaks with decades of presidential deference and raises concerns about political interference. Economists warn that undermining the Fed's independence could lead to spiraling prices and economic ruin, drawing comparisons to Nixon's attempts to influence the Fed in the 1970s. The conflict highlights the importance of maintaining market confidence in the Fed's ability to control inflation.</p>

          <p>Marks & Spencer (M&S) has suspended online orders and is issuing refunds after a cyber attack disrupted its systems. Customers reported issues with contactless payments, Click & Collect, and gift card usage, leading to the complete pause of online and app shopping, including food deliveries and clothes. The retailer's shares fell by 5% following the announcement, and the company has apologized for the inconvenience. While stores remain open, the firm is working to resolve the ongoing issues and restore online services.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration initially sought to bring back Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man wrongfully deported to El Salvador, but later hardened its stance, portraying him as a dangerous criminal. Internal discussions revealed concerns about his safety and doubts about his alleged gang ties, with officials initially considering diplomatic channels for his return. However, as criticism of the administration grew, the White House took over the response, turning the case into a test of executive authority and refusing to take corrective action.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock is climbing due to the Trump administration's announcement of regulatory changes that could help the company achieve its self-driving ambitions sooner. The Transportation Department will loosen rules to help U.S. automakers deploy self-driving cars more quickly, streamlining safety testing and crash reporting requirements. This announcement comes at a critical time for Tesla, which has seen sales decline in key markets amid increasing competition. The relaxation of rules is intended to beat China in the race to develop next-gen technology.</p>

          <p>Tensions between India and Pakistan have escalated after a militant attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir, with India blaming Pakistan for the deaths of 26 people. The Indian military reported an exchange of fire with Pakistani soldiers across the de-facto border. Following the attack, India suspended a water treaty with Pakistan, closed a border crossing, and ordered the expulsion of military advisers from the Pakistani diplomatic mission. Pakistan announced similar countermeasures, halting trade and closing its airspace to Indian aircraft.</p>

          <p>The United States has reportedly considered asking Ukraine to accept Russian control of Crimea as part of a peace agreement, but Ukraine has stated doing so would violate the constitution. Recognizing the annexation would undermine international law, alienate allies, and provoke internal political fallout, according to the Robert Lansing Institute for Global Threats and Democracies Studies. Ukrainian political scientist Volodymyr Fesenko argues that Crimea is a "red line" and its loss would set "an extremely dangerous precedent."</p>

          <p>Kashmir's strategic importance and the ongoing conflict between Pakistan and India make it a volatile flashpoint with global stakes.

The region is heavily militarized and claimed in full by both India and Pakistan, fueling multiple wars and decades of diplomatic hostility.
