          <p>American shopping malls are undergoing a significant transformation to survive, replacing vacant anchor stores like Sears with unconventional tenants including churches, bowling alleys, and expanded bookstores. For example, the Dayton Mall in Ohio has seen a local church, Crossroads, revitalize a former Sears space, drawing thousands of visitors and boosting business for remaining retailers. This trend, driven by mall owners like CBL Properties and Brookfield, focuses on creating community hubs with diverse, experience-oriented offerings. Data shows this strategy is increasing foot traffic, with Gen Z in particular embracing the revamped, community-focused mall experience.</p>

Despite a modest sales increase and a still-shrinking customer base, the company is forecasting continued growth and is expanding its use of AI to improve personalization.

Citing a need to combat what he described as "crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor," Trump's administration will also clear homeless encampments. The move has been met with opposition from D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who highlighted that official statistics show a significant decrease in both overall and violent crime this year.

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, marking the fifth named storm of the current hurricane season. Located west of the Cabo Verde islands, the storm is moving westward and is not an immediate threat to the United States. However, forecasters at the U.S. National Hurricane Center predict it could strengthen into the season's first hurricane, potentially becoming a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean islands later in the week. This development aligns with predictions for an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season this year.</p>

Currently a Schedule I drug alongside heroin, a potential move to Schedule III could provide major benefits, such as easing tax burdens and encouraging institutional investment. Trump confirmed he is reviewing the matter and will make a decision soon, a statement that has fueled industry optimism. While the final authority rests with the Attorney General, presidential backing is seen as a crucial step for the cannabis market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a major move following its merger with Skydance, Paramount has acquired the U.S. broadcasting rights for the UFC in a seven-year deal valued at $7.7 billion, starting in 2026. All UFC events will be available on the Paramount+ streaming service, with select events simulcast on CBS, effectively ending the pay-per-view model for U.S. fans. TKO Group, the parent company of UFC and WWE, views the deal as a way to broaden its audience and drive streaming subscriptions. For Paramount, the acquisition secures a highly desirable, year-round live sports asset, crucial for its growth strategy.</p>

This article analyzes how the debate became a self-sustaining outrage cycle, with each side reacting more to the other's perceived reaction than to the original ad content.

          <p>China's People's Liberation Army has released rare public footage of its DF-100 cruise missile being launched, a move interpreted as a strategic deterrent aimed at the United States. The video, part of a military documentary, provides one of the clearest views of the weapon since its debut in 2019. The segment showcased a rocket force brigade conducting a complex communications and launch drill under simulated enemy jamming conditions. The public release by state media confirms the model and highlights China's increasing transparency regarding its advanced military capabilities.</p>

          <p>A new study in the journal JAMA reveals that the number of abortions in the U.S. actually rose after the repeal of Roe v. Wade, largely driven by medication abortions supplied via telehealth. Between July 2023 and August 2024, the provider Aid Access shipped nearly 120,000 packs of abortion pills, with the majority going to residents in states with abortion bans. The study found that provision rates were significantly higher in poorer counties and in states with restrictive laws, highlighting how telehealth and "shield laws" in protective states are creating new avenues for abortion access across the country.</p>

          <p>Chicano artist Perry Picasshoe is using performance art to comment on recent immigration enforcement raids in Southern California's Inland Empire. His project involves placing large blocks of ice at locations where raids have occurred and documenting them as they melt, serving as a metaphor for the precarious existence of immigrants. The artist, known for exploring complex Latino and LGBTQ+ identities, has gained recognition for his work, much of which is showcased at the Cheech Marin Center for Chicano Art and Culture. His art aims to provoke reflection on community identity and confront residents with hard truths.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government's planned overhaul of driving laws is facing criticism for not including a graduated licensing system for new and young drivers. Road safety advocates and the AA have called this a "major oversight," pointing to data showing young drivers are disproportionately involved in fatal collisions. The proposed changes do include compulsory eye tests for drivers over 70 and stricter penalties for not wearing a seatbelt. However, the government has stated it has no current plans for graduated licenses over concerns they could unfairly discriminate against young people who are parents or carers.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's performance in the Community Shield showcased both the promise of its new signings and potential defensive weaknesses. New attacking players Hugo Ekitiké and Florian Wirtz had encouraging debuts, contributing to a potent offense. However, the team appeared defensively open at times, a recurring issue during pre-season, as they adapt to a new 4-2-3-1 formation. The absence of key midfielders highlighted vulnerabilities in the back line, suggesting that while the attack looks strong, the team may face a period of adjustment to find defensive stability early in the season.</p>

          <p>Amazon has successfully launched another 24 Kuiper internet satellites into orbit aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, bringing its total constellation to 102. The launch, which faced several delays due to weather, marks the fourth mission for Amazon's satellite internet project. The company is racing to meet a Federal Communications Commission deadline requiring it to have approximately 1,600 satellites in orbit by mid-2026. This launch is the second time Amazon has relied on its primary competitor, SpaceX's Starlink, to deploy its satellites as it works to build out its network.</p>

          <p>A new scientific paper published in a peer-reviewed journal presents a model for a physical warp drive that does not require negative energy, a theoretical and likely impossible substance. This concept builds upon the 1994 Alcubierre drive model but overcomes its primary obstacle by proposing a different method of manipulating spacetime. Instead of moving a ship within a spacetime bubble, the new model involves stable, floating bubbles of spacetime itself. While the energy requirements are still immense and construction is in the far future, this provides a theoretical pathway for faster-than-light travel based on understood physics.</p>
