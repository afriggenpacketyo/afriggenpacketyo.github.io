            <p>A new Lancet study warns that the number of overweight or obese adults in India could soar to 450 million by 2050, nearly a third of the country's projected population. Abdominal obesity, defined as a waist over 90cm for men and 80cm for women, affects about 40% of women and 12% of men in India, according to the latest National Family Health Survey. Experts blame lifestyle shifts, including increased consumption of junk food and sedentary habits, for the rise in obesity. The condition is linked to increased risk of Type 2 diabetes and heart disease, with South Asians tending to accumulate fat around the trunk, leading to insulin resistance. Optimism score: 40</p>

            <p>Scottie Scheffler, the world's No. 1 golfer, struggled in the third round of the Masters, shooting an even-par 72 and falling off the pace as Rory McIlroy took the lead. Scheffler, a frontrunner in his previous Masters victories, found himself in the unfamiliar position of chasing McIlroy. He played a good round of bad golf, scrambling to recover from numerous mistakes. Scheffler's partner, Tyrrell Hatton, also struggled, finishing three over for the day. Optimism score: 65</p>
            <p>65/100</p>

            <p>President Trump urged Congress to pass legislation making daylight saving time permanent, citing its popularity and the inconvenience of changing clocks twice a year. Trump's directive follows ongoing efforts in Congress, including the Sunshine Protection Act. Every state observes daylight saving time except Hawaii and Arizona (with the exception of the Navajo Nation portion). The issue was debated during a Senate hearing, with concerns raised about the impact of changing clocks on the economy, health, and well-being. Optimism score: 75</p>
