        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump stated that U.S. cattle ranchers fail to grasp the benefits of his tariffs, specifically a 50% tariff on Brazilian beef, which he claims has boosted their prosperity. His comments followed ranchers' criticism of his plan to import beef from Argentina to lower consumer prices. Trump urged ranchers to reduce their prices, emphasizing the consumer's importance in his economic considerations. This policy aims to address rising beef prices in the U.S., but has sparked concerns among American cattle producers about market interference.</p>

          <p>The UK government has postponed the publication of its Schools White Paper, including reforms for the Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) system, until early next year. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson cited the need for a "further period of co-creation" with stakeholders to ensure effective policy. While frustrating for parents, the delay is also seen as an opportunity to make the right decisions for a system widely described as "broken" and financially unsustainable. Local authorities warn of significant deficits if comprehensive changes are not implemented soon.</p>

          <p>Seventy years after Ruth Ellis was hanged for murder, her grandchildren are seeking a posthumous pardon, arguing she was a victim of severe domestic abuse. Ellis, a nightclub hostess, shot her "abusive" lover, David Blakely, in 1955. Her legal team contends that modern understanding of trauma and slow-burn provocation would likely have resulted in a manslaughter charge, not murder. The case, which inspired films, significantly influenced public opinion against the death penalty in the UK, leading to its eventual abolition.</p>

          <p>A supporter of Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic was shot and injured outside parliament in Belgrade, near a tent camp set up to counter anti-government protests. The 70-year-old gunman, who intended to burn the tents, claimed to have acted alone and expressed annoyance at the "occupation of the city center." President Vucic labeled the incident an act of "terrorism," blaming political opponents and certain media, while opposition groups condemned the violence and criticized the government's role in creating confrontation. The shooting escalates tensions in a country already experiencing nearly a year of protests against government corruption.</p>

          <p>The NFL has approved Julia Koch's purchase of a 10% stake in the New York Giants, valuing the team at $10.3 billion, marking the highest valuation for a minority NFL team sale. This deal, along with other limited partner sales for the New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers, highlights a sharp increase in NFL team values. The escalation is attributed to expectations of significantly higher media rights deals and the recent introduction of private equity investors, boosting valuations and liquidity in the league.

          <p>A child abuse expert has withdrawn from the UK's national inquiry into grooming gangs, citing concerns over "political point scoring" and "misinformation." This follows another expert's departure, leaving the inquiry without a chair. The expert emphasized the need for a chair trusted by victims and criticized the "adversarial approaches" hindering the inquiry's crucial work. Survivors have expressed fears that the inquiry's scope might be diluted or that racial and religious motivations behind the abuse could be downplayed, despite assurances from political leaders that it will not be watered down.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The burgeoning AI sector presents a paradoxical landscape for workers, where significant investments and acquisitions by big tech companies often lead to layoffs rather than expanded opportunities. Startups like Snorkel AI and Scale AI have seen staff reductions after major investments, as larger firms prioritize streamlining and eliminating duplicate functions. This trend reflects a recalibration of workforces post-pandemic and a shift towards flatter organizational models, with an emphasis on senior roles. While AI is projected to create new jobs, the current environment signals job volatility and a more employer-driven market, potentially impacting future recruitment strategies for AI startups.

          <p>Meta is laying off approximately 600 employees within its artificial intelligence unit as part of an effort to reduce organizational layers and operate more nimbly. The cuts, announced by Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang, impact various AI infrastructure, research, and product-related positions. This move follows CEO Mark Zuckerberg's frustration with Meta's AI progress and comes after a $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI and the creation of a new Meta Superintelligence Labs unit. Employees were notified of a non-working notice period with severance packages, as Meta aggressively overhauls its AI strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

Strazik confirmed GE Vernova's position as a key power equipment provider for major hyperscalers, with electrical equipment orders from this sector nearly doubling year-to-date. Despite strong demand and topping third-quarter expectations, GE Vernova's shares fell, partly due to the company not raising its 2025 forecast and ongoing challenges in onshore wind. The company is also expanding its portfolio with a significant acquisition in transformer manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

This vulnerability stems from their lower maturity, liquidity, and frequent use in highly leveraged trading. The event, triggered by Trump's tariff threats on China, exposed a "doom loop" where initial price drops cascade into further liquidations due to thin order books and margin calls.
