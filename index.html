          <h2>Supreme Court Weighs Taxpayer Funding for Religious Charter School in Oklahoma</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-30 16:39:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court appeared inclined to allow taxpayer funding for the nation's first religious charter school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, in Oklahoma. The justices debated whether excluding the school from charter school funding constitutes religious discrimination, focusing on the First Amendment's religion clauses. Liberal justices argued that charter schools are public institutions that cannot advance a specific ideology with taxpayer funds, while conservatives viewed them as contractors for a public service. The decision could have ripple effects nationwide, impacting charter schools and other government contracts with religiously affiliated organizations. Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself from the case, leaving a possibility of a tie vote.</p>

          <p>Meta's shares experienced a surge of over 4% following the release of its first-quarter earnings report, which revealed stronger-than-anticipated revenue and provided a second-quarter forecast aligning with Wall Street's projections. The company's first-quarter sales increased by 16% year-over-year, while net income saw a substantial rise of 35%, reaching $16.64 billion. Meta anticipates second-quarter sales to fall within the range of $42.5 billion to $45.5 billion.

          <p>Israel faced severe wildfires that forced road closures, town evacuations near Jerusalem, and a call for international assistance, interrupting Memorial Day ceremonies and canceling Independence Day celebrations. Eyal Caspi, head of Israel’s fire and rescue service, described the blazes as exceptionally challenging, with firefighting planes hindered by difficult conditions. While there were no reported deaths, several people were treated for minor injuries. Prime Minister Netanyahu attributed the fires to a combination of strong winds and dryness, while Caspi suggested climate change was exacerbating the situation, noting the unprecedented speed at which the fire advanced. The Palestinian Authority offered assistance, but it is unclear whether Israel will accept.</p>

          <p>Interest rates on home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are influenced by various factors, including the federal funds rate, prime rate, loan-to-value ratio, credit score, and overall economic data. HELOC rates are variable and change monthly, making it important for borrowers to understand the factors driving these rates. A low federal funds rate and prime rate, along with a smaller loan-to-value ratio and a strong credit score, can help borrowers secure a lower HELOC rate. Monitoring economic data such as inflation and unemployment can also provide insights into potential rate fluctuations.</p>

The Liberals managed to gain more than a dozen seats, but the Conservatives also made significant gains, blocking the Liberals from forming a decisive majority government, highlighting the challenges Carney faces in uniting the country.</p>

          <p>A new study challenges the assumption that wealth is the primary determinant of happiness, arguing for a broader understanding of flourishing that includes relationships, community, health, and a sense of purpose. The 2025 World Happiness Report ranks Nordic countries as the happiest, but a new Global Flourishing Study, surveying over 200,000 people across 22 countries, reveals a different picture. The study found that while wealthy countries like Sweden scored high in life evaluation, they ranked lower in overall composite flourishing compared to poorer countries like Indonesia and Nigeria, which reported stronger social relationships and community involvement. The research suggests that prioritizing economic growth above all else may have imposed costs on developed nations.</p>

          <p>The first 100 days of the Trump administration have been marked by significant financial market turmoil, with over $6.5 trillion wiped from the value of public companies. The S&P 500 experienced its worst start to a presidential term since 1974, triggered by the announcement of sweeping tariffs. Economists warn that these tariffs, a tax on imports paid by the importer, will lead to higher prices for consumers and businesses. While some investors hope for trade deals and tax cuts, uncertainty remains over the administration's next moves, creating an unstable environment for financial markets. The recent market turmoil prompted President Trump to back down on his steepest tariffs.</p>

The company reported revenue just shy of expectations and modified its net yield growth guidance, indicating revenues will likely be pressured this year. CEO Harry Sommer noted some "choppiness" in cruises booked to Europe from the United States in the third quarter. Despite these pressures, Sommer reiterated the cruise industry's view that travelers increasingly seek cruises during economic turmoil due to the value of those vacations. (not investment advice)</p>

Justices were divided along ideological lines, with Republican appointees largely sympathetic to the school and Democratic ones wary. A ruling in favor of the school could affect laws in 46 other states that authorize charter schools. Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself from the case.</p>

Most HELOCs have a 10-year draw period, during which borrowers can access funds, followed by a repayment period. After 10 years, access to funds ends, the payment structure changes, and monthly payments increase, often substantially. To prepare for the end of the draw period, consider making principal payments early, calculating future payments, exploring refinancing options, and building an emergency fund.
