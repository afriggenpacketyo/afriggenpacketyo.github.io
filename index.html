          <p>A Kazakh trade official emphasized the need for greater infrastructure investment to realize the country's potential as a key trade bridge between China and Europe. While Kazakhstan is digitizing trade procedures with China, bottlenecks in customs and logistics remain a challenge. The official highlighted the Middle Corridor trade route as a significant opportunity, citing a World Bank report that projects trade volumes along the route will triple by 2030, driven largely by Kazakh exports.</p>

          <p>Scientists from BGI Research have identified the "master sex-determining gene" in the central bearded dragon, a lizard whose sex is influenced by both genetics and incubation temperature. For this species, male embryos incubated at 32°C or higher can develop into females, a phenomenon known as sex reversal. By sequencing a near-complete genome of the lizard, researchers were able to pinpoint the specific gene responsible for this unique biological process, advancing understanding of temperature-dependent sex determination.</p>

          <p>Billionaire Tom Steyer is contributing $12 million to support Proposition 50, a California ballot measure aimed at redrawing the state's congressional districts to favor Democrats. The measure was proposed by state Democrats in response to efforts by President Trump to have GOP-led states redraw their maps, which could impact control of the U.S. House. Steyer's contribution makes him the largest funder of the initiative, which he frames as a necessary move to counter Trump's "election-rigging power grab."</p>

          <p>China has expanded its licensing requirements for rare earth exports, a move that is deepening anxiety within the European Union. The new rules now cover the export of processing technologies and products containing even trace amounts of the critical minerals, which are essential for military and high-tech industries. The EU's ambassador to China described the measures as "collateral damage" that is hurting European companies, reflecting growing concerns about supply chain vulnerabilities.

          <p>A Rutgers University professor, who authored a book on anti-fascism, was prevented from boarding a flight to Spain with his family after their reservations were mysteriously canceled at the last minute.

This action underscores China's dominance in the rare earths market and its willingness to use this control as a diplomatic lever. (not investment advice)</p>
