          <h2>India Accuses Pakistan of Ceasefire Violation Amid Rising Tensions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-10 15:21:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India has accused Pakistan of violating the ceasefire agreement brokered with U.S. assistance, citing ongoing explosions heard in Srinagar. Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri stated that India is responding appropriately to these violations, while Pakistan has yet to address the allegations. The tensions between the two countries have escalated since an attack on Indian-controlled Kashmir, with India launching strikes on what it claims to be terrorist infrastructure within Pakistan. Despite the ceasefire announcement by President Trump, reports of cross-border firing persist, raising concerns about the stability of the region.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have initiated trade talks in Switzerland, marking the first high-level meeting since the U.S. imposed tariffs on Chinese imports. Both countries have been sending signals of wanting to resolve the trade war, which has impacted factory output and led to economic contraction. The timing of the talks coincides with Xi Jinping's visit to Moscow, projecting China's strength as an alternative global leader. With the tariffs hurting both economies, the discussions aim to reassure nervous markets and domestic constituencies, though expectations for a significant tariff reduction remain low.</p>

          <p>Ramona Sarsgaard, the daughter of Maggie Gyllenhaal and Peter Sarsgaard, was arrested at Columbia University during protests against Israel’s war in Gaza. The arrest occurred after student activists occupied part of the Butler library, renaming it the Basel al-Araj People’s University, and demanding the university divest from businesses involved in the conflict. University officials called in the police, leading to multiple arrests, including Sarsgaard who received a desk appearance ticket for criminal trespassing. The protests are part of a larger wave of anti-war demonstrations at Columbia and other US universities, amidst crackdowns on student activism.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan agreed to a cease-fire after days of intense fighting, though reports of continued violence persisted. The agreement, initially announced by President Trump, was followed by contradictory statements regarding U.S. mediation.

Disinformation and conflicting government statements have obscured the precise nature of the attacks, while both sides spread their own narratives. The dispute over Kashmir's origins dates back to the 1947 partition of British India.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has ordered the Department of Homeland Security to add 20,000 officers to enforce his deportation policies, supplementing current efforts with state and local law enforcement. This initiative is part of a broader plan to encourage undocumented immigrants to self-deport, including offering financial incentives and paid travel. Trump's administration is also pursuing multiple pathways to force undocumented immigrants to leave the US, though some methods have been challenged in federal courts. The initiative is dubbed as "Project Homecoming" and includes strict punishments for those who remain.</p>

          <p>Leaders from Britain, France, Germany, and Poland visited Ukraine, announcing that Russia would face “new and massive” sanctions on its banking and energy sectors if President Putin did not agree to a 30-day cease-fire. The effort, coordinated with the White House, aims to pressure Russia to show seriousness about peace. While the Kremlin dismissed the threat of sanctions, Ukraine and its allies remain focused on building military strength to ensure lasting peace. The situation underscores the shifting geopolitical landscape, with Europe seeking to fill the void left by the United States.</p>

Developed by Teal Health, the device allows women to collect a vaginal sample for HPV testing, offering a more convenient and less invasive screening method. The approval follows a study showing at-home screening to be as effective as in-office procedures, with women expressing a preference for self-screening. This development aims to increase cervical cancer screening rates and reduce racial disparities in outcomes.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft launched towards Venus in 1972, re-entered Earth's atmosphere after 53 years in space. The spacecraft, which failed to reach its intended destination due to a rocket booster malfunction, may have remained intact during its plunge and splashed down in the Indian Ocean. The event serves as a reminder of the ambitious space race between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Experts noted that the return of the spacecraft highlights a time when space exploration held a more adventurous spirit.</p>

          <p>In his new memoir, media executive Barry Diller reflects on his career, particularly his time at ABC, and emphasizes the importance of instinct over relying solely on data for decision-making. Diller argues that data can be harmful to instinct and that too much information can obscure the essence of a good idea. He shares anecdotes about successful projects, such as "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker," which were driven by instinct rather than extensive research. Diller's perspective challenges the overreliance on structured information and PowerPoint presentations in business.</p>
