          <p>President Donald Trump has called for a "major investigation" into celebrity endorsements received by former Vice President Kamala Harris during her 2024 presidential campaign. Trump alleges, without evidence, that some celebrities were illegally paid for their endorsements, while the celebrities in question have denied receiving payment. Campaign law experts stated that there are no FEC regulations against campaigns paying celebrities for endorsements, provided those payments are properly disclosed. The Harris campaign paid production companies founded by Oprah Winfrey, Bruce Springsteen, and Beyonce for services provided during and after the 2024 election.</p>

The NTSB is investigating the incident, gathering evidence about the crew, vessel, and nautical conditions.

Investigators are also looking into whether a power outage contributed to the collision, though this remains unconfirmed. The investigation is expected to take 12 to 24 months, with a preliminary report due within 30 days.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-19 18:20:36 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Joe Biden was diagnosed with an "aggressive" form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to his bones, prompting questions about the disease and its detection. Experts explain that prostate cancer can be difficult to detect early, especially in older men who may not undergo regular PSA screenings. Symptoms may not always be present, and the cancer can develop rapidly between screenings. Treatment options vary depending on the stage and spread of the cancer, with hormone therapy and chemotherapy being common approaches for advanced cases. The article emphasizes that while metastatic prostate cancer is not curable, advancements in treatment have significantly improved survival rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court issued an order allowing the Trump administration to remove deportation protections from nearly 350,000 Venezuelan immigrants while the case is appealed. The order allows the administration to strip the immigrants of temporary legal status, potentially allowing the U.S. to begin deporting them. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, and a lawyer representing the immigrants described the decision as ‚Äútruly shocking‚Äù and the largest single action stripping any group of noncitizens of immigration status in modern U.S. history.</p>

          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.‚Äôs announcement that he has aggressive prostate cancer has shifted the focus from Democrats‚Äô reflections on his presidency and 2024 candidacy to concern for his health. The diagnosis, which reveals the cancer has spread to his bones, has paused discussions about his role in the party's loss. While many express sympathy, some, including former Representative Dean Phillips, suggest the timing of the announcement is a deflection from criticism. The news has also sparked questions about when Biden learned of his condition and whether it was concealed during his presidency.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration and Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) takeover and gutting of the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) were unlawful. The decision declared DOGE's actions at USIP ‚Äúnull and void‚Äù and ordered the reinstatement of USIP's acting president, George Moose. The judge noted that Trump used force and "threats of criminal process" to take over the USIP headquarters, even though the agency is not part of the government's executive branch.

A key part of the deal involves giving European fishing boats a further 12 years of access to British waters in exchange for easing some trade frictions. The government said the deal would make it easier for food and drink to be imported and exported by reducing paperwork and checks.

          <p>First Lady Melania Trump has joined her husband President Donald Trump as he signed a bill into law that makes posting so-called "revenge porn" and deepfake explicit content illegal. The Take It Down Act criminalizes posting "intimate images" - real or AI-generated - online without an individual's consent and requires technology companies to remove the content within 48 hours. While the bill has received strong bipartisan support, some digital rights groups say it's too broad and could lead to censorship.</p>

If the bill moves forward without significant changes, the U.S. would likely find its debt levels spiraling higher in order to finance the tax cuts, according to several analyses. Moody's Ratings on Friday downgraded the nation's debt, citing the potential for the new bill to add $4 trillion to the federal primary deficit, which excludes interest payments, over the next decade.</p>
