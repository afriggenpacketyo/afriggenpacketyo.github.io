          <p>Intense sectarian violence has erupted in the southern Syrian city of Sweida between local Druze militias and Sunni Bedouin communities, resulting in hundreds of casualties. The conflict, which began after a robbery, escalated when Syrian government troops entered the area, leading to further clashes and alleged executions of Druze civilians by government-aligned forces. In response, Israel conducted airstrikes on Syrian army headquarters in Damascus and Sweida, stating the intervention was necessary to protect the Druze population. The events highlight the fragile security situation and complex ethnic tensions within the country under its new government.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Blocks Rule to Remove Medical Debt from Credit Reports</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 14:19:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Texas has overturned a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) rule that would have removed unpaid medical debt from the credit reports of approximately 15 million Americans. The court found that the CFPB exceeded its authority under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. This decision impacts a significant number of consumers, as medical debt is often considered a poor predictor of creditworthiness due to billing inaccuracies and insurance disputes. While the ruling is a setback for consumer advocates, some protections still exist at the state level and through voluntary actions by major credit reporting agencies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Commission has unveiled a proposed €2 trillion, seven-year budget that significantly boosts defense and space investment to €131 billion, a fivefold increase from current levels. The plan, which requires unanimous approval from member states, aims to address modern geopolitical realities while also dedicating 35% of funds to climate and biodiversity projects. To finance the budget without increasing member contributions, the EU is looking to new revenue streams, including duties on e-waste and tobacco. The proposal also includes €100 billion in support for Ukraine and increased funding for migration management. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York Mets first baseman Pete Alonso has proposed a unique rule change for Major League Baseball that would permit one-on-one fights without immediate ejection. Speaking at a press conference, Alonso suggested that if a player charges the mound, the two involved could fight, with the loser being ejected while the winner remains in the game. He also proposed a system where a player could "take a knee" to opt out of a confrontation, aiming to reduce the risk of injury from team-wide brawls. The idea contrasts sharply with current MLB rules, which strictly penalize such altercations.</p>

The discussion highlights Trump's ongoing dissatisfaction with Powell over interest rate policies, which he believes are not being cut quickly enough. While the legality of a president removing a Fed chair "for cause" is untested and could destabilize financial markets, the administration has increased pressure on Powell, including accusations of mismanaging a headquarters renovation. This potential move underscores a significant challenge to the traditional independence of the Federal Reserve. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Morgan Stanley announced second-quarter financial results that exceeded Wall Street expectations, with net income rising 13% to $3.5 billion. The strong performance was driven by a 12% increase in revenue, which reached $16.79 billion. The bank's institutional securities division saw a significant boost from higher client activity, particularly in equity trading. Additionally, the wealth management segment delivered robust net revenues of $7.76 billion, benefiting from higher asset management fees, showcasing broad strength across the firm's key business areas.

          <p>AI startup Scale AI is laying off 200 full-time employees, about 14% of its workforce, just weeks after receiving a $14.3 billion investment from Meta and seeing its founder, Alexandr Wang, hired by the tech giant. In a memo, interim CEO Jason Droege stated the company had expanded its generative AI capacity "too quickly," leading to bureaucracy. The layoffs are intended to make the company more nimble and responsive to customer needs. The move comes as some major clients, like OpenAI and reportedly Google, are winding down their work with the data-labeling firm.</p>

          <p>U.S. Central Command has announced that its Yemeni partners intercepted a massive shipment of Iranian weapons intended for Houthi rebels. The seizure, described as the largest in the history of Yemen's National Resistance Forces, contained over 750 tons of munitions. This included advanced cruise missiles, anti-ship missiles, drone engines, and radar systems, with many components allegedly manufactured by a sanctioned Iranian defense company. The interdiction is seen as a significant blow to Iran's efforts to arm the Houthis and a critical step toward enhancing regional security and stability.</p>

          <p>A major review has found that the UK's Prevent counter-terrorism scheme missed a crucial opportunity to intervene with Axel Rudakubana before he murdered three young girls in Southport. Lord David Anderson KC's report noted that teachers had referred Rudakubana three times due to his obsession with violence, but his case was closed each time because he lacked a specific terrorist ideology. The review calls for the program to focus more on individuals fascinated with extreme violence, regardless of motive. It also highlighted separate failings in the earlier handling of the man who later murdered MP Sir David Amess.</p>

The suspended MPs—Rachael Maskell, Lloyd Duncan-Jordan, Brian Leishman, and Andrew Hinchliff—voted against proposed benefits cuts, a move that undermined the authority of party leader Sir Keir Starmer. The MPs stated they were representing their constituents' interests and could not support a bill that would make disabled people poorer.

Despite its strangeness, the explanation was reportedly believed by at least one investigating officer, creating a division among authorities before the case even reached a courtroom.
