          <p>The estimated $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot, the second-largest in the game's history, has been won by two ticket holders in Missouri and Texas. This win ends a three-month period without a jackpot winner, with the last major prize being claimed in May. Winners have the option of a lump sum payment of approximately $826.4 million or an annuity paid over 30 years. The odds of winning the grand prize are about 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

          <p>Bishop Robert Barron critiques Senator Tim Kaine's assertion that human rights originate from government rather than from a divine creator. Barron argues this view contradicts the foundational principles of American democracy, as articulated by figures like Thomas Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence. He contends that treating rights as government-granted makes them "alienable" and susceptible to removal, citing totalitarian regimes of the 20th century as examples. The article posits that recognizing rights as God-given is a crucial safeguard against governmental overreach.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of federal student loan borrowers are using deferment and forbearance options to pause their monthly payments, with over a quarter of borrowers currently in such a status. While these tools can prevent default, they have different financial implications; deferment may avoid interest accrual on subsidized loans, whereas forbearance typically results in costly interest charges. Experts advise that these are short-term solutions and encourage borrowers to explore income-driven repayment plans, which can offer affordable payments while still making progress toward loan forgiveness.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's aggressive deportation campaign, aiming to remove one million undocumented immigrants annually, could inadvertently cause the first recorded population decline in U.S. history. With natural population increase (births minus deaths) at a low of 500,000, a significant drop in net immigration could lead to national shrinkage. This demographic shift poses risks to key economic sectors like agriculture, construction, and healthcare, which heavily rely on immigrant labor. The article suggests this could lead to labor shortages, higher prices, and a smaller, poorer United States.</p>

          <p>With over half of Americans developing high blood pressure by age 40, the American Heart Association is promoting new recommendations for early intervention. Known as the "silent killer," untreated hypertension significantly increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, and dementia. The guidelines advocate for lifestyle changes and medication once systolic pressure exceeds 130/80 mm Hg, stressing that early action can add years of healthy life. For those with higher readings, starting with two medications is now recommended for more effective control.</p>

          <p>Russia launched its largest drone and missile attack of the war against Ukraine, firing a total of 823 munitions, according to Ukrainian officials. The barrage, which surpassed a previous record from July, resulted in at least eight civilian deaths and 59 injuries across the country. A key government cabinet building in Kyiv's historic Pecherskyi district was damaged, prompting President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to call for more international military aid. The attack led NATO to scramble fighter jets in neighboring Poland as a precautionary measure.</p>

          <p>UK Defence Secretary John Healey announced that the government is exploring the use of military and other non-military sites for temporary accommodation for asylum seekers. This initiative is part of Labour's pledge to end the use of hotels for housing asylum seekers before the next election, a practice that has led to public protests. Currently, over 32,000 asylum seekers reside in hotels. The move follows the use of two former military bases under the previous government and comes as the new Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, is expected to announce further proposals soon.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's economic approach, characterized by aggressive tariff regimes, direct government intervention in corporations like Intel, and attacks on the Federal Reserve's independence, is fundamentally altering the traditional U.S. economic model. This shift away from the "Washington consensus" of free-market capitalism is described as both systematic in its destruction of norms and chaotic in its execution. While the market response has been muted by an AI-fueled stock boom, the article suggests this radical uncertainty is creating significant long-term risks for economic stability and credibility, building on populist sentiment that grew after the 2008 financial crisis.</p>

          <p>Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has announced his resignation following intense pressure from within his own Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The move comes after the ruling coalition's historic defeat in the July parliamentary election, where it lost its majority in the upper house. Ishiba had initially resisted calls to step down, citing the need for political stability amidst economic and regional challenges. His resignation preempts a party vote that was widely seen as a no-confidence motion, triggering a leadership contest to select Japan's next prime minister.</p>

          <p>Gold prices have surged to record highs, gaining approximately 35% this year to nearly $3,600 an ounce, driven by economic uncertainty and anticipation of Federal Reserve rate cuts. Investors often turn to gold as a safe-haven asset during periods of political and financial instability. Financial experts generally recommend gaining exposure through gold bullion-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) rather than owning physical gold, due to lower costs and higher liquidity. They also advise limiting gold allocation to a small portion, typically under 3% of a diversified portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An advocacy group, Rainbow Railroad, has reported a 760% surge in inquiries from LGBTQ+ Americans seeking to relocate to Canada since Donald Trump's re-election. This increase is attributed to a climate of fear fueled by anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric, executive orders targeting transgender individuals, and over 600 restrictive bills at the state level. The organization, which typically helps people escape persecution globally, noted that for the first time, the U.S. became the top country from which people requested help.

The ruling, which orders lawmakers to draw a new, fairer map, is seen as a significant victory for voting rights advocates.

          <p>This summer's transfer window highlighted a significant financial gap, with Premier League clubs spending £3 billion compared to La Liga's £592 million. However, this disparity reflects a strategic shift in Spanish football towards sustainability, driven by strict economic controls implemented in 2013 to combat widespread club bankruptcy and debt. While these rules have stabilized the league and attracted foreign investment, they have also limited spending power. Despite the financial austerity, Spanish clubs remain highly competitive in European competitions, leveraging strong youth academies to produce top-tier talent and maintain on-pitch success.</p>

          <h2>AI-Generated Bible Videos Spark Debate Between Tech Company and Theologians</h2>

          <p>The company Pray.com is using artificial intelligence to create cinematic videos depicting biblical stories, such as the Book of Revelation, which are gaining significant traction on social media. The company views this as an innovative way to engage a younger audience, calling it the "Marvel Universe of faith." However, some theologians are critical, arguing that the action-movie aesthetic reduces the Bible to mere entertainment and strips it of its spiritual depth and transformative power. This controversy highlights the ongoing tension between leveraging modern technology for religious outreach and preserving the traditional sanctity of sacred texts.</p>

          <h2>Total Lunar Eclipse to Create 'Blood Moon' Visible in the UK</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 04:56:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A total lunar eclipse will be visible across much of the UK, causing the full moon to take on a deep red hue known as a "Blood Moon." The phenomenon occurs when the Earth passes directly between the Sun and the Moon, casting its shadow on the lunar surface. The reddish color is caused by sunlight refracting through Earth's atmosphere, a process called Rayleigh scattering. Visibility in the UK will depend on local moonrise times, with eastern regions getting the best and longest view of the event's totality.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, a London-born Italian teenager who died of leukemia at 15, has been canonized as the first millennial saint by the Catholic Church. Known for his passion for technology, Acutis created websites to document miracles and spread Catholic teachings, earning him the nickname "God's influencer." The Vatican fast-tracked his canonization, attributing two miracles to him after his death. His sainthood is seen as an effort by the Church to connect with and inspire younger generations, blending modern interests like video games with traditional faith.</p>

          <p>Anutin Charnvirakul has officially taken office as Thailand's new prime minister after receiving royal endorsement from King Maha Vajiralongkorn. His appointment follows the court-ordered dismissal of former Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, disrupting the long-dominant Shinawatra political dynasty. Anutin, known for championing cannabis decriminalization, secured the position with the backing of the main opposition People's Party. As a condition of their support, he has agreed to dissolve parliament and call for new elections within the next four months.</p>

He is the prime suspect in two 2003 bombings in the San Francisco Bay Area linked to an animal rights extremist group. After a high-speed chase in 2003, he vanished, leaving behind a car containing what agents called a "bomb-making lab." San Diego was discovered and arrested last year living under an alias in a cottage in north Wales.</p>

          <p>Global financial markets are anticipating a volatile week, driven by significant instability in European government bonds, particularly in the U.K. and France. In France, political uncertainty threatens the government, with a key sovereign debt rating review by Fitch scheduled for September 12. Amid this turmoil, the European Central Bank (ECB) is set to meet on Thursday but is expected to keep interest rates on hold at 2%. Market watchers expect ECB President Christine Lagarde to face questions about the market stress but maintain a cautious, non-committal stance on future policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwan is rapidly advancing its long-range strike capabilities by developing a new class of low-cost, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in collaboration with the U.S. defense company Kratos. The new Chien Feng IV suicide drone is a derivative of an existing Kratos system and reportedly has a range of at least 1,000km, enabling it to reach major cities deep inside mainland China. This "high-low" strategy aims to supplement more expensive cruise missiles with affordable alternatives, enhancing Taipei's defensive posture as military tensions with Beijing continue to rise.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has intensified threats to deploy federal troops to Chicago for immigration enforcement, sharing an AI-generated image parodying the film "Apocalypse Now" on social media. The post, titled "Chipocalypse Now," suggested a "war" on the city, prompting condemnation from Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who called the threat undemocratic. The move follows similar deployments in other cities and comes as thousands protested in Chicago against the possibility of large-scale immigration raids. The rhetoric has already led to the cancellation of some local Mexican Independence Day festivals.</p>
