          <p>This article discusses reports that Qatar's royal family considered donating a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet for President Trump's use as Air Force One, but denies that the plane will be gifted during Trump's visit to Qatar. Qatar's Media Attaché to the U.S. stated that the possible transfer of an aircraft for temporary use as Air Force One is under consideration between Qatar's Ministry of Defense and the U.S. Department of Defense, but the matter remains under review by the respective legal departments, and no decision has been made. The article emphasizes that any gift given by a foreign government is accepted in full compliance with all applicable laws and with full transparency.</p>

          <p>The White House announced a trade deal with China after weekend negotiations in Switzerland, but details remain unclear. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the talks were productive and that he would provide more details on Monday, while U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer hailed the discussions as "very constructive." Any de-escalation in the ongoing trade war could bring relief to the global economy, which has been affected by tariffs since Trump's April 2 tariff announcement. The article notes that high-stakes negotiations took place amid widespread economic uncertainty stemming from the U.S.-China trade war.</p>

          <p>President Trump implored Ukraine to accept a Russian proposal for direct talks rather than insist on a cease-fire first, as had been laid out in a plan announced by European leaders during a visit to Kyiv. The leaders of France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Poland had set a deadline of Monday for Russia to accept a 30-day cease-fire or face additional sanctions. Mr. Zelensky responded cautiously to the Russian counteroffer of direct talks, insisting again on a halt in the fighting, and added a new twist to the diplomatic brinkmanship, saying he would personally attend negotiations.</p>
