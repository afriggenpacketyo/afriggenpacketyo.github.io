          <p>Constance Marten was cross-examined by her partner, Mark Gordon, in their retrial concerning the death of their baby, Victoria. Both Marten and Gordon deny manslaughter by gross negligence and causing or allowing the death of a child, whose body was found in a Brighton shed in March 2023. Marten described feeling fearful after their car exploded in January 2023 and recounted living in a tent in Wales before Victoria's birth due to this fear. She testified that Victoria died in the tent after Marten fell asleep on top of her, and she denied intentionally causing the baby harm, stating that Victoria was always a priority.</p>

          <p>The UK and US have reached a deal to reduce or remove tariffs on some goods traded between the two countries, including cars, steel, and aluminum. While not a comprehensive trade deal, this agreement cuts car tariffs to 10% for up to 100,000 UK cars and scraps a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports into the US. Negotiations will continue on pharmaceuticals and digital trade, but there will be no change to the UK's digital services tax on US firms. The article clarifies that the agreement is a significant achievement for Starmer and will require months of negotiations and legal paperwork to follow.</p>

          <p>At the Milken Institute Global Conference, financial leaders expressed mixed emotions regarding financial markets and the economy, ranging from anxiety about volatile markets and trade tensions to optimism about technology and cost-cutting. Despite a recent market rebound after tariff-induced declines, uncertainty remains, with some skeptics suggesting a rosier outlook is being painted to avoid spooking investors. Investors are also looking more closely at opportunities in Europe and other parts of the world, as the role of the dollar as the world’s reserve currency is being questioned. Michael Milken delivered a keynote speech emphasizing economic freedom and equality of opportunity, while celebrating immigrants.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. intelligence agencies have increased their focus on Greenland, spurred by President Trump's interest in acquiring the island and Vice President Vance's visit to a U.S. military base there. This increased focus has led to a growing number of intelligence reports about Greenland being circulated in the executive branch and Congress. Some reports focus on Russian or Chinese interest in the island, as the White House remains concerned about Arctic security and encroachment by China and Russia on American interests. While much of the intelligence work is based on open-source information, officials expect more work to be done on Greenland and its population.</p>

Despite this increase, Gates notes that philanthropy cannot compensate for multibillion-dollar cuts in foreign aid by wealthy countries.

          <p>A House of Lords committee heard that home working has led to a more significant decline in after-work drinking in city centers outside London. Data suggests that in London, post-work drinks have shifted from Friday to Thursday, but this shift is not seen in other large British cities. Instead, spending in bars in these cities is more likely to shift into the weekend, indicating that workers are coming in from a leisure perspective rather than going out after work. This trend suggests a change in social habits due to remote work.</p>

          <p>Three political scientists argue that America has crossed the line into competitive authoritarianism, where opposition to the government comes with a price. They assert that the Trump administration has weaponized government agencies and taken punitive actions against critics, raising the cost of opposition for a wide range of Americans. This includes directing investigations into political opponents, targeting law firms perceived as unfriendly, and threatening universities with penalties. The authors contend that this has led to self-censorship and a weakening of democratic defenses, urging civil society to collectively resist this authoritarian offensive.</p>

The EU is ready to use rapid-fire safeguarding measures, including import quotas and high import duties, to protect its industries from the second-order impacts of Trump's tariffs.</p>

The report highlights the need for significant reform and efficiencies within the higher education sector, as universities have become increasingly reliant on higher fees from international students.</p>
