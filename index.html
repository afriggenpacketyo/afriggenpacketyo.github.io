        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is planning to move thousands of civil servant jobs out of London to regional campuses in Manchester and Aberdeen, aiming to save ¬£94m annually by 2032 and redistribute decision-making across the country. This initiative involves closing 11 London offices, including major government buildings, and creating roles in various towns and cities across the UK. While unions support the relocation, they seek more details on the impact to civil servants. The government aims to have 50% of senior civil servants based in regional offices by 2030, potentially injecting ¬£729m into local economies.</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, have been resentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole, a decision made by Judge Michael Jesic after hearing testimony from family members who vouched for their rehabilitation. The brothers, who claimed sexual assault by their parents, have spent over three decades incarcerated. While Judge Jesic acknowledged the heinous nature of the crime, he emphasized the brothers' efforts toward rehabilitation, leaving their fate to the parole board and Governor Newsom, with relatives expressing joy and hope for their release. The resentencing hearing allowed the brothers to apologize to their family and the court, and they expressed their wish to help those incarcerated and work with sexual assault victims if they were to be released.</p>

          <p>Greece issued a tsunami warning for parts of its coast after a strong earthquake struck south of the island of Kasos. The earthquake, measured at magnitude 5.9 by Greek authorities and 6.3 by the German Research Centre for Geoscience (GFZ), prompted emergency services to advise people to move away from the coast. Tremors were felt as far away as Israel and southwestern Turkey, with Egypt also reporting a magnitude 6.4 quake with no casualties or property damage.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has reinstated Pete Rose, "Shoeless" Joe Jackson, and 15 other players, making them eligible for the Hall of Fame after their careers were marred by gambling scandals. This decision changes the league's policy on permanent ineligibility, stating bans will expire at death. The reinstatement of Rose, who holds the record for career hits, comes after his death and opens the door for consideration by the Hall of Fame's Classic Baseball Era committee. However, concerns about Rose's character and past controversies remain.</p>

          <p>BBC research indicates that GPs in England are deeply divided over plans to legalize assisted dying, with personal beliefs shaping their views. A survey of over 1,000 GPs revealed that approximately half opposed the law, citing concerns about coercion and religious beliefs. Supporters emphasized patient choice and the desire for dignified deaths, with many sharing personal experiences. The Royal College of Psychiatrists also expressed reservations about the bill, citing a lack of requirements for addressing patients' unmet needs.</p>
