          <p>Vice President JD Vance stated that "a lot of waste and fraud" within the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) tax credit system is a central issue in the ongoing government shutdown. He claimed that while some recipients deserve the credits, many funds are improperly directed within the insurance industry. The shutdown is prolonged by a stalemate where Democrats demand the extension of enhanced ACA subsidies, while Republicans push for a stopgap funding measure. The KFF health policy group warns that premiums for millions of Americans could more than double if the enhanced credits expire as scheduled. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Penn State has reportedly fired head football coach James Franklin following a surprising upset loss to Northwestern, which marked the team's third straight defeat. Franklin, who was in his 12th season with the Nittany Lions, will be owed more than $49 million according to his contract. Last season, he led the team to a 13-3 record and a College Football Playoff semifinal appearance, finishing his tenure with a 104-45 record. The decision comes as the team also announced that starting quarterback Drew Allar is out for the season with a leg injury, compounding a difficult period for the program.</p>

          <p>Former NFL quarterback and current Fox Sports analyst Mark Sanchez has been released from an Indianapolis hospital and police custody after suffering multiple stab wounds in an altercation on October 4. He faces a felony charge of battery involving serious bodily injury stemming from a fight with a truck driver over a parking dispute. In his first public comments, Sanchez focused on his recovery and thanked first responders and the surgeon who he said saved his life, declining to discuss the charges. A pretrial conference is scheduled for November 5, and he has been permitted to leave Indiana after being processed.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance declared that the Trump administration will "litigate as much as we can" to deploy the National Guard to Chicago, following a federal appeals court ruling that blocked their immediate deployment for law enforcement duties. The administration argues the move is necessary to control crime, a claim disputed by Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and other local leaders who view it as a federal overreach. This legal battle is part of a broader push to send federal forces to several Democrat-led cities. The ongoing dispute has created tension in Chicago, particularly during major public events like the city's marathon.</p>

          <p>A college student from Texas is facing intense online harassment after her real mugshot was attached to a fabricated viral story claiming she was an Olive Garden waitress arrested for throwing breadsticks at customers. The fictional post, which originated from a known "rage bait" Facebook page, spread rapidly across social media, leading people to identify and target her. The student, whose mugshot was from a public intoxication arrest during a difficult period in her life, described the experience as her "worst nightmare." The incident highlights the damaging real-world consequences of online misinformation and the challenges of removing false content from platforms like Facebook.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance confirmed that the Trump administration is "looking at all options," including the possibility of invoking the Insurrection Act, to address what he described as out-of-control crime in U.S. cities. This 1807 law would permit the domestic deployment of military troops for law enforcement, a measure rarely used and legally contentious. The discussion arises as the administration faces legal challenges to its attempts to deploy federalized National Guard forces in cities like Chicago. Vance's comments have intensified the political clash with Democratic governors, who accuse the administration of fabricating a crisis and overstepping its constitutional authority.</p>

An Amsterdam court has suspended Wingtech's chairman from his roles at Nexperia and placed the company's shares under third-party management.

However, a late 27-yard field goal by Denver's Wil Lutz proved to be the decisive score, as a final Jets drive was thwarted by the Broncos' ninth sack of quarterback Justin Fields.</p>

          <p>Women who have experienced miscarriage or stillbirth are criticizing Meta for its ad-targeting algorithms that continue to show them baby-related content, causing significant emotional distress. Despite losing their pregnancies, these women report being "bombarded" with ads for maternity wear, prams, and other baby products on Facebook and Instagram. While Meta allows users to adjust ad preferences, critics say the "parenting" category is too broad and ineffective at stopping the triggering content. A former Meta employee stated that the company's systems are not designed with user well-being as a priority, and the company's new paid subscription to remove ads is seen as an unreasonable solution.</p>

          <p>As a ceasefire takes hold in Gaza, Hamas' internal security forces are visibly reasserting control in areas not occupied by the Israeli military, including cracking down on alleged collaborators and informants. Reports indicate clashes between Hamas and opposing clans, with the group announcing a large-scale campaign to arrest individuals accused of spying for Israel. This re-emergence of Hamas authority highlights the unresolved questions surrounding Gaza's future security, especially as the U.S.-brokered peace plan calls for the group's disarmament and the establishment of an International Stabilization Force. The transition to a new security structure faces significant logistical and political challenges.</p>
