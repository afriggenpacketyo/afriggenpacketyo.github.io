          <p>An upcoming Tokyo metropolitan assembly election is poised to be a crucial indicator of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's long-term political prospects, especially with a House of Councillors election on the horizon. The outcome of this local race could potentially lead to Ishiba's resignation, given his declining popularity attributed to concerns about his economic strategies, including efforts to control rising rice prices. Past Tokyo assembly elections have significantly shaped Japan's political landscape, even leading to changes in prime ministers and shifts in the ruling party's power. Analysts suggest that Ishiba's political fate hinges on achieving positive results in tariff negotiations with the United States.</p>

His partnership with Sadaharu Oh, dubbed "O-N," made them household names, symbolizing a prosperous era for many older Japanese.

          <p>Due to rising tariffs, a restaurant in Beijing has had to remove American chicken feet, a delicacy known as "phoenix talons," from its menu after prices increased by 30%.

Geng hopes that the price of American chicken feet will decrease if global political tensions ease.

          <p>Iowa state Representative J.D. Scholten has announced his candidacy to challenge Republican Senator Joni Ernst in 2026, spurred by Ernst's response to constituents concerned about potential Medicaid cuts. Ernst's comment, "Well, we're all going to die," during a town hall meeting sparked controversy and motivated Scholten to enter the race. Scholten, a former congressional candidate and current baseball player, aims to make the election a referendum on President Trump's trade policies, particularly their impact on Iowa soybean farmers.

The disagreement centers on Abramovich's desire to donate the proceeds to "all victims of the war in Ukraine," including those in Russia, while the UK government insists the funds should solely benefit humanitarian efforts within Ukraine.

          <p>The acting head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), David Richardson, reportedly stated during a briefing that he was unaware the U.S. has a hurricane season, causing confusion among agency staff. The comment, made at a daily operational briefing, raised concerns about Richardson's preparedness for the upcoming Atlantic hurricane season, which officially began on June 1. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson suggested the comment was a joke, but some FEMA employees found it to be in poor taste given the agency's responsibilities. NOAA has predicted an above-average hurricane season with a high likelihood of major storms.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is temporarily halting its plan to garnish Social Security benefits for individuals who have defaulted on their student loans. The Education Department spokesperson stated the administration is committed to protecting Social Security recipients who often rely on a fixed income. This decision marks a policy shift, as the administration previously announced the resumption of collection activity on student loans. The pause provides older borrowers with defaulted loans additional time to become current and prevent future benefit reductions. (not investment advice)</p>
