The report alleges Planned Parenthood manipulates the definition of contraception to circumvent parental consent laws, citing a patient guide from their Mar Monte chapter. This practice is contrasted with state laws requiring parental consent for gender transition treatments. The report claims Planned Parenthood prioritizes gender-affirming care over abortion services, leading to criticism from the watchdog group.</p>

Lliuya sued over the risk of flooding from a glacial lake, arguing RWE's emissions contributed to the melting glaciers. The court ruled the flood risk was too low for RWE to be liable, barring an appeal.  Despite the loss, the case established the principle that climate change plaintiffs can sue German companies in German courts for emissions-related damages.

          <p>The price of gold has risen significantly since early 2024, exceeding $3,400 per ounce.
