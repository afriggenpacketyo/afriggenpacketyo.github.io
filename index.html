          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly threatened to support a primary challenger against Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina. The threat came after Tillis announced his opposition to Trump's major spending bill, citing concerns over its significant cuts to Medicaid funding for his state. Despite Tillis's vote, the bill narrowly cleared a key procedural hurdle in the Senate. Trump also criticized Senator Rand Paul, another Republican who voted against the measure, questioning his loyalty on social media.</p>

          <p>The Irish-language rap group Kneecap delivered a defiant performance at the Glastonbury Festival, drawing a large crowd despite facing significant controversy. One member, Mo Chara, is currently facing a terrorism charge, which the band and its supporters claim is an attempt to silence their pro-Palestinian views. During their set, the group led chants of "Free Palestine" and criticized UK political leaders who had questioned their inclusion in the festival's lineup.

          <p>The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, has stated that Iran retains the capability to restart enriching uranium to weapons-grade levels in "a matter of months." This assessment follows recent US and Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, which Grossi described as causing severe but not total damage, contradicting US claims of complete destruction. The situation is further complicated by Iran's parliament voting to suspend cooperation with the IAEA, though Grossi remains hopeful for a diplomatic solution to the ongoing nuclear standoff.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive report details the 2024 murder trial of Samuel Woodward, who was found guilty of the first-degree murder of his former classmate, Blaze Bernstein. The prosecution successfully argued that the killing was a premeditated hate crime, motivated by Woodward's neo-Nazi ideology and Bernstein's identity as a gay, Jewish man. The defense conceded Woodward killed Bernstein but claimed it was an act of provoked manslaughter, an argument the jury rejected. After more than six years of legal delays, the trial brought a painful chapter to a close for the Bernstein family, resulting in a life sentence for Woodward.</p>

          <h2>Eastern European Nations Consider Reinstating Land Mines on Russian Border</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to the perceived threat from Russia, five Eastern European NATO membersâ€”Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Polandâ€”have announced their withdrawal from the Ottawa Convention, a treaty banning anti-personnel land mines. The move would allow them to produce and deploy mines along their borders with Russia and Belarus as a deterrent. This plan, described as a new "Iron Curtain," is highly controversial due to the indiscriminate danger mines pose to civilians long after conflicts end. Proponents argue it is a necessary defensive measure against a significant existential threat.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani demonstrated his continued recovery as a pitcher by throwing two scoreless innings against the Kansas City Royals. During his outing, he recorded the fastest pitch of his Major League Baseball career, reaching 101.7 miles per hour. Despite his strong performance on the mound, Ohtani was unable to contribute offensively, going hitless in four at-bats. The Dodgers ultimately lost the game 9-5, ending their five-game winning streak, but Ohtani's progress in his return from elbow surgery remains a positive development.</p>

          <p>France has enacted a new nationwide ban on smoking in numerous public areas, including all beaches, public parks, and forests. The rules, which took effect on Sunday, also prohibit smoking near schools, libraries, and bus shelters, aiming to create a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032. The primary goal is to protect non-smokers, especially children, from the dangers of secondhand smoke, which is responsible for thousands of deaths annually in the country. Violators of the new law could face fines, although a grace period will be initially observed.</p>

          <p>Civil servants in various parts of China are increasingly avoiding dining out due to stringent, locally-imposed austerity measures that often go beyond central government regulations. This shift in lifestyle is a response to the political climate of "ceng ceng jia ma," or adding extra layers of control, where local authorities impose stricter rules to demonstrate compliance with anti-corruption and austerity drives. Officials fear that being seen in public dining establishments could attract unwanted scrutiny or be perceived as a violation of these ever-tightening rules, reflecting a pervasive sense of caution within the bureaucracy.</p>

          <h2>The Urban Heat Island Effect: Why Cities Feel Hotter During Heatwaves</h2>

          <p>As a heatwave affects the UK, this article explains the "urban heat island" phenomenon, which causes cities to be significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas. Dark surfaces like asphalt and buildings absorb and retain the sun's heat, while a lack of vegetation and water reduces natural cooling through evaporation. This effect can raise city temperatures by several degrees, particularly at night, exacerbating the health risks of heatwaves, such as dehydration and heat stroke. With global temperatures rising and urban populations growing, this phenomenon makes city dwellers increasingly vulnerable to extreme heat.</p>
