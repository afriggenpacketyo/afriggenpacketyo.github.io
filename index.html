The move intensifies competition with rivals such as Instacart and Walmart+. The service allows customers, including non-Prime members for a fee, to order perishable groceries alongside other items like electronics and household goods in a single cart. Amazon reports that in test markets, the convenience of adding fresh food has led to customers shopping twice as often.

          <p>Shares of AI data center provider CoreWeave fell by 17% after the company announced a second-quarter adjusted loss of 27 cents per share, exceeding analyst expectations. The stock decline also coincides with the upcoming expiration of its post-IPO lock-up period, which could introduce more volatility as insiders become eligible to sell shares. Despite the loss, CoreWeave reported that revenue more than tripled year-over-year to $1.21 billion, surpassing forecasts due to high demand for AI infrastructure. The company also raised its full-year revenue guidance, but some analysts expressed concern over delayed capital expenditures. (not investment advice)</p>

Investigators identified Bryan Miller, who had a prior juvenile record for a stabbing, as a person of interest. They confirmed his involvement by obtaining his DNA through an elaborate undercover sting at a restaurant. Miller, known locally for his 'Zombie Hunter' persona, was convicted and sentenced to death in 2023, though he maintains his innocence from death row.</p>

          <p>Investigators successfully captured a notorious killer responsible for the 1990s 'canal murders' in Phoenix through a clever undercover operation. Detective Clark Schwartzkopf posed as a security consultant and arranged a meeting with suspect Bryan Patrick Miller at a Chili's restaurant under the guise of a job offer. The goal was to covertly obtain Miller's DNA from a used drinking glass. Despite the detective's initial skepticism about the mild-mannered suspect, the DNA from the glass provided a perfect match to evidence from both crime scenes, leading to Miller's immediate arrest and eventual conviction.</p>

          <p>A jury has found Colorado dentist James Craig guilty of murdering his wife, Angela Craig, sentencing him to life in prison without parole. The prosecution argued that Craig poisoned his wife by lacing her protein shakes with substances like potassium cyanide and arsenic. The investigation began after a suspicious package containing cyanide arrived at his dental office, prompting a colleague to alert authorities. Evidence presented included Craig's online searches for undetectable poisons and a motive involving an affair and significant life insurance policies. The defense suggested Craig was suicidal himself, but the jury ultimately convicted him of first-degree murder.</p>

          <p>Residents in Fort Collins, Colorado, have reported sightings of rabbits with unsettling black, horn-like growths on their heads and faces. Wildlife officials have identified the cause as shope papillomavirus, a virus specific to rabbits that causes wart-like tumors. While the growths can look alarming, the virus is not transmissible to humans, pets, or other wildlife and typically does not harm the rabbits unless it obstructs their vision or ability to eat. The eerie appearance of the affected animals has led to online comparisons to zombies and aliens, and some folklorists believe these growths may have inspired the legend of the jackalope.</p>

In a social media post, the president had suggested the bank's CEO should get a new economist.

          <h2>California Governor Newsom Vows to Redraw Congressional Maps to Counter GOP</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 11:08:28 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced that the state will proceed with drawing new congressional maps, which he claims will help Democrats regain control of the U.S. House and 'end the Trump presidency.' This move is a direct response to Republican-led efforts in Texas to redraw maps in their favor, a process that could give the GOP several new seats. Newsom's announcement signals an escalation in the partisan battle over redistricting, with blue states threatening to retaliate against red-state gerrymandering. The California legislature is expected to release draft maps soon, potentially setting the stage for a high-stakes political fight.</p>

          <p>The German government has rejected allegations of censorship and restrictions on freedom of expression made in the U.S. State Department's 2024 Human Rights Report. A German government spokesperson asserted that the country maintains a very high level of free expression. The report has faced widespread criticism from human rights groups, who claim it has been politically altered by the Trump administration to align with its foreign policy goals. Critics point to its lenient treatment of allies like Israel and El Salvador and harsher criticism of countries with whom the administration has clashed, undermining its traditional credibility.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Gallup survey reveals that alcohol consumption among U.S. adults has fallen to its lowest level on record, with only 54% reporting that they drink. For the first time, a majority of Americans (53%) now believe that even moderate drinking is harmful to one's health, a significant increase from 45% last year. The decline is also reflected in drinking frequency, with the average weekly intake dropping to 2.8 drinks, the lowest since 1996. Researchers suggest this trend is driven by growing health awareness and is not linked to a shift toward alternatives like recreational cannabis.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is on track to become the first hurricane of the 2025 season. The storm developed west of the Cabo Verde islands, where it has already caused deadly flooding, and is moving westward. According to the National Hurricane Center, Erin is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane by Friday and could become a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean islands over the weekend. While it poses no immediate threat to the United States, its long-term path remains uncertain as the Atlantic hurricane season enters its peak months.</p>

          <p>New research reveals that Planned Parenthood provided care in over 1.5 million visits to Medicaid patients in 2024, underscoring its crucial role in the U.S. healthcare system. This role is now under threat due to a provision in a recent Republican spending package that bans the organization from receiving Medicaid reimbursements. Although temporarily blocked by a court, experts warn that if the ban is enacted, it could severely cripple the nation's healthcare safety net, particularly for low-income individuals seeking contraception and STI screenings. Opponents argue the move is a politically motivated attempt to shut down the organization over its abortion services.</p>

          <p>Germany's Interior Ministry reports that 1,337 Syrians have voluntarily returned to their home country since the ousting of President Bashar Assad in December 2024. The data, collected through the end of July, comes as the German government, under Chancellor Friedrich Merz, intensifies its focus on reducing immigration and increasing deportations. While encouraging voluntary returns, the government is also working towards organizing deportation flights for convicted criminals and potentially others. Germany suspended most new Syrian asylum applications in December to reassess the security situation in the post-Assad era.</p>

          <p>The state of California is legally challenging the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles, arguing it was an illegal use of military force in civilian life. State lawyers contend the deployment, initiated during protests against ICE operations, violated the Posse Comitatus Act and caused public anxiety. The federal government maintains the action was legal under Title 10, asserting the president had the authority to deploy troops to protect federal property and personnel during what was described as a 'rebellion.' The trial's outcome could have significant implications for presidential power and military involvement in domestic affairs.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, mandating improved conditions at an ICE holding facility in downtown Manhattan. The order requires ICE to provide detainees with sleeping mats, hygiene products, access to medication, and regular legal calls. It also places limits on the number of people who can be held at the site. The ruling follows a lawsuit from the ACLU and other advocates, who decried conditions as inhumane, citing video evidence of detainees sleeping on bare floors and a government admission that they received only two meals per day.</p>

          <p>Canada's new professional women's soccer league, the Northern Super League (NSL), is being highlighted as a potential blueprint for European leagues to follow. German player Lara Schenk, who plays for the Montreal Roses, praises the NSL for its professional structures and robust player protections, such as extended maternity leave and a ban on non-consensual transfers. The league, driven by former Canadian national team player Diana Matheson, was built with a long-term vision focused on creating stable, professional conditions. Schenk argues that smaller European leagues could learn from the NSL's commitment to standard contracts and minimum wages.</p>

Ibom Air stated the passenger's conduct posed a safety threat and that she attempted to use a fire extinguisher as a weapon.

          <p>Major technology companies, including Nvidia, AMD, and Apple, are engaging in unprecedented deals with the Trump administration to gain relief from tariffs. Nvidia and AMD secured permission to sell advanced chips to China in exchange for the U.S. government receiving a 15% share of their revenue from that market. Meanwhile, Apple announced a plan to increase its U.S. investment to $600 billion, a move seen as a successful bid to avoid tariffs on its products. Analysts suggest these deals highlight the significant financial pressure tariffs are placing on Big Tech, prompting a new era of direct negotiation. (not investment advice)</p>
