          <p>Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis came after a small nodule was found in the prostate, necessitating further evaluation. Biden's cancer is characterized by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone, indicating a more aggressive form of the disease. Despite the seriousness of the diagnosis, his office noted that the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management.</p>

BBC bosses reportedly considered Lineker's position untenable due to previous controversies over social media posts. Lineker had announced his departure from Match of the Day in November 2024 but was set to continue with FA Cup and World Cup coverage.</p>
