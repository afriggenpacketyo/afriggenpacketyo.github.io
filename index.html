          <p>Hurricane Imelda made landfall in Bermuda as a Category 2 storm, bringing powerful winds and heavy rainfall. The National Hurricane Center reported maximum sustained winds of 100 mph as the storm's center moved across the island. Bermuda's Minister of National Security, Michael Weeks, emphasized the seriousness of the threat, urging residents to take precautions. The storm is expected to weaken to an extratropical low-pressure system after passing Bermuda, but dangerous storm surges and life-threatening rip currents are anticipated along the U.S. East Coast.</p>

          <p>Taiwan has declined a U.S. proposal to locally manufacture half the semiconductor chips it currently supplies to the United States. Taiwan's top trade negotiator, Cheng Li-chiun, stated that discussions focused instead on tariff reductions and exemptions, not a production split. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick had advocated for the "50-50" plan to reduce American reliance on Taiwanese chip production, which currently meets 95% of U.S. demand. Taiwanese politicians condemned Lutnick's proposal, calling it an attempt to undermine the island's crucial technology sector and its "Silicon Shield" defense.</p>

          <p>The ongoing federal government shutdown poses an immediate threat to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), which serves nearly 7 million people. Unlike larger programs, WIC relies on annual appropriations and could face a crisis within two weeks without new funding. States are preparing to use contingency funds, but a prolonged shutdown could force WIC offices to prioritize pregnant and breastfeeding women, turning away pre-school-aged children. This disruption could have long-term negative impacts on child development and public health, despite the program's proven benefits.</p>

          <p>An Idaho state judge has blocked the release of graphic crime scene photos from the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students by Bryan Kohberger. The ruling cited the "extreme emotional distress" such images would cause the victims' families, outweighing public interest in the investigation details. While other investigative records, including videos of distraught friends, can be released, portions showing victims' bodies or surrounding blood must be blacked out. Kohberger pleaded guilty in July to the stabbings, receiving a life sentence without parole.</p>

          <p>French asset manager Amundi has significantly reduced its exposure to China's September equity rally, reallocating funds to dividend stocks due to persistent doubts about China's economic outlook. Philippe d’Orgeval, Amundi's deputy group chief investment officer, cited overvalued Chinese stocks and unsettled tariffs as reasons for trimming positions. The firm selectively increased onshore shares over Hong Kong-listed equities, focusing on the CSI 300 Dividend Index for safer plays. This article suggests Amundi remains open to rebuilding China exposure if macro conditions become more supportive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration froze approximately $26 billion in funds for projects in Democratic-leaning states on the first day of the federal government shutdown.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer accused the administration of using Americans as pawns for partisan aims. Vice President JD Vance warned of potential federal worker layoffs if the shutdown persists, impacting scientific research, financial oversight, and environmental cleanup efforts.</p>

Antoni, a conservative economist, had previously criticized the BLS, suggesting it suspend its monthly jobs report and calling its health insurance figures "phoney baloney."

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown debate includes a contentious dispute over healthcare for immigrants, with Republicans accusing Democrats of seeking free healthcare for undocumented individuals. Democrats, however, deny this, clarifying their proposal aims to restore Medicaid eligibility for immigrants with some form of legal status or government protection, as was the case before the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" restricted coverage. This act, signed by President Trump, significantly narrowed Medicaid access for groups like refugees and asylees. The Democratic plan would reverse these cuts, impacting roughly 1.4 million immigrants who are legally present in the U.S.</p>
