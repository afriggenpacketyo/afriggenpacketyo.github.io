            <p>A U.S. appeals court has ruled in favor of the New Orleans Saints in a trademark dispute over the fleur-de-lis symbol. Michel J Messier, claiming to be a descendant of French royalty, argued his family held intellectual property rights to the symbol. The court dismissed Messier's appeal, stating he failed to demonstrate any commercial interest or injury from the Saints' use of the trademark, which the team has used since 1967 and registered in 1974. The ruling affirms the Saints' right to use the fleur-de-lis on their merchandise and branding.</p>

            <p>Nvidia announced it expects to record a $5.5 billion charge related to the export of H20 graphics processing units to China and other destinations. The U.S. government has imposed new licensing requirements for these chips, citing concerns they could be used for military supercomputers. This development signals potential headwinds for Nvidia's growth, as China is a significant market for its products, though the company is working to comply with regulations. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has acknowledged growing competition in China, particularly from Huawei, and has moved some operations out of China following export controls in 2022.

The case has sparked controversy, particularly after El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele stated he would not return Abrego Garcia, who the U.S. government alleges is a member of MS-13.

            <p>With the tax deadline approaching, many Americans are seeking filing extensions. The IRS typically recommends filing early, but an extension provides an extra six months to complete the process. Taxpayers can request an extension online or by filing Form 4868. However, an extension only grants more time to file, not to pay; penalties apply for late payments. The IRS offers payment plans for those who cannot afford to pay on time.</p>

            <p>A proposed California law, named Wyland's Law, aims to close a gun loophole that allowed a man under a domestic violence restraining order to purchase a firearm and kill his 10-year-old son. The bill would require county courts to keep records proving they submitted restraining orders to the state and make those records accessible within one day. The goal is to prevent individuals subject to restraining orders from acquiring guns before the paperwork is fully processed. The bill is sponsored by the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.</p>

The ruling is a victory for the firm, which has fought back against Trump's actions.</p>

            <p>A Vox analysis argues that President Trump's actions exhibit a blend of authoritarian tactics reminiscent of both El Salvador's Nayib Bukele and Hungary's Viktor Orbán. Trump's treatment of migrants reflects Bukele's strongman approach, while efforts to influence universities resemble Orbán's subtle manipulation. However, the analysis suggests that this unstable mixture could backfire, inflaming resistance to Trump's policies and ultimately undermining his efforts to consolidate power.</p>
