          <p>US lawmakers have released a "birthday book" given to convicted financier Jeffrey Epstein in 2003, which contains a note allegedly signed by then-friend Donald Trump. The 238-page scrapbook, compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell, also includes contacts of royalty, politicians, and celebrities. The White House denies the alleged Trump note, which features a drawing of a woman's body, is authentic, stating the president did not draw or sign it. This release comes amid continued pressure for transparency regarding investigations into Epstein.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump's bilateral trade deals often feature large orders for Boeing aircraft, a recurring symbol in his negotiations. Experts suggest this trend is partly performative, providing high-profile statements of trade commitment and helping reduce bilateral trade surpluses with the U.S. Additionally, aircraft imports are less politically sensitive than other commodities and their long delivery windows offer financial flexibility. Beyond symbolism, the growing international tourism industry means these U.S.-made passenger jets are genuinely needed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The deadly stabbing of Iryna Zarutska, a Ukrainian refugee, on a Charlotte light rail last month has ignited a fierce debate about public safety and the justice system. The suspect, Decarlos Brown Jr., has a long history of criminal charges and psychiatric crises, leading critics to question why he was not kept off the streets. President Trump and other Republican officials have condemned the incident, blaming Democratic leadership and advocating for "law and order" policies. Charlotte's mayor, Vi Lyles, acknowledged the incident as a "tragic failure" by the courts, calling for bipartisan solutions for repeat offenders and mental health treatment.</p>

A University of Kansas analysis attributes this trend primarily to the high cost and demands of childcare, which often make working financially unviable for many families. This article highlights that mothers are frequently forced to choose between their careers and caring for their children due to insufficient policy support for caregivers.

          <p>Six whistleblowers, current and former Meta employees, allege the company covered up harm to children on its virtual reality devices and apps, including exposure to grooming, sexual assault, and violence. They claim Meta deleted or doctored internal safety research, with managers reportedly instructing staff to avoid research showing child harm. These revelations come as Meta faces ongoing scrutiny over child safety on its social media platforms. The whistleblowers are set to testify before a Senate subcommittee, with Senator Marsha Blackburn calling for legislation to establish guardrails on social media companies.</p>

          <p>John Elkann, chairman of Ferrari and Stellantis, has agreed to one year of community service and a joint payment of €183 million (£159 million) to Italian tax authorities to settle an inheritance tax dispute. The dispute involved allegations that Elkann and his siblings failed to declare approximately €1 billion in assets related to their grandmother's estate, claiming she was a Swiss resident. While the agreement does not include an admission of liability, it offers a swift resolution to the "painful affair." This article highlights that the settlement will also lead to the dismissal of criminal charges against his siblings.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest has sacked head coach Nuno Espirito Santo after 21 months, following a public deterioration of his relationship with owner Evangelos Marinakis. Nuno had guided the club to a seventh-place Premier League finish last season, securing European football for the first time in three decades, and signed a new three-year deal in June. However, internal tensions reportedly stemmed from disagreements over transfer business and the club's slow movement in the market. This article notes that despite his success on the pitch, the breakdown in his relationship with Marinakis ultimately led to his departure.</p>

          <p>The UK's Electoral Commission has admitted to significant security failures that allowed Chinese cyber spies undetected access to 40 million voters' private details for over a year. Chief executive Vijay Rangarajan acknowledged "enormous shock" and "painful lessons learned" from the 2021 breach, which took three years and over £250,000 to recover from. The hackers exploited a known Microsoft Exchange flaw, and the commission failed to implement basic security measures or heed warnings. This article highlights that while no election interference was detected, the incident exposed a dangerous complacency and has prompted a major overhaul of the commission's cybersecurity protocols.</p>

          <p>The ban on disposable vapes in the UK is failing to prevent millions of devices from being improperly discarded, continuing to cause significant problems for the waste industry, according to Roger Wright of Biffa. Despite the June ban, the number of vapes incorrectly mixed with general recycling has increased, partly due to the sale of large stocks and the introduction of cheap, "reusable" models that are often still treated as disposables. Vapes, containing lithium batteries, pose a fire hazard when crushed, costing the UK waste industry an estimated billion pounds annually. This article highlights concerns that the ban has inadvertently led to more diverse products, complicating recycling efforts.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes Donald Trump's consistent use of violent rhetoric, contrasting his public pursuit of a Nobel Peace Prize with his "swaggering machismo." Recent examples include a meme threatening "war" on Chicago and a proposed rebranding of the Defense Department to the "Department of War." The analysis suggests that while Trump may not intend literal war, he is drawn to its imagery, and his language normalizes brutality. Critics argue that such rhetoric, coupled with the deployment of military forces domestically, reflects an "imperial boomerang" effect, where tools of repression used overseas are turned against the domestic population.</p>
