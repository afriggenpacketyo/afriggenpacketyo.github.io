          <p>A fireworks warehouse in Yolo County, Northern California, experienced multiple explosions and a resulting fire, leaving seven people currently unaccounted for. The incident prompted mandatory evacuations for a one-mile radius, though some residents have since returned. The fire spread to approximately 80 acres of grass, with the initial explosion occurring around 5:50 p.m. local time. Two individuals sustained injuries, and authorities are actively working to determine the whereabouts of those missing.</p>

          <p>Tesla announced a 14% year-over-year decline in vehicle deliveries for the second quarter, marking its second consecutive quarterly drop. The company delivered approximately 384,000 vehicles, falling slightly short of analyst expectations but still causing a nearly 5% rise in stock value as fears were less severe than anticipated. Increased competition from other EV manufacturers and a flattening demand for electric vehicles are cited as factors. CEO Elon Musk's political involvement has also reportedly contributed to brand damage impacting sales.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will face a no-confidence vote in the European Parliament next week, largely stemming from criticisms regarding transparency over COVID-19 vaccine deals. Romanian MEP Gheorghe Piperea initiated the motion, specifically citing von der Leyen's text messages with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla. While the vote is expected to fail due to a lack of broad support, requiring an absolute majority of 361 votes, it underscores growing frustration within Brussels. The motion is seen as primarily symbolic, despite the potential for the entire Commission to resign if successful.</p>

          <p>A federal court has ruled against President Donald Trump's proclamation declaring an "invasion" at the US-Mexico border, deeming his suspension of asylum access unlawful. US District Judge Randolph Moss sided with asylum seekers and immigrant rights groups, asserting the President exceeded his authority and cannot unilaterally adopt an alternative immigration system. The ruling, while not immediately effective, requires the administration to renew processing asylum claims if it holds. This decision marks a significant legal challenge to the administration's stringent immigration policies, which have left many migrants stranded.</p>

Hispanic consumers, who comprise roughly half of Constellation's U.S. beer sales, are reportedly spending less due to concerns about immigration enforcement and potential job losses. While the company reiterated its full-year outlook, the impact of these policies and rising aluminum costs from Trump's tariffs continue to pose challenges.</p>

          <p>The Mexican corrido band Los Alegres del Barranco has reached an agreement with authorities to suspend a criminal investigation, months after facing backlash for projecting an alleged drug cartel leader's image during a concert. The band agreed to release an anti-narcocorrido track, "El Consejo," and enter a six-month probationary period, including checking in with authorities and speaking to incarcerated youth. This resolution comes after the U.S. State Department revoked their visas, leading to cancelled U.S. shows, with officials citing their stance against those who "extol criminals."</p>

          <p>Members of Parliament in the UK have voted to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist organization, a move that will make supporting the direct action group a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The order, which also includes two white supremacist groups, is expected to come into effect soon, though legal action is underway to temporarily block it. The government asserts Palestine Action meets the criteria for terrorism due to "atrocious acts" and increased "frequency and severity" of actions, including property damage. Critics argue it criminalizes civil disobedience rather than actual terrorism.</p>

This could lead to the closure of nearly 200 health centers, affecting over 1.1 million patients who rely on Planned Parenthood for various services.

          <p>A federal judge in Brooklyn has blocked the Trump administration's plan to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of Haitian migrants this fall. The ruling asserts that the Homeland Security Secretary lacks the authority to prematurely terminate Haiti's TPS designation, which was extended until February 2026 by the previous administration. This decision ensures that Haitian migrants currently enrolled in the program will retain their legal status and work permits. The White House has announced it will appeal the ruling, arguing that district courts lack authority to interfere with executive immigration powers.</p>
