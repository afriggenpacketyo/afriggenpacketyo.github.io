            <p>Kilmar Ábrego García, a Maryland resident, was mistakenly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, leading to legal challenges and political scrutiny. A judge has demanded his return, but El Salvador's president claims he lacks the power to do so, while the Trump administration alleges Ábrego García has gang ties, a claim disputed by the judge. Senator Chris Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador to investigate the wrongful deportation, seeking answers and advocating for Ábrego García's return, but was initially denied access to him. The senator claims the El Salvador government had no evidence of gang involvement, despite Trump's claims.</p>

            <p>A new study reveals that while fewer Americans are attending church services and identifying with a religion, belief in God remains relatively stable. The research indicates a move towards individualized spirituality, with people shaping their own faith outside of traditional institutions. Political values, particularly on issues like same-sex marriage, are a significant factor in the decline of church attendance. Researchers argue this isn't secularization, but a shift in how people practice faith, emphasizing personal expression over formal affiliation.</p>

            <p>South Korea's central bank maintained its policy rate at 2.75% as the nation navigates U.S. tariffs and prepares for a presidential election following the removal of Yoon Suk Yeol from office.

The trade data emerges as Japan engages in trade negotiations with the U.S., with discussions focusing on tariffs, military support costs, and trade fairness. A weaker yen and the fear of tariffs could boost exports, but China-made goods are replacing Japanese exports. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Emily Ley, owner of Simplified, a Florida-based stationery business, is suing the Trump administration over tariffs on goods imported from China. Ley argues that the tariffs, which have cost her business nearly $1.2 million, are illegal due to a lack of Congressional approval and threaten the viability of her company. She fears she may have to raise prices or eliminate jobs due to the increased costs, and argues the U.S. lacks the infrastructure to produce the planners domestically.</p>

The initiative aims to help two million people receive faster, more convenient care locally by the end of 2025/26. GPs will collaborate more closely with specialists to access expert advice for conditions like IBS and menopause, with the goal of diverting treatments from hospitals into the community.</p>

            <p>China is encouraging its retirees to spend their savings on domestic tourism to offset the economic impact of tariffs imposed by President Trump. Initiatives like the "silver train" are designed to take older travelers to less-developed rural areas and small towns to boost local economies. With a growing aging population and economic uncertainty, the government is seeking to increase domestic consumption by providing retirees with opportunities to travel and spend their money.</p>

            <p>A new CDC study indicates that autism prevalence has increased to 1 in 31 children, or more than 3% of kids. HHS Secretary Kennedy Jr. cited these figures to support his claim of a growing autism "epidemic," while experts emphasize improved screening and access to services. The study's authors noted higher prevalence among Asian, Black, and Hispanic children compared to White children, potentially due to disparities in factors like preterm birth and lead poisoning. Kennedy claims an environmental toxin causes autism, a claim that has been refuted by some.</p>
