            <p>A report by the European Chamber of Commerce in China reveals that China's "Made in China 2025" plan, aimed at achieving self-sufficiency in technology, has missed several key targets. While the country has exceeded expectations in the automotive sector, it has struggled to reach its goals in aerospace, high-end robotics, and manufacturing value-added growth. The initiative has also fostered unhealthy industrial competition and increased global security concerns due to overcapacity and the push to move up the manufacturing value chain.

The SeaCURE project processes seawater to extract carbon dioxide, which is then concentrated and stored, before returning the low-carbon water to the sea. The project aims to determine whether this method is a more efficient way to capture carbon than extracting it directly from the air. While the current project removes a small amount of CO2, proponents believe it has the potential to be scaled up significantly.</p>
