          <p>A new report from the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC) indicates that the Wagner Group systematically used military equipment supplied to Mali's armed forces. Evidence, including photographs and interviews, suggests this involved armored vehicles, machine guns, and drones from various countries, potentially violating international arms treaties. Following Wagner's official disbandment, its operations were taken over by Russia's Africa Corps, which is believed to be continuing similar practices with many of the same personnel. The Malian government has not officially responded to the allegations of diverting military hardware.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has called off the planned deployment of federal agents to San Francisco following a direct phone call from Mayor Daniel Lurie and lobbying from local tech CEOs. Trump stated on social media that he based the decision on requests from "friends of mine" and because the mayor asked "very nicely." The incident has raised concerns about the arbitrary nature of deploying federal forces, suggesting such decisions are based on personal relationships rather than objective criteria. While the immediate crisis is averted for San Francisco, the president's statement implies the city is on a trial basis.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, is facing a barrage of attacks characterized by racism and Islamophobia from opponents, including former governor Andrew Cuomo. Cuomo and others have labeled Mamdani a "terrorist sympathizer" and used manipulated imagery, drawing condemnation for their tactics. Despite the vitriol and opposition from wealthy donors, Mamdani has maintained a composed response, which some political observers believe is strengthening his grassroots support. The campaign's tone highlights deep-seated biases and the personal nature of the attacks against the city's potential first Muslim mayor.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new California law, effective January 1, will allow the year-round hunting of non-native mute swans, classifying them as an invasive species alongside starlings and English sparrows. Wildlife officials argue the measure is necessary because the large, aggressive birds damage fragile wetland ecosystems and displace native waterfowl. Mute swans, introduced in the 1800s for ornamental purposes, consume large amounts of aquatic vegetation and can pose a threat to people and pets. While supported by conservation groups, the law has been criticized as inhumane by animal advocacy organizations.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown extends into its fourth week, federal employees are experiencing increasing financial and psychological stress, with many about to miss their first full paycheck. Workers from agencies like the TSA and EPA report growing desperation, forcing them to seek side jobs or liquidate assets to survive. The political stalemate in Washington continues, with House Speaker Mike Johnson and Democrats deadlocked over a budget deal involving healthcare subsidies. The situation is exacerbated by threats from the Trump administration to withhold back pay and enact cuts to federal programs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, has become a site of intense protests, with federal agents reportedly using aggressive tactics against demonstrators. Reverend Quincy Worthington described witnessing agents deploy pepper spray, pepper balls, and physical force against peaceful protesters, including a fellow pastor who was photographed being sprayed in the face. Despite the escalating and terrifying response from law enforcement, Worthington says his faith compels him to continue attending the protests to stand against what he views as human rights violations. A temporary restraining order now prevents ICE from using chemical munitions at that location.</p>

          <p>A new federal law imposing significant cuts and new work requirements on Medicaid is causing anxiety in the rural South, particularly in Louisiana's East Carroll Parish. Since Louisiana expanded Medicaid in 2016, its uninsured rate dropped, providing a crucial lifeline in high-poverty areas. The changes, set to take effect in 2027, are projected to cause millions nationwide to lose coverage, with states facing a massive administrative burden to implement new reporting systems.

The aircraft is designed to operate without runways, GPS, or constant communication, making it resilient to a potential first strike by China, which has developed long-range missiles to target U.S. airfields. The X-BAT utilizes an onboard autonomy system called Hivemind to navigate, identify threats, and engage targets, though a human operator retains the final decision on using lethal force.

          <p>The Trump administration's intense military buildup targeting Venezuela's regime, including strikes on alleged drug boats and authorizing CIA operations, contradicts the president's "America First" non-interventionist promises. This analysis suggests the aggressive policy is driven by internal White House dynamics, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio's hardline stance prevailing over more pragmatic approaches focused on oil deals. Rubio's influence, combined with a desire to reassert U.S. dominance in Latin America and appeal to key voter demographics, has pushed the administration toward a confrontational strategy that risks escalating into a wider conflict aimed at toppling the Maduro government.</p>

The quest for a mate is perilous for the males, as females are known to eat their suitors before or after mating.

This move reflects Microsoft's broader focus on making its games available across multiple platforms and promoting its Game Pass subscription service, rather than relying on console exclusivity. While some Xbox loyalists have criticized the decision, many fans and industry observers see it as a positive step for gamers and the industry.</p>

          <p>Summer McKesson took a 23andMe DNA test hoping to understand the genetic basis for her rare and life-threatening blood clotting disorder, but instead discovered a shocking family secret. The results revealed she had seven half-siblings and that her biological father was Dr. Charles Peete, her mother's fertility doctor at Duke University in the 1980s. Peete had secretly used his own sperm to inseminate multiple patients without their consent over decades, a practice known as fertility fraud. The discovery has connected numerous families and raised critical questions about medical ethics and the lack of regulation in the fertility industry.</p>

          <p>President Trump has terminated trade negotiations with Canada, a move that experts warn could impact U.S. consumer prices for goods like cars, auto parts, and home appliances. The decision was reportedly a response to a Canadian TV ad that used a Ronald Reagan speech to criticize high tariffs. The halt in talks could prolong steep U.S. tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, key materials in many manufactured products, leading to higher costs for producers and consumers. With the USMCA trade agreement up for review next year, this breakdown raises concerns about future trade relations. (not investment advice)</p>

Critics have condemned his remarks as divisive, though a recent survey suggests a majority of respondents agree with his sentiment. During a visit to Potsdam, Merz linked his government's efforts to combat illegal immigration to the "problem in how our cities look," a statement he later clarified was aimed at migrants without legal status.

          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has rejected an offer from US President Donald Trump to resume negotiations on its nuclear program, calling any pre-determined agreement an "imposition." The rejection comes after the reinstatement of all UN sanctions against Iran and a recent 12-day conflict with Israel and the US over its nuclear facilities. While Iran has stated it no longer considers cooperation with the IAEA necessary, experts believe the leadership is trying to buy time and avoid actions that could provoke a major military strike.

          <p>Social media claims that Germany has canceled its Christmas markets for 2025 are false, according to a fact-check. While a few small, local markets have been called off for reasons like renovations or low revenue, the vast majority of Germany's over 2,500 markets are scheduled to proceed as planned. The viral claims appear to originate from a single, unreliable article that misrepresented information and used sensationalist language. Although security costs for markets have risen since past terror attacks, this has not led to widespread cancellations of the popular seasonal tradition.</p>
