        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Christian counselor is challenging Colorado's law banning "conversion therapy" for minors, arguing it violates free speech by censoring conversations about gender identity and sexual orientation. The state defends the ban as a regulation of professional conduct to protect minors from harmful and ineffective practices. The Supreme Court's arguments centered on whether the counselor's talk therapy constitutes protected speech or regulatable conduct, a distinction that will be crucial to the case's outcome. The decision could have significant implications for similar laws in over 20 other states and the broader regulation of healthcare practices.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the idea that happiness stems from contentment rather than the accumulation of wealth, drawing lessons from the author's new book. It argues that appreciating the ordinary, managing expectations, and recognizing that psychological wealth is more valuable than material possessions are key to a fulfilling life. The author contrasts billionaires with his grandmother-in-law, who lived near poverty but was exceptionally happy because she wanted less than she had. The central message is that true richness is achieved when one can say "this is enough," regardless of their financial status.</p>

          <p>Israel is holding solemn memorial events to mark the second anniversary of the October 7th Hamas attack, which killed 1,200 people and resulted in numerous hostages. The anniversary occurs as the devastating war in Gaza continues, with a death toll exceeding 67,000, and as families of the remaining 48 captives push for a peace deal. Indirect negotiations, spurred by a U.S.-backed proposal, are ongoing in Egypt, with international pressure mounting on both sides to agree to a ceasefire. The main memorial event, organized by bereaved families, reflects deep divisions over Prime Minister Netanyahu's leadership.</p>

This deal values Polymarket at approximately $8 billion and signals a growing mainstream acceptance of prediction markets, which are seen as a competitor to the sports gambling industry. Polymarket, which recently received approval to launch in the U.S., aims to combine its consumer-focused approach with ICE's institutional scale. The investment highlights the potential for significant growth in the prediction markets sector over the coming years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Canadian minerals explorer Trilogy Metals skyrocketed after the White House announced it was taking a 10% stake in the company through a $35.6 million investment. The move is part of a U.S. initiative to secure domestic supply chains for critical minerals like copper, cobalt, and zinc, which are vital for energy, defense, and manufacturing. This partnership reverses a previous administration's decision and grants permits for the Ambler mining district project in Alaska.

          <p>After a weekend of cryptic social media posts teasing a new product, Tesla's stock fell following the announcement of a cheaper, stripped-down version of its Model Y SUV. The initial hype had caused shares to jump over 5% on Monday, but the stock reversed course after the reveal. This new Model Y variant will reportedly use less premium materials to compensate for the loss of federal tax credits. The announcement follows a recent report of a 7% year-over-year increase in third-quarter EV deliveries, which was partially attributed to the expiring tax credit.</p>

          <p>With the S&P 500 continuing to set record highs, some financial experts are advising investors to look beyond the popular index for better diversification and protection against a potential pullback. They argue that the market-cap-weighted index is heavily concentrated in a few large technology companies, creating an "illusion of safety" and increasing volatility risk. To mitigate this, advisors suggest considering total market index funds, which include small- and mid-cap stocks, or equal-weighted S&P 500 funds. The goal is to build a more balanced portfolio that can perform well even during periods when the large-cap index underperforms. (not investment advice)</p>

The turmoil intensified after his fifth prime minister in less than two years resigned, and two former prime ministers, including once-loyal ally Gabriel Attal, publicly criticized his leadership. Macron's decision to dissolve parliament in June 2024 backfired, leading to a fragmented assembly that has consistently brought down his minority governments.

          <p>Startups are remaining private for longer periods, with the median age for a company going public now at 13 years, up from 10 years in 2018. This trend is largely attributed to the massive growth of alternative capital sources like venture capital, private equity, and sovereign wealth funds, which provide ample funding without the regulatory burdens of being a public company. As a result, companies are more mature and have significantly higher revenues by the time they launch an IPO. While this allows early-stage investors to capture more growth, some analysts question if the flood of private capital will diminish future returns.</p>

Experts note that while the number of sightings is normal for this time of year, the invasive harlequin ladybird is most likely to be found indoors. A warm spring and summer led to a boom in aphid populations, the ladybirds' primary food source, which in turn caused their numbers to surge.</p>

          <p>While air travel is not immediately impacted by the government shutdown, a prolonged impasse could lead to significant disruptions. Most FAA and TSA employees, including air traffic controllers and airport screeners, are deemed essential and must work without pay. However, past shutdowns have shown that if the situation persists for weeks, an increase in "sick calls" from unpaid staff can lead to labor shortages, resulting in longer security lines and flight delays. The U.S. Travel Association warns that a shutdown could cost the travel economy $1 billion a week and halt the hiring and training of new air traffic controllers.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive analysis on the second anniversary of the Israel-Hamas war details a systematic and brutal conflict that has expanded regionally and resulted in over 67,000 deaths in Gaza. Israel's campaign to destroy Hamas has involved the destruction of vast amounts of infrastructure and has led to accusations of genocide from U.N. bodies and human rights groups, which Israel vehemently denies. The conflict has broadened with Israeli military actions in Lebanon, Syria, and Iran. Concurrently, the Trump administration is pushing a 20-point peace plan that proposes a new technocratic Palestinian government, with negotiations currently underway in Egypt.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ghana is facing a critical healthcare challenge due to the high demand for organ transplants, particularly for kidneys and corneas, and the absence of a legal framework to regulate donations. A kidney transplant can cost up to $50,000, an unaffordable sum for most citizens, while thousands risk irreversible blindness due to a shortage of corneal surgeons and donors. A proposed Organ and Tissue Donation Bill aims to establish a regulatory authority, create a national registry, and ensure ethical and equitable access, but it has been slow to pass. The situation is compounded by a medical brain drain and the risk of illegal organ harvesting syndicates.</p>

          <p>The CDC has officially adopted recommendations for updated COVID vaccines for everyone over six months old, a move that should improve access for children covered by the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program. However, the decision was delayed for months, creating a gap in availability during a critical vaccination window and compounding persistent access issues and misinformation. Providers in some states were unable to order any pediatric COVID vaccines without the official recommendation. Health experts worry that the delay and confusing messaging from health officials will further suppress already low vaccination rates among children, who can still face severe outcomes from the virus.</p>

          <p>When deciding between traditional (pretax) and Roth 401(k) contributions, many people compare their current marginal tax rate to their expected future rate, but one financial planner argues this is a mistake. He suggests that savers should instead consider their effective tax rate—the total tax paid as a percentage of total income—which is often much lower than the marginal rate. Because of how progressive tax brackets and deductions work, one's effective tax rate in retirement may be significantly lower than anticipated. This calculation could make pretax contributions more advantageous than commonly thought, allowing for tax planning opportunities like Roth conversions later. (not investment advice)</p>

The union urges players to seek legal advice before signing any contracts, noting that detailed information about the competition is still lacking and it has not yet received regulatory approval from World Rugby. R360 aims to attract top male and female stars with large contracts and a condensed schedule. However, securing World Rugby ratification will require compliance with international release windows, and several major nations have policies that would make players in the new league ineligible for their national teams.</p>
