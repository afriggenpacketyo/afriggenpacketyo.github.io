          <p>Elon Musk, expressing a subdued tone, indicated he would scale back his involvement with the federal government, though he would continue advocating for lower tariffs to the Trump administration. This comes after a period where Musk was highly influential in Washington, driving significant changes across the government. He acknowledged that President Trump's receptiveness to his advice was uncertain. Musk's influence had previously drawn both praise and criticism, marking a shift from his earlier, more assertive stance in governmental affairs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments in a case involving parents seeking the right to opt their children out of LGBTQ storybooks used in Maryland public schools.

          <p>Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders and the state's GOP congressional delegation are urging President Trump to reconsider the denial of federal disaster relief following severe storms in March. FEMA denied the state's request, citing insufficient damage to warrant federal assistance. This denial follows similar rejections for disaster relief in Washington and North Carolina, raising concerns about the federal government's responsiveness to state-level emergencies. Trump has previously criticized FEMA, suggesting states should handle disaster relief independently.</p>

          <p>A bill in California, proposed by Assemblymember Lisa Calderon, aims to reduce energy credits for homeowners with rooftop solar panels, sparking protests and debate. Calderon argues the bill promotes equity by reducing costs for non-solar users, while solar owners and environmental groups claim it undermines long-term incentives for renewable energy. The bill has garnered support from utility companies and electrical worker unions but faces strong opposition from solar advocates. The outcome of the bill could significantly impact the rooftop solar industry and energy policy in California.</p>

          <p>England's NHS safety watchdog, the Health Services Safety Investigations Body, has warned that extreme tiredness and exhaustion among NHS staff pose a significant risk to patients. Common problems associated with fatigued staff include medication errors, impaired decision-making, and rude behavior. The watchdog cited examples of mistakes being made with pregnancy scans and chemotherapy drugs, and emphasized the need for better systems to monitor fatigue and raise awareness about the issue within the NHS. The watchdog said exhaustion was also a risk to staff themselves with some complaining of nodding off at the wheel on the way home and reports of staff dying in road accidents after work.</p>
