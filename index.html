        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The rise of SkinnyTok, a corner of the internet where thin women promote restrictive eating habits, is examined in this article. The trend has sparked controversy, with some condemning it as promoting eating disorders, while others find it refreshingly honest. The author explores the backlash against the body-positivity movement and the influence of weight-loss drugs like Ozempic, noting that SkinnyTok's emphasis on being small and traditionally feminine has political undertones. Despite the potential health risks, some women are drawn to SkinnyTok because they feel it offers a more truthful reflection of societal preferences for thinness.</p>

          <p>New York City Comptroller Brad Lander was arrested while protesting ICE's actions at a federal courthouse, sparking debate about authoritarianism and the defense of democracy. The article details Lander's arrest and the broader context of protests against ICE tactics in Los Angeles, where citizens have reported being detained based on their appearance. The piece contrasts the Democratic establishment's tepid support for these protests with the urgency of defending inalienable rights, suggesting a need for stronger action against authoritarianism. It emphasizes that defending liberty can be messy, referencing historical examples like the Boston Tea Party, and calls for Democrats to prioritize saving democracy over preserving the status quo.</p>

          <p>A Fox News opinion piece accuses legacy media outlets of bias for allegedly downplaying a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on former President Joe Biden's mental fitness. The author contrasts this with the extensive coverage given to the House Special Committee on the January 6 attack, claiming the media prioritizes hearings that align with Democratic objectives. The piece highlights the absence of broadcast network coverage of the Biden hearing and quotes Sean Spicer's criticism of the media's lack of curiosity about Biden's failures. The author argues that the media's actions underscore the importance of conservative and independent media in covering stories that liberals want to bury.</p>

The article details the alleged actions of Vance Luther Boelter, who is accused of attacking Democratic officials, and the spread of disinformation following the incident. It criticizes Senator Mike Lee for using the tragedy to attack Governor Tim Walz and argues that both Boelter and Lee embody parallel lives influenced by Trump. The article suggests that the tragedy reveals the depravity of those who worship at the shrine of Trump, contrasting Boelter's unraveling life with Lee's moral failings.</p>

          <p>This article discusses Donald Trump's increasing commercialization of politics during his second term, exemplified by the launch of Trump Mobile, a Trump-branded mobile phone service. The author argues that Trump is blurring the lines between business and politics, treating the presidency as a brand-franchise. The article highlights other Trump-branded products and ventures, including real estate projects and various merchandise items, and notes that these activities reinforce Trump's political persona among his supporters. The author concludes that Trump is turning political fandom into money, and that his actions are not seen as damaging by his base.</p>

          <p>The author argues that a war with Iran would be perilous to American democracy, given Donald Trump's increasing control over law enforcement and the military. The article suggests that Trump could use a state of war to strengthen his dictatorial control at home, suppress dissent, and violate the rights of citizens. The author also raises concerns about the global implications of a Trump-led intervention, arguing that it would further the interests of anti-liberalism. The piece concludes that the United States is at risk of becoming a military dictatorship, and war with Iran would likely hasten its demise.</p>

This change of position occurred after Donald Trump disputed her earlier claims, stating that intelligence indicated Iran possessed a significant amount of material and could develop a nuclear weapon within months. Gabbard's initial testimony has faced criticism, with Trump dismissing her statements. The US president said he believes Iran were "very close to having a weapon" and his country would not allow that to happen.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom's podcast, "This is Gavin Newsom," has drawn attention for featuring a single-use plastic water bottle, despite Newsom's administration battling over a landmark single-use plastic law. Environmentalists and waste advocates have been critical of Newsom's efforts to scale back SB 54, the state's single-use plastic recycling law. The presence of the plastic water bottle has been seen as an ironic and disappointing contrast to Newsom's previous stance on plastic pollution. The governor's office has defended the situation, but environmentalists remain concerned about his commitment to reducing plastic waste.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are facing criticism for their initial silence regarding immigration raids in Los Angeles, despite the team's strong Latino fan base. After community pressure, the team announced a $1 million commitment to families impacted by the raids. The article argues that the Dodgers, as a team with a history of breaking racial barriers and fostering diversity, have a responsibility to take a leading role in supporting their community. The author calls on the team to summon the moral courage of their past and set an example for other sports organizations.</p>

          <p>This article explores possible motives for the Minnesota rampage by examining the suspect's religious background and views on abortion. Investigators are examining notebooks belonging to the suspect, Vance Luther Boelter, containing detailed notes on dozens of other presumed targets that included Democratic public officials and abortion rights supporters. Scholars suggest that the rampage may be linked to anti-abortion violence and its ties to conservative Evangelical Christian movements. The suspect's apparent connection with the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR), a fast-growing strand of Evangelical Christianity, may shed light on his motives, as the movement frequently invokes the terminology and imagery of war when discussing political and spiritual enemies, including those who support abortion rights.</p>

While the plan is ambitious, some experts caution that the government would need to hire qualified professionals who could interpret it for patients.</p>

          <p>Japan's proactive measures to secure its supply chain offer a valuable lesson as China imposes export restrictions on rare earth elements. After experiencing a targeted export ban in 2010, Japan diversified its sources, invested in non-China rare-earth projects like Australia's Lynas, and implemented stockpiling and recycling initiatives. As a result, Japan's dependence on Chinese rare earths has significantly decreased. This approach highlights the importance of a comprehensive government and industry strategy to tackle China's mineral dominance and secure supply chains.</p>
