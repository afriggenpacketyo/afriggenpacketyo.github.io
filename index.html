        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a right-wing historian, has been elected as Poland's new president, narrowly defeating Warsaw's liberal mayor Rafal Trzaskowski. Nawrocki's victory is a turnaround from initial exit polls that favored Trzaskowski. As president, Nawrocki is expected to use his veto power to challenge Prime Minister Donald Tusk's pro-EU agenda, potentially re-energizing the national conservative Law and Justice opposition party. He supports traditional Catholic values, Polish sovereignty within the EU, and continued support for Ukraine, but opposes the country joining NATO and the EU during Russia's ongoing aggression. The largely ceremonial role of Poland's president still carries influence through veto powers. </p>
