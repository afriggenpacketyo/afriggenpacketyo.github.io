            <p>The Nasdaq Composite experienced its second-best day ever, surging over 12% as markets rebounded following President Trump's temporary tariff pause. The tech-heavy index saw its best session since January 2001, fueled by a broad market rally. Apple led the charge, soaring more than 15% after a recent slump that briefly saw Microsoft reclaim the title of the most valuable company. Trump's announcement of a 90-day tariff pause for some countries spurred the market's recovery. (not investment advice)</p>

Tariffs are taxes on goods bought from other countries, typically a percentage of the product's value. Trump argues that tariffs will boost US manufacturing and protect jobs, but economists warn that the move could harm the world economy and push up prices for consumers in the US and around the globe. The UK, Argentina, Australia, Brazil and Saudi Arabia are among the countries whose goods face a minimum 10% tariff.</p>

            <p>US shares have rocketed after US President Donald Trump said he would suspend higher tariffs on goods from most countries, and instead impose a 10% import tax rate. The White House said it was backing off on steeper levies for trade partners that had agreed to negotiate, although Trump said he would raise tariffs on goods from China even further, to at least 125% "effective immediately". The S&P 500 soared 7% in afternoon trading and was on course for one of its best days in years, after days of market turmoil amid dire warnings of an economic recession sparked by the trade war.</p>

            <p>The fintech sector is rallying Wednesday following the Trump administration's announcement of a 90-day pause on planned tariffs. Affirm was up 20%, Toast and Block rose 13% and PayPal increased 10%. The 90-day pause doesn't eliminate the threat of tariffs — it just delays it. Investors are still pricing in risk, including inflation, discretionary pullbacks, hardware import costs and credit exposure. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>All member countries of the European Union except Hungary voted Wednesday in favor of proposals that would impose tariffs on specific U.S. products sold into Europe, starting next week. The vote came just hours before President Trump said on social media that he would pause tariffs on most countries for 90 days but would immediately hike tariffs on China to 125%. The proposals were first published on Monday by the European Commission, the EU's executive branch that coordinates trading policy for the bloc. They were adopted at a meeting in Brussels on Wednesday, hours after drastic 20% tariffs on almost all European goods took effect.</p>

            <p>The federal tax deadline is less than one week away — and there's still time to collect a pandemic-era IRS stimulus check. It's your final chance to do so. If you're unsure if you received the money, there's a simple way to check via your IRS account online, tax experts say. The 2021 stimulus payments were worth up to $1,400 per individual, or $2,800 per married couple. A family of four could receive up to $5,600 with two eligible dependents.</p>

            <p>The price of electric vehicles in the U.S. will likely rise due to the Trump administration’s new tariffs, potentially jeopardizing California’s ambitious climate goals. Over the past month, the Trump administration announced it will impose tariffs against many of the U.S.’ largest trading partners, across a range of imported goods. Electric vehicles could be especially susceptible to price increases. The California Air Resources Board adopted a rule in 2022 to require an increasing percentage of new car sales to be zero-emission vehicles over the next decade.</p>
