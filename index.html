        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japanese automaker Honda reported a 50% decrease in its first-quarter operating profit, falling short of market expectations. The decline is primarily attributed to the financial impact of U.S. auto tariffs and a strengthening yen, which affects the value of its overseas earnings. Despite the downturn, Honda raised its full-year profit forecast, anticipating a weaker yen and planning to mitigate tariff impacts by increasing production within the United States. The company's motorcycle division, however, posted a record quarterly profit, showcasing strength in other market segments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a series of postponements, Shakira delivered a high-energy spectacle at her Los Angeles concert, part of her "Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran" tour. The performance was characterized by elaborate production, frequent costume changes, and impressive choreography, though some critics noted sound quality issues within the SoFi stadium. The show heavily featured her recent commercial hits centered on themes of female empowerment following her public separation, with only a few nods to her earlier rock-influenced music. The article highlights her focus on entertainment spectacle over political or social commentary, despite the concert's initial delay being linked to local security concerns.</p>

          <p>Mining and commodity trading giant Glencore has concluded a review of its stock market listing, deciding to remain on the London Stock Exchange rather than move to New York. The company stated that a shift would not be value-accretive for shareholders at this time, providing a significant boost to the London market, which has recently lost other major firms. This decision was announced alongside its half-year results, which revealed a net loss of $655 million amid lower commodity prices and U.S. tariff uncertainty. Glencore also launched a $1 billion cost-cutting program to improve its financial performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk reported a 67% surge in second-quarter sales for its popular weight-loss drug, Wegovy, reaching 19.53 billion Danish kroner. Despite this strong growth, the figure fell slightly below analyst expectations, and the company's stock saw a minor dip. Novo Nordisk reiterated its full-year outlook but has been contending with softer U.S. sales due to competition and pressure from the White House to lower drug prices. The company also announced cost-cutting measures and a leadership change to sharpen its commercial execution amid these challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The BBC has begun broadcasting a new series of MasterChef that was filmed before its hosts, Gregg Wallace and John Torode, were dismissed following an investigation that upheld misconduct complaints against them. The decision to air the show has drawn criticism, though the BBC stated it was for the benefit of the contestants who participated. The new episodes have reportedly been edited to minimize the hosts' presence and banter, and one contestant was removed at her own request. The controversy stems from a report upholding numerous complaints against Wallace and a separate complaint against Torode.</p>

With Norris closing the points gap to Piastri, the teammates have dominated the season, winning 11 of the 14 races so far. Brown acknowledged that they will likely "swap paint again" but believes the mutual respect and open communication within the team will prevent their rivalry from turning hostile. He stated that the team will address any tensions immediately to maintain a healthy relationship, which is crucial for their long-term success together.</p>

          <p>Supporters of the Sheffield Wednesday football club are voicing their anguish over the club's severe financial crisis under owner Dejphon Chansiri. The club has been plagued by late payments to tax authorities and staff, transfer embargoes, and the closure of a stadium stand due to safety issues. Fans describe the situation as "mentally exhausting" and are urging Chansiri to sell the club, believing his valuation is too high and that he is destroying the club's legacy. With the team's future in jeopardy, supporters are planning protests to pressure the owner and express frustration with what they see as inaction from the English Football League.</p>

          <p>In his second game back from a knee injury, Max Muncy provided a major boost to the Los Angeles Dodgers, leading them to a 12-6 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. Muncy had a dominant performance, going four-for-five with four RBIs, including two powerful home runs. His return is a welcome sight for the Dodgers, whose lineup had struggled significantly during his month-long absence. The slugger's immediate impact, along with strong offensive contributions from teammates, suggests a potential turnaround for the team's recently scuffling offense.</p>

          <p>Mexican ranchers, particularly in the state of Sonora, are facing a severe economic crisis following the U.S. suspension of live cattle imports. The ban was enacted due to the northward spread of the New World Screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite that poses a significant threat to livestock. This halt in trade, which generated $1.2 billion for Mexico last year, compounds the struggles ranchers already face from severe drought. Many are now forced to sell their cattle at a significant loss within Mexico or diversify into other ventures to survive the "tiempos de vacas flacas" (times of the lean cows).</p>

          <p>Less than three months after the U.S. lifted long-standing sanctions, the Trump administration has imposed a 41% tariff rate on Syria, the highest for any country in the world. While direct trade between the U.S. and Syria is minimal, analysts say the move sends a negative signal and threatens to hinder the nation's ability to attract investment for reconstruction after 13 years of devastating civil war. The decision is seen by some as a political lever or "leash" to influence Syria's new transitional government. This economic pressure comes as the country grapples with a collapsed infrastructure and relies heavily on international aid.</p>
