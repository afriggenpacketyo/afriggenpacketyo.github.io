          <p>Authorities in Sumter County, South Carolina, have initiated a homicide investigation following the discovery of two women's bodies in a rural clearing. The victims, identified as Kristen Grissom, 38, and Christine Marie McAbee, 35, appeared to have been killed elsewhere before being moved. An autopsy confirmed McAbee died from a gunshot wound, while Grissom's cause of death is pending. The women, who knew each other, were likely deceased for about a day before being found by a landowner. Officials have stated the incident appears to be isolated with no broader threat to the public.</p>

          <p>A 39-year-old man, Andrew Barber, was successfully rescued after being lost for nine days in a remote region of British Columbia, Canada. He survived by building a makeshift shelter, drinking pond water, and foraging for food. To attract attention, he carved the word "HELP" on a rock and drew an "SOS" in the mud, which ultimately led a search helicopter to his location. Though severely dehydrated and suffering a leg injury, Barber's survival skills were credited for his endurance. Rescuers noted that he was fortunate to have been found when he was, as his condition was deteriorating rapidly.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. consumer price index rose 2.7% annually in July, holding steady from the previous month, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This stability was largely due to a decline in gasoline and grocery prices, which helped counteract price increases in other sectors. However, economists note that core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, has accelerated to a 3.1% annual rate. There are concerns that administration policies, such as tariffs, are beginning to drive up prices for goods like household furnishings and apparel, with potentially larger impacts expected later in the year.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Based on the latest government inflation data, policy experts are projecting a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for Social Security beneficiaries in 2026. This increase would be slightly higher than the 2.5% adjustment received in 2025. The official COLA is calculated based on the average inflation for July, August, and September, so the final figure remains subject to change. The projection is based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), which rose 2.5% over the last year. The potential impact of new tariffs on inflation in the coming months could also influence the final adjustment. (not investment advice)</p>

Pfizer confirmed it is in discussions with the agency to keep the authorization, stating the deliberations are not related to the vaccine's safety or efficacy. The potential move follows other recent changes to U.S. immunization policy under the new Health and Human Services leadership. If revoked, it could significantly limit vaccine options for this age group, as alternatives from Moderna and Novavax are approved for more restricted populations.</p>

          <p>Lauren Sánchez Bezos recently shared a heartfelt post on social media detailing the emotional experience of dropping her son, Evan Whitesell, off at college. She described the moment of watching him build his own dorm cabinet as both proud and heartbreaking, marking the start of a new chapter for him. Last year, Sánchez Bezos announced that Evan had been accepted to the University of Miami's Herbert Business School. This family milestone comes after her recent marriage to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in Venice, which was attended by all three of her children from previous relationships.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders have publicly appealed to President Trump to protect their security interests during his upcoming summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin concerning the war in Ukraine. They expressed apprehension that a deal could be made without their input, potentially involving Ukraine ceding territory, which they argue must not be decided without Ukraine's involvement. The appeal comes amid reports of Russian forces advancing in the Donetsk region, possibly to strengthen Putin's negotiating position. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is scheduled to meet virtually with Trump and EU leaders before the summit.</p>

As federally regulated products, primarily through the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) program, they offer protections like ensuring the loan balance never exceeds the home's value. However, the tool is not without risks; borrowers must continue to pay for property taxes, insurance, and maintenance to avoid default. The accumulating loan balance also reduces the equity available for heirs. The article advises that these loans are best for seniors planning to age in place long-term.</p>

          <h2>AI Startup Perplexity Makes Unsolicited $34.5 Billion Offer to Acquire Google's Chrome Browser</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>AI search startup Perplexity AI has made a surprising, unsolicited bid of $34.5 billion to purchase Google's Chrome browser. The offer comes after the U.S. Department of Justice proposed that Google divest Chrome as a remedy in the antitrust lawsuit the company recently lost regarding its search market monopoly. Perplexity, known for its AI-powered conversational search engine, stated that several investors have agreed to back the deal, which exceeds its own current valuation. Google has previously called the DOJ's proposal a "radical interventionist agenda" and has not yet disclosed how it will adjust its business following the ruling.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities have reportedly instructed companies to avoid using Nvidia's H20 and certain AMD artificial intelligence chips for government and national security-related applications. This warning comes shortly after the U.S. administration approved export licenses for these less-advanced chips, contingent on the companies paying a 15% tax on their China revenues. The H20 and its AMD equivalent were specifically designed to comply with earlier U.S. export restrictions aimed at preventing China from accessing top-tier AI technology. The move signals China's continued push to reduce reliance on foreign technology in sensitive sectors.</p>

Disguised in a niqab, Betro attempted to shoot the man at point-blank range, but her gun jammed and the target escaped unharmed. She later fired shots at the family's empty home before fleeing the country, remaining on the run for nearly five years before her capture.</p>
