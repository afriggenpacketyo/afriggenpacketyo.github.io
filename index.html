          <p>Two 18th-century shipwrecks off the coast of Costa Rica have been identified as Danish slave ships, the Fridericus Quartus and Christianus Quintus. Marine archaeologists confirmed the ships' identities through investigations of ship timbers, bricks, and clay pipes. The ships were wrecked in 1710, and the discovery sheds light on Denmark's involvement in the transatlantic slave trade. The Danish government banned the transatlantic slave trade in 1792 but did not abolish slavery until 1847.</p>
