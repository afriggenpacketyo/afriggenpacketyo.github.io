          <p>The FBI has released images of a person of interest in connection with the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. The FBI is offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information leading to the identification and arrest of the person responsible for Kirk's murder. The suspect, believed to be college-aged, arrived on campus at 11:52 a.m. on Wednesday and shot Kirk at 12:20 p.m. before fleeing. Investigators have recovered a rifle and ammunition with writings described as "transgender and anti-fascist," and are analyzing them for DNA and fingerprints. (not investment advice)</p>

The suspect is described as college-aged and was captured on security cameras. Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA, was shot in the neck while speaking to students; the weapon, a high-powered rifle, was recovered nearby along with a palm print and footwear impression. Authorities believe the gunman acted alone, and Utah's governor has called the shooting a "political assassination."</p>

          <p>Nadine Menendez, wife of former Senator Bob Menendez, has been sentenced to 4.5 years in prison for her role in a bribery scheme. She was convicted of colluding with her husband to sell his political influence in exchange for cash, gold bars, and a luxury car. Prior to sentencing, Menendez blamed her husband, claiming she was manipulated by his power and stature, though prosecutors argued she played a crucial role in the crimes. The judge cited her difficult childhood and health conditions as factors in granting some leniency.</p>

          <p>A plane carrying hundreds of workers detained in a U.S. immigration raid at a Hyundai-LG Energy Solution battery plant in Georgia has departed for South Korea. The workers, mostly South Korean nationals, were detained for allegedly working or living in the U.S. without legal status. The incident has caused a diplomatic standoff between the U.S. and South Korea, with Seoul mounting a "whole-of-government response". The raid is expected to delay the battery plant's construction by two to three months.</p>

          <p>The European Union is grappling with a request from President Donald Trump to impose a 100% tariff on China and India to halt their purchases of Russian energy. While EU officials are pleased that Trump is engaging on the issue of punishing Russia, doubts are emerging about the bloc's ability to implement such a measure. The demand comes amid discussions about jointly imposing "secondary sanctions" on companies from China and other third countries for buying Russian oil and gas. (not investment advice)</p>

Other recommendations include banning mobile phones in schools and creating a crime of digital negligence for parents who fail to protect their children.
