          <p>The projected cost for constructing the Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk, UK, has surged to £38 billion, a significant increase from the previous £20 billion estimate. This new figure, which accounts for inflation and risk, will add approximately £1 per month to household energy bills during the decade-long construction phase. The UK government has confirmed it will take a 44.9% stake in the project alongside private investors like Centrica. Critics have raised concerns about the escalating costs and the financial burden on taxpayers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Harvard Education Publishing Group has abruptly canceled a special issue of the Harvard Educational Review focused on "education and Palestine," shortly before its scheduled publication. The move has shocked contributors and editors, who allege it is an act of censorship amid a climate of repression against pro-Palestinian speech on US campuses. The publisher cited a lack of "internal alignment" and issues with the review process, but authors and editors claim the decision was driven by fears of legal liability and antisemitism accusations. The incident has intensified debates about academic freedom and the "Palestine exception" in higher education.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Labor has unveiled proposals to rewrite or repeal over 60 workplace regulations, aiming to reduce what it calls "costly, burdensome rules." The changes would affect a wide range of protections, including minimum wage for home health care workers, safety standards for construction and mining, and protections for migrant farmworkers. While the administration argues the move will stimulate economic growth, critics and labor advocates warn it would significantly increase the risk of injury and death for workers.

This rare ending, which has not been seen in Major League Baseball since 1971, gave the Phillies a crucial win. The game concluded with celebration for the Phillies and disbelief for the Red Sox.</p>

Instead of letting the state legislature decide, the administration collaborated with the Texas Attorney General to have the law declared unconstitutional in court. The author contends this is part of a broader pattern of using federal power to override state laws on issues like immigration and transgender rights.

An administration official described the Israeli actions as undermining US diplomatic efforts in the region.

          <p>Jensen Huang, the CEO of AI chip giant Nvidia, has reportedly become a major political force in Washington, eclipsing the influence of other tech leaders like Apple's Tim Cook and Tesla's Elon Musk. Huang has successfully lobbied the Trump administration, aligning with key officials to argue against broad chip restrictions on China, leading to a reversal on a ban for Nvidia's H20 AI chips. His ability to navigate the complex US-China trade landscape and secure favorable outcomes for his company highlights the strategic importance of AI technology. This positions Huang as a key business envoy in ongoing tech disputes.</p>

          <h2>Research Suggests 11% of Trump's Working-Class Voters Are Persuadable for Democrats</h2>

          <p>A new report from the Center for Working-Class Politics suggests a path for Democrats to win back a segment of Donald Trump's working-class supporters. The research indicates that while these voters are often socially moderate, they hold strongly progressive "economic egalitarian" views on issues like minimum wage, job protection, and taxing the wealthy. The analysis identifies a key group, about 11% of Trump voters, who hold both socially moderate and economically populist views, making them potentially persuadable. The author argues that a "social populism" strategy could be key to future Democratic victories.</p>

          <p>Millions of Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace could face sharp premium increases in 2026 if Congress does not act. Enhanced premium tax credits, which were expanded during the pandemic to make plans more affordable, are set to expire at the end of 2025. This could create a "subsidy cliff," where individuals earning just over certain income thresholds lose their subsidies entirely, causing their monthly costs to skyrocket. Financial experts advise those potentially affected to begin planning now to manage their 2026 income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A case before the Supreme Court, *Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians v. Howe*, could effectively nullify the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by stripping private citizens and groups of the ability to sue under it. A lower court ruling found that only the Department of Justice can enforce the law. Since private lawsuits have accounted for the vast majority of successful VRA cases over the past 40 years, this would render the landmark civil rights statute largely unenforceable. The decision represents an existential threat to the law that ended Jim Crow-era voting restrictions.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece critiques the recent $150-billion increase to the U.S. Pentagon budget, arguing it primarily benefits military contractors at the expense of troops and veterans. The author notes that over half the Pentagon's budget now goes to private companies, funding what are often called overpriced and underperforming weapons systems. This enriches firms while military families struggle and VA programs face cuts. The article calls for a strategic shift toward diplomacy and better support for service members, rather than letting corporate interests drive military policy. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that federal courts should recognize a legal privilege for patient-physician communications to protect transgender and reproductive healthcare from government intrusion. The authors contend that in the face of sweeping subpoenas from the Justice Department targeting providers of gender-affirming care, such a privilege is essential to prevent a chilling effect on necessary medical services. They draw a parallel to existing privileges like attorney-client and spousal communications, suggesting that the intimate nature of this medical data warrants similar protection. This legal shield would block subpoenas and protect patient privacy from politically motivated investigations.</p>

          <p>Researchers from UCLA have launched a new network of 20 air pollution monitors in northwest Los Angeles County to track airborne particles in the area of the recent Palisades fire. The sensors provide real-time, hyperlocal data on both fine and coarse particulate matter, which can be kicked up by reconstruction and pose health risks. The publicly accessible online map is designed to help residents make informed decisions about outdoor activities. This initiative addresses a gap in existing monitoring systems, which often do not track the larger particles associated with construction and fire debris.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center have created an AI-powered virtual therapist named Xaia to provide mental health support to patients. The system uses a virtual reality headset to immerse users in a calming environment where they can converse with a humanoid robot programmed with therapeutic dialogue. Xaia is designed to supplement traditional therapy, helping patients manage anxiety, depression, and pain, especially given the national shortage of mental health providers.
