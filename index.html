          <p>Seattle police have arrested a 29-year-old man linked to the June robbery of rapper Macklemore's home. The suspect was apprehended for a separate robbery, but a subsequent search of his home and a local jewelry store uncovered items from Macklemore's residence, including a distinctive Seattle Sounders ring. The home invasion occurred while the rapper's nanny and three children were inside, with the nanny being attacked with bear spray before the perpetrators stole thousands of dollars worth of personal belongings. The arrest resulted from a collaborative investigation involving multiple law enforcement agencies.</p>

          <p>Montreal-based luxury fashion retailer SSENSE has announced its intention to file for creditor protection, citing an immediate liquidity crisis. The company's CEO, Rami Atallah, pointed to increased trade pressures, particularly the recent suspension of the U.S. de minimis exemption which allowed for duty-free shipping on small parcels. This policy change, combined with a broader downturn in luxury sales, created what Atallah described as an insurmountable short-term financial challenge. The company, valued at $4 billion in 2021, plans to continue operations as usual while it restructures under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa will not run for re-election in 2026, according to multiple sources who confirmed her decision. Ernst, a retired military officer first elected in 2014, is expected to make a formal announcement next week, creating an open Senate seat in a state that has trended Republican in recent years. Her retirement opens the door for other candidates, with GOP Representative Ashley Hinson reportedly planning to run for the seat. The decision adds another layer to the 2026 midterm elections, where Republicans aim to defend and expand their current Senate majority.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The July Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report indicates that inflation remains persistent, with the annual rate holding steady at 2.6%. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, ticked up slightly to 2.9%, remaining above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Despite these price pressures, consumer spending rose by 0.5%, suggesting Americans are continuing to spend, though many are becoming more cautious with discretionary purchases.

          <p>A fiery collision on Interstate 15 in Temecula has resulted in the deaths of four people, including two teenage boys who were close friends and teammates on a youth soccer team. Authorities suspect the crash, which occurred on August 23, was the result of an illegal street race where a BMW crossed the median and struck an oncoming Nissan. The deceased teens, Jacob Labib, 15, and Mina Sabet, 14, were returning from a soccer tournament. The driver of the BMW is expected to face charges of vehicular manslaughter and engaging in a speed contest once released from the hospital.</p>

          <p>A Texas man has been reunited with his Fordham University class ring 56 years after it slipped off his finger and fell into the water off a Long Island dock in 1969. The ring was discovered this summer by David Orlowski, who was using a metal detector at Cedar Beach in Mt. Sinai, New York. After finding the ring, Orlowski decided against selling it and used the engravings to track down the original owner, Al DiStefano, through a university alumni group. DiStefano, now 77, called the recovery a "miracle," celebrating the return of a valuable and sentimental item.</p>

This move is unusual, as the U.S. is generally expected to facilitate travel for officials from all member and observer states to the UN headquarters. The decision comes as several countries, including France, are advocating for the recognition of a Palestinian state, a move the Trump administration and Israel oppose.</p>

The motion contends that the Trump administration used an unprecedented legal maneuver to extend Essayli's term without Senate or judicial confirmation, circumventing congressional limits on temporary appointments. This challenge mirrors similar legal actions in other states, such as New Jersey, where a judge recently ruled a Trump-appointed prosecutor was illegally occupying her seat. Essayli's tenure has been controversial, marked by a hard-line agenda and discord within the prosecutor's office.</p>

The discovery, based on newly found remains in Morocco, reveals that the herbivorous dinosaur had long bony spikes fused directly onto its rib bones, a feature never before seen in any vertebrate. This finding challenges previous theories about the evolution of ankylosaurs, which were thought to have developed their extensive armor later in response to large predators. Researchers have dubbed the creature the "punk rocker" of its time due to its bizarre and elaborate defensive armory.</p>

The lawsuit stems from accusations made by a Trump ally that Cook committed mortgage fraud before joining the Fed.

The White House is using a rare budgetary maneuver known as a "pocket rescission," which involves requesting to cancel funds so late in the fiscal year that they expire before Congress can vote on the matter. The proposed cuts target programs at USAID and the State Department, including funding for international peacekeeping and democracy promotion. The move has drawn bipartisan criticism for circumventing Congress's constitutional "power of the purse" and is expected to face legal challenges.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has canceled the Secret Service detail for former Vice President Kamala Harris, seven months after she left office. While former vice presidents are legally entitled to six months of protection, this term can be extended by presidential directive, which former President Joe Biden had reportedly done for Harris. The move has been criticized by some Democrats as politically motivated retribution, pointing to Harris's unique position as the first woman and person of color to hold the office, which may expose her to additional threats. The administration has not provided a specific threat assessment to justify the withdrawal of her security detail.</p>

          <p>The UK Court of Appeal has overturned a High Court ruling that would have forced 138 asylum seekers to leave the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex. The initial injunction was granted to the local council, which argued the hotel's owner breached planning rules by housing migrants. However, the appellate court found the original ruling "seriously flawed," stating it failed to consider the difficulty of relocating the asylum seekers. The hotel has been the site of numerous protests, particularly after an asylum seeker housed there was charged with sexual assault, a detail the court noted could risk encouraging further lawlessness.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz held a joint cabinet meeting aimed at repairing and strengthening the Franco-German relationship, which had been strained under the previous German administration. The leaders discussed pressing issues including the war in Ukraine, European defense autonomy, and energy policy. They announced progress on resolving a long-standing dispute over nuclear power, with Germany agreeing to drop its opposition to labeling nuclear as "green" at the EU level. Despite the warm display of unity, significant bilateral disagreements remain on topics like joint military projects and a planned EU trade deal.</p>

The author reflects on his journey, from being orphaned by the AIDS epidemic to being adopted by an American family, which gave him the educational opportunities he now sees for his son. The milestone is deeply meaningful, representing the culmination of personal sacrifice and the realization of a dream for a better future.</p>

The Spanish player briefly received treatment on his right knee during the second set but stated afterward that the discomfort quickly subsided and was not a cause for concern. Alcaraz, the 2022 US Open champion, is aiming to win his second Grand Slam of the year and potentially reclaim the world number one ranking.</p>

          <p>With mortgage refinancing rates remaining high, seniors have several alternative options for borrowing against their home equity without giving up their current low-rate mortgage. One key option is a reverse mortgage, available to homeowners aged 62 and older, which converts equity into payments for the homeowner and does not require monthly repayment. Other viable choices include home equity loans, which offer a lump sum at a fixed interest rate, and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), which provide a revolving credit line with variable rates. These methods allow homeowners to leverage their record-high equity levels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of chipmaker Marvell Technology fell by 15% after the company reported data center revenue that missed analyst estimates and provided a lackluster forecast for the upcoming quarter. While overall revenue grew 58% year-over-year, driven by strong AI demand, sales in its key data center segment fell slightly short of projections. The company's third-quarter revenue guidance was also below consensus estimates, which the CEO attributed to the "nonlinear" nature of its custom AI chip business. The results prompted a stock downgrade from Bank of America over concerns about near-term AI growth prospects. (not investment advice)</p>

Zelensky also rejected any deal that would require Ukraine to cede territory within such a zone. His comments come as a U.S.-led diplomatic effort to end the war appears to be stalling, with Russia showing little interest in peace talks.</p>

          <p>The ongoing deployment of over 2,200 National Guard members in Washington, D.C., ordered by President Trump to stop violent crime, has created a complex and often confusing situation. While the Guard's duties have included mundane tasks like landscaping, their armed presence has chilled life in some neighborhoods, particularly for immigrant communities, and raised fears of the military being used as a domestic police force. Residents have had mixed reactions, with some mocking the seemingly absurd nature of the deployment while others, frustrated with crime, express relief.
