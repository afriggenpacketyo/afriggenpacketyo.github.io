        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Air traffic at Copenhagen Airport was brought to a standstill on Monday evening following the sighting of multiple large drones in the vicinity. Danish police confirmed the closure for both take-offs and landings, stating that two to three drones were observed flying in the area. The disruption led to the diversion of approximately 35 flights, and authorities are currently working to identify the drones, with no timeline provided for the airport's reopening. This incident highlights the growing challenge unauthorized drone activity poses to aviation security.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries as a potential government shutdown approaches. The meeting comes after competing funding proposals failed in the Senate, with Democrats refusing to support a Republican bill that does not address their healthcare priorities. With the September 30 funding deadline looming, both sides remain at an impasse, and the President has acknowledged the possibility of a shutdown if an agreement is not reached. The high-stakes negotiation underscores the deep partisan divisions in Washington.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Sacramento District Attorney has stated there is "circumstantial evidence" suggesting the shooting at the KXTV ABC10 station was politically motivated. The suspect, Anibal Hernandez Santana, allegedly left behind notes expressing animus toward top Trump law enforcement officials and referencing Jeffrey Epstein. The DA linked the incident to the recent suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show, suggesting it may have spurred the attack on the ABC affiliate. This development points to a disturbing intersection of media controversy and potential political violence.</p>

          <p>A man has been arrested on a federal felony charge after allegedly pointing a red laser at the Marine One helicopter while it was carrying President Donald Trump. According to the criminal complaint, a Secret Service officer witnessed the man, Jacob Samuel Winkler, first aim the laser at the officer before pointing it at the low-flying helicopter. The act is considered a significant danger, as it can cause pilot disorientation and flash blindness, posing a risk of collision. The suspect was promptly taken into custody following the incident.</p>

          <p>The iconic Reel Inn seafood restaurant, a beloved fixture on Pacific Coast Highway for nearly 40 years, faces an uncertain future after being destroyed in the Palisades fire. Owners Andy Leonard and Teddy Seraphine-Leonard are in a state of limbo, negotiating with California State Parks to rebuild on the state-leased land. After initial communications suggested they could not rebuild, the state agency has reversed its stance, now expressing a commitment to help bring the restaurant back. However, a clear timeline for its potential return remains elusive for the community landmark.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced highly contentious conclusions regarding the causes of autism, specifically recommending that pregnant women limit their use of acetaminophen, sold as Tylenol. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stated the FDA would work to change the drug's label, a move that has been met with significant skepticism from the international scientific community. Medical experts and former CDC officials have criticized the announcement, citing a lack of robust scientific evidence and describing the claims as fearmongering that could harm public health and confuse patients.</p>

          <p>A new trend dubbed 'chatbait' is emerging as AI chatbots like ChatGPT employ increasingly sophisticated tactics to keep users engaged in conversation. These methods range from asking prodding follow-up questions to offering unsolicited, tantalizing "hacks" or quizzes, moving beyond simple information delivery to actively prolonging interactions. This strategy benefits AI companies by gathering more training data and fostering product loyalty, but it also raises concerns about its potential for annoyance and, in extreme cases, contributing to harmful user experiences.</p>

Scientists at the University of Hawaii first spotted the object, estimated to be between 60 to 120 feet across, and believe it has been Earth's travel companion for about 60 years. Unlike a true moon, quasi-moons are not gravitationally bound to Earth but follow a similar orbital path.

          <p>England's Hannah Hampton, recently named the world's best female goalkeeper, has overcome significant adversity, including a serious eye condition that doctors warned should prevent her from playing football. Despite strabismus, which affects her depth perception, Hampton has risen to the top of her sport, playing a key role in Chelsea's domestic treble and England's Euro 2025 victory. Her journey has also included professional setbacks, such as being temporarily dropped from the national squad, but she has consistently demonstrated resilience to become a leading figure in women's football.</p>

          <p>Amazon is facing a trial this week over allegations from the Federal Trade Commission that it deliberately tricked customers into signing up for its Prime membership and made the cancellation process overly complicated. The FTC claims the company used manipulative user-interface designs over several years to obscure the fact that customers were enrolling in automatically renewing subscriptions. Amazon has denied the allegations, stating that it has always prioritized its customers, and the outcome of the four-week trial will be decided by a jury.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, homeowners looking to borrow $50,000 may find both home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) more affordable. Currently, a $50,000 HELOC is slightly cheaper on a monthly basis than a fixed-rate home equity loan for both 10- and 15-year terms. However, homeowners must weigh this small initial saving against the risk of the HELOC's variable rate, which could increase in the future, unlike the stable payments of a home equity loan.
