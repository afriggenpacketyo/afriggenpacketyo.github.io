          <p>Authorities have found human remains at the scene of a major explosion and fire at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, California. The incident, which occurred at a facility owned by Devastating Pyrotechnics, left seven people unaccounted for and caused significant damage, including grass fires spanning 80 acres. Investigations revealed the company lacked local licenses for fireworks storage on the agricultural property, which is owned by a Yolo County Sheriff's Lieutenant. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is assisting in the ongoing investigation into the tragic event.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed a controversial and far-reaching spending bill into law during a Fourth of July celebration at the White House. The legislation enacts significant tax cuts, increases funding for immigration enforcement, and introduces substantial cuts to social programs like Medicaid. Trump promoted the bill as a historic achievement, while Democrats heavily criticized its impact on services for low-income Americans, with some experts predicting millions could lose health insurance. The signing followed a push to pass the bill before the holiday, overcoming some Republican reservations.</p>

          <p>Italian luxury brand Prada is facing accusations of cultural appropriation from artisans in Kolhapur, India, after releasing a line of sandals with a striking resemblance to the traditional Kolhapuri design.

The controversy has prompted Prada to acknowledge the sandals' origins and has sparked a broader debate about the protection of traditional crafts. Industry associations are now seeking better recognition and potential profit-sharing to support the artisans keeping the centuries-old craft alive.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research reveals that tiny marine creatures called zooplankton are crucial allies in the fight against climate change, locking away vast amounts of carbon in the deep ocean. These animals gorge on carbon-rich phytoplankton near the surface in Antarctica, grow fat, and then sink to the depths to burn this fat over winter. This process, known as the seasonal vertical migration pump, sequesters an estimated 65 million tonnes of carbon annually, equivalent to the emissions of 55 million cars. The discovery highlights the underappreciated importance of these creatures to the planet's climate regulation.</p>

          <p>Thomas Partey, a former midfielder for Arsenal, has been formally charged with five counts of sexual assault and one count of sexual assault involving three women. The alleged offenses took place between 2021 and 2022, with the investigation beginning after an initial report was made to police in February 2022. The 32-year-old Ghanaian international, whose contract with Arsenal recently ended, denies all charges. His lawyer stated that Partey has cooperated with the investigation and "welcomes the opportunity to finally clear his name," with a court appearance scheduled for August.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, documentary filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as the most important event in world history since the birth of Christ, as it introduced the concept of the citizen. He emphasized that the nation was born from deep division and civil war, a complexity that he believes makes its founding ideals even more inspiring. Burns argued against sanitizing history, stating that understanding the founders' flaws makes them more accessible and their achievements more powerful. He stressed that patriotism involves engaging with this complicated past to better understand the present.</p>

          <p>Adult education programs across the United States are facing uncertainty after the Trump administration withheld $715 million in grant funding. These programs, which serve over a million students annually, provide essential services like literacy, high school equivalency, and job training. The sudden halt in funding has left program administrators and students in limbo, scrambling to understand the implications for their operations and future. The administration has not yet provided a clear reason for withholding the funds, causing widespread concern among educators and advocates for adult learners.</p>

          <p>England wicketkeeper Jamie Smith scored a remarkable 184 not out against India, setting a new record for the highest score by an England wicketkeeper in a men's Test match. The 24-year-old's aggressive and powerful batting display was a key part of a 303-run partnership with Harry Brook. This performance marks a high point in a whirlwind year for Smith, who made his Test debut just 12 months ago. His rapid ascent and ability to change a game have drawn comparisons to Australian great Adam Gilchrist and solidified his crucial role in the team.</p>

          <p>Health care advocates are expressing concern that the wide variety of names for state-level Medicaid programs could cause confusion and lead to eligible individuals losing their health coverage. As states conduct eligibility redeterminations, many people may not realize that notices about programs with names like "Husky Health" or "Apple Health" refer to their Medicaid coverage. This lack of standardized branding across the country creates a risk that important notifications will be ignored. Experts warn this could result in people discovering they are uninsured only when they seek medical care.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated that a 60-day ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas is close, stating that Israel has agreed to a framework and is waiting on Hamas. Hamas issued a response it described as "positive," but a senior official noted the group seeks guarantees for a permanent end to the war, which Israel has previously refused. While diplomatic talks progress, Israeli military strikes have intensified across Gaza, killing at least 138 Palestinians in two days, according to Gaza health officials. The violence underscores the urgent need for a resolution to the ongoing conflict.</p>
