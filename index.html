          <p>Berkshire Hathaway's shares experienced a nearly 6% decline after Warren Buffett's surprising announcement to step down as CEO, with Greg Abel named as his successor. The transition marks the end of Buffett's legendary 60-year run, during which he transformed Berkshire from a failing textile mill into a $1.2 trillion conglomerate. Despite the leadership change, Buffett will remain as chairman, providing mentorship to Abel. The company's Class A and B shares both fell after hitting record highs, reflecting investor uncertainty despite assurances of a smooth transition. (not investment advice)</p>

Prime Minister Netanyahu declared that Israel has "not finished the war" and intends to intensify operations, despite questions about how additional forces will fundamentally alter the conflict's dynamics. International entities, including the European Union, have voiced concerns that an escalation will worsen the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

          <p>Shares of major Hollywood studios and streaming services experienced brief declines after President Trump proposed a 100% tariff on movies made overseas, citing tax incentives offered by foreign countries as a national security threat. Companies like Netflix, Disney, and Warner Bros. Discovery saw their stock prices dip before rebounding as investors and industry experts tried to understand the potential impact of the proposed tariff. Questions remain about the implementation of the duties, including which production processes would be affected and whether completed projects would be exempt. Industry experts also worry about potential retaliatory measures from other countries, which could impact international box office sales.</p>

          <p>President Trump has made a series of comments regarding the possibility of running for a third term, despite constitutional limitations. While he has previously hinted at methods to circumvent these limitations, Trump recently downplayed the idea, stating that he will be a two-term president. This article provides a timeline of Trump's various remarks on the subject, including instances where he joked about running again and acknowledged potential paths to doing so. Experts suggest that the talk of a third term may be a show of strength aimed at preventing the perception of Trump as a lame-duck president.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security is considering a plan to provide financial assistance, including commercial flights and a $1,000 stipend, to illegal aliens who choose to self-deport from the United States. DHS argues that this measure would be significantly cheaper for taxpayers than the current process of arresting, detaining, and deporting individuals. Secretary Kristi Noem stated that self-deportation is the safest and most cost-effective way for illegal aliens to leave the country, while also allowing them the opportunity to return legally in the future. While the move is expected to face criticism, DHS maintains that it will ultimately save taxpayers money and help reduce the number of illegal aliens in the country.</p>

          <p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has dismissed Sudan's claim that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) fueled genocide in Darfur. Sudan had argued that the UAE violated the Genocide Convention by supplying weapons to paramilitary forces.

          <p>Pharmaceutical companies are warning that Americans would bear the brunt of President Trump's proposed tariffs on imported drugs, leading to higher medication costs and potential supply disruptions. Generic drugmakers, who operate on tight margins, argue that tariffs would make it difficult to produce affordable medications. A 25% U.S. tariff on pharmaceutical imports could increase drug costs by almost $51 billion annually, raising prices by up to 12.9%. While some drugmakers are shifting production to the U.S., it may not be enough to offset the impact of tariffs on the pharmaceutical industry.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed the administration to reopen and expand Alcatraz prison to house America's "most ruthless and violent offenders". The decision has been met with criticism, with California lawmakers calling it "absurd" and a distraction from budget cuts to anti-crime programs. The prison, which closed in 1963 due to high operational costs and infrastructure issues, would require significant investment to bring it up to modern standards. Critics argue that the proposal is a waste of resources and will not effectively address crime.</p>

          <p>A clash among Republicans in Congress over whether to repeal Biden-era clean energy tax credits is jeopardizing renewable energy projects in rural Alaska, where residents rely on diesel fuel flown in from hundreds of miles away to power their homes. The potential loss of these tax credits is creating uncertainty for villages like Noatak, which are seeking to reduce their reliance on expensive and polluting diesel fuel. Senator Lisa Murkowski is fighting to preserve the tax credits, arguing that they are crucial for supporting renewable energy projects in isolated communities. The dispute highlights the tension between fiscal conservatism and the need for affordable and sustainable energy in rural areas.</p>
