Democratic Representative Ro Khanna emphasized the importance of respecting the federal judiciary and Supreme Court decisions. Hegseth stated his job was to ensure troops in Los Angeles could support law enforcement and expressed concerns about the judiciary's expanding powers, leading to continued questioning from Khanna regarding adherence to court rulings. The exchange highlights tensions between the executive branch and the judiciary regarding national security and foreign policy.

They accuse the administration of injecting politics and ideological mandates into the Fulbright program. The State Department disputes these claims, asserting that the board members were partisan appointees of former President Biden and that the administration is ensuring foreign policy initiatives align with national interests. </p>
