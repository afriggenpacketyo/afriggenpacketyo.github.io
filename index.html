        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite ongoing prisoner exchanges, Russia launched a massive barrage of drones and missiles targeting cities across Ukraine. The Ukrainian air force reported that most regions were affected, with strikes hitting residential buildings and enterprises, resulting in casualties, including children. President Zelenskyy condemned the attacks as deliberate strikes on ordinary cities and called for stronger international pressure on Russia. Poland, a NATO nation bordering Ukraine, scrambled its fighter jets during the attack, and while the prisoner exchange is the largest since the conflict began, U.S.-brokered peace talks have failed to reach an accord, with both sides accusing each other of undermining negotiations.</p>

While some institutions adopted diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, criminal justice inequities persist in the U.S., and police killings continue in Brazil. In the UK, anti-immigrant sentiment has grown, and some argue that US-based BLM offered little support to African struggles.
