            <p>An Israeli Defense Forces inquiry has attributed the deaths of 15 emergency workers in Gaza last month to a series of 'professional failures,' including an 'operational misunderstanding' and a 'breach of orders.' The IDF claimed that six of the casualties were Hamas members, a claim disputed by the Palestine Red Crescent Society, which called the report 'invalid.' The deputy commander of the unit involved has been dismissed, and another officer will be reprimanded. A UN official criticized the investigation for not going far enough in ensuring accountability.</p>

            <p>American-style restaurants in Beijing, such as Home Plate BBQ, are removing U.S. beef from their menus due to the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China. The retaliatory tariffs imposed by Beijing have made American beef too expensive, leading restaurants to switch to Australian beef and Canadian pork. The shift reflects the broader impact of the trade war on businesses and consumers. Home Plate BBQ is transitioning to Australian M5 beef, believing it maintains similar taste and quality.</p>

            <p>Approximately 60,000 Americans risk losing their rental assistance and facing eviction as the Emergency Housing Vouchers program runs out of funding. The program, launched in 2021 to aid those fleeing homelessness and domestic violence, is expected to exhaust its $5 billion allocation by the end of next year due to rising rental costs. Advocates are lobbying Congress for additional funding, but prospects appear uncertain.

            <p>The drowning toll in Australia over the Easter weekend has reached seven, with the death of a nine-year-old boy who became trapped between rocks at a New South Wales beach. Most of the deaths were caused by strong swells washing people into the ocean from rocks. Two people remain missing. Surf Life Saving NSW CEO Steven Pearce described it as the 'worst' spate of drownings on record for the Easter long weekend.</p>
