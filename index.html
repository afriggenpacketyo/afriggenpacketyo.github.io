          <p>The article examines the significant financial burden of carrying a large credit card balance in a high-interest-rate environment. With average APRs near 22%, a $25,000 debt can accrue approximately $5,500 in interest annually, with monthly interest charges consuming most of the minimum payment. This analysis highlights how making only minimum payments can extend the repayment period for decades and cost tens of thousands in interest alone. The article also outlines several strategies for mitigating these costs, such as balance transfers, debt consolidation loans, and negotiating lower rates with card issuers.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant political maneuver, California Democrats have introduced a proposal to redraw the state's congressional district maps ahead of the midterm elections. The plan aims to create more favorable districts for Democratic candidates, potentially adding up to five seats for the party in the U.S. House. This action is a direct response to a similar Republican-led redistricting effort in Texas, escalating a partisan battle over electoral boundaries. The proposal would require a state constitutional amendment and voter approval, setting the stage for a contentious political fight over what critics are calling partisan gerrymandering.</p>

          <p>Texas megachurch Gateway Church has installed Pastor Daniel Floyd as its new lead pastor, aiming to begin a new chapter following a major scandal. The move comes fourteen months after founding pastor Robert Morris stepped down amid allegations of child sexual abuse, for which he now faces criminal charges in Oklahoma. In his first sermon, Floyd promised to lead with integrity and vision, while the church continues to navigate multiple lawsuits related to the scandal. The transition represents an effort by the prominent church to move forward and rebuild trust with its large congregation.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has warned that the United States may be underestimating the threat posed by China's rapid progress in artificial intelligence. He expressed skepticism that current U.S. export controls on advanced semiconductors are a sufficient or reliable long-term solution to curb China's AI ambitions. Altman noted that competition from Chinese open-source models was a significant factor in OpenAI's recent decision to release its own open-weight models. His comments highlight the complex and consequential nature of the U.S.-China AI race, suggesting it involves multiple layers beyond a simple measure of which country is ahead.</p>

          <p>After a two-week standoff, Democratic members of the Texas House of Representatives have returned to Austin, ending their quorum break and allowing the legislature to resume business. The Democrats had left the state to block a Republican-led effort to redraw congressional maps in a way that could significantly favor the GOP in future elections. Their return signals a shift in strategy, with Democrats now planning to fight the proposed maps in committee and through legal challenges, arguing they are discriminatory. This development is part of a larger national battle over redistricting, with California Democrats proposing their own map changes in response.</p>

          <p>Fans of Newcastle United and Aston Villa have united in protest against the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR), which they argue force clubs to sell homegrown players.

Experts note that while these deals are beneficial from an accounting perspective, they are detrimental to the sport's culture and the special bond fans have with local talent. The rules limit club losses, creating pressure to sell players to balance the books.</p>

Now 91, Dwight recently became the oldest person to travel to space and is also a renowned sculptor with over 130 memorials dedicated to Black history. Despite being selected for astronaut training by President John F. Kennedy in 1961, he faced prejudice that led him to resign from the program. His remarkable life of perseverance, entrepreneurship, and artistic contribution is being recognized through this proposed honor.</p>

Those accessing the pill without a prescription were more likely to be uninsured, younger, and living in rural areas.

          <p>A trend dubbed "job hugging" has emerged in the U.S. labor market, as workers are increasingly choosing to stay in their current roles rather than seeking new opportunities. This marks a significant reversal from the "great resignation" period of 2021-2022, with the voluntary quits rate falling to its lowest consistent level in nearly a decade. Experts attribute this shift to worker anxiety about a cooling job market and a gradual economic slowdown. While providing stability, this trend may also lead to wage stagnation for employees and create challenges for new entrants trying to find work.</p>

          <p>The article explains the advantages of using dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs) as a strategy to enhance investment returns through the power of compound interest. A DRIP automatically uses the cash dividends paid by a stock to purchase more shares of that same stock, often including fractional shares. This passive approach ensures that money is consistently put to work, accelerating portfolio growth over the long term. Using the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) as an example, the article demonstrates that reinvesting dividends resulted in a total return of 239% over a decade, compared to 185% from price appreciation alone.

          <p>Financial experts suggest that the best age to take out a reverse mortgage depends on an individual's specific circumstances, including health, long-term goals, and immediate income needs. While homeowners can qualify at age 62, waiting until their late 60s or early 70s often allows them to access a larger portion of their home equity. A reverse mortgage can provide a crucial income stream for retirees on a fixed budget by eliminating mortgage payments and providing tax-free funds. However, it's essential to consider that this reduces the home's equity, impacting potential inheritances and funds available if one needs to move later. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>State health officials have officially declared that the measles outbreak in Texas, which began in January and resulted in 762 confirmed cases, is over. The declaration was made after 42 days—double the disease's maximum incubation period—passed without a new reported case in affected counties. The outbreak predominantly affected children, and tragically, two unvaccinated children died from the virus. The Texas Department of State Health Services credited a comprehensive public health response for containing the highly contagious disease but urged continued vigilance as measles outbreaks persist elsewhere in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has proposed new regulations that would prevent employees of certain organizations from receiving benefits under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. The Department of Education aims to exclude organizations deemed to be "undermining national security and American values through illegal means." Critics and advocates for borrowers worry that the vague language could be used to arbitrarily deny forgiveness to employees of non-profits based on political ideology. The PSLF program, enacted in 2007, is designed to cancel federal student loan debt for public service workers after ten years of payments.</p>

          <p>The price of bitcoin experienced a sharp decline, falling to around $115,000 after setting a new record high of nearly $124,500 last week. The broader cryptocurrency market also tumbled, with a wave of liquidations totaling over $500 million in forced selling of long positions. This downturn was triggered by investor profit-taking and heightened macroeconomic concerns, particularly after wholesale inflation data raised doubts about a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut. Despite the pullback, crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continued to see significant net inflows for the week, suggesting underlying institutional support. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The search for a missing 7-month-old baby in Yucaipa, California, has become more complex after his mother, Rebecca Haro, stopped cooperating with investigators. Haro initially claimed her son, Emmanuel, was kidnapped after she was attacked and knocked unconscious, but authorities noted inconsistencies in her story and have not ruled out foul play. The San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department is continuing its investigation despite the mother's refusal to answer further questions. The disturbing circumstances have led a child advocacy group to retract its offer of a reward, citing concerns about the situation.</p>

          <p>Germany's Foreign Ministry has confirmed that Pakistan deported 211 Afghan nationals who had already been approved for resettlement in Germany. These individuals, including human rights defenders and former local staff for German institutions, had fled to Pakistan after the Taliban takeover and were awaiting transfer. The German government is now in contact with Pakistani authorities to try and facilitate their return to Pakistan while arranging temporary accommodation for them in Afghanistan. The deportations are part of a broader Pakistani policy of expelling Afghan refugees, creating a precarious situation for thousands fearing persecution.</p>

          <p>A section of Times Square in Manhattan was briefly closed to all vehicle and pedestrian traffic on Monday morning as the New York City Police Department investigated a suspicious device. The closure affected a two-block area of Seventh Avenue, bringing an unusual quiet to the normally bustling tourist and theater district. After approximately an hour and a half, the police concluded their investigation and reopened the area, allowing traffic and public activity to resume. The incident caused temporary disruptions but was resolved without any reported harm or ongoing threat.</p>

          <p>The cable news channel MSNBC is set to change its name to MS NOW and will no longer use the iconic NBC peacock logo. This rebranding is part of a larger corporate restructuring, as MSNBC and other NBCUniversal channels like CNBC and USA are being spun off into a new independent company called Versant. The new name, which stands for My Source News Opinion World, is intended to establish a separate identity for the brand. The change marks a significant shift for the channel, which was founded nearly 30 years ago as a partnership between Microsoft (MS) and NBC.</p>

          <p>Several European leaders have traveled to Washington for urgent talks with President Trump, driven by deep concerns over a recent shift in U.S. strategy for ending the war in Ukraine. The visit aims to prevent what some fear could be a "capitulation" to Russia, following Trump's decision to drop a ceasefire as a precondition for peace talks. European officials are worried that the U.S. is moving too quickly toward a deal that could compromise Ukrainian sovereignty and European security. They seek to convince the White House that any peace agreement must include robust, long-term security guarantees for the entire continent.</p>
