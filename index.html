          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic candidate for New York City mayor, has withdrawn from an upcoming WABC-TV town hall to protest the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show. Mamdani stated his decision was a response to corporate leaders prioritizing their bottom line over the freedom of the press, framing the issue as a stand against authoritarianism. The suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" occurred after the host made comments critical of the Trump administration's response to the assassination of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk. This move by Mamdani adds a political dimension to the controversy, which has already drawn widespread debate over free speech and media independence.</p>

This victory continues a five-year streak of Barcelona players winning the award, following Alexia Putellas's wins in 2021 and 2022 and Bonmati's own previous wins in 2023 and 2024. The top ten also featured a strong presence from England's Lionesses, with five players recognized for their outstanding performances over the past year.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has strongly refuted a New York Magazine cover story alleging that senior adviser Corey Lewandowski, not Secretary Kristi Noem, is effectively running the agency. A DHS spokesperson characterized the report as "libelous" and based on "anonymous gossip," asserting that all decisions are made by Secretary Noem. The article had also raised concerns about Noem's use of U.S. Coast Guard housing and described increased deportations as part of "Trump's police state." In response, the DHS highlighted its achievements in border security and the removal of dangerous criminals, stating that the agency's actions have made America safer under Noem's leadership.</p>

          <p>Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate former President Donald Trump at a Florida golf club, has concluded his defense without personally testifying. Representing himself, Routh called a firearms expert who questioned the effectiveness of the weapon due to a poorly mounted scope and a tendency to jam. Prosecutors allege Routh planned the attack for weeks before being intercepted by a Secret Service agent. The jury will soon hear closing arguments and begin deliberations on multiple charges, including the attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate, following the seven-day prosecution case which involved 38 witnesses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration's request to proceed with the removal of Federal Trade Commission member Rebecca Slaughter while the court considers a broader case. The decision temporarily sets aside lower court rulings that had blocked her firing, which were based on a 1935 precedent protecting members of independent agencies from being removed by the president without cause. The justices have agreed to hear arguments in December on whether to overturn this long-standing precedent, a move that could significantly alter the independence of federal agencies. The court's three liberal justices dissented, arguing the majority's decision undermines the established structure and bipartisanship of these institutions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new $100,000 fee for initial H-1B visa applications is causing confusion and concern among employers and immigrant workers. While the White House clarified that the fee applies only to new applicants and not to current visa holders or renewals, immigration lawyers note significant uncertainty remains. Attorneys are advising H-1B holders against international travel until further guidance is issued, fearing they could be unexpectedly subjected to the fee upon re-entry if their status changes. The policy is expected to deter many companies from hiring foreign talent, aligning with the administration's goal of prioritizing American workers, but potentially impacting industries like tech and healthcare that rely on the program.</p>

The company explained that after several days of thoughtful conversations with the host, they mutually reached the decision to resume production. The suspension had followed a call for action from the FCC chairman and sparked a significant public debate about free speech, media responsibility, and political pressure on entertainment programming.</p>

Currently, a HELOC is slightly cheaper, with monthly payments for a 15-year term being about $7 less than a fixed-rate home equity loan. However, the key difference lies in the rate structure: HELOCs have variable rates that can change over time, while home equity loans offer a fixed rate for the life of the loan. Borrowers must weigh the immediate savings of a HELOC against the long-term payment stability of a home equity loan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 24-hour general strike in solidarity with Palestinians saw thousands of workers and students participate in rallies across Italy, affecting transportation, schools, and ports. In Rome, over 20,000 people gathered for a protest, while demonstrators in Bologna blocked a major motorway. Dockworkers in several key ports, including Genoa and Venice, also went on strike to voice their support. The protests were not uniformly peaceful, as clashes between demonstrators and police were reported in Milan, leading to at least 10 arrests and dozens of injuries among law enforcement officers, drawing condemnation from Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.</p>

          <p>San Francisco 49ers defensive end Nick Bosa will miss the remainder of the season after tearing his ACL during Sunday's game against the Arizona Cardinals. The injury to his right knee occurred in the first quarter while he was being double-teamed on a pass play. Bosa, the 2022 NFL Defensive Player of the Year, is a cornerstone of the 49ers' defense and his absence is a major blow to the undefeated team's Super Bowl aspirations. The 27-year-old had already recorded two sacks and a forced fumble in the first three games of the season. Veteran Bryce Huff is expected to step into the starting role.</p>

          <p>Christian Horner has officially left his role as team principal of the Red Bull Formula 1 team, reportedly securing a severance payment of 60 million euros. The 51-year-old's departure concludes a tumultuous period for the championship-winning team, marked by an internal power struggle and allegations of misconduct against Horner, which he has denied. His exit followed the resignations of key figures like technical director Adrian Newey and a noticeable decline in the team's on-track dominance. While Horner's legacy includes building one of F1's most successful teams, his departure frees him to pursue other projects within the sport, though his future remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet is reportedly considering three primary options for annexing territory in the occupied West Bank, a move aimed at permanently blocking a two-state solution. The proposals range from a sweeping annexation of over 80% of the territory, as suggested by far-right ministers, to a more limited annexation of Area C, which is already under Israeli control, or just the settlement blocs near the Green Line. Any such move would likely provoke a severe international backlash, potentially jeopardizing normalization agreements with Arab nations. The final decision is expected to be heavily influenced by the position of the U.S. Trump administration.</p>

Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt asserted that Homan did nothing wrong and was the target of a politically motivated "weaponization" of the Justice Department by the previous administration. The alleged incident involved FBI agents posing as business executives who reportedly offered Homan money in exchange for immigration-related government contracts. The Trump administration's FBI Director, Kash Patel, stated that a full review found no credible evidence of criminal wrongdoing, and the case was subsequently closed.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is expected to announce a link between the use of acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, during pregnancy and an increased risk of autism in children. This anticipated announcement has been met with strong opposition from medical experts and Tylenol's manufacturer, Kenvue, who state there is no credible scientific evidence for such a claim. Major medical organizations maintain that acetaminophen is the safest pain relief option for pregnant women. The administration also plans to promote leucovorin, a form of folate, as a potential treatment for some autism symptoms, a move that specialists say is only effective for a small subset of cases.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new U.S. study suggests that while efforts to decrease partisan animosity can produce small, positive changes, these effects typically fade within two weeks. Researchers analyzed 25 previous studies and found that interventions, such as correcting misperceptions about political opponents, only modestly increased warmth toward the other party. The team also found that combining multiple interventions or repeating them did not lead to more significant or lasting reductions in hostility. The findings suggest that lasting change may require addressing the systemic incentives that encourage political and media figures to fuel partisan conflict, rather than focusing solely on individual-level interventions.</p>

Among the organizations severing ties are the Teenage Cancer Trust and the British Heart Foundation. A spokesperson for the duchess explained the email was sent on advice to mitigate a defamation threat from Epstein and reiterated her regret over any association with him.</p>

While many world leaders have attempted to appease him, his second-term agenda is seen as more unrestrained and unpredictable, rattling allies and adversaries alike. Trump's speech is expected to articulate his "American strength" philosophy, focusing on his self-proclaimed role as a peacemaker despite limited success in resolving major conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. The administration is also notably skipping a French-led summit to recognize a Palestinian state, underscoring its divergent foreign policy approach.</p>

          <p>Sportswear giant Nike is being viewed by some analysts as a promising turnaround story, prompting its addition to investment watch lists. The company has struggled in recent years with challenges in China and a loss of innovation, allowing competitors to gain market share. However, under new CEO Elliott Hill, Nike is refocusing on its core sports categories and has restored key retail partnerships, including with Amazon. The company's last earnings report showed positive signs, and management expects to achieve a clean inventory position by November, ahead of the crucial holiday season, which could improve margins and signal a return to growth.

          <p>Stephen Miran, President Trump's recent appointee to the Federal Reserve board, is pushing for more aggressive cuts to interest rates, diverging from the central bank's more cautious approach. After being the sole dissenting vote in last week's quarter-point rate cut, Miran argued that rates should be below 3% by the end of the year. He dismissed concerns that the president's tariffs are fueling inflation, suggesting that price increases are minor and that inflation is primarily driven by housing costs. Miran's stance solidifies his role as an advocate for the administration's economic policy within the Fed, and he has pledged to continue dissenting rather than voting for a consensus he disagrees with.
