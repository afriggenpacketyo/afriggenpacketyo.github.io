        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is exploring investments in companies that mine and process critical minerals to reduce U.S. reliance on imports, particularly from China. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum suggests using a sovereign wealth fund to invest in domestic miners, countering China's market dominance achieved through state capital. The administration is also considering sovereign risk insurance to protect companies from political changes and a strategic stockpile of key minerals. This comprehensive approach aims to bolster domestic mining and processing capabilities, ensuring a secure supply chain for critical minerals.(not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old man in New Jersey, Joseph Kling, faces arson charges after allegedly starting a bonfire that led to a wildfire consuming over 15,000 acres. Authorities say Kling lit wooden pallets on fire and left before it was fully extinguished, leading to the blaze that destroyed a commercial building and prompted air quality concerns in New York City. The fire, which started in Waretown and spread into Lacey Township, is about 50% contained and is expected to burn for days. The investigation involved multiple agencies, and Kling is currently held in the Ocean County Jail.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration introduced a new online tool to assist unlawful migrants in the U.S. with registering their biometric data, as mandated by a Trump order. The USCIS survey determines if an immigrant needs to register under the Alien Registration Act, requiring a fingerprint and home address for those over 14 without legal status. Failure to register could result in fines, jail time, deportation, and difficulty returning to the U.S., while successful registration leads to DHS issuing proof of registration. Immigrant advocates argue this puts undocumented individuals in a difficult position, risking deportation by registering or facing legal repercussions for non-compliance.</p>

          <p>The effectiveness of current ADHD treatments, particularly medication, for American children is being questioned. ADHD has traditionally been considered a medical disorder treatable with drugs like Ritalin. However, recent studies are challenging this assumption and raising concerns about the long-term impacts of medication-based interventions. The discussion focuses on whether alternative approaches may be more beneficial in addressing the challenges faced by children diagnosed with ADHD.</p>

The comments contrast with recent reports of Amazon pausing some data center leases, indicating sustained growth in the AI sector's infrastructure needs.</p>

          <p>An examination of ancient cultures reveals a consistent fascination with death and the afterlife, despite limited understanding and varying beliefs. Ancient societies faced high mortality rates and lacked modern palliative care, leading to intimate family involvement in death rituals and intense expressions of grief. While polytheistic religions offered little comfort, ideas about the afterlife ranged from bleak underworlds to dualistic realms of reward and punishment. The enduring human effort to imagine what happens after death reflects a fundamental desire for meaning and continuity, whether through reunion with loved ones or acceptance of extinction.</p>
