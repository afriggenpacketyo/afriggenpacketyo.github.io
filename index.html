        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ceasefire talks between Russia and Ukraine in London have been downgraded, excluding US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff, amidst speculation Russia might accept current front lines for concessions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has dismissed recognizing Crimea as Russian territory. Despite Putin's Easter weekend ceasefire claim, British intelligence found no reduction in attacks, and Russian military progress is reportedly slowing. A Russian drone strike in Marhanets resulted in nine civilian deaths, highlighting continued attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure, as the conflict's impact continues to cause global concern.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk stated that China's new export controls on rare earth magnets are impacting the production of Tesla's Optimus humanoid robots. These robots depend on these magnets, and Tesla is working with Beijing to secure access to these resources, with China seeking assurances they won't be used for military purposes. China's restrictions, implemented in response to U.S. tariffs, require exporters to obtain licenses, raising concerns about global shortages. The U.S. is exploring potential tariffs on critical mineral imports in response to China's export controls.</p>

          <p>The world's coral reefs are experiencing the most severe bleaching event on record, affecting 84% of them, driven by rising ocean temperatures due to human-induced climate change.

Scientists emphasize the need to address climate change by reducing fossil fuel emissions to protect coral reefs, as current efforts are insufficient.
