          <p>Global financial markets experienced a significant downturn as Asian stock markets plummeted following President Trump's announcement of new tariffs. Japan's Nikkei 225 index fell sharply, and Hong Kong shares saw their worst day in over 16 years. U.S. stock futures also indicated a potential for further losses, reflecting investor concerns about the economic consequences of escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and other major economies. Many economists warn that these tariffs could lead to increased inflation, reduced consumer spending, and hindered economic growth, raising the specter of a severe global trade war.

          <p>A recent WHO report reveals a stark reality: a woman dies every two minutes due to inadequate maternal healthcare, with 260,000 maternal deaths recorded in 2023. The report highlights the alarming impact of aid funding cuts by countries like the US and the UK, potentially reversing progress made in reducing maternal mortality rates. Sub-Saharan Africa and India bear the highest death rates, emphasizing inequalities between high- and low-income countries. The WHO warns that the global target to reduce maternal deaths by 2030 will be missed by a significant margin, calling for increased political commitment and financial investments to improve healthcare quality and save lives.</p>

          <p>A proposed bill in New York aims to prohibit police from conducting traffic stops for minor violations, such as a broken taillight or expired registration, in an effort to promote racial equity. Supporters argue that racial minorities are disproportionately affected by traffic stops and arrests for these offenses. However, critics, including law enforcement officials and the Nassau County District Attorney, contend that the bill is "pro-criminal" and would compromise public safety by removing a valuable tool for identifying and apprehending dangerous individuals, referencing a case where a serial killer was caught during a traffic stop for a missing license plate.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Marine Le Pen's supporters gathered in Paris to protest her conviction for embezzling public funds, which has barred her from running for office. The rally, organized by Le Pen's National Rally party, was framed as a populist show of force against what they perceive as a politically motivated verdict. Meanwhile, counter-rallies led by left-wing parties warned against France's far right embracing U.S.-style authoritarianism, accusing Le Pen of undermining the rule of law. This event highlights the deep divisions in France over justice, power, and the future of French democracy.</p>

          <p>As investors seek refuge from the economic uncertainty caused by President Trump's new tariffs, analysts are recommending the Japanese yen and Swiss franc as safe-haven assets. The yen has strengthened against the dollar, driven by its cheap valuation and the expectation of declining U.S. interest rates. Similarly, the Swiss franc has appreciated due to its traditional role as a hedge. While some analysts suggest the Brazilian real as an "exotic" hedge, investors are also turning to bonds and gold as safe alternatives amid the ongoing market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan have increased their estimates of a U.S. recession, further contributing to the market turmoil.</p>

          <p>In response to heightened trade tensions with the U.S. and President Trump's new tariffs, China's central bank is opting for stability over devaluation of its currency. While the yuan's daily reference rate has been set to a four-month low against the dollar, it has not breached the critical 7.2 benchmark, signaling an effort to stabilize the currency rather than devalue it to offset the impact of U.S. tariffs.

          <p>The UK government is weighing its response to President Trump's escalating trade wars, balancing the potential benefits of retaliation against the risks of alienating a key ally. While retaliation could prove popular domestically and potentially strengthen ties with the EU, it would also come with costs for UK consumers in the form of higher prices. Alternatively, appeasement could lead to a favorable trade deal with the US, but this carries the risk of being seen as appeasing a bully and may offer limited economic benefits.

          <p>Universities in the US are facing increasing attacks, which are largely financially motivated, from the Trump administration due to the administration's alleged compliance with or support for “antisemitism” (ie pro-Gaza demonstrations) and “anti-white racism” (ie diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives). The real targets are academic freedom and freedom of speech. This article suggests several ways for academics, journalists, universities, and governments to support US-based academics and institutions. These include hosting targeted data and research on open websites in Europe, being more sensitive to the situation of US-based academics when approaching them for interviews, and universities ensuring that academics can continue their thriving careers at European institutions.</p>

          <p>President Trump defended his sweeping tariffs on imports, stating that "sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something," despite the resulting shockwaves through global stock markets.

UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer warned that "the world as we knew it has gone" and that the UK government would keep pushing for an economic deal with the US that avoided some of the tariffs.

          <p>The venture capital industry is experiencing significant churn at the senior level, with many top-level executives departing legacy firms. Reasons for these departures include a perception that decision-making at large firms is slow, and that funds are focused on increasing assets under management rather than working with promising founders. Some investors are capitalizing on big changes in the industry, leaving the drawbacks of big firms for the benefits of smaller ones. The trend reflects a shift in the venture capital landscape, with some investors seeking more control over their decisions and a return to the basics of early-stage investing.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the deportation of a Maryland man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, to a notorious prison in El Salvador was "wholly lawless" and ordered the Trump administration to bring him back to the United States. The judge found little evidence to support allegations that Abrego Garcia was in the MS-13 gang and noted that an immigration judge had previously barred his deportation to El Salvador. The Justice Department has placed the attorney who conceded the error on leave. The case raises concerns about due process and the government's authority to deport individuals without proper legal justification.</p>

Former leaders of the CRS worry that shuttering the office could lead to a surge in disputes between police departments or city leaders and minority communities nationwide. The move has raised concerns about the federal government's ability to prevent racial strife in U.S. cities. The CRS is a low-profile approach and has been a vital asset for the Justice Department, according to some who have led the office.</p>
