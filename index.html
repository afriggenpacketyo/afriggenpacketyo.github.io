        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tripadvisor's "Transparency Report 2025" indicates that approximately 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted in 2024 were identified as fake, more than double the amount detected in 2022. The company attributes this rise to an increase in submissions, along with a more stringent approach towards "incentivized reviews," where businesses offer rewards for favorable feedback. Tripadvisor uses a three-pronged strategy to combat fake reviews, which includes auto-detection, human review, and community feedback, with 7% of submissions being auto-rejected. The article notes that paid reviews are considered a "more pernicious" category of fakes, often originating from Asia, and that rooting out fake reviews is a constant "cat and mouse" game, as Tripadvisor uses AI and behavioral biometrics to identify patterns and penalize violators.</p>

          <p>President Trump has agreed to extend the deadline for negotiating tariffs with the European Union to July 9, following a call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Trump initially announced a 20% tariff on most EU goods, later halving it to 10% until July 8 to allow for negotiations, but expressed frustration with the pace of discussions and threatened 50% tariffs. Von der Leyen affirmed her readiness to swiftly agree on a trade deal, emphasizing the need for mutual respect and warning against escalation, as the EU consults on potential retaliatory measures against US imports. The article explains that Trump has long criticized the trade relationship with the EU, citing concerns over trade in cars and agricultural goods, and that EU leaders have cautioned against tariffs that could harm both economies.</p>

          <p>A Republican senator has indicated that resistance to President Trump's "One Big, Beautiful Bill" could potentially halt its progress in the Senate unless significant changes are made. Senator Ron Johnson expressed concerns that the bill increases the deficit, advocating for deeper spending cuts to return to pre-pandemic levels. The bill faces additional challenges in the Senate, including raising the debt ceiling, which some GOP senators prefer to address separately. The article notes that Speaker Johnson defends the bill as a crucial investment that will stimulate the U.S. economy through tax reductions, deregulation, and incentivizing American manufacturing, while critics argue that its spending cuts are inadequate and that the Congressional Budget Office estimates it would raise the deficit by $3.8 trillion.</p>

Trump also confirmed the postponement of newly announced tariffs on imports from the European Union until July 9, following a call with Ursula von der Leyen.

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to rule on the cases of two former City traders jailed for rigging interest rates, amid concerns that they were scapegoated. Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo were among 37 traders prosecuted for manipulating Libor and Euribor, with evidence suggesting central bankers and government officials pressured banks to engage in similar conduct. The traders argue that any potential gains to their bonuses from a nudge to Libor were too small to motivate a criminal conspiracy, and that they were merely doing what every bank had done since the 1980s. The article details the workings of Libor and Euribor, and the accusations against Hayes and Palombo, as well as the contrasting decisions in US courts, which overturned similar convictions.</p>

The mosaic, made of rich green and white marble and purple-red porphyry, was part of an inlaid floor in one of the ships commissioned by Caligula, which were sunk in Lake Nemi after his assassination. The mosaic resurfaced in the 1960s when an art dealer, Helen Fioratti, purchased it and turned it into a coffee table, unaware of its origins.

The article explains that identifying and extracting batteries from incinerated EVs is complex, requiring specialized teams and equipment, and that the waste is transported to landfills in other states due to limited hazardous waste disposal options in California.

The overnight attack saw Russia fire 367 drones and missiles, killing at least 12 people, including three children, and injuring dozens more across Ukraine. Zelensky warned that Russia's "brutality cannot be stopped" without "strong pressure on the Russian leadership," while Trump said he was "not happy with Putin." The article notes that Zelensky likely means the further sanctions Washington has so far resisted imposing on Moscow, and that despite mounting international calls, Russia has continued to intensify its aerial campaign.</p>
