          <p>Indian police have arrested Ranganathan Govindan, owner of Sresan Pharmaceuticals, in connection with the deaths of at least 17 children who consumed his company's Coldrif cough syrup. Investigations revealed the syrup contained diethylene glycol, a highly toxic industrial solvent, leading to its ban and exposing unhygienic factory conditions. The World Health Organization expressed significant concern, citing a "regulatory gap" in India's testing of domestically marketed medicines. This ongoing public health crisis has prompted authorities to issue warnings about other potentially contaminated syrups from different manufacturers, underscoring systemic issues in drug safety.</p>

          <p>Millions of households in England are set to face even higher water bills, following successful appeals by five major water companies to the UK's Competition and Markets Authority. Companies like Anglian, Northumbrian, Southern, Wessex, and South East argued that the previously announced 36% average price rises over five years, set by regulator Ofwat, were inadequate for crucial infrastructure investment. The CMA's decision permits these companies to implement an additional average increase of 3% above Ofwat's initial determination, placing further financial strain on consumers amidst ongoing cost-of-living concerns.</p>

          <p>As Sanae Takaichi, a protégé of Shinzo Abe, is poised to lead Japan, her "Abenomics"-aligned policies advocating loose monetary policy could weaken the yen and reignite trade tensions with former U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump has historically criticized Japan for currency devaluation, and the yen's recent dip past 150 against the dollar is a politically sensitive level. While analysts believe Takaichi will tread carefully to avoid straining US relations, persistent yen weakness could impact trade. The Bank of Japan is still expected to hike rates to curb inflation, potentially overriding Takaichi's stance and influencing market stability. (not investment advice)</p>
