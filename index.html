            <p>Hertz CEO Gil West conveyed his positive reaction to Bill Ackman's Pershing Square acquiring a substantial stake in the rental car company. In a message to employees, West stated he was encouraged by Ackman's comments and the firm's support, viewing it as a validation of Hertz's strategic direction following its emergence from bankruptcy. Pershing Square's stake has grown to 19.8%, making them the second-largest shareholder. The investment firm received an exemption from the SEC to delay the filing of the position until Wednesday, which allowed it to accumulate substantially more shares. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Australian government is controversially shooting koalas from helicopters in Budj Bim National Park due to starvation and injuries caused by bushfires and habitat loss. While officials claim this is to end the koalas' suffering, animal welfare advocates are concerned about the indiscriminate nature of the cull. The situation underscores the broader issues of climate change, logging, and development that are destroying koala habitats and making wildfires more frequent and damaging. Experts emphasize the need for continuous, healthy forests and careful management of blue gum plantations to assist in reducing the risk and severity of fires.</p>

Trump stated that these workers should be held to the highest standards and should no longer have a job if they refuse to advance the president's policy interests or engage in corrupt behavior.

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The article explores the use of dark humor as a coping mechanism during times of political repression and societal collapse. It references historical examples, such as sarcastic jokes in Franco's Spain and Yiddish humor in 1930s Poland, where humor served as a form of dissent and solidarity. The piece also discusses how authoritarian leaders use humor for their own political purposes and how anti-totalitarian laughter can be a form of resistance. Ultimately, it suggests that macabre jokes may have special appeal in moments when high-achieving individuals are targeted by repression.</p>

Experts say that such a move would be difficult and lengthy, citing the case of Bob Jones University as a legal precedent.

            <p>A Texas school district has banned the Virginia state flag and seal from its online learning platform for younger students due to concerns about nudity. The flag depicts the Roman goddess Virtus with a partially exposed breast, which the district deemed a violation of its policy against visual depictions of frontal nudity in elementary school materials. The move has sparked criticism from groups opposing censorship and book bans. The commonwealth of Virginia’s flag is periodically thrust into the national spotlight, and in 2010 was part a debate about what constitutes sexually explicit material in the state’s school libraries.</p>
