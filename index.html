        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union is actively preparing retaliatory measures as a trade agreement with the U.S. remains highly uncertain, with an August 1 deadline approaching for potential 30% U.S. tariffs on EU imports. Despite some market optimism following a U.S.-Japan deal, EU diplomats are hesitant, emphasizing that the final decision rests solely with President Trump. Brussels is developing comprehensive countermeasures, including combining previously prepared lists of retaliatory tariffs into a single list totaling 93 billion euros. Additionally, there's widespread discussion about deploying the "Anti-Coercion Instrument," a "nuclear option" that could severely restrict U.S. suppliers' access to the EU market, reflecting the bloc's determination to protect its economic interests.</p>

          <p>Deutsche Bank reported a net profit of 1.485 billion euros in the second quarter, significantly surpassing analyst forecasts and affirming its trajectory to meet full-year targets. This strong performance occurred despite headwinds like the euro's strength against the U.S. dollar and varied results within its crucial investment banking unit. Shares for the German lender surged over 5% following the announcement, approaching 10-year highs. While corporate banking revenues slightly declined due to a perceived "chill" in corporate activity, the bank's CFO highlighted encouraging momentum and disciplined cost management. The broader European banking sector navigates a low-interest rate environment, yet a recent surge in European defense spending presents new investment opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Launches AI Action Plan Targeting 'Woke AI' in Federal Government</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump signed three executive orders to launch an "American AI Action Plan," primarily focused on preventing "woke AI" in the federal government. One order mandates that federal AI models be neutral and nonpartisan, explicitly rejecting ideologies like Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), which the administration claims can lead to discriminatory outcomes and manipulate AI outputs. The plan also aims to spur AI innovation by reducing regulations and establish an "American AI Exports Program" to promote U.S. AI technology abroad. This initiative aligns with messages from companies like xAI, though recent controversies surrounding xAI's Grok chatbot highlight challenges in achieving AI neutrality.</p>

          <p>A passenger plane, an An-24 carrying 43 passengers and six crew members, including five children, vanished from radar in Russia's far eastern Amur region while en route from Blagoveshchensk to Tynda. Local authorities quickly confirmed the discovery of the aircraft's burning wreckage on a mountainside, approximately nine miles from its intended destination. Rescue efforts were promptly launched, with a search and rescue helicopter locating the fuselage. Initial aerial observations reported no evidence of survivors, suggesting a devastating outcome for all 49 individuals on board. Emergency services are now deploying ground teams to reach the remote crash site.</p>

          <p>Marcus Rashford's transfer from Manchester United to Barcelona has generated significant interest in Spain, with fans and journalists keenly observing how the English forward will integrate into the squad. Barcelona's sporting director highlighted a need for additional wingers, and Rashford's versatility, including his ability to play as a false nine, positions him as a valuable asset for providing rest to key players like Robert Lewandowski. Although Rashford was reportedly not the club's initial top choice and his acquisition was more cost-effective, there is a collective hope that he can reignite his career in the Catalan capital. His strong personality and past social activism are generally not viewed as concerns, with the primary focus remaining on his on-field performance and impact.</p>

          <p>As NFL training camps commence, several prominent players are notably absent, primarily due to ongoing contract negotiations, as they are unwilling to risk injury before securing new lucrative deals. Dallas Cowboys' Micah Parsons, Washington Commanders' Terry McLaurin, and Cincinnati Bengals' Trey Hendrickson are among the high-profile athletes holding out, each seeking significant extensions after delivering impressive on-field performances. The circumstances surrounding these holdouts vary, with some players, like McLaurin, entering the final year of their current contracts, while others, such as Hendrickson, have explicitly stated they will not play under their existing terms. These actions highlight the substantial financial stakes and strategic gambles players undertake to secure their long-term future in the league.</p>

          <p>India and the United Kingdom are set to sign a significant free trade deal, a "landmark" agreement aimed at substantially reducing tariffs on goods and increasing market access for both countries. This pact, which concluded negotiations in May, is projected to boost the British economy by £4.8 billion annually and elevate bilateral trade by an additional £25.5 billion by 2040. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is currently in the UK to formalize the deal, with scheduled talks with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and a meeting with King Charles. The agreement outlines India lowering tariffs on British goods such as whisky and cars, while the UK will increase imports of Indian textiles and gemstones.</p>

          <p>The White House has strongly refuted reports suggesting President Donald Trump was informed his name appeared in Justice Department documents related to convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, labeling the claims as "fake news." Attorney General Pam Bondi reportedly briefed Trump in May, indicating his name was among hundreds mentioned, though not implying any wrongdoing. This account, however, contradicts Trump's previous denial of such a briefing. Concurrently, a U.S. judge in Florida denied a bid to unseal Epstein court files, citing grand jury secrecy, while a U.S. House subcommittee voted to subpoena the Justice Department for its records. These developments underscore the persistent public scrutiny and conspiracy theories surrounding Epstein's case and the selective release of information.</p>

          <p>British car and van production in the first half of the year has significantly declined, reaching its lowest level since 1953, excluding the period of industry shutdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. Car output experienced a 7.3% fall, while van production dropped a substantial 45%, partly attributed to factory closures and pervasive trade uncertainty, particularly concerning U.S. tariffs. Although a recently enacted U.S.-UK tariff deal and government electric vehicle (EV) grants offer a glimmer of hope, the industry body SMMT cautions that the new EV grant system lacks clarity and was implemented without proper industry consultation. The SMMT does not foresee a return to 2021 production levels by the end of the decade, underscoring the formidable challenges facing the UK automotive sector.</p>

          <p>Tesla has announced ambitious plans to produce more affordable vehicles and secure regulatory approval for its self-driving software in Europe this year, following a decade-worst sales decline and shrinking profits. The electric car giant is grappling with several headwinds, including reduced U.S. government support for EVs, escalating competition from Chinese manufacturers, and perceived brand erosion due to Elon Musk's controversial political engagements. Musk remains optimistic about European sales once self-driving capabilities are approved, despite acknowledging the "kafkaesque" bureaucracy. This article highlights that Tesla's once-robust profit margins have significantly contracted, and Musk's public "shenanigans" are reportedly alienating some of the company's previously fervent customer base.

Madu, a self-taught artist who shares this trait with Van Gogh, draws profound inspiration from his vibrant upbringing in Lagos and identifies strongly as a "global citizen," embracing diverse cultural influences. His artistic endeavors serve as a heartfelt homage to Van Gogh, whose expressive use of color and brushstrokes captivated Madu from a young age, profoundly shaping his path towards painting as a powerful means of self-expression.</p>

          <p>China's waste-to-energy incineration industry is currently grappling with a significant oversupply, resulting in approximately 40% of its processing capacity remaining idle, despite the nation possessing the world's highest overall capacity.

While the volume of municipal solid waste collected increased by over 10% since 2019, the country's incineration capacity more than doubled within the same timeframe, leading to substantial underutilization of these facilities. Analysts now estimate the average capacity utilization at a mere 60%, underscoring a notable mismatch between optimistic industrial planning and the actual availability of waste.</p>

          <p>Deadly clashes have erupted between Thai and Cambodian military forces near disputed border temples, resulting in at least nine civilian fatalities and 14 injuries from Cambodian rocket and artillery strikes. Both nations are blaming each other for initiating the violence, which rapidly escalated with Thailand deploying F-16 fighter jets and Cambodia reporting aerial bombardments. In response, Thailand has closed all its border crossings and urged its citizens to depart Cambodia. Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Manet has formally requested an urgent United Nations Security Council meeting to address the situation. These renewed hostilities underscore the long-standing territorial disputes and escalating nationalist tensions that have persistently plagued relations between the two Southeast Asian neighbors.</p>

          <p>Court documents reveal that Pedro Arrupe, the late Jesuit global leader and a candidate for Catholic sainthood, was aware of multiple child sexual assault allegations against Donald J. Dickerson before his ordination as a priest. Despite warnings from a regional official describing Dickerson as a "poor risk," Arrupe did not prevent his ordination. Dickerson was later accused of sexually assaulting other minors. The lawsuit, accusing Dickerson of sexually assaulting a 17-year-old at a Jesuit university, raises serious questions about Arrupe's actions and the order's handling of abuse cases, prompting calls for Arrupe's canonization process to be re-evaluated.</p>

Similarly, quantum computing poses a threat to current encryption, with "harvest now, decrypt later" strategies already in play.

Students describe services as inadequate or difficult to navigate, leading to feelings of being "thrown between services." While universities emphasize that their services are supplementary to clinical NHS care, the debate centers on the extent of their responsibility. Academics often lack mental health training, and despite increased university spending on these services, a lack of standardized models and NHS capacity issues create gaps. Some argue for closer collaboration with health authorities, while others, like Natasha Abrahart's father, advocate for a stronger legal "duty of care."</p>
