          <p>A 42-year-old man is in custody following a stabbing attack at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan, that left eleven people injured. The incident, which officials described as a random act, occurred near the store's checkout area. The suspect allegedly used a folding knife, and several victims are reported to be in critical condition. Authorities, including the FBI, are investigating the attack, and officials have praised the swift response of first responders and citizens who helped apprehend the suspect.</p>

          <p>Approximately 4,000 NASA employees, representing about 20% of its workforce, have chosen to leave the agency through a deferred resignation program initiated by the Trump administration. This reduction is part of a broader plan to shrink the federal workforce and comes amid proposed budget cuts for the space agency. While the White House's budget proposal suggested a significant funding decrease, Congress is considering keeping funding near current levels. The move has drawn criticism from scientific organizations who fear it will undermine American leadership in space exploration.</p>

          <p>Virginia Tech's football program has launched an internal investigation following accusations from North Carolina Central's head coach, Trei Oliver. Oliver claimed that a Hokies assistant coach attempted to recruit one of his star running backs from the sideline during a game last season. He suggested the alleged tampering was an effort to persuade the player, believed to be J'Mari Taylor who later transferred to Virginia, to enter the transfer portal. Virginia Tech stated it was previously unaware of the issue and is committed to upholding NCAA rules and integrity.</p>

          <p>Emma Raducanu's run at the Washington Open has ended after she was defeated by Anna Kalinskaya in the semi-final with a score of 6-4, 6-3. Kalinskaya broke Raducanu's serve at a crucial moment to win the first set and maintained her momentum to secure the victory. This loss prevented a highly anticipated rematch of the 2021 US Open final between Raducanu and Leylah Fernandez. Kalinskaya will now face Fernandez in the final, after Fernandez won a marathon three-set match against Elena Rybakina.</p>

          <p>A new BBC documentary investigates the Jesus Army, a disgraced evangelical movement in the UK, revealing the extensive trauma suffered by its former members. The group, which disbanded five years ago, is accused of systemic child abuse, with disclosures accusing its founder of serious sexual assaults. The film director interviewed over 80 survivors, many still processing the psychological and physical abuse they endured. The article highlights the cult's dangerous environment, where children were separated from parents and subjected to beatings and manipulation.</p>

          <p>An American Airlines flight bound for Miami was evacuated on the runway at Denver International Airport due to a landing gear incident during takeoff. Officials reported that all 173 passengers and six crew members safely deplaned, with some using emergency slides as smoke was seen billowing from the aircraft. The incident involved a maintenance issue with a tire, which led to a small fire that was extinguished by the fire department. The FAA is investigating, and while airport operations were briefly halted, they have since returned to normal.</p>

Another recent study linked living near nanoplastic-polluted oceans to higher rates of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke.

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in several decades, with daytime high temperatures struggling to surpass the mid-60s. Meteorologists attribute the chilly, gray weather to a misplaced high-pressure system, which is sitting farther west than normal over the Pacific. This has allowed a low-pressure system to dominate, bringing unrelenting cloud cover and increasing a process called upwelling, where cold, deep ocean water is brought to the surface. While not record-breaking, the weather pattern is the coldest the Bay Area has seen since the late 1990s, with little change expected in the immediate forecast.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to reform licensing rules to protect pubs and music venues from noise complaints, a move aimed at revitalizing struggling town centers. Under the proposed changes, developers building new properties near existing venues would be responsible for soundproofing. The reforms also aim to fast-track permissions for new businesses and promote outdoor activities like al fresco dining and live performances. While the government touts the changes as a boost for the hospitality industry, the opposition has criticized the ruling party's tax policies for harming the sector.</p>

          <p>Opposition lawmakers in Taiwan have survived a recall vote, allowing them to maintain their controlling majority in the legislature and ensuring the continuation of political gridlock. The recall campaign targeted 24 lawmakers from the China-friendly KMT party, accusing them of undermining national security and obstructing the president's agenda. Since winning a parliamentary majority in early 2024, the opposition has stymied government spending and defense budgets amid rising military pressure from Beijing. The failure of the recall effort means President William Lai will likely face an emboldened opposition for the remainder of his term.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has exposed how a convicted fraudster, James Kenny, orchestrated an elaborate, non-existent music festival called Monmouth Rising. The event promised a major lineup including Glastonbury headliners and claimed to be the world's first hydrogen-powered festival, attracting employees and suppliers with false promises of investment and support. Kenny allegedly used forged documents and dropped names of prominent investors to build credibility for the multi-million pound event. The festival was eventually canceled after employees went unpaid and suppliers discovered the entire operation was built on lies, leaving many out of pocket.</p>

This move is designed to encourage more European countries to formally recognize a Palestinian state, a step France plans to take on September 21. The proposal aims to present a post-war roadmap leading to a two-state solution, covering security, reconstruction, and governance. The initiative comes as France urges the European Commission to take a tougher stance on Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank.</p>

Czuba was convicted of murdering 6-year-old Wadee Alfayoumi and attempting to murder his mother, Hanan Shaheen, in October 2023. Prosecutors demonstrated that Czuba targeted the pair because they were Palestinian American and Muslim, with the attack occurring shortly after the start of the Israel-Hamas war. The case drew international attention and highlighted rising anti-Muslim sentiment in the U.S., particularly within the large local Palestinian community.</p>

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight from Burbank to Las Vegas took a sudden dive of nearly 500 feet to avoid a potential midair collision with another aircraft. The incident occurred just six minutes after takeoff when an onboard alert warned pilots of a decommissioned Hawker Hunter fighter jet in the vicinity. The FAA is investigating the event, which resulted in minor injuries to one flight attendant. This near-miss highlights ongoing concerns about air traffic control staffing shortages, which have been criticized following a fatal collision earlier this year and workforce reductions under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's broad use of tariffs, justified under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), is facing significant legal challenges in federal court. A key lawsuit argues that the president has exceeded his authority by unilaterally imposing duties, a power no previous president has claimed under the nearly 50-year-old law. While a lower court struck down the tariffs, an appeals court has kept them in effect pending a final ruling. The outcome of this case, which is expected to reach the Supreme Court, could invalidate numerous recent trade deals and tariff implementations. (not investment advice)</p>
