          <p>Maro Itoje is anticipated to be named captain of the British and Irish Lions for their tour of Australia, making him the first Englishman to hold the position since 2001. The announcement is set to occur at the O2 Arena, where the full Lions squad will also be revealed. Itoje's leadership of England during the 2025 Six Nations, where they finished second, and his endorsement from former Lions, including Matt Dawson, have solidified his candidacy. The Lions are scheduled to play Argentina in Dublin before commencing their Australian tour with a match against Western Force, culminating in a three-Test series against the Wallabies.</p>

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles has experienced a 35% decrease in cargo volume following tariff increases on Chinese goods, impacting numerous businesses linked to the port, including trucking, shipping, and distribution centers. Port officials anticipate that the decline will soon affect manufacturers, retailers, and consumers nationwide, potentially leading to shortages and price hikes. The port complex handles a substantial portion of the U.S.'s container traffic, supporting many jobs in the region. The executive director of the Port of Los Angeles, Gene Seroka, expressed concern about the situation and its broader economic implications.</p>

          <p>A piece of the Soviet-era spacecraft Kosmos 482, launched in 1972 as part of a mission to Venus, is predicted to re-enter Earth's atmosphere. NASA believes that the lander probe, a durable, spherical object about a meter wide and weighing nearly half a tonne, may survive the descent. While the exact landing location is uncertain, experts consider the risk to people on the ground to be low, given that 70% of the planet is covered by water. The capsule's projected flight path spans most of the inhabited world, ranging from London to the southern tip of South America.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England is widely expected to reduce interest rates, potentially lowering them to 4.25% from 4.5%, a move that would decrease borrowing costs for businesses and individuals. This would be the fourth rate reduction since last year's peak of 5.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee is closely monitoring the rate of inflation, aiming to keep it near the 2% target, and considering global economic uncertainties, including President Trump's tariff policies. A rate cut could influence mortgage pricing and savings returns, although lenders have already factored in the anticipated change.</p>

          <p>Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier is contesting a federal judge's decision to halt the enforcement of a new state immigration law. Uthmeier argues that the law, which makes it a misdemeanor for illegal immigrants to enter Florida, aligns with federal law and that the judge's ruling violates the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution. He asserts that Florida is aiding the United States in curbing illegal immigration and is seeking a stay of the motion from the 11th Circuit Court. Uthmeier emphasizes that he cannot order law enforcement officers to disregard the law, as they are not party to the order.</p>

          <p>A US judge in Boston has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to deport migrants to Libya, citing concerns that the plan would violate due process rights. The order came after reports that the US military was preparing to fly migrants to Libya, a country mired in conflict and considered unsafe by the US State Department. Immigration lawyers swiftly moved to prevent the deportations, arguing that they would defy a previous court order protecting migrants' rights. Libya is one of several countries the Trump administration has approached regarding migrant deportations.</p>

          <p>In a Memphis courtroom, three former police officers were acquitted of all state charges, including second-degree murder, related to the death of Tyre Nichols, a Black man, following a brutal beating in 2023.

The three officers, Demetrius Haley, Tadarrius Bean, and Justin Smith, were previously convicted of witness tampering in a federal trial but acquitted of civil rights violations causing Mr. Nichols’s death, though Mr. Haley was convicted of civil rights violations causing bodily injury. The case sparked national outrage and prompted calls for police reform after video footage showed the officers beating Mr. Nichols during a traffic stop.</p>

Air raid sirens were activated in numerous locations across India as part of nationwide preparedness exercises, while Pakistan considered its response, calling the missile strikes an act of war. India stated that it targeted infrastructure used by militants linked to a recent massacre of tourists, while Pakistan reported casualties from the strikes and claimed to have shot down several Indian aircraft. The U.S. has urged both countries to exercise restraint.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve decided to keep interest rates unchanged for the third consecutive meeting, amidst growing concerns about the economic impact of President Trump’s tariffs. The unanimous decision maintains interest rates between 4.25 percent and 4.5 percent, where they have been since December. Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the labor market's strength but also noted heightened uncertainty and increased risks of higher unemployment and inflation. Powell emphasized the Fed's readiness to respond to economic developments but refrained from indicating any immediate plans for rate cuts, citing a need for more data.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas experienced its wettest May on record after a storm system delivered four consecutive days of rain, causing widespread flooding. In Henderson, a man was swept away by floodwaters, prompting search and rescue efforts. The unusual rainfall, attributed to a low-pressure system interacting with Pacific moisture, surpassed the previous record set in 1969. While flooding occurred on the Las Vegas Strip, including in the Linq hotel's parking garage, the overall impact highlighted the region's vulnerability to intense storms amid longer-term drought conditions. It is not possible to draw a direct connection between this particular rain event and climate change, but scientists have pointed out that climate change is resulting in more extreme weather events.</p>
