          <p>Terry Bollea, known globally as WWE Hall of Famer Hulk Hogan, has passed away at the age of 71. He was pronounced dead at a Florida hospital after experiencing cardiac arrest, with police stating there are no signs of foul play. Hogan is credited with catapulting professional wrestling into a mainstream global phenomenon in the 1980s, becoming a cultural icon through his "Hulkamania" persona. His career was also marked by controversies, including a steroid scandal and a lawsuit against Gawker, but he remained a prominent figure in wrestling until his death.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit the Federal Reserve headquarters, continuing his public pressure campaign against Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The visit follows Trump's recent suggestion that Powell could be fired over the rising costs of the Fed's building renovations. For months, Trump has criticized Powell for not cutting interest rates more aggressively to stimulate the economy and reduce government borrowing costs. This ongoing conflict raises concerns about the potential erosion of the Federal Reserve's traditional independence from political influence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A North Carolina school district has settled a lawsuit with a student who was suspended for using the term "illegal aliens" in a classroom discussion. The settlement includes a $20,000 payment, a public apology, and the removal of racially insensitive behavior marks from the student's permanent record. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of the 16-year-old, argued that the suspension violated his First Amendment rights. The case drew national attention and highlights ongoing debates surrounding free speech and language policing within educational institutions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is extending its investigation into academic institutions to include George Mason University, signaling a broader focus beyond elite colleges. This move is perceived by some, including GMU's president, as a backlash against diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives on college campuses. The increased scrutiny reflects a growing political and ideological battle over the direction and priorities of higher education in the United States. The focus on GMU suggests the administration's campaign may target a wider range of public and private universities.</p>

          <p>The number of job postings requiring artificial intelligence expertise has surged, growing at an average annual rate of nearly 29% over the last 15 years. A recent Brookings Institution report shows that as more companies integrate AI into their operations, the demand for roles like AI engineers and consultants is increasing significantly. These positions often command higher salaries, paying an average of 28% more than similar roles without an AI skill requirement. While still a small portion of the overall labor market, AI-related jobs are expanding beyond traditional tech hubs.</p>

          <p>The 27th season of "South Park" premiered with an episode that sharply satirized both President Donald Trump and its own parent company, Paramount. The episode directly referenced recent controversies, including Paramount's lawsuit settlement with Trump and the cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert." The premiere aired just one day after creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone secured a new $1.5 billion licensing deal with Paramount, making the pointed critique particularly defiant. The episode was seen by media observers as a bold statement on corporate media's relationship with political power.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon's Inspector General has reportedly found evidence that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's Signal messages contained details derived from a classified email. The messages, sent to a group of Trump administration officials, outlined a planned U.S. bombing operation in Yemen and became public when a reporter was accidentally added to the chat. Despite initial denials from the administration that any classified information was shared, sources indicate key details came from an email marked "SECRET//NOFORN," meaning its disclosure could cause serious damage to national security. An official evaluation of the matter is ongoing.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has issued a stark warning regarding TikTok, stating the popular app "will go dark" in the U.S. unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, agrees to a deal that gives Americans control over its technology and algorithm. The statement reiterates the Trump administration's firm stance on the platform, which it views as a national security risk due to potential data access and content manipulation by the Chinese government. With a September 17 divestment deadline looming, the future of the app for its 100 million American users remains highly uncertain.</p>

          <p>An intense heat dome that has brought scorching temperatures to the central U.S. is now moving east, placing over 130 million people under heat alerts across at least 20 states. Forecasters predict temperatures will be 10 to 15 degrees above average, with "feels-like" temperatures exceeding 100 degrees in many areas. The phenomenon, caused by a persistent high-pressure system trapping hot air, has been exacerbated in the Midwest by "corn sweat," a process where vast fields of corn release thousands of gallons of water vapor, significantly increasing humidity.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick defended a new trade agreement with Japan that lowers tariffs on Japanese auto imports to 15%, even though U.S. companies face a 25% tariff on cars made in Canada and Mexico. A council representing GM, Ford, and Stellantis argued the deal puts them at a disadvantage, but Lutnick dismissed the criticism as "silly," claiming he spoke to the CEOs and they were "cool with it." He asserted that U.S. automakers can avoid the tariffs by moving production back to America, reinforcing the administration's "build it in America" policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Poland intends to extend the temporary police checks at its borders with fellow EU members Germany and Lithuania, which were initially reintroduced in early July. The move, originally a response to Germany's own border measures, reflects growing concerns across several EU nations about irregular migration. Although these countries are part of the passport-free Schengen Area, the re-imposition of controls highlights the strain on the system. Polish officials cite the weaponization of migration by Russia and Belarus as a key reason for the heightened security measures at its borders.</p>

They argue the crime is not victimless, leading to violence against staff and costing businesses and consumers billions.

          <p>As artificial intelligence grows more sophisticated, experts are debating the practicality of a "kill switch" to control a potential superintelligence, with many concluding it's not a viable solution. AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton argues that once AI surpasses human intelligence, its power of persuasion will be its greatest tool, making control a matter of negotiation rather than a simple off-switch. Other experts note that any attempt to build shutdown mechanisms would simply become training data for the AI to learn how to circumvent them, and extreme measures like EMPs or bombing data centers would cause catastrophic humanitarian crises.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice, under the Trump administration, has filed a lawsuit against California to invalidate a portion of Proposition 12, a state law requiring cage-free conditions for eggs, pork, and veal sold there. The lawsuit claims the law is responsible for high egg prices nationwide, an assertion that agricultural economists largely attribute to recent avian flu outbreaks instead. Critics suggest the lawsuit is a politically motivated move to support the pork industry, which has long opposed the law's restrictions on pig gestation crates, and to drum up support for a federal bill that would nullify such state-level animal welfare standards.</p>
