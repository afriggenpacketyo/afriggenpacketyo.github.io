          <p>A rapidly spreading wildfire, named the Canyon Fire, has prompted mandatory evacuations for over 2,700 residents near the Los Angeles and Ventura county line. Fueled by extreme heat and dry conditions, the blaze grew from 30 to nearly 5,000 acres overnight and remains completely uncontained. While no injuries or structural damages have been reported yet, authorities are urging residents in threatened areas to heed evacuation orders immediately. This fire is one of several active blazes in the state, highlighting the growing threat posed by climate change, which has led to longer and more destructive fire seasons in California.</p>

          <p>An American man from Dallas was killed by a Cape buffalo he was tracking during a trophy hunting safari in South Africa's Limpopo province. The 52-year-old was reportedly fatally gored in a sudden, unprovoked attack by the animal. The safari company involved described the Cape buffalo as the most dangerous animal to hunt in Africa, known for its aggressive and vengeful behavior. The incident highlights the inherent dangers of trophy hunting, a practice that generates significant revenue for South Africa, with foreign hunters spending tens of thousands of dollars per visit.</p>

          <p>Sami Sheen, the 21-year-old daughter of actors Charlie Sheen and Denise Richards, detailed an alarming encounter where she believes she was nearly a victim of sex trafficking. In a TikTok video, she explained how two men persistently approached her and a friend in a restaurant parking lot late at night, making her feel intensely uneasy. Her instincts prompted her to pull out her pepper spray, which she alleges caused one of the men to back off, allowing her and her friend to escape in their car. She later discovered photos showing one of the men had been watching them for some time and urged her followers to always trust their gut instincts.</p>

Although the USDA has cleared the Jarratt facility, recent inspection reports from other Boar's Head plants in Arkansas, Indiana, and Virginia reveal persistent sanitation issues. These problems, including meat residue on equipment and blocked drains, mirror the conditions that led to the deadly contamination. Food safety advocates and lawmakers have expressed alarm over the findings, questioning the company's commitment to reform and the effectiveness of federal oversight.</p>

          <p>A government watchdog group, the Democracy Defenders Fund, has formally requested a federal investigation into the Pentagon's acceptance of a luxury Boeing 747-8 jet from the Qatari royal family on behalf of President Trump. The group alleges the action may violate laws against accepting foreign gifts and represents a misuse of public funds, as nearly $1 billion was reportedly diverted from a nuclear missile program to retrofit the aircraft. Critics argue the jet is redundant given the existing Air Force One fleet, calling the arrangement a staggering abuse of public trust and national security priorities.</p>

In response, Republican Governor Greg Abbott has escalated the conflict, while Democrats garner support from national figures, turning the state-level dispute into a national political battle.</p>

An NPR report from Santiago investigates the personal and societal factors contributing to the country's plummeting fertility rates.

This demographic change presents long-term economic and social challenges for the region, mirroring issues faced by many developed nations.</p>

          <p>The annual Perseids meteor shower, one of the most anticipated celestial events, is set to peak next week, but viewing conditions will be less than ideal. A bright, 84% full waning gibbous moon will coincide with the peak on August 12-13, significantly reducing visibility. The American Meteor Society estimates that the moonlight could obscure up to 75% of the meteors, with viewers likely to see only 10-20 per hour instead of the usual 50 or more in dark skies. For better viewing, experts suggest watching a week after the peak when the moon is less prominent, or finding a location far from city lights.</p>

The daughter argues that a swifter police response could have sent a deterrent message and prevented the fatal attack.

          <p>As interest rates on Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are expected to decline, financial experts suggest using a CD laddering strategy to maximize returns while maintaining flexibility. This approach involves opening multiple CDs with staggered maturity dates, such as three-month, six-month, and one-year terms. This allows savers to lock in the current high rates before they drop further, while ensuring that portions of their money become accessible at regular intervals. In the current economic climate, laddering provides a balanced way to earn high interest without committing all funds to long-term, inflexible accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum firmly stated there would be "no invasion of Mexico" following reports that President Trump has directed the Pentagon to prepare military options against drug cartels. The directive reportedly provides a basis for U.S. military operations against cartels that the administration has designated as terrorist organizations. Sheinbaum asserted that while her government was aware of the executive order, it was assured it did not involve deploying U.S. military personnel within Mexican territory. The development escalates tensions over U.S. anti-cartel strategy, with Mexico emphasizing collaboration over foreign intervention.</p>

          <p>A group of 49 Democratic members of Congress is demanding an investigation into the Department of Homeland Security's immigration enforcement tactics, citing cases where American citizens have been wrongfully detained or even deported. The lawmakers sent letters to DHS oversight offices requesting a full accounting of these incidents to determine if the civil rights of Americans are being violated. Amid reports of a 4-year-old with cancer being deported and other citizens being held for hours, advocates fear the problem will worsen as the administration expands its enforcement operations. The DHS has defended its actions.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has dismissed a criminal contempt finding against the Trump administration concerning the deportation of over 250 Venezuelan migrants to a prison in El Salvador. A lower court judge had found that officials willfully disregarded his order to halt the deportations, which were carried out without due process under the Alien Enemies Act. However, the divided appeals court panel ruled that the lower court's order raised "troubling questions about judicial control over core executive functions" like foreign policy. The decision is a victory for the administration's aggressive anti-immigration agenda.</p>

          <p>Shares of ad-tech firm The Trade Desk experienced their worst day on record, falling almost 40%, despite beating second-quarter earnings and revenue expectations. The dramatic drop was triggered by a combination of negative factors, including the unexpected departure of its CFO, concerns about the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs on ad spending, and rising competition. Analysts highlighted the growing strength of Amazon's advertising platform as a significant threat that could erode The Trade Desk's value proposition over time.

After the HM Coastguard confirmed their identity, Lowe admitted his mistake and pledged to donate £1,000 to their cause. The rowers said they found the incident "hilarious" as they watched people gather on the shore and police arrive.</p>

Trump has expressed his disappointment, and the White House maintains that its priority is a negotiated peace.

          <p>As Virginia Woolf's novel *Mrs. Dalloway* marks its 100th anniversary, this article explores its lasting significance, particularly as a masterpiece of the midlife crisis. The book, which unfolds over a single day, juxtaposes the life of its 51-year-old protagonist with that of a young, traumatized World War I veteran. While often read in college for its modernist style and depiction of post-war trauma, the novel offers new layers of meaning when reread at different stages of life. The article suggests that Clarissa Dalloway's anxieties about mortality and her ultimate affirmation of life resonate deeply with the experience of middle age.</p>

The primary goal is to run out the clock on the special session, but this strategy faces significant hurdles, including financial strain, personal pressures on lawmakers to return home, and political pressure from Republican leaders. Governor Greg Abbott has threatened fines and arrests, and courts have previously postponed election deadlines in similar situations. Experts suggest that while the quorum break is effective for messaging, it will probably delay, but not prevent, the new maps.</p>
