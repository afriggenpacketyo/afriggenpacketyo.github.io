          <p>President Trump held a rally in Iowa to celebrate the congressional passage of his administration's major tax and spending bill, which he called a great birthday present for America. He highlighted the legislation's tax cuts, border security funding, and spending reductions as key victories. During the event, Trump also previewed plans for the nation's 250th anniversary celebration, which will include a "Great American State Fair" starting in Iowa and a UFC fight on the White House lawn. He also reiterated the success of recent military strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities.</p>

          <p>An explosion and subsequent fire at a fireworks warehouse in Yolo County, California, have left seven people unaccounted for. The facility, Devastating Pyrotechnics, was later found to be operating without local licenses on agricultural property. The incident, which injured two people and caused a smoke plume reaching up to 15,000 feet, is now under investigation by multiple agencies, including the ATF. Family members have identified some of the missing, who are believed to have been working at the warehouse when the blasts occurred.</p>

          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has confirmed that discussions are underway to form a new left-wing political party in the United Kingdom. The announcement followed former Labour MP Zarah Sultana's decision to quit the party, with Corbyn stating he was delighted she would help build a "real alternative." This move aims to formalize an existing alliance of independent, pro-Gaza MPs into a political entity that could contest future elections. The development reflects growing dissatisfaction among some on the left with the current Labour government's policies.</p>

          <p>Congress has passed a massive legislative package that makes President Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent while also enacting significant policy changes. The bill introduces new restrictions and work requirements for Medicaid and SNAP benefits, which the CBO estimates could cause millions to lose coverage. It also allocates billions for border security, raises the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, and rolls back many green energy tax incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act. The legislation passed narrowly along party lines and now heads to the president's desk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Famed Mexican boxer Julio César Chávez Jr. has been arrested by U.S. immigration officials in Los Angeles for allegedly overstaying his visa and providing fraudulent statements on a green card application. The arrest occurred just days after his high-profile fight against Jake Paul. Authorities state Chávez Jr. will be deported to Mexico, where he faces an outstanding arrest warrant related to organized crime and arms trafficking. His detention is part of the Trump administration's broader immigration enforcement actions, with officials stating that no one is above the law.</p>

The blast occurred after a tanker truck reportedly hit a pipe, causing a gas leak and an initial, smaller explosion that emergency services were already responding to. A subsequent, much larger fireball caused extensive damage to nearby vehicles and buildings, with the impact felt across the city. Authorities said that the prior evacuation of a nearby sports center helped avert a much more serious tragedy.</p>

This funding crisis could force the U.S. to abandon its leadership in space science, as other nations like China and the European Space Agency advance their own ambitious exoplanet-studying missions.

The other examines the work of fashion designer Claire McCardell, who created practical, comfortable clothing for women as "doers."

          <p>An opinion article reflects on the difficulty of celebrating the Fourth of July's ideals of freedom while perceiving a decline in American democracy and civil rights. It draws a parallel to Frederick Douglass's famous 1852 speech, noting that marginalized communities have always seen the gap between America's promise and its reality. The authors argue that despite a federal government increasingly hostile to racial equity and civil liberties, hope lies in grassroots action. They advocate for community-level engagement to build a democracy that lives up to its promises.</p>

          <p>With the Trump administration set to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitian nationals, families in communities like Springfield, Ohio, are in a desperate race against time. They are trying to secure U.S. passports for their American-born children to prevent family separation or the children becoming stateless if the parents are deported. A federal judge has temporarily blocked the termination, but fear remains high following a recent Supreme Court ruling against Venezuelan TPS holders. Volunteers are helping families navigate the bureaucracy, fearing a potential humanitarian crisis if thousands of children are left behind.</p>

          <p>The latest installment in the Jurassic Park franchise, "Jurassic World Rebirth," attempts to reset the series by returning to a more isolated, jungle-based setting. The film is praised for its impressive sense of scale and visually clear action sequences, but is criticized for being a plodding and disenchanting experience. The review argues that the movie lacks memorable characters, narrative stakes, and a compelling reason to exist beyond its box office potential. Despite a capable cast, the characters are thinly drawn, and the dinosaurs are reduced to little more than background wallpaper.</p>

          <p>This historical commentary explores how the Continental Army, under George Washington's command, was instrumental in creating a unified American identity during the Revolutionary War. Initially, the colonies were disparate and competitive, and Washington himself viewed the troops as a disorderly mix. However, the shared experience of hardship and sacrifice during the war forged a common bond and a national spirit. The army established new traditions, such as celebrating Washington's birthday and adopting a national flag, laying the groundwork for a national identity that transcended colonial distinctions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This essay reflects on the enduring relevance of Virginia Woolf's "A Room of One's Own" from a modern, intersectional feminist perspective. The author describes initially avoiding the book, viewing it as a symbol of privileged white feminism, but later finding its core arguments about the suppression of women's voices to be powerful and resonant. The article connects Woolf's ideas on the need for financial and personal space to create art with contemporary issues like the gender pay gap and the undervaluing of women's stories. It also considers the book's limitations while celebrating its foundational insights.</p>
