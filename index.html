          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 04:08:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Microsoft report, analyzing interactions with its Bing Copilot, identifies blue-collar professions such as painters and nursing assistants as the most secure against artificial intelligence automation. The study indicates that AI predominantly assists with information gathering, writing, and communication, making white-collar roles more susceptible to AI integration and impact. This trend suggests that occupations requiring complex physical work, direct human interaction, or problem-solving in unstructured environments are less prone to AI displacement. The article highlights that these blue-collar careers are gaining stability and demand, often evolving to incorporate new technological knowledge and offering competitive compensation.</p>

          <p>A man in Florida was arrested for allegedly stealing Smokey Bear signs from state forests and attempting to sell them on Facebook Marketplace for $1,900 each. Florida Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson announced the arrest, humorously stating Smokey the Bear "personally assisted" in the apprehension. The suspect faces pending criminal charges, with officials emphasizing Smokey Bear's iconic status, known by children and families across the United States, as a crucial symbol for forest fire prevention. This unusual incident underscores the state's boosted efforts, including controlled burns and upgraded equipment, to prevent wildfires and deter criminal activity within its protected natural areas.</p>

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a victim of Jeffrey Epstein, has publicly urged President Donald Trump not to pardon Ghislaine Maxwell, calling her a "monster" who deserves to remain imprisoned. Their statement also questioned Trump's recent remark that Epstein "stole people that worked for me," including Giuffre, who was a Mar-a-Lago employee. The family clarified that Maxwell preyed on Giuffre while she worked for Trump, raising concerns about his awareness of the criminal actions. This appeal comes as Trump faces questions about his historical ties to Epstein and Maxwell's recent meetings with Justice Department officials.</p>

          <p>A Delta Airlines flight from Salt Lake City to Amsterdam was forced to make an emergency landing in Minneapolis after encountering severe turbulence, resulting in 25 hospitalizations. The aircraft experienced a sharp altitude change roughly 40 minutes into the flight, prompting the diversion. Paramedics and fire crews met the plane upon its safe landing at Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport. This incident highlights the growing concern among scientists that climate change may lead to more frequent and severe in-flight turbulence, following a recent fatality on another major airline due to similar conditions.</p>

          <p>OpenAI is spearheading the development of a massive AI data center in Norway, dubbed "Stargate," in a joint venture with British firm Nscale and Norwegian energy company Aker. This marks OpenAI's first major data center project in Europe, aiming to house 100,000 Nvidia GPUs by late 2026. The facility, powered entirely by renewable energy, will have 230 megawatts of capacity, making it one of Europe's largest. This initiative aligns with Europe's push for "sovereign AI" and aims to address the continent's computing capacity fragmentation, facilitating the development of new AI products and economic growth.</p>

          <p>A barrage of Russian drones and missiles struck multiple districts in Kyiv, killing at least six people, including a six-year-old boy, and injuring over 50. One strike destroyed an entire entrance of a residential high-rise, with three fatalities occurring there. Ukrainian officials reported extensive damage across dozens of locations, including a hospital, school, and kindergarten. This attack comes despite US President Donald Trump's recent threats of tougher sanctions against Moscow if a ceasefire is not agreed upon, with Ukrainian President Zelensky condemning the continued "demonstrative murder" by Russia.</p>

Critics, particularly from France, condemn the agreement as an "admission of weakness" and an "imperial tribute."

          <p>The Hamas-run civil defense agency in Gaza reports that at least 30 Palestinians were killed and 300 wounded by Israeli gunfire while waiting for humanitarian aid in northern Gaza. Israel's Defense Forces (IDF) stated they fired "warning shots" but were "not aware of any casualties" from their gunfire, with details still being examined. This incident adds to a grim toll, as the UN human rights office reports over 1,000 Palestinians killed by the Israeli military seeking food aid since late May. The situation underscores warnings from food security experts about famine in Gaza, despite recent Israeli "tactical pauses" for aid.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's imposition of 25% duties and an unspecified "penalty" on Indian imports, New Delhi has not rushed into a trade deal with Washington. India's Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal indicated the country prioritizes protecting its local farmers and sensitive agricultural sectors, which form a significant voting bloc. Analysts suggest India's strong economic position and "multi-alignment strategy" give it leverage, allowing it to negotiate on its own terms and explore deals elsewhere. The article highlights India's strategic importance to the US as an alternative manufacturing hub to China, influencing Washington's approach. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Samsung Electronics reported a second-quarter operating profit of 4.7 trillion Korean won, missing expectations, primarily due to a staggering 93.8% profit slump in its chip business.

Despite the downturn, Samsung's CFO expressed optimism for a gradual recovery in the second half, driven by AI and robotics momentum.

South Korean officials expressed regret over the new tariff rate, which replaces years of near-zero duties, and noted differing interpretations of the "90% of profits" claim made by US officials.

Democrats argue the map intentionally fragments minority representation, particularly Black and Latino communities, for political gain. They warn of a "dangerous domino effect" across other states and suggest the strategy could backfire given recent polling shifts among Latino voters.
