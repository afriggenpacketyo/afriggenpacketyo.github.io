          <p>Eleven adult men escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in New Orleans, prompting a full-scale search operation involving local, state, and federal law enforcement. One inmate, Kendell Myles, has been apprehended, but ten remain at large, including Gary Price, who was charged with attempted first-degree murder. Authorities believe the inmates likely had assistance and have changed out of their jail clothes, urging the public to remain vigilant but avoid panic as the investigation continues. The Orleans Justice Center is located less than 3 miles from the French Quarter, a tourist hotspot, increasing the urgency of the search. Optimism score must be a multiple of 5 between 0 and 100.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home electricity bills are projected to reach an average of $784 this summer, marking a 12-year high, according to an analysis by the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA). This increase, driven by high temperatures and rising electricity prices, could strain household budgets, particularly for low-income families who spend a larger portion of their income on energy costs. The analysis also points out that public assistance programs have not kept pace with the evolving climate, leaving many families vulnerable to heat-related health risks if they are unable to afford air conditioning. Modernizing homes with better insulation can help households save money in the long run.</p>

Nvidia's 7% stake in CoreWeave is now valued at approximately $2 billion following this week's surge.

          <p>A New York Times article reports that while most Americans may see lower taxes under the Republican tax plan, the spending cuts implemented to offset those tax cuts could outweigh the benefits and leave some worse off. A nonpartisan assessment found that many Americans making less than $51,000 a year would see their after-tax income fall as a result of the Republican proposal beginning in 2026. The top 0.1 percent, including those with incomes over $4.3 million, would gain on average more than $389,000 in after-tax income in 2026, the data show.</p>
