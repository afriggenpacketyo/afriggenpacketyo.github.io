            <p>In the trial of Bryan Kohberger, accused of the Idaho student killings, a judge ruled that a former roommate can testify about seeing an intruder with "bushy eyebrows." The defense argued the testimony is unreliable, but the judge deemed it admissible for cross-examination. The judge also addressed the use of Kohberger's medical diagnoses during the trial, stating they cannot be used to explain his courtroom demeanor unless he testifies. The prosecution aims to prevent mental conditions from limiting Kohberger's culpability if convicted.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court issued an order preventing the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan immigrants without due process, suggesting a potential shift in the Court's tolerance of the administration's procedural tactics. The order came in response to concerns that immigrants were being moved to a Texas facility, given short notice in English (despite many speaking only Spanish), and potentially deported to El Salvador without a fair chance to challenge their removal. This follows previous rulings requiring hearings for these immigrants, but the Court now seems less willing to accept attempts to evade meaningful judicial review.</p>

            <p>US Vice-President JD Vance met with Vatican officials to discuss international conflicts, immigration, and religious freedom. The Vatican expressed satisfaction with the Trump administration's commitment to protecting religious freedom but voiced concern over war-torn countries and the treatment of migrants. The meeting comes amid tensions between the Trump administration and the Catholic Church over immigration policies and differing views on social justice issues. Vance, a Catholic convert, identifies with a "post-liberal" movement.</p>

            <p>Pakistan has expelled over 19,500 Afghans this month, with more than 80,000 leaving before the April 30 deadline, citing an inability to cope with the large refugee population. Many expelled Afghans were born in Pakistan and have never lived in Afghanistan. The deportations raise concerns about national security and strain public services, according to the Pakistani government. The UN estimates that half of the 3.5 million Afghans in Pakistan are undocumented, including 700,000 who arrived after the Taliban takeover in 2021.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump announced steps to make it easier to fire federal workers by stripping civil service protections and reclassifying them as "at-will" employees. The new "Schedule Policy/Career" classification will affect approximately 50,000 federal workers. The administration claims this will allow for the removal of corrupt or underperforming employees who refuse to advance the President's policies. The new rule, proposed by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), requires an executive order from Trump after a final rule is issued.</p>

            <p>The article explores the link between financial security and a shift towards right-wing populism. A growing number of affluent voters support policies that prioritize tax cuts, deregulation, and reduced immigration. This new social contract favors the wealthy, who are less concerned with social safety nets for the poor. Oxford academics have found that financial security reduces risk aversion, making voters more tolerant of radical political policies. The article questions whether recent economic events will alter this trend.</p>

            <p>The Menendez brothers' resentencing hearing has been delayed until May due to disputes between the defense and prosecution. The brothers, convicted of murdering their parents in 1996, seek to have their charges reduced to manslaughter, potentially leading to their release. The new district attorney, Nathan Hochman, opposes resentencing, arguing the brothers haven't taken responsibility and weren't abused. The family, mostly supporting their release, criticizes Hochman's handling of the case. The hearing will address the district attorney's office's recusal and review a risk assessment report.</p>
