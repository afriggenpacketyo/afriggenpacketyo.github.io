          <p>Authorities in Montana have captured Michael Brown, the 45-year-old suspect accused of killing four people at a bar in Anaconda. The arrest followed a weeklong manhunt involving approximately 130 law enforcement officers. Brown, an Army veteran with known mental health issues, allegedly opened fire in a bar where he was a regular, killing four individuals in what officials described as a cold-blooded act. The capture brought a sense of relief to the community, which had been on edge since the tragic event. The victims' families and local residents are now grappling with the aftermath of the violence.</p>

          <p>A shooting in New York City's Times Square resulted in injuries to three people early Saturday morning. Police report that a 17-year-old opened fire following a verbal dispute, injuring an 18-year-old woman, a 19-year-old man, and a 65-year-old man. All victims were transported to a local hospital and are in stable condition, with one person currently in custody for questioning. This incident occurs despite a significant city-wide decrease in gun crime, with New York recording its lowest number of shooting incidents for the first seven months of the year since record-keeping began.</p>

          <p>In a significant diplomatic achievement, the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a historic peace agreement at the White House, ending decades of conflict. The U.S.-brokered deal establishes a major transit corridor, to be named the 'Trump Route,' linking Azerbaijan to its exclave of Nakhchivan through Armenian territory. Both nations' leaders credited President Trump for facilitating the breakthrough, which was hailed by international figures as a major step toward regional stability. The agreement also signifies a shift in geopolitical influence, diminishing Russia's long-standing role as a mediator in the South Caucasus region.</p>

          <p>OpenAI's latest model, GPT-5, has been met with mixed reviews in China, a key market in the global artificial intelligence race. While OpenAI CEO Sam Altman touted it as the company's smartest and most useful model yet, some Chinese tech experts have expressed disappointment, describing it as lacking revolutionary breakthroughs. The new system integrates a 'thinking' function designed to switch between standard and deep modes based on query complexity. This lukewarm reception highlights the heightened competition and high expectations within China's rapidly advancing domestic AI industry.</p>

          <p>Protests are escalating across the UK regarding the government's use of hotels to accommodate asylum seekers, sparking a contentious debate about immigration and community safety. In towns like Epping, demonstrations have been fueled by local residents' fears, particularly after a hotel resident was charged with sexual assault. While some activists see far-right influence stirring division, many protesters are ordinary citizens concerned about the lack of transparency and the impact on their communities. The situation is complicated by a lack of official data on hotel occupants, leaving public concerns to be filled by speculation and anxiety.</p>

A new state-owned enterprise has been established to oversee the railway, which will create a 2,000km (1,240-mile) artery by linking the existing Lhasa-Shigatse line with a new route from Hotan. This railway is part of a larger plan to establish a 5,000km plateau rail network centered on Lhasa by 2035. The project's scope also includes diversified operations like real estate development, tourism, and international contracting, signaling its broad economic and strategic importance.</p>

          <p>Travelers can avoid unexpectedly high cell phone bills abroad by employing several strategies, as one reporter learned after incurring nearly $50 in extra charges over five days in Paris. Experts suggest that the best approach depends on individual usage needs. For frequent travelers with basic data needs, switching to a carrier like T-Mobile, which includes international roaming in some plans, may be cost-effective. For heavier data users, purchasing a digital eSIM from providers like Airalo or GigSky is often a cheaper alternative to daily roaming packages. Additionally, maximizing the use of free Wi-Fi and pre-downloading maps and documents can significantly reduce data consumption.</p>

          <p>Recent analyses on global food sustainability highlight a critical conflict between environmental preservation and the ethics of food production. With agriculture consuming nearly half of the planet's habitable land, intensive farming is presented as a necessary method to feed a growing population without clearing more forests. This creates a defense for factory farming, which produces the most food on the least land, despite its inherent cruelty. This 'anti-anti-factory farming' logic argues that replacing land-intensive beef with more efficiently produced poultry and pork is environmentally beneficial, but this trade-off would mean a catastrophic increase in the suffering of billions more animals.</p>

          <p>When choosing between oatmeal and smoothies for a breakfast that provides lasting energy, nutrition experts give a slight edge to oatmeal. While both can be healthy, oatmeal's solid form and complex carbohydrates lead to slower digestion, promoting a greater feeling of fullness. Its beta-glucan fiber also supports heart health and metabolism. Smoothies offer a quick, customizable option but are digested more rapidly; however, their nutritional value can be enhanced by adding protein, fiber, and healthy fats. Ultimately, a balanced breakfast combining protein, fiber, and healthy fats is key, regardless of the form it takes.</p>

          <h2>Health Experts Warn of Fatal 'Refeeding Syndrome' in Starvation Zones like Gaza and Sudan</h2>

          <p>As catastrophic hunger grips regions like Gaza and Sudan, health experts are highlighting the deadly risk of 'refeeding syndrome.' This condition can occur when severely malnourished individuals resume normal eating too quickly, causing a rapid, fatal shift in electrolytes that can lead to heart failure. Proper treatment requires a slow, carefully managed reintroduction of nutrients, often using specially formulated therapeutic foods like Plumpy'Nut. Aid workers stress that preventing this syndrome is nearly impossible without safe access to these regions, urging international pressure on governments to allow humanitarian agencies to deliver care.</p>

Fearing a sudden raid and detention, Kangethe has made the agonizing decision to leave on his own terms, ensuring his family knows his whereabouts.

          <p>This opinion piece observes that Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has recently begun speaking out against her own Republican colleagues and right-wing media. She has criticized the treatment of women in the party, denounced Fox News as propaganda, and became the first Republican lawmaker to label the situation in Gaza a genocide. The author suggests that while Greene's motives are likely not progressive, her actions sow discord within the Republican party. The article posits that this infighting, rather than Democratic opposition, may be what ultimately leads to the collapse of the MAGA movement.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reportedly informed Pfizer that it may not renew the emergency use authorization for its pediatric COVID-19 vaccine for children under five. This move would remove the only vaccine currently available for all children in this age group, creating a potential gap in protection. The CDC is now in discussions with Moderna to increase its supply for young children, though Moderna's shot is currently only approved for children with underlying health conditions. Public health experts have expressed concern over the decision, citing low vaccination rates and the continued risks of COVID-19 for children.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Trump administration's new tariffs taking effect, the U.S. now has its highest average tariff rate since 1933, raising questions about the economic impact. Economists predict that the costs will be shared among overseas exporters, U.S. importers, and consumers, making price hikes for goods inevitable. While the exact increase is unknown, one estimate suggests the average household could pay an additional $2,400 this year. The tariffs are also expected to fuel inflation and slow the labor market, but most forecasters currently do not predict a full-blown recession. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>To ensure you're a houseguest who gets invited back, etiquette expert Elaine Swann advises respecting your host's space, even with close friends or family. Key tips include giving ample notice, keeping visits to a manageable length like four days, and communicating plans to avoid awkwardness. When a host says to 'make yourself at home,' it means you can be self-sufficient for basic needs but should still be tidy and mindful. It is also important to be self-reliant for transportation and to show appreciation with a thoughtful gift by the end of your stay.</p>

          <p>The Italian government has approved the revival of a long-stalled project to construct the Strait of Messina Bridge, which would connect Sicily to the mainland. The proposed 2-mile single-span suspension bridge, estimated to cost €13.5 billion, is slated to begin construction in 2026 and finish by 2032. Proponents believe it will bring economic prosperity to southern Italy, creating over 100,000 jobs. However, the project faces significant challenges, including its location in a seismically active zone, strong winds, and opposition from local residents who argue the funds could be better used on existing infrastructure.</p>
