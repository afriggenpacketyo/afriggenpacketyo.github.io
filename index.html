          <p>A China-led international research team analyzed seismic waves from "marsquakes" using data from NASA's InSight lander, revealing a zone in the Martian crust that suggests the presence of water-saturated rock. This underground layer, located between 5.4km and 8km deep, could contain a substantial amount of water, potentially matching Mars' missing water. If confirmed, this discovery could reshape our understanding of Mars' water cycle and the potential for habitable environments on the planet. The InSight lander, which arrived on Mars in 2018, played a crucial role in detecting these subtle ground movements.</p>

          <p>California Gov. Gavin Newsom released a model ordinance for local municipalities to address homeless encampments and announced new funding for treatment and housing. Newsom called on cities and counties to take action, emphasizing the need to provide alternatives to encampments. The model ordinance reflects principles that prioritize shelter and services, while also allowing local authority to clear encampments. This effort is backed by $3.3 billion in new Prop 1 funding, as Newsom approaches the end of his term and speculation about his political future increases.</p>

          <p>CBS News reports that local authorities in Dalton, Georgia, dismissed traffic charges against Ximena Arias Cristobal, a 19-year-old college student detained by ICE. The dismissal came after a review of dashboard camera footage revealed that the officer had stopped the wrong vehicle. Despite the dropped charges, Arias Cristobal, who is in the country without authorization, remains in ICE custody and faces deportation. The case highlights the Trump administration's expanded immigration enforcement policies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghans, affecting over 8,000 people. The Department of Homeland Security said it will wind down TPS for Afghans on July 12, citing an improved security situation and a stabilizing economy in Afghanistan. This decision reverses the Biden administration's extension of the program, which was based on the humanitarian crisis following the Taliban's takeover. Advocates have criticized the decision, arguing it will have long-lasting negative effects.</p>
