          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and Palestinian activist, is seeking $20 million in damages from the Trump administration. His legal claim alleges false imprisonment and malicious prosecution, asserting he was unjustly detained for over three months due to his prominent activism against the war in Gaza. The filing names the Department of Homeland Security and ICE, accusing the government of attempting to deport him and smearing him as an antisemitic national security threat. Khalil, who was released last month, maintains his innocence and looks forward to reuniting with his family.</p>

          <p>The imminent termination of the federal tax credit for electric vehicles, worth up to $7,500, is predicted to cause a surge in EV purchases this summer. President Trump's new bill eliminates the incentive after September 30, prompting automakers like Tesla to urge consumers to buy now. Analysts suggest this "sense of urgency" will lead to competitive deals as buyers rush to take possession of vehicles before the deadline. The move is seen as removing "training wheels" from the EV market, which has relied on subsidies to approach price parity with gasoline-powered cars. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its criticism of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, with the Office of Management and Budget accusing him of gross mismanagement. OMB Director Russell Vought claimed the Fed's headquarters renovation is vastly over budget, now at $2.5 billion, and alleged Powell misled Congress about its "ostentatious" features. Vought's letter suggests the project may violate federal planning laws by deviating from approved plans, which he claims included VIP dining rooms and rooftop gardens. The administration is calling for construction to be halted until a new approval is obtained. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, who pleaded guilty in the University of Idaho student murders, and Luigi Mangione, accused in the killing of a UnitedHealthcare CEO, may both suffer from visual snow syndrome. This rare neurological disorder causes vision to be obscured by flickering dots, similar to television static. Both men reportedly posted online about their struggles with the condition, which affects 2-3% of the global population and can be associated with anxiety and depression. While there is no standard treatment, experts note the condition can be highly distressing, though they caution against drawing direct links between the syndrome and the alleged violent acts.</p>

          <p>The film “Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs Tonight,” adapted from Alexandra Fuller's memoir, explores a white family's precarious existence in 1980 Zimbabwe-Rhodesia during a period of intense civil unrest. Told through the eyes of 7-year-old Bobo, the movie captures the unsettling mix of childhood innocence and the harsh realities of a country on the brink of political transformation. Directed by and co-starring Embeth Davidtz, the drama highlights the family's entitlement and fear, juxtaposed with the perspective of their Black servants. The review praises the lead performance by Lexi Venter and the film's ability to reveal complex political undertones.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Annuities can serve as a strategic financial tool to supplement and optimize Social Security benefits for retirees. By providing a guaranteed income stream, an annuity can allow an individual to delay claiming Social Security, which increases their future monthly payments for each year of deferral. This strategy helps create a more stable "paycheck" in retirement, covering essential expenses that Social Security alone may not fully fund. Additionally, certain types of annuities can offer tax advantages, potentially reducing the taxable portion of one's Social Security income. (not investment advice)</p>

The "one in, one out" deal involves the UK sending back certain arrivals in exchange for accepting an equivalent number of vetted asylum seekers with a connection to Britain.

          <p>As the United States rolls back clean-energy incentives under the Trump administration's latest policies, China is significantly expanding its investment in renewable energy. Photographic evidence reveals the immense scale of China's solar power initiatives across the country.

This starkly contrasts with the U.S. approach, which has seen the elimination of key subsidies aimed at promoting green energy adoption, creating a widening gap in the global race for renewable energy leadership.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article revisits the historical "Battle of the Brows," focusing on Virginia Woolf's fiery 1932 critique of the "middlebrow." Woolf defined the middlebrow as a dishonest consumer of art who lacks genuine taste, instead molding their preferences to fit current fashions. She proudly declared herself a "highbrow," one who pursues ideas with thoroughbred intelligence, and even had a certain respect for the "lowbrow," who pursues life itself. However, she reserved her sharpest disdain for the middlebrow, famously writing she would "stab him, dead" if anyone dared call her one. The essay explores how the term was once at the center of a fierce debate about art, class, and taste.</p>

          <p>The very first Hermès Birkin bag, created for and once owned by the late actress and singer Jane Birkin, has been sold at a Sotheby's auction in Paris for over $10.1 million. This sale makes it the most valuable handbag ever sold at auction. The iconic bag was famously conceived in 1984 after Birkin lamented to the head of Hermès on a flight that she couldn't find a suitable bag for a young mother. He sketched a design on an airplane sick bag, leading to the creation of the legendary accessory. The prototype was sold to a private collector after a heated bidding war.</p>

          <p>If you suffer from migraines, you may notice they become more frequent or severe during the summer, and a neurologist confirms there are scientific reasons for this. Dr. Shae Datta explains that weather-related changes, including bright sun, heat, and shifts in barometric pressure, can be significant triggers. Dehydration is another major factor, making it critical to stay hydrated. To help prevent attacks, experts recommend wearing sunglasses to reduce light sensitivity, ensuring adequate rest, and avoiding other personal triggers like certain fragrances in sunscreens or a lack of caffeine.</p>

          <p>A Brighton, Boston resident named Jean Powers has created a "not mail" box outside her home to foster a sense of community and connection. She invites strangers to leave notes containing "thoughts, opinions, poetry, secrets and lies," an idea she conceived during the pandemic. The responses have ranged from silly notes and poems to deeply personal and heartfelt confessions. Powers says she is often moved by the anonymous contributions, which she feels allow her to "look into the hearts and souls of strangers."

Melton, who had a history of mental health issues, was restrained by officers after approaching them during an apparent crisis. An investigation has revealed multiple system failures, including a breakdown of the city's dispatch system, which resulted in no medic ever arriving at the scene. Just one day prior, the mother had been denied an emergency petition by a judge to get her son mental health help. She is now questioning the police response and the city's emergency protocols.</p>

          <p>A review of the Supreme Court's recent term indicates a significant trend toward expanding presidential power while simultaneously limiting the authority of lower courts. According to analysis, the court has made consequential use of its "shadow docket" to issue orders with major impacts without full hearings or explanations. These rulings have often favored the executive branch, contributing to a shift in the constitutional balance of power. The decisions reflect a court that is actively reshaping the landscape of federal authority, with long-term implications for governance and the role of the judiciary.</p>
