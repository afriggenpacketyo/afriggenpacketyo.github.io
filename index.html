          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 07:24:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Doordash announced it will acquire SevenRooms, a restaurant booking platform, for $1.2 billion in cash. This acquisition comes as Doordash reported first-quarter revenue that fell short of expectations, causing shares to drop approximately 4%. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2025 and will expand Doordash's services to grow local commerce and support financial goals. The article also notes that Doordash has agreed to a $3.9 billion deal with British food delivery service Deliveroo.</p>

          <p>A brief power outage at Newark Liberty International Airport caused air traffic control screens to go dark for 60-90 seconds, disrupting communication with aircraft. This incident led to the FAA halting departures to Newark due to telecommunications and equipment issues at the Philadelphia TRACON. Several controllers took medical leave following the event, exacerbating existing staff shortages and leading to increased flight cancellations and delays. United Airlines has removed 35 round-trip flights per day to ease congestion, and the FAA is working to improve the reliability of telecommunications equipment in the New York area.</p>

          <p>Wales' First Minister Eluned Morgan stated she will challenge the Labour government in Westminster if its decisions harm Welsh communities, prioritizing Wales' interests over party loyalty. She highlighted potential harm from cuts to disability benefits and the winter fuel allowance, advocating for Wales to benefit more from offshore wind projects. Morgan emphasized that while there's a bond, disagreements will be voiced, and unfairness will be challenged, promoting a grown-up modern government. She seeks to rethink PIP and advocates for models that lead people through a process rather than cutting benefits.</p>

Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour hailed the decision as historic, securing the future of prediction markets in America.

          <p>Friedrich Merz failed to be elected German chancellor in the first parliamentary vote, falling short of a majority. This unexpected setback has prompted a halt in the parliamentary session for discussion of next steps, causing losses in the German Dax stock market index. Despite the initial failure, Merz is still expected to eventually be elected chancellor in a second vote within 14 days. Analysts suggest this outcome may sow doubts about his ability to fully pursue his agenda, potentially damaging his domestic and international authority.</p>

The exhibition explores how Black people have used fashion and dress as a contest of power and aesthetics, from enslavement to the present. The theme was inspired by Monica L.

Constellation Brands, which relies heavily on Hispanic consumers for its beer sales, has provided a weaker-than-expected outlook. Coca-Cola also reported weaker traffic from Hispanic shoppers, partly due to a boycott fueled by false rumors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is targeting left-leaning universities by freezing federal funding and considering a steep tax on university endowments. Republicans are proposing a significant increase in the endowment tax, potentially costing institutions like Harvard hundreds of millions annually.

          <p>The Taiwan dollar experienced a pullback after a significant surge, driven by speculation of pressure from Washington to strengthen the currency. Despite the recent weakness, the Taiwanese dollar is still up over 8% this year against the greenback. Experts believe the surge was largely due to exporters converting U.S. dollar reserves and life insurers hedging U.S. dollar debt. Investors are closely monitoring the Taiwanese central bank, with some speculating that authorities are tolerating a stronger currency to win trade concessions from the U.S.</p>

          <p>Russia has accused Ukraine of launching a drone attack on Moscow just days before the start of a ceasefire ordered by Vladimir Putin to coincide with a World War Two parade. Moscow's major airports were temporarily shut down, but there were no casualties reported. Ukraine has not commented on the alleged attack. Putin has called for a ceasefire from May 8-10, while Ukraine seeks a longer truce and has warned of potential Russian provocations.</p>

The tourism industry, a key economic driver, has been severely impacted by restricted access to border areas.

The gala highlighted Black fashion and the history of Black dandyism, but its political context is complicated by the Trump administration's targeting of diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. The show has other political baggage, too. The Costume Institute has never had a Black curator, and the Met has its own history of racism.

          <p>Despite the trade war with the U.S., China has largely avoided de-dollarizing its economy, as indicated by an Oxford Economics report. China's export orientation necessitates substantial dollar assets, and few high-grade alternatives exist for its foreign exchange reserves. The report suggests China is more likely to weaken the yuan than sell U.S. assets in response to trade tensions. This strategy allows exporters to buy more of the Chinese currency with U.S. dollars earned from sales overseas.</p>
