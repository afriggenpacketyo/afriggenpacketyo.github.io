            <p>Representative Ro Khanna is urging the Democratic Party to undergo a significant rebranding with a future-oriented platform to better resist President Trump's policies. Khanna believes new leadership is essential and emphasizes the need for Democrats to speak out on civil liberties and immigration rights. He praised Senators Booker and Sanders for their activism and highlighted the party's need to regain ground lost in recent elections. Khanna also criticized Vice President Vance, suggesting a long-term intellectual foundation for the Democratic Party is necessary.</p>

            <p>The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act (SAVE Act) is under scrutiny for potentially disenfranchising voters, particularly women, due to stricter ID requirements. Critics argue the law, requiring passports or birth certificates with photo IDs, disproportionately affects women who often change their names after marriage or divorce. Representative Elise Stefanik, a co-sponsor of the SAVE Act, is facing criticism for supporting legislation that could undermine the voting rights of women, despite her previous efforts to commemorate suffragists. The SAVE Act has also been criticized as a solution in search of a problem, as non-citizen voting is already illegal.</p>

            <p>Following the Eaton fire, Altadena residents are questioning whether the town's unincorporated status hindered the emergency response, particularly concerning evacuation alerts. Unlike neighboring incorporated cities, Altadena relies on Los Angeles County for resources and governance, which some residents believe created gaps in communication and resource allocation. The delayed evacuation alerts in west Altadena, where most fatalities occurred, have fueled these concerns. While cityhood is debated, the immediate focus remains on recovery, with residents advocating for improved emergency preparedness and communication systems.</p>

            <p>Chocolate prices in the United States are surging due to rising cocoa costs and President Trump's tariffs on imports. Climate-related crises in West Africa have decimated cocoa production, leading to a significant cocoa deficit and inflated prices. Trump's tariffs are expected to further increase chocolate prices, as most cocoa is imported due to the lack of suitable growing climates in the US. Smaller chocolate businesses are particularly vulnerable to these unstable conditions, with some facing closure due to pricing turmoil.</p>

            <p>President Trump's immigration policies are drawing comparisons to historical figures like Judas, Pontius Pilate, and Herod due to their perceived cruelty and disregard for human rights. His administration's efforts to deny birthright citizenship, rescind legal status for migrants, and deport individuals like Kilmar Abrego Garcia are seen as violations of fundamental principles. Critics argue that Trump is using the issue of illegal immigration to push the boundaries of American law and incite fear, while some supporters cheer on his actions. The situation is drawing parallels to historical instances of persecution and complacency, urging people to stand up for the vulnerable.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's policies are increasingly drawing parallels to authoritarian tactics, particularly those employed by El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele. Trump's immigration policies and attacks on the rule of law are seen as mirroring Bukele's crackdown on criminal gangs and political opposition. The article highlights the potential for Trump's actions to erode democratic institutions and suppress dissent. The author warns of the dangers of normalizing authoritarian tactics and the need to defend fundamental rights.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has issued a temporary block on the deportation of Venezuelans held in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act. The ACLU argued that the immigrants were not given a fair chance to challenge their deportation in court. The Alien Enemies Act, dating back to 1798, has been invoked by the Trump administration to expedite the removal of individuals deemed threats. The Supreme Court's decision underscores the ongoing legal battles surrounding immigration enforcement policies.</p>

            <p>The US Supreme Court has ordered the Trump administration to temporarily halt the deportation of Venezuelan men in immigration custody, after their lawyers said they were at imminent risk of removal without the judicial review previously mandated by the justices. Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said dozens of Venezuelan men held in Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Bluebonnet detention center in Texas were given notices indicating they were classified as members of the Tren de Aragua gang. They said the men would be deported under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA), and were told “that the removals are imminent and will happen tonight or tomorrow”.</p>

            <p>Dozens of humanoid robots raced alongside thousands of runners at a half-marathon in Beijing on Saturday in an attempt to showcase China’s tech prowess. According to Chinese media reports, 21 humanoid robots, including machines from private firms and universities such as Tsinghua, were put to the test along the 21km (13-mile) route in the capital’s Daxing district. Video footage from state news agency Xinhua showed several human-sized robots – one wearing a black sun hat and white gloves – alongside several much smaller ones running in parallel to the competitors.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the deportations of Venezuelans held in northern Texas under an 18th-century wartime law. The court acted on an emergency appeal from the ACLU, which argued that immigration authorities were moving to restart removals under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. The ACLU said the deportations would violate the Supreme Court's previous ruling that deportations could only proceed if those about to be removed had a chance to argue their case in court. The temporary block remains in place until further order of the court.</p>

            <p>Vice President JD Vance met with Vatican officials following a papal rebuke of the Trump administration's migration policies. Pope Francis has been critical of the administration's approach to migrants, which contrasts with Vance's theological justification for stricter border control. The meeting comes amid ongoing tensions between the Vatican and the administration on issues of social justice and international relations. The Holy See has emphasized peaceful resolutions to conflicts and expressed concern over the treatment of migrants.</p>

            <p>Economists warn that President Trump's escalating trade war and tariffs could give corporations a green light for profiteering, leading to higher prices for consumers. The narrative of rising prices due to tariffs could provide companies with cover to increase profit margins, even on goods not directly affected by the tariffs. Experts point to previous instances where tariffs led to price increases across the board, potentially harming consumers. The Yale Budget Lab estimates that consumers could face an average effective tariff rate of 28%, leading to a significant increase in living costs.</p>
