            <h2>Putin Announces Short Easter Truce in Ukraine Amid Skepticism</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-20 06:22:14 EDT</div>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a unilateral 30-hour Easter truce in Ukraine, citing "humanitarian" reasons, which has been met with skepticism. Ukraine's President Zelenskyy noted ongoing isolated Russian advances despite the declared ceasefire, while Russia accused Ukraine of violations. The truce, announced at short notice, is viewed by some as a PR move to improve relations with the Trump administration, which has grown impatient with the lack of progress on the Ukraine situation and threatened to withdraw from peace negotiations. The situation remains tense as both sides accuse each other of violating the ceasefire. </p>

            <p>California is facing a $5.6 billion unfunded liability for unused vacation and leave benefits owed to state employees, with some retirees receiving payouts exceeding $1 million. The rising liability stems from generous time-off provisions and a failure to enforce vacation balance caps. A prison dentist received $1.2 million for unused vacation time. While efforts to overhaul the system face political challenges, the state is exploring options to reduce the liability and encourage employees to take time off.</p>

            <p>China has taken a more assertive stance in the conflict between the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda, urging Kigali to end its support for the M23 rebel group. This shift from China's usual non-interference policy is driven by the need to protect its mining interests in the region. China's UN ambassador has directly called on Rwanda to withdraw its troops from the DRC, and China voted in favor of a UN Security Council resolution condemning Rwanda's role in the conflict.</p>

            <p>DHL Express is temporarily suspending deliveries to the US worth more than $800 due to increased red tape at customs following the introduction of Trump's new tariff regime. The change has caused a surge in formal customs clearances, leading to multi-day delays for shipments over $800. The White House is also set to clamp down on low-value packages from China and Hong Kong, impacting fast-fashion firms like Shein and Temu. These measures are aimed at addressing the synthetic opioid supply chain and deceptive shipping practices.</p>
