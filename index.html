          <p>Renowned figurative painter Alex Katz, now 98, is focusing on promoting other artists by gifting a collection of over 100 paintings to the Portland Museum of Art in Maine. The exhibition, titled "Painting Energy," features works by emerging and established artists that Katz selected for their dynamic quality. Katz, who faced resistance early in his career for his figurative style in an era of abstraction, aims to support artists who experienced similar struggles, emphasizing his belief in giving back to the art community.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Tennessee have announced that their re-examination of a 1967 cold case concludes that famed McNairy County Sheriff Buford Pusser, the inspiration for the movie "Walking Tall," killed his wife, Pauline. Investigators found that physical evidence, including blood spatter and gunshot wound analysis, contradicts Pusser's account of an ambush by his enemies and suggests the wound was self-inflicted. The district attorney stated that if Pusser were alive today, he would be indicted for murder, a finding that brings closure to Pauline's family but challenges a long-held local legend.</p>

          <p>The UK has finalized its largest-ever warship export deal, a £10 billion agreement to supply the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 anti-submarine frigates. The deal is expected to support thousands of UK jobs, particularly at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be constructed. This strategic partnership strengthens NATO's northern flank by creating a combined fleet of 13 advanced frigates, enhancing joint operational capabilities in northern Europe.</p>

          <p>The rise of artificial intelligence is creating anxiety in the labor market, with job postings declining and entry-level positions being particularly affected. Economists suggest that while AI can automate certain tasks, especially screen-based jobs like coding and data management, it is less likely to replace roles requiring physicality, empathy, or creative thinking, such as healthcare and teaching. While some job displacement is inevitable, experts believe AI will also create new, unforeseen job categories and could lead to significant advancements in fields like medicine and energy.

While there is no contamination concern, the labeling error poses a risk for consumers who must monitor their sugar intake for medical reasons, such as individuals with diabetes.</p>

This new regulation builds on previous legislation that banned other single-use plastics like straws and carrier bags, aiming to reduce waste and protect marine life.</p>
