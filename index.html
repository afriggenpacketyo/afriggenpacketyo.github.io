          <p>Actor Alec Baldwin and his brother Stephen were uninjured after Baldwin crashed his Range Rover into a tree in the Hamptons, reportedly swerving to avoid a commercial truck on a wet road. This incident marks the latest in a series of public controversies for Baldwin, including his recent involuntary manslaughter trial related to the fatal 2021 "Rust" film set shooting and a prior heated exchange with a comedian. East Hampton Town Police confirmed no injuries were reported or summons issued, attributing the accident to a reaction to an uninvolved vehicle and adverse road conditions. The event, involving a well-known public figure, garnered significant media attention, highlighting his tumultuous year.</p>

          <p>OpenAI is aggressively shifting towards vertical integration, moving beyond software to control its entire AI ecosystem, from chipmaking to consumer hardware. The company is partnering with Broadcom to co-develop custom AI accelerators and acquired Jony Ive's startup, io, to explore AI-native devices. This strategy, likened to Apple's approach with smartphones, aims to enhance efficiency and dominance by designing the full stack, from transistors to user experience. These blockbuster deals, including significant investments with Nvidia and AMD, underscore OpenAI's ambition to establish itself as the leading AI infrastructure provider.</p>

          <p>Despite a record increase in renewable energy capacity last year, global efforts are still falling short of the targets needed to combat climate change, according to an interim report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). The newly installed capacity of 582 gigawatts in 2024, while significant, did not meet the required yearly increase of 16.6% to achieve the UN's COP28 goal of 11.2 terawatts by 2030. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that the window to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius is rapidly closing, urging accelerated energy transition efforts worldwide.</p>

          <p>A ceasefire in Gaza is holding, allowing the UN's World Food Programme to scale up operations and send 137 trucks of food aid into the region. This improved access has also enabled WHO teams to deliver medical supplies to hospitals. The remains of four more hostages have been returned to Israel, with 20 bodies still believed to be in Gaza. President Trump, who helped broker the agreement, commented that Hamas would be disarmed, reflecting ongoing international efforts to manage the post-ceasefire situation.</p>

          <p>China's booming electric vehicle (EV) industry is prompting the European Union to consider protective measures, potentially setting up "roadblocks" to manage the influx of Chinese-made EVs. The article highlights the historical context of foreign automotive companies' engagement in China, evolving from early learning phases to the current competitive landscape. While the EU seeks to protect its domestic industry, there's an underlying question about whether cooperation, rather than confrontation, can clear the way for a mutually beneficial future in the global EV market. The situation reflects complex trade dynamics.</p>

Hamas forces have re-deployed to assert control in areas Israeli forces withdrew from, clashing with armed gangs and alleged collaborators, killing dozens. While the exchange of fire with Israel has ceased, Hamas faces pressure to disarm and relinquish power, a condition of the Trump-brokered deal. Civilians express cautious hope for peace and reconstruction, though the lack of a clear timeline for rebuilding adds to their torment.</p>

          <p>NBA All-Star Giannis Antetokounmpo, currently under contract with the Milwaukee Bucks until at least 2027, has expressed a desire to finish his professional basketball career in his native Greece. The two-time MVP stated on Greek television that he does not wish to live in the United States after leaving the NBA and would like to play for a Greek team. This revelation comes as his brother Alex Antetokounmpo is reportedly joining the Bucks, potentially making it the first time three siblings are on the same active NBA roster.</p>

          <p>Lakers guard Marcus Smart is expected to be limited to 20-25 minutes in his preseason debut against the Phoenix Suns, as he returns from Achilles tendinopathy. Smart, entering his 12th NBA season, described the initial diagnosis as frightening given recent Achilles injuries among NBA stars. He emphasized a cautious approach with the Lakers staff to ensure full readiness for the season. Other players, including Luka Doncic, are also managing their preseason workloads, while several others are ruled out for upcoming games due to injuries or schedule congestion.</p>

Trump, hosting Milei at the White House, praised his "America First" philosophy and pledged full endorsement, linking continued U.S. generosity to Milei's political success. This stance comes after the Trump administration promised a $20 billion bailout to Argentina's struggling economy. Additionally, Trump threatened trade penalties against Spain for its refusal to increase defense spending to NATO's target of 5%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A lawyer for the family of deceased pitcher Tyler Skaggs argued in court that the Los Angeles Angels should be held responsible for his overdose death. The family alleges the team failed to enforce its drug policies, allowing communication director Eric Kay, who was addicted to opioids and supplied drugs to players, to remain employed and access the team. Kay was convicted of providing the fentanyl-tainted pill that caused Skaggs' 2019 death. The Angels contend Skaggs' actions were off-duty and outside their control, and that he was also consuming alcohol and oxycodone.</p>

          <p>Major news organizations, including CBS News, The New York Times, and The Washington Post, are rejecting a new Pentagon policy that would require journalists to seek formal authorization to publish unclassified information and characterize independent reporting as a "security risk." This policy, a dramatic departure from historical standards, is seen as a violation of First Amendment protections. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who has aggressively pursued leaks, defends the policy as "common sense," despite President Trump's earlier skepticism. The widespread refusal could leave the Pentagon without a traveling press corps.</p>

Lower rates could stimulate economic growth, business expansion, and hiring. Powell also hinted at an impending halt to the Fed's balance sheet reduction, aiming to maintain ample reserves for banks.

However, concerns exist that a prolonged shutdown could eventually impact controller performance due to stress over unpaid wages.
