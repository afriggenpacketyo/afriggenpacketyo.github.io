          <p>Authorities in Northern California have confirmed that human remains found at the site of a fireworks warehouse explosion belong to the seven people who were missing. The facility, owned by a Yolo County Sheriff's Lieutenant, was operating without the required local licenses to store commercial fireworks. The massive explosion and subsequent fires destroyed multiple structures and burned approximately 80 acres. Federal agencies, including the ATF, have joined the investigation into the cause of the tragic incident.</p>

          <p>The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) scrambled a fighter jet to intercept a civilian aircraft that violated the temporary no-fly zone over Bedminster, New Jersey. The incident occurred while the president was at the location for the holiday weekend. The pilot was safely escorted out of the restricted airspace following standard procedures. Officials noted this was one of five unauthorized entries into the presidential airspace that day, prompting a warning for private pilots to check flight restrictions.</p>

          <p>In a significant diplomatic move, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy met with Syria's new interim president, whose ruling group was previously proscribed by the UK as a terrorist organization. This engagement is part of a broader Western effort to reset relations with Syria after the fall of the Assad regime. Lammy stated the UK is looking "to the future" but will monitor the new government's actions regarding inclusivity and stability amid concerns over its Islamic-led agenda.</p>
