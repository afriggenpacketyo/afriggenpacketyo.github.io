          <p>John Woeltz, a crypto investor, was arrested in New York City for allegedly kidnapping and torturing an Italian tourist who had come to retrieve Bitcoin he was previously forced to send Woeltz. The victim was reportedly lured to Woeltz's SoHo home, where he was tied up and subjected to electric shocks, cuts, and forced drug use over several weeks. The victim managed to escape and flag down a traffic agent, leading to Woeltz's arrest on charges including kidnapping, assault, and firearm possession. Evidence recovered from the scene included weapons, body armor, and disturbing photographs of the victim. </p>

          <p>A British fishing vessel has been impounded by French authorities for allegedly fishing illegally in French waters. The French coast guard inspected the vessel and found it to be operating without a license, leading to its seizure in the English Channel and detention in Boulogne. The UK Foreign Office is providing support to the British national involved and is in contact with French authorities. This incident follows criticism of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's deal with the EU, which grants EU fishing vessels continued access to UK waters. </p>

The kidnappers strapped fake dynamite to Michelle and her daughter, Breea, and threatened to detonate it if Michelle didn't comply with their demands. During the trial of the kidnappers, Michelle was treated as a criminal and attacked for her past as a stripper and financial difficulties. Despite the trauma, Michelle and Breea survived, and Michelle has since become an advocate for trauma survivors, even after Breea was diagnosed with a rare form of multiple sclerosis. </p>

          <p>Japanese doctors and social workers are denouncing the continued COVID-19 restrictions at hospitals, calling them a violation of human rights, as many facilities still limit patient visitations, even for terminally ill individuals. Despite the government downgrading the threat of COVID-19, hospitals continue to enforce strict rules, such as mask requirements, temperature checks, and time limits for visitors. The health ministry recommends considering visitations while maintaining infection control, but specific policies are left to individual facilities. Critics argue there is no scientific evidence that these restrictions prevent infections, and they are urging the public to speak out against the policies.</p>

          <p>A new study in Scientific Reports suggests that dog owners who dwell on work-related stress may inadvertently pass anxiety to their pets. Researchers found that dogs of owners with high job stress exhibited more stress-related behaviors, such as whining and restlessness. The connection was primarily driven by rumination, where owners mentally took work home with them. The study highlights the idea of "crossover," where stress spills over from one person to others in a household, including pets, and suggests that avoiding work-related ruminations at home could benefit both owners and their dogs.</p>

          <p>Chinese military scientists have revealed a technological breakthrough behind what they claim is the world's fastest electromagnetic coilgun, capable of firing 3,000 rounds per minute. The technology eliminates the need for capacitors, traditionally a limiting factor in coilgun firing rates, by powering the weapon directly with lithium batteries. This innovation, detailed in China's Journal of Gun Launch & Control, could redefine future combat, according to military experts, by surpassing traditional firearms in firing capacity. Recent footage of the Chinese electromagnetic coil gun shows it can shatter car windows and demolish door panels in seconds.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to improve working conditions for chefs at its overseas diplomatic missions, increasing their annual salaries to over 6 million yen due to growing competition for talent as Japanese cuisine gains global popularity. Chefs will also be allowed to opt for government-covered rented accommodation instead of serving as live-in staff at diplomatic establishments. The initiative aims to recruit and retain skilled chefs who play significant roles in hosting foreign dignitaries and promoting Japanese food abroad. The changes include offering funds to help chefs bring their spouses to their work locations. </p>

          <p>Donald Trump has threatened to impose a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union, citing trade imbalances. The EU's trade chief, Maroš Šefčovič, has responded by stating the EU is committed to securing a deal that works for both sides but is ready to defend its interests. Other news includes an increase in Americans seeking permanent residency in the UK, federal officials visiting Alcatraz, and a federal judge ordering the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Guatemalan man it deported to Mexico.

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has been renationalized, becoming the first train company to transfer to public ownership under Labour. The government has hailed the move as a "new dawn for rail" but stopped short of promising lower fares, focusing instead on improving services and reinvesting profits into infrastructure. Unions have voiced concerns over outsourcing to private companies, while the opposition Conservatives are calling for Labour to deliver on their promises. SWR trains will now be managed by DfT Operator and integrated into Great British Railways (GBR). </p>

These restrictions include the offices of Hegseth and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, raising concerns from the Pentagon Press Association, which calls it a direct attack on the freedom of the press. The National Press Club is urging the Pentagon to reverse course, stating that restricting access undermines public trust.

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK party has pledged to fully reinstate winter fuel payments to pensioners and scrap the two-child benefit cap if they come into power, increasing pressure on the Labour party. The move is intended to highlight divisions within Labour, as Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer faces pressure from his own MPs to change his approach to both policies. Reform UK plans to fund these policies by cutting net zero projects and eliminating hotels for asylum seekers. More than 10 million pensioners lost out on winter fuel payments when the pension top-up was restricted last year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Susan Brownmiller, the feminist author, journalist, and activist whose book "Against Our Will: Men, Women and sexual assault" helped define the modern view of sexual assault, has died at the age of 90. Her book argued that sexual assault was a crime of power and violence, not passion, and it led to laws that made it easier to prosecute those who perpetrate sexual assault. The book faced criticism for its feminist dogma and assertions about the role of men, but it also sparked significant changes in society's attitude toward sexual violence, including the opening of rape-crisis centers and the rewriting of laws. She also fought against the multi-billion-dollar pornography industry. </p>
