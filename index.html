          <p>U.S. and Panamanian officials report a dramatic reduction in migrant crossings through the dangerous Darién Gap, with numbers falling by over 99.9% from their peak in August 2023. The decrease, from over 82,000 in one month to just 10 in June, is attributed to a coordinated crackdown involving mass deportations and increased patrols by Panama. The Department of Homeland Security and the White House credit the Trump administration's strict border policies for deterring migrants from undertaking the perilous journey. Officials are also encouraging undocumented immigrants within the U.S. to self-deport using a government app.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an interview, philosopher Mark C. Taylor discusses his book "After the Human," arguing that humanity faces existential threats from climate change and technology. He posits that the traditional Western concept of the human, rooted in Descartes' idea of consciousness being separate from nature, has led to environmental exploitation. Taylor advocates for a relational understanding of existence, where everything is interconnected, and suggests that rethinking consciousness and intelligence is crucial for survival. The article explores these philosophical ideas, the rise of "techno-gnosticism" among tech billionaires, and the need to find hope by embracing our fragility.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Forecasters are warning of an impending increase in hurricane activity as ocean temperatures in the Atlantic's Main Development Region (MDR) have risen considerably. While warm waters are a necessary ingredient for hurricane formation, unfavorable upper-level winds, known as wind shear, have so far suppressed storm development this season. However, meteorological patterns like the Madden-Julian Oscillation are expected to reduce this wind shear in early August. This combination of very warm ocean waters and diminishing wind shear creates highly favorable conditions for a more active period of the hurricane season to begin.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid a worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, a growing number of mainstream Jewish American organizations are publicly urging Israel to allow more aid into the territory. Groups like the American Jewish Committee and the Reform movement, which have traditionally been staunch supporters of Israel, have issued statements expressing deep concern over civilian suffering and starvation. This shift reflects a broadening of discomfort beyond left-wing Jewish groups and appears to align with declining support for Israel's military actions among the wider American public. The statements often balance support for Israel's security with an emphasis on Jewish values.</p>

          <p>Following a trend of organizing in the coffee industry, workers at four Blue Bottle Coffee shops in the Bay Area have voted to unionize. The baristas, located in Oakland and Berkeley, voted 22-to-5 to join the Blue Bottle Independent Union. This marks the union's second victory, after organizing several stores in the Boston area last year. Workers are seeking higher wages to cope with the high cost of living, improved benefits, and the return of perks lost after Nestlé acquired the company. The move is part of a larger wave of unionization efforts at cafes across the U.S.</p>

          <p>The animated Netflix film 'K-pop Demon Hunters' has achieved massive popularity in South Korea, where it is affectionately known as 'Keh-deh-hun.' South Korean audiences are praising the American-made film for its meticulous attention to cultural detail, from local folklore and K-pop history to everyday mannerisms like how utensils are placed at a restaurant. This authenticity is credited to a production team filled with K-pop fans and diaspora Koreans. The film's success highlights the increasingly fluid, global nature of the "K-wave," where cultural products can be created abroad yet resonate deeply within Korea itself.</p>

The article emphasizes the emotional toll on players, some of whom lost family to COVID-19, and the challenges of isolation and daily testing.

This is the first time a former head of state in Colombia has been found guilty in a criminal trial. The court found that Uribe paid jailed paramilitaries to change their testimony linking him to the formation of right-wing death squads during the country's civil war. While Uribe's supporters claim the trial was politically motivated, human rights groups have hailed the verdict as a major step against impunity for past abuses.</p>

          <p>The increasing use of 'Gotham,' a powerful AI-driven surveillance software from US firm Palantir, by police in several German states is fueling a major controversy over privacy. Civil rights groups argue the software, which can rapidly analyze vast amounts of data to create profiles of individuals, violates constitutional rights by ensnaring innocent people in a "dragnet." Critics, including the Chaos Computer Club, also point to the opaque nature of the software and dependency on a US company. The debate highlights a conflict between law enforcement's desire for advanced tools and Germany's commitment to digital sovereignty and citizen privacy.</p>

From the UK Prime Minister touting an "unprecedented" state visit invitation to the Israeli Prime Minister nominating him for a Nobel Peace Prize, leaders appear to have adopted this approach to gain favor. Experts suggest that unlike his first term, world leaders now recognize Trump as the sole decider and believe appealing to his desire to be seen as a winner is the most effective tactic. This "art of the praise" has been linked to tangible results, such as increased NATO defense spending commitments.</p>

          <p>President Trump has fired Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), just hours after the agency released a weaker-than-expected jobs report. The report showed the U.S. added only 73,000 jobs in July and included significant downward revisions for the previous two months. Trump claimed without evidence that the figures were "rigged," a move that critics condemned as something seen in authoritarian countries. The unprecedented firing has been described as an intentional attack on the integrity of U.S. economic data and has rattled financial markets.</p>

The victims were identified as the parents, grandmother, and uncle of a seven-month-old baby who was found abandoned but safe in a front yard. Police believe Drummond dropped off the infant and alerted people to the child's presence before fleeing, an act authorities described as a sign of "compassion" amidst the violence. Drummond, who was out on bond for other charges including attempted murder, is considered armed and dangerous, and a reward is being offered for his arrest.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld a temporary order that prevents the Trump administration from conducting indiscriminate immigration arrests in Southern California. The ruling affirms a lower court's decision, which found a "mountain of evidence" that enforcement tactics were unconstitutional. The original lawsuit was filed by advocacy groups who accused federal agents of systematically targeting people based on race or speaking Spanish. The court rejected the government's argument that the order was too broad, with one judge noting that in a place like Los Angeles, such factors "cannot possibly weed out" undocumented individuals from citizens.</p>

          <p>A pioneering study led by Chinese scientists has traced the evolutionary origins of the potato, revealing an ancient link to a forerunner of the tomato. By analyzing the genomes of various potato species, researchers found that the modern potato descended from a hybrid created about nine million years ago between a tomato ancestor and a non-tuberous, potato-like plant. This ancient hybridization event was the key driver for the development of tubers, the edible part of the potato that has made it a global staple food. The findings, published in the journal Cell, shed new light on the diversification of this crucial crop.</p>
