          <p>Poland's Iga Swiatek has claimed her first Wimbledon title in a stunningly one-sided final, defeating American Amanda Anisimova 6-0, 6-0 in just 57 minutes. This marks the first "double bagel" victory in a Wimbledon women's final since 1911 and Swiatek's sixth Grand Slam title overall. The 24-year-old demonstrated mastery on grass, previously considered her weakest surface, while Anisimova struggled with nerves in her first major final appearance, committing numerous unforced errors.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced plans to impose 30% tariffs on goods imported from Mexico and the European Union, scheduled to take effect on August 1. In letters to the respective leaders, Trump cited Mexico's insufficient efforts to curb drug trafficking and a non-reciprocal trade relationship with the EU as justifications. The move represents a significant escalation in the administration's trade policy, potentially disrupting global supply chains and inviting retaliatory measures from two of America's largest trading partners.

          <p>Following President Trump's announcement of a 30% tariff on EU goods, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated the bloc will take all necessary steps to protect its interests, including potential countermeasures. While affirming the EU's readiness to negotiate a deal by the August 1 deadline, leaders from France, Germany, and Italy expressed strong disapproval of the move. French President Emmanuel Macron called for the speedy preparation of a firm response to defend European economic interests if an agreement is not reached. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New UK regulations requiring tech platforms to prevent children from seeing harmful content and to verify user ages are set to take effect, enforced by the regulator Ofcom. The rules are the result of years of campaigning by parents whose children died after exposure to harmful online material. However, critics and even government sources admit the Online Safety Act already needs updating to address fast-moving technology like AI, peer-to-peer messaging risks, and misinformation, with further measures already being considered.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent visit to flood-stricken central Texas has highlighted his administration's distinct approach to federal disaster response. Political analysts note that while past presidents often used such events to connect emotionally with victims, Trump's focus is more on touting his administration's mobilization of resources. This approach involves scaling back the direct federal footprint and placing greater reliance on state and local officials, representing a significant shift in the traditional role of the White House during national emergencies.</p>

          <p>In a post on his Truth Social platform, Donald Trump stated he is giving "serious consideration" to revoking the U.S. citizenship of his longtime nemesis, Rosie O'Donnell, calling her a "Threat to Humanity." Legal scholars note that a president cannot revoke the citizenship of a U.S.-born individual, as it is protected by the 14th Amendment. O'Donnell, who was born in New York, responded on social media, calling Trump "a danger to the nation" and a "mentally ill untreated criminal."</p>

In an interview, Patterson suggests Kohberger developed "tunnel vision" and panicked, leading him to leave a knife sheath at the crime scene which ultimately led to his arrest. The author also speculates that Kohberger, who had difficulty socializing with women, may have been inspired by other killers who felt rejected.</p>

Historically, successful third parties in the U.S. have influenced policy by pressuring the major parties on specific issues rather than by winning seats, a different approach than Musk appears to be taking.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, a transgender author reflects on the current moment, where increased visibility for trans people coincides with a political backlash and laws targeting their rights. Drawing on her own experience of a closeted childhood in the 1970s and 80s before transitioning as an adult, she argues against the "survivorship bias" that suggests waiting is harmless. She frames the debate around trans youth care as analogous to manufactured doubt on issues like climate change, advocating for acceptance and understanding.</p>

Lara has taken on a public role similar to Ivanka's, working to soften Donald Trump's image and championing him as a supporter of women.</p>
