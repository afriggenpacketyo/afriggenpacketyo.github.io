        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United's Premier League season began with a 1-0 defeat to Arsenal, a result largely attributed to a critical error by goalkeeper Altay Bayindir. Bayindir, chosen over the recently fit Andre Onana, failed to handle a corner, leading to the decisive goal. The incident has intensified the debate around United's goalkeeping situation, despite manager Ruben Amorim's public defense of his player. While the team's newly reinforced attack showed promise, the focus remains on the costly mistake that highlighted a potential vulnerability for the club as they begin their new campaign.</p>

          <p>In Iraq, officials have started the excavation of a large sinkhole south of Mosul, believed to be one of the largest mass graves left by the Islamic State (IS) group. The site, known as al-Khafsa, may contain the remains of thousands of victims, primarily Iraqi security personnel and minority groups killed a decade ago. The initial phase involves collecting surface remains and DNA samples from families of the missing to build a database for identification. Due to hazards like unexploded ordnance, a full exhumation will require international support, marking a significant step in accounting for the atrocities committed by IS.</p>

          <p>A 63-year-old American man sustained severe injuries after being attacked by a shark while spearfishing near Big Grand Cay in the Bahamas. The incident occurred on Sunday afternoon, and the man was transported to a local clinic before being airlifted to the United States for further treatment. This attack is the latest in a series of shark encounters in the region, which has one of the world's highest rates of such incidents. Recent events include two other American tourists being injured in February and a fatal attack on a paddleboarder from Boston in December 2023.</p>

          <p>Jodi Arias, who is serving a life sentence for the 2008 murder of her ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander, has signaled she may be preparing a new legal challenge. In a recent blog post, Arias mentioned her focus is on "PCR (post-conviction relief)," fueling speculation of another attempt to overturn her conviction more than a decade after her highly publicized trial. Arias has consistently sought to appeal her sentence and has reportedly been using proceeds from her prison artwork sales to finance future legal efforts. Post-conviction relief in Arizona is a legal avenue available after standard appeals are exhausted, often used to introduce new evidence.</p>

Baker's performance helped dismiss the Superchargers for 114, boosting his team's tournament prospects. In another match, Birmingham Phoenix's Liam Livingstone showcased his all-round skills, taking two wickets and scoring an unbeaten 45 from 20 balls to secure a seven-wicket win against London Spirit. Livingstone's consistent form makes him the leading run-scorer in this season's competition, solidifying his reputation as a premier finisher.</p>

This arrangement is described as being similar to NATO's Article 5, where an attack on one member is considered an attack on all. The development comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who called the offer "historic," prepares to meet with U.S. and European leaders in Washington. The proposal could offer an alternative to Ukraine's full NATO membership, a long-standing point of contention for Moscow.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, was downgraded to a Category 3 storm but is forecast to potentially strengthen again as it moves north of the Caribbean. While not expected to make direct landfall on the U.S. East Coast, its large size could generate dangerous rip currents along the Southeast coast and cause flooding in North Carolina's Outer Banks. The storm, which briefly reached Category 5 intensity, is undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle, a process that can cause temporary weakening before possible re-intensification. A tropical storm warning has been issued for the Turks and Caicos Islands and parts of the Bahamas.</p>

          <p>Despite official reports of steady visitor numbers, some businesses in Florida's beach cities are experiencing a significant downturn, with some describing their towns as 'ghost towns' and reporting revenue drops of up to 30%. This slump is attributed to economic pressures on American consumers, including persistent inflation, which has led to slashed travel budgets for big-ticket items like airfare and lodging. While the overall tourism figures remain strong, the reduced spending per visitor is impacting local economies. For travelers with flexible budgets, this situation could present an opportunity for discounts on accommodations and attractions. (not investment advice)</p>

The Democrats fled earlier in the month to prevent a GOP-led plan that could create five new Republican-leaning U.S. House seats ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Their return follows the conclusion of the initial special session and the start of a new one, with some members already back in Texas.

While many Ukrainians are fatigued by the war and crave an end to the suffering, polling shows strong opposition to formally giving up land.

          <h2>Ancient Dental Remains in China Suggest Complex Mating Practices Among Early Humans</h2>

          <p>A new study of 300,000-year-old dental remains from a Chinese archaeological site reveals surprising insights into early human evolution and breeding. The teeth exhibit a unique combination of archaic features typical of Homo erectus and more advanced traits seen in Homo sapiens. This "mosaic" of characteristics suggests that human evolution in Asia was not linear and that interbreeding with other hominins was occurring much earlier than previously believed. The findings challenge existing timelines, indicating that modern human traits may have been emerging in Asia long before Homo sapiens spread globally, complicating the story of our species' origins.</p>

          <p>Firefighters in Spain are struggling to control numerous wildfires as the country endures a severe heatwave now in its third week, with temperatures exceeding 40 degrees Celsius (104 F). The fires have already claimed at least three lives, destroyed over a thousand square kilometers of land, and forced thousands to evacuate. The government has deployed additional military units to support firefighting efforts in the worst-affected regions, including Galicia, Castile and Leon, and Extremadura. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has acknowledged the challenging days ahead, linking the crisis to the broader climate emergency and promising government assistance for victims.</p>

          <h2>Trump Reverses Stance on Ukraine Ceasefire, Now Pushing for Direct Peace Agreement</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, President Trump has shifted his position on resolving the war in Ukraine, now advocating for a direct peace agreement rather than an immediate ceasefire. This change aligns with Putin's stance and puts Trump at odds with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has consistently pushed for a ceasefire as a precursor to broader negotiations. Trump stated that a comprehensive peace deal is a better path than a potentially fragile ceasefire. The reversal adds a new layer of complexity to the diplomatic efforts, with Zelensky scheduled to visit the White House on Monday.</p>

          <h2>Draft of 'Make America Healthy Again' Report Avoids Strict Pesticide Restrictions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A draft of the Trump administration's upcoming "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) report does not recommend severe restrictions on pesticides or ultra-processed foods, a move seen as a victory for the agriculture industry. The document, obtained by ABC News, instead calls for more targeted pesticide applications and further research, while also proposing the development of a government-wide definition for 'ultra-processed food'. This approach appears to be a setback for HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his allies, who have strongly advocated for eliminating chemical additives from the American food supply, arguing they harm children's health.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old Gazan woman, who was evacuated to Italy for medical treatment due to severe emaciation, has died less than 48 hours after her arrival. The woman, identified as Marah Abu Zuhri, suffered a cardiac arrest at a hospital in Pisa; doctors noted she had a very complex clinical condition with severe weight and muscle loss. Her death highlights the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, where the UN has warned of widespread malnutrition and a potential famine. She was part of an Italian government program that has brought over 180 patients from Gaza to Italy for urgent medical care.</p>

          <p>Dr. Alieu Kamara has become the first and only neurosurgeon in Sierra Leone, a country of eight million people, single-handedly addressing a massive burden of neurological diseases and injuries. Before his practice began in January 2025, patients with conditions like brain tumors or severe spinal injuries had no hope for treatment within the country. A recent, successful spine surgery—the first ever performed in Sierra Leone—was made possible through a grassroots network of international support from nonprofits like Mission Brain. Dr. Kamara's work represents a critical step forward for the nation's healthcare system, inspiring a new generation of medical professionals.</p>
