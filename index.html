          <p>President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of US troops to Portland, Oregon, authorizing "full force" to suppress protests targeting immigration detention centers. He claimed the move would protect ICE facilities from "Antifa and other domestic terrorists." Democratic lawmakers, including Oregon Governor Tina Kotek and Portland Mayor Keith Wilson, have strongly pushed back, stating there is no national security threat and that federal troops are unnecessary. This action marks a further expansion of federal troop deployments in American cities amid the Trump administration's wider crackdown on illegal immigration and perceived domestic extremism.</p>

The Metropolitan Police confirmed the stop under the Counter Terrorism and Border Security Act but stated neither was arrested and they were released. Galloway's Workers Party of Britain condemned the incident as an "attempt to intimidate political opponents" who advocate for amity with Russia and China. This event raises questions about the use of counter-terrorism powers against political figures and highlights ongoing tensions in international relations.</p>

          <p>Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has launched a strong attack on the Reform party and its leader, Nigel Farage, ahead of the Labour conference, labeling them "toxic" and "unpatriotic." Starmer criticized Reform's proposal to abolish indefinite leave to remain for hundreds of thousands of migrants, arguing it would "tear this country apart." He accused Farage of "grubbing around in America" for money and talking down the UK. This pre-conference rhetoric signals Labour's strategy to position itself as a patriotic alternative, contrasting its inclusive immigration stance with Reform's divisive policies, as both parties vie for public support.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has ordered his administration to declassify all federal records pertaining to Amelia Earhart, whose 1937 disappearance over the Pacific Ocean has captivated public interest for decades. While the prevailing theory suggests Earhart ran out of fuel and crashed, various unproven theories persist, including one that she was on a spy mission and captured by the Japanese. The article notes that previous FBI and Navy reviews found no evidence for spy theories. Trump's directive, influenced by a lawmaker from the Northern Mariana Islands, aims to resolve historical inquiry surrounding the aviator's fate, reigniting interest in one of history's enduring mysteries.</p>

          <p>An article explores how President Donald Trump's willingness to openly display actions traditionally considered misconduct is changing public perception of political scandal. Observers suggest his brazen approach earns him perverse credit for authenticity and desensitizes the public to actions that would typically be career-ending. Examples include directing the Justice Department to target political opponents, urging foreign governments to investigate rivals, and his response to the January 6th Capitol insurrection. This phenomenon, coupled with a rapid news cycle and a lack of institutional checks, allows many voters to view his rule-breaking as a defiant act against the establishment, rather than corruption.</p>

          <p>A new study published in Science reveals that wild chimpanzees regularly consume fermented fruit, ingesting significant amounts of alcohol daily, equivalent to about one small bottle of beer for humans. Researchers observed chimpanzees in Uganda and Ivory Coast consuming fruit pulp with an average alcohol content of 0.3%. This finding suggests that regular alcohol consumption may not be solely a human cultural phenomenon but could have deeper evolutionary roots shared with our closest relatives. The research raises questions about why the fermented food is shared and whether the alcohol causes intoxication or offers social benefits, pushing the boundaries of understanding animal behavior.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court to uphold its executive order, signed in January, which seeks to deny birthright citizenship to children of migrants residing illegally or on temporary visas in the U.S. Lower courts have blocked the order, citing the 14th Amendment's clause that "all persons born...in the United States...are citizens." The Justice Department argues these rulings undermine border security and reward citizenship to "unqualified people." This legal challenge represents a significant effort by the administration to redefine a fundamental aspect of U.S. citizenship, potentially impacting millions and sparking intense constitutional debate.</p>

          <p>After more than three decades, Austin police have identified Robert Eugene Brashers, who died by suicide in 1999, as a suspect in the infamous 1991 murders of four teenage girls at a Texas yogurt shop. DNA testing linked Brashers, who had a lengthy criminal history including sexual assault, to the cold case where Amy Ayers, Eliza Thomas, Jennifer, and Sarah Harbison were bound, gagged, shot, and set on fire. The identification brings a measure of closure to a case that shocked the nation and saw previous convictions overturned due to new DNA evidence. The investigation remains open, but this development offers significant progress for the victims' families.</p>

          <p>David Zervos, a prominent market bull and Jefferies economist, warns that the Federal Reserve is underestimating the profound impact of the artificial intelligence boom on the labor market. He suggests that while AI could drive strong economic growth, it might simultaneously lead to a significant increase in unemployment, potentially displacing three to five million jobs within the next few years. Zervos contends this presents a dilemma for the Fed, whose dual mandate includes both full employment and price stability, arguing they should prioritize the labor market over inflation concerns. This article highlights a growing concern about AI's disruptive potential for employment and its implications for economic policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>US military officials are reportedly anticipating potential firings or demotions as Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth has summoned hundreds of generals and admirals to an unusual meeting in Virginia. Described as a "show of force" for the "new military" under President Trump's second term, the event is expected to feature an address on military standards and the "warrior ethos." This comes amidst Hegseth's previous actions, including a reduction in four-star officers and the dismissal of over a dozen senior military officials. The gathering has stirred unease, with some comparing it to historical events involving loyalty oaths, signaling a significant shift in military leadership and potentially a purge of dissenting voices.</p>
