          <p>Peter Green Chilled, a UK logistics firm supplying major supermarkets like Tesco and Aldi, has been hit by a ransomware attack, disrupting order processing. The company confirmed the cyber attack, stating that while transport activities remained unaffected, clients were receiving updates on workarounds. One of Peter Green Chilled's customers, Black Farmer founder Wilfred Emmanuel-Jones, expressed concern over potential waste of thousands of pounds worth of meat products due to delivery delays. This incident highlights the growing cyber security challenges faced by smaller logistics firms amidst an increase in retailer cyber attacks, disrupting supply chains.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, reflects on President Joe Biden's recent prostate cancer diagnosis, drawing parallels to her father's announcement of his Alzheimer's diagnosis in 1994. Davis argues that Biden's openness about his health can provide leadership on a human level, transcending political divides. She notes that while cancer is openly discussed, the emotional impact often isn't, and Biden has an opportunity to connect with voters by sharing his personal experience. Davis contrasts this with speculation about Biden's fitness for office and suggests candor could restore trust, while also noting that her father also faced accusations of hiding his illness.</p>

          <p>The US Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to end deportation protections for approximately 350,000 Venezuelans in the US with Temporary Protected Status (TPS). This decision lifts a hold placed by a California judge, marking a win for Trump's immigration policies. TPS was granted to Venezuelans in 2021 due to a humanitarian crisis in their home country, but the Trump administration sought to terminate these protections. Lawyers representing TPS holders expressed shock at the Court's decision, warning of significant humanitarian and economic consequences. The Trump administration is also expected to revoke TPS protections for Haitians.</p>

          <p>Carlos Lozada reviews new books examining the Democratic Party's awareness and handling of Joe Biden's cognitive decline leading up to the 2024 election. Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson's "Original Sin" suggests many Democrats were aware of Biden's issues but remained silent due to partisanship and fear of a Trump victory. The article details instances of Biden's forgetfulness and confusion, which were often masked by his staff. The article also references Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes' book "Fight," which portrays Biden's motives as self-serving and highlights concerns about Kamala Harris's capabilities. The author concludes that Democrats prioritized anti-Trumpism over addressing Biden's shortcomings.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece on Fox News draws parallels between Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump, arguing that both men are conservative/populist outsiders who challenged the political establishment. The article highlights Reagan's opposition to the Soviet Union and his desire to eliminate certain government departments, mirroring Trump's policies. It also notes that both presidents were popular with blue-collar voters and possessed a strong sense of humor. The author contends that the Republican Party has embraced tax cuts, a strong national defense, and a pro-life stance due to Reagan's influence, which Trump continues to pursue. The only potential difference between them, according to the article, is on trade, but the author notes that Reagan also used tariffs to save Harley-Davidson.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration will not finalize a rule that would have expanded access to GLP-1 weight loss drugs for Medicare and Medicaid recipients. This decision contrasts with some states, like South Carolina, which have chosen to cover these medications under Medicaid, though with stringent prerequisites. The high cost of GLP-1s remains a significant barrier, with some costing over $1,000 per month and requiring long-term use for sustained weight loss. The article highlights the debate over the cost-effectiveness of these drugs and their impact on state health plans, as well as the potential role they could play in addressing obesity rates. The article also notes that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. didn't rule out the possibility that Medicare and Medicaid might cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment in the future as costs come down.</p>

          <p>China's central bank reduced the five-year loan prime rate (LPR), a key reference for mortgage loans, by 10 basis points in an effort to stabilize the struggling property market. The one-year loan prime rate was also cut by 0.1 percentage points. This action follows a previous cut to the seven-day reverse repo rate, and comes as Beijing attempts to revive the property sector, which has been a drag on the economy. The article notes that these efforts are aimed at boosting domestic demand and ensuring economic stability amidst external risks under Donald Trump’s second presidency.</p>

          <p>A Texas showerhead salesman, Ramon van Meer, conducted an online experiment to gauge consumer willingness to pay more for products manufactured in the USA. Van Meer offered identical showerheads, one imported for $129 and a 'Made in the USA' version for $100 more, but found that none of the website visitors opted for the domestic model. This result challenges the notion that tariffs will spur domestic manufacturing, as consumers appear unwilling to pay a premium for American-made goods.

          <p>Despite President Trump's imposition of tariffs aimed at boosting US manufacturing and raising revenue, collecting these tariffs has been difficult. Trade experts highlight the increasing incentive for smuggling and transshipping to avoid tariffs, particularly on goods from China. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) faces understaffing and lacks the resources to effectively inspect imports and enforce trade regulations. Business owners report filing trade complaints with little effect, leading to calls for increased funding for DOJ task forces to prosecute trade fraud cases. The article suggests that the current government hiring freeze and budget cuts exacerbate the problem.</p>

          <p>NASA engineers successfully revived a dormant primary roll thruster on Voyager 1 after it had been inactive for two decades. The decision to reactivate the thruster was prompted by concerns about the spacecraft's backup thrusters, which were showing signs of potential failure. This was a critical maneuver as the thrusters are essential for maintaining the spacecraft's antenna alignment with Earth. The successful revival ensures Voyager 1 can continue its mission of exploring interstellar space, with the team optimistic about keeping it operational through its 50th anniversary in 2027.</p>

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, rose over 16% in their Hong Kong trading debut. Investors are optimistic about the company's prospects in the electric vehicle (EV) market. CATL raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion) in its IPO, which will be used to build a factory in Hungary to supply batteries to European automotive clients. The company's expansion into Europe coincides with global expansions from Chinese EV makers, amidst increased scrutiny from the U.S. and EU. The article also notes that CATL found itself in the crosshairs of U.S.-China trade earlier this year, with the Pentagon putting it on a watchlist over suspected links to China's military, allegations the company has rejected.</p>

Xi Jinping's announcement of a $9.1 billion credit line, infrastructure investments, and visa waivers for several Latin American countries is seen as China capitalizing on Trump's negative agenda. While China is seen by some as a defender of free trade and multilateralism, the United States under Trump is perceived as a nation practicing economic nationalism. The article also notes Ryan Berg's concern regarding China's invitations to 300 Latin American politicians to showcase the “model of governance” and the potential for promoting autocracy.</p>

          <p>Japan's animation industry is increasingly embracing AI, despite concerns from artists about copyright infringement and job losses. Japan's copyright laws are permissive, allowing the use of copyrighted materials to train AI models without the consent of the copyright holder. This is due to a labor crunch in the anime industry and the country's embrace of technology. While many artists are worried about AI, some studios are using AI to assist with coloring, background generation, and turning photos and videos into anime, which saves time and effort. However, some experts don't see this as threatening creativity in the East Asian country.</p>
