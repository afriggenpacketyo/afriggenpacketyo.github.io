          <p>At least 48 people, including 15 children, have died after catastrophic flash floods struck central Texas, with dozens more, primarily from a children's summer camp, still missing. The Guadalupe River rose dramatically in a short period, catching communities by surprise and prompting a massive search and rescue operation involving over 160 air rescues. Officials described the event as a "mass casualty event," and Governor Greg Abbott has signed a federal disaster declaration to provide state resources for the affected counties. The rapid and unexpected nature of the flooding has left the region devastated, with a long recovery ahead.</p>

          <p>China has introduced new regulations for the Communist Party's central commissions and leading groups, which could indicate a shift in President Xi Jinping's leadership style toward delegating more power. According to state media, the new rules are designed to standardize the policy-making and review process at the highest levels of government. These organs are now expected to focus on strategic planning and oversight of major national matters. Some analysts interpret this move as a potential step by Xi to streamline governance and possibly lay the groundwork for a future succession plan.</p>

          <p>Barry Morphew has been arrested for a second time for the murder of his wife, Suzanne Morphew, after her remains, found in a shallow grave, revealed the presence of tranquilizer drugs used on wildlife. Authorities state that Morphew, an avid hunter, was the only private citizen in the area with access to this specific drug compound. The initial murder charges from 2021 were dismissed, but the discovery of her body in 2023 and the subsequent autopsy findings led to the new indictment. Morphew has consistently maintained his innocence throughout the complex investigation, which has involved bizarre clues and revelations of his wife's secret affair.</p>

          <p>Australian authorities have charged a 34-year-old man with reckless conduct endangering life after he allegedly set fire to the front doors of a synagogue in Melbourne while worshippers were inside. The attack, which caused no injuries as people evacuated through a rear exit, has been labeled "cowardly" and antisemitic by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. This incident is part of a rising wave of antisemitism in Australia since late 2023, with this specific event also being investigated for potential links to a violent protest at a nearby Israeli-owned restaurant on the same night.

This adjustment comes after recent criticism for a pre-watershed TV performance and controversial album artwork.

          <p>President Donald Trump's foreign policy approach is being analyzed as a modern application of the 'Madman Theory,' where a leader's perceived unpredictability is used as a strategic tool to coerce concessions. This doctrine has been evident in his dealings with allies and adversaries, from questioning NATO's Article 5 to his sudden bombing of Iran after suggesting a pause. While this approach has successfully pressured NATO allies to significantly increase defense spending, its effectiveness against adversaries like Russia and Iran is questionable.

          <p>Real Madrid secured a 3-2 victory over Borussia Dortmund, setting up a highly anticipated Club World Cup semi-final against Paris Saint-Germain. Goals from academy products Gonzalo García and Fran García gave Madrid a comfortable lead for most of the match. A chaotic stoppage time saw Kylian Mbappé score a spectacular acrobatic goal for Madrid's third, followed by a late surge from Dortmund and a red card for Madrid's Dean Huijsen. The win continues a strong start for new manager Xabi Alonso, and gives Mbappé his first opportunity to face his former club, PSG, on a major stage.</p>

          <p>Recent cuts to public health and scientific research funding by the Trump administration are impacting the future of HIV research in the United States, according to a former CDC official. Dr. John Brooks warns that while treatment for current patients remains a focus, the reduction in funding for prevention research is particularly concerning and could lead to a rise in new infections. Key long-term projects, such as the development of an HIV vaccine and a cure, appear to have been canceled. This rollback threatens the previous administration's goal of eliminating the HIV epidemic in the U.S. by 2030.</p>

          <p>Tennessee Republican Representative Mark Green has officially announced his resignation from Congress, effective July 20, a move that further shrinks the already slim GOP majority in the House. With his departure, the Republican majority will be reduced to 219-212, potentially creating more challenges for Speaker Mike Johnson in passing legislation. Green, who chairs the Homeland Security Committee, stated he is returning to the private sector to start a business focused on competing with the Chinese Communist Party. His seat in the solidly Republican 7th District will remain vacant until a special election is held.</p>

          <p>An executive order from the Trump administration aimed at curtailing the use of Chinese-made drones in the U.S. highlights an ongoing effort to challenge China's dominance in the global drone market. However, industry analysts and insiders suggest that removing Chinese firms, which are world leaders in the industry, from supply chains will be difficult and costly. With very few non-Chinese drone manufacturers globally, a ban is expected to raise costs for commercial users. The move is seen by some as a negotiation tactic, but it underscores the administration's persistent fight against China's technological influence.</p>

          <p>An email from the Social Security Administration (SSA) claiming that President Trump's new spending bill eliminates federal income taxes on benefits for most seniors has been labeled misleading and a "lie" by critics. The bill provides a temporary tax deduction for seniors, not a permanent elimination of the tax, which is being phased out for higher-income individuals. Former SSA officials and Democratic lawmakers condemned the communication as a partisan and unconscionable political statement from a traditionally apolitical agency, arguing that it misrepresents the actual effects of the legislation on social security recipients.</p>

          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, made his first public appearance on Saturday since the start of the 12-day conflict with Israel in June, according to Iranian state media. Footage showed him attending a religious ceremony at a mosque in Tehran, ending speculation about his whereabouts after he had only appeared in pre-recorded messages during the war. The conflict involved a surprise Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear and military sites, followed by Iranian retaliation. Khamenei's appearance comes as the country observes the mourning period of Muharram, a significant time in the Shia calendar.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that exposure to high heat and wildfire smoke during pregnancy can negatively impact a baby's development in the womb. Research from the University of Southern California found that heat stress during the first trimester or even before conception was linked to smaller infant size. The effect was nearly doubled for mothers in climate-vulnerable neighborhoods with less access to air conditioning. Doctors are urging more attention to these climate-related risks for pregnant people, advising simple precautions like staying cool, hydrating, and wearing masks during smoke events to protect both maternal and fetal health.</p>

This move follows a public feud between Musk and President Donald Trump, primarily over a major spending bill Musk vocally opposed.
