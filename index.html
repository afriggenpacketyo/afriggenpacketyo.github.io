          <p>An effort in the Senate to block President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs failed due to Republican opposition, despite anxieties over the potential disruption to the U.S. economy. The resolution, led by Democratic and Republican senators, aimed to terminate the national emergency used to impose the tariffs, but fell short of the necessary votes. House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the administration's tariff policy, while anxieties persisted regarding its economic impact, as indicated by a slowdown in economic growth during the first quarter of 2025. Senate Majority Leader John Thune acknowledged the uncertainty surrounding the tariffs' benefits and timeline.</p>

          <p>Former Las Vegas Raiders wide receiver Henry Ruggs, currently serving time for a fatal DUI crash, is reportedly training in prison with the hope of returning to the NFL upon his release, according to former teammate Josh Jacobs. Jacobs stated that Ruggs is maintaining a positive attitude and that some teams may be willing to give him another chance. Ruggs was sentenced to over three years in prison for a 2021 incident where he drove drunk at high speeds, resulting in the death of a woman and her dog and causing injuries to his fiancée. Jacobs expressed his belief that Ruggs' future actions should not be defined by a single decision.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a contraction in the first quarter of 2025, with gross domestic product (GDP) shrinking at a 0.3% annual rate, largely attributed to businesses stockpiling goods in anticipation of President Trump's tariff policies. The slowdown occurred despite expectations of growth, raising concerns about a potential recession. Economists cautioned that the figures may be skewed due to the surge in imports ahead of the tariffs. Government spending also declined, impacting growth. Weak employment numbers further fueled recession concerns, potentially influencing the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rate cuts.</p>

          <p>Rodney Scott, President Trump's nominee to lead U.S. Customs and Border Protection, is facing scrutiny over his role in the investigation into the death of Anastasio Hernández Rojas, a migrant who was beaten by Border Patrol agents in 2010. Critics allege that Scott participated in a cover-up, while his defenders claim that he acted appropriately. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights found the U.S. responsible for Hernández Rojas' death and called for a reopening of the criminal investigation. Scott denied interfering with the investigation.</p>

          <p>The wife of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the man mistakenly deported to El Salvador, had filed a protective order against him in 2021, alleging domestic violence, according to court records. Jennifer Vasquez sought the order, describing incidents where Abrego Garcia allegedly assaulted and verbally abused her. Vasquez has since stated that she didn't pursue the court process because the situation did not escalate. Abrego Garcia's legal team responded, emphasizing that he hasn't been criminally convicted. The Trump administration has used the protective order to argue that Abrego Garcia is "not a sympathetic figure."</p>

          <p>President Trump's second term has seen a renewed focus on his "America First" policies, leading to global trade wars, expansionist ambitions, and stalled diplomatic efforts. The administration has pursued trade disputes with China, threatened tariffs against other countries, and expressed interest in acquiring territories like the Panama Canal and Greenland. While some conflicts, such as the war between Russia and Ukraine, remain unresolved, the administration has secured a mineral resources deal with Ukraine. The administration is also shrinking the federal government and cutting diplomatic structures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's promise of a massive deportation operation to Mexico, the numbers have been lower than anticipated. Data shows fewer deportations to Mexico compared to the Biden administration. The decline is attributed to reduced illegal border crossings and a focus on deporting migrants already inside the U.S., which is more complex. Meanwhile, Mexico is accepting U.S. deportees who are not Mexican citizens. Some migrants are reportedly facing difficult circumstances after being deported to Mexico.</p>
