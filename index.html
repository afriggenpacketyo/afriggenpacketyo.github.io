          <p>Honda Motor Co. reported a significant 76% drop in operating profit, falling short of analysts' expectations due to the anticipated impact of U.S. tariffs and declining sales in China and Southeast Asia. While the motorcycle business saw record sales, the automobile sector experienced a downturn, though hybrid electric vehicle sales in North America showed growth due to incentives. Honda has downgraded its financial outlook for the current fiscal year, projecting a nearly 59% decrease in operating profit, citing the considerable impact of global tariff policies. The company is also shifting its dividend policy to a "dividend on equity" approach, forecasting an increase to 70 yen per share. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>French actor GÃ©rard Depardieu was found guilty by a Paris court of sexually assaulting two women on the set of a film in 2021, receiving an 18-month suspended sentence.

          <p>President Trump announced an executive order aimed at slashing prescription drug prices in the U.S. by implementing "most favored nations drug pricing," which ties American prices to the lowest prices paid in other developed countries. The order directs government agencies to draft rules, potentially leading to significant price reductions, but implementation may take months. The article lists the most expensive prescription drugs by price, including Lenmeldy at $4.25 million, and by sales volume, such as Keytruda with $25 billion in revenue, also noting that the pharmaceutical industry argues that lowering prices could reduce investment in innovation.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom faces a health care crisis as the state's costs have spiraled out of control due to Medicaid initiatives, including the expansion of taxpayer-financed health care for immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. The state borrowed $3.4 billion to pay health insurers, doctors, and hospitals, prompting Newsom to consider rolling back coverage and benefits, despite his promise of universal health care. The expansion of Medi-Cal to low-income adults, regardless of immigration status, has led to costs soaring to $9.5 billion per year, with the federal government contributing roughly $1.1 billion for pregnancy and emergency care. Lawmakers are considering options such as freezing enrollment, imposing cost-sharing measures, or restricting benefits.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China have agreed to temporarily cut tariffs on each other's goods for 90 days, providing some relief for businesses but also prolonging uncertainty. The tax on Chinese imports to the U.S. will drop from 145% to 30%, while the tariff China charges on U.S. goods will fall from 125% to 10%. This has prompted businesses to scramble to ship as much merchandise as possible while the lower tariffs are in place, raising concerns about freight rates and potential supply chain disruptions. Some businesses may rush to produce and ship products early for the Christmas holiday season, while others are exploring alternatives to manufacturing in China.</p>

Key sticking points include changes to Medicaid, extending Trump's tax cuts, and the state and local tax deduction (SALT).

The visit aims to strengthen relationships between the two countries and will focus on trade, cultural, and defense links. The last state visit to the UK by a French president was in 2008, when Nicolas Sarkozy visited Queen Elizabeth II. This visit follows King Charles and Queen Camilla's state visit to France in September 2023, which was seen as a diplomatic success after Brexit.</p>

          <p>French film star GÃ©rard Depardieu has been found guilty of sexually assaulting two women on a film set in Paris and given a suspended jail term of 18 months.

          <p>French actor Gerard Depardieu was found guilty by a Paris court on Tuesday of sexual assault, receiving an 18-month suspended prison sentence. The charges stem from incidents in 2021 during the filming of "Les Volets Verts," where Depardieu was accused of groping two women. The court rejected Depardieu's defense, stating his version of events was unconvincing. Around 20 women have previously accused Depardieu of inappropriate conduct, but this was the first case to come to trial.</p>

Job vacancy numbers have also declined, indicating a cooling labor market. Wage growth, while slowing, is still rising faster than the rate of inflation, which may cause the Bank of England to remain cautious over future interest rate cuts.

          <p>The U.S. Army is shifting its focus from operations in Europe and the Middle East to deterring Chinese aggression in the Pacific, border security, and missile defense. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth signed a memo that has the potential to unleash profound change in the Army. These changes reflect President Trumpâ€™s main national security priorities and have their roots in the outset of his previous term. This involves redirecting resources towards weapons more relevant to combat in the Asia-Pacific theater, including air-and-missile defense, longer-range munitions, and A.I.-enabled command and control networks.</p>

          <p>Jordan Spieth is seeking to complete his career Grand Slam at the US PGA Championship, a feat that has eluded him despite a successful career. After a period of inconsistent performance, Spieth has shown recent signs of improvement, finishing in the top 10 in several tournaments. Spieth has talked about winning the career Grand Slam at the US PGA Championship as "the elephant in the room" and that doing so would feel like he had "accomplished golf". He is now in his best shape for years to finally accomplish the feat.</p>
