          <p>Following a deadly Russian missile attack on Kyiv that resulted in at least 12 fatalities and numerous injuries, former President Trump publicly appealed to Vladimir Putin to cease the strikes. Trump expressed dissatisfaction with the attacks, citing the heavy casualties on both sides and urging for a swift peace agreement. Ukrainian President Zelensky, currently in South Africa, announced his expedited return to Ukraine in response to the intensified conflict. The attack occurred during ongoing negotiations to end the war, with reports of White House pressure on Ukraine to consider territorial concessions. Optimism Score: 15</p>
