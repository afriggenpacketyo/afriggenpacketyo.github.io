          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 01:45:31 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has issued an executive order detailing new tariffs on dozens of countries, set to take effect on August 7. The duties range up to 41% for nations like Syria, while also providing some relief to trading partners such as Thailand and Malaysia with reduced rates. A significant new measure imposes a 40% tariff on all goods determined to have been transshipped to evade duties. Trade experts suggest this move introduces further uncertainty into global commerce and could provoke responses from affected nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 60-year-old man convicted for the 1994 murders of his wife and two children was executed in Florida, marking the state's ninth execution this year. This total establishes a new record for the most executions in a single year in Florida since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. Opponents of the execution had pointed to the man's military service and the narrow 7-5 jury vote that originally recommended the death sentence, which would not meet today's state law requirements.</p>

          <p>A new anti-poaching initiative in South Africa, named the Rhisotope Project, is injecting rhino horns with safe, low-level radioactive isotopes. This innovative method, developed by the University of the Witwatersrand, makes the horns detectable by radiation scanners at international borders and airports without harming the animals. The project aims to disrupt trafficking networks and deter poachers by increasing the risk of capture, offering a new technological tool to protect the country's severely threatened rhino population.</p>

          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud division, announced second-quarter revenue of $30.87 billion, an 18% year-over-year increase that slightly surpassed analyst expectations. Despite this growth, AWS faces heightened competition from Microsoft and Google, both of which reported stronger growth rates in their cloud businesses, largely driven by the boom in artificial intelligence. Amazon's leadership emphasized AWS's market-leading size and security, while acknowledging ongoing supply constraints for AI infrastructure. (not investment advice)</p>

The government has also raised the amount students can borrow through maintenance loans to help with escalating living costs. This decision follows persistent warnings from universities about facing significant financial deficits due to years of frozen fees coupled with high inflation, which has diminished the real-terms value of their funding.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the Los Angeles Angels' surprising decision to act as buyers at the MLB trade deadline, acquiring veteran players instead of selling assets to rebuild for the future. General Manager Perry Minasian justified the moves by stressing the developmental value for the team's young core to play in meaningful, high-pressure games down the stretch. However, the strategy is viewed as risky, given the team's sub-.500 record and statistically low probability of reaching the postseason this year.</p>

The 90,000-square-foot facility, funded by Trump and other private donors, will replace the current East Wing and provide a permanent, all-weather venue for large state events. This will be the first major structural addition to the executive mansion itself since the Truman Balcony was built in 1948.</p>
