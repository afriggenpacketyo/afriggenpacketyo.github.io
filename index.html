        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several cryptocurrency regulation bills, supported by the Trump administration, failed to pass a key procedural vote in the House of Representatives, representing a significant setback for the industry. The motion was blocked by a 196-223 vote, with 13 Republicans joining Democrats in opposition, stalling legislation intended to regulate stablecoins and clarify digital asset jurisdictions. This unexpected outcome during the so-called "Crypto Week" occurred despite President Trump's public endorsement, leading to a drop in the stock prices of crypto-related companies like Coinbase and Circle. House leadership may attempt another vote to advance the measures.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration, led by the White House Counsel's Office in coordination with the Justice Department, is conducting a sprawling investigation into former President Joe Biden's use of an autopen. Officials are reviewing tens of thousands of documents from the National Archives to determine if the device was used inappropriately by unelected staffers, raising questions about executive authority during the previous administration. The probe aims to uncover what decisions were directed by Biden versus his staff and whether proper safeguards were in place for the presidential signature, which holds significant legal authority.</p>

          <p>General Motors has announced plans to expand its production of gasoline-powered vehicles by manufacturing the Cadillac Escalade SUV and adding production of Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks at its Orion Assembly plant in Michigan. This facility was previously expected to be dedicated to electric vehicles, signaling a strategic shift to meet sustained high consumer demand for traditional internal combustion engine models. The decision builds on GM's recent $4 billion investment in U.S. facilities and reinforces its commitment to its profitable truck and SUV lines, even as the industry moves towards electrification.</p>

          <p>In an unusual alliance, Amazon is utilizing Elon Musk's SpaceX to launch its next batch of Project Kuiper internet satellites, highlighting the intense competition and logistical challenges in the satellite internet market. This collaboration is driven by Amazon's need to meet a Federal Communications Commission deadline requiring it to deploy half of its 3,000-satellite constellation by mid-2026. The move underscores the current dominance of SpaceX's launch capabilities, forcing a pragmatic partnership between the rival ventures of billionaires Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk as they both aim to capture the growing satellite broadband market.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade agreement with Indonesia, reducing planned U.S. tariffs on Indonesian goods from 32% to 19%. In exchange, the deal reportedly grants American firms "full access" to Indonesian markets and includes commitments for Indonesia to purchase billions in U.S. energy and agricultural products, as well as 50 Boeing aircraft. This pact is the latest in a series of negotiations following widespread tariff threats issued by the White House this spring. While the deal marks a development in U.S. trade policy, specific terms were not immediately confirmed by Indonesian officials.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly moving to eliminate bond hearings for millions of immigrants who entered the U.S. without legal status and are facing deportation proceedings. According to a memo from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a revised legal interpretation asserts that these individuals are not eligible for release from custody, a policy that could keep them detained for years as their cases are processed. This change marks a significant shift from previous practices and is expected to face immediate legal challenges, while advocates for reduced immigration have defended the move as a necessary enforcement measure.</p>

The leak, caused by a Ministry of Defence error, led to a secret and urgent operation to relocate some of those at risk to the UK, a fact concealed by a super-injunction for over a year. Analysts are now questioning the effectiveness of preventing such leaks, Britain's duty to protect its former Afghan allies, and whether the government's secrecy was also politically motivated to avoid accountability.</p>

          <p>European Union officials have welcomed the Trump administration's recent reversal on Ukraine policy, including a tougher stance on Russia and the approval of new arms sales to Kyiv. However, top EU diplomats also expressed a desire for the U.S. to share the financial burden, noting that if Europe pays for the weapons, it should be considered European support. The EU's foreign affairs chief, Kaja Kallas, highlighted this point, suggesting a deal where one party promises weapons while another pays is not true aid. The development comes as the EU's own efforts to pass new sanctions on Russia have stalled.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Texas has blocked a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) rule that would have removed unpaid medical debt from consumers' credit reports. The ruling sided with financial industry groups, finding the CFPB exceeded its authority under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The rule, issued in January, was intended to relieve the burden on approximately 15 million Americans with $49 billion in medical debt, which the CFPB argued is not a reliable predictor of creditworthiness. The decision is a setback for consumer advocates who hailed the rule as a crucial protection against complex and often inaccurate medical billing issues.</p>

          <p>Tensions between the United States and China over espionage appear to be escalating, with both nations recently announcing high-profile counter-intelligence actions. The FBI reported the arrest of a Chinese national in Italy, with Director Kash Patel vowing to hunt down those threatening U.S. national security. Shortly after, China's Ministry of State Security announced it had disrupted three foreign espionage plots, warning that foreign spies have become increasingly aggressive.

The widespread flooding caused significant disruptions, including thousands of flight cancellations and major train service interruptions.

This approach, he argued, allows the U.S. to maintain a technological lead while still engaging in trade.
