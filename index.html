          <p>Singapore Airlines shares fell over 8% after reporting a 59% drop in first-quarter net profit, attributed to lower interest income and losses from associates, including its stake in Air India. The company noted a S$405 million operating profit, down 13.8% year-over-year, and cited geopolitical uncertainties impacting its cargo business. Despite the downturn, SIA expressed confidence in its long-term strategy and noted that demand for air travel remains strong heading into the summer peak season. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A gunman wearing body armor killed four people, including an off-duty NYPD officer, in a Midtown Manhattan office building before reportedly taking his own life. The suspect, identified as a Las Vegas resident, entered the lobby and opened fire with an M4 assault rifle. The motive is under investigation, and authorities believe he acted alone after traveling cross-country. The building, which houses Blackstone and the NFL headquarters, was placed on lockdown as witnesses described barricading themselves in conference rooms.</p>
