          <p>Labubu dolls, created by Hong Kong artist Kasing Lung and sold by Chinese toy maker Pop Mart, have become a global sensation, attracting celebrity endorsements and long queues of eager buyers. The dolls' popularity has significantly boosted Pop Mart's profits, with international sales contributing nearly 40% of total revenue in 2024. Some observers believe Labubu's success reflects the appeal of Chinese creativity and culture on a global scale, despite recent challenges to China's soft power. The dolls' affordability and the trendsetting influence of celebrities like Rihanna and Lisa from Blackpink have contributed to their widespread appeal. </p>

          <p>A California appeals court has temporarily sided with President Trump, allowing him to maintain control over the California National Guard in Los Angeles. This decision blocks a lower court ruling that had ordered Trump to relinquish control back to Governor Gavin Newsom. The dispute arose after Trump federalized the Guard, citing the need to prevent interference with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, a move Newsom argued was an overreach of federal authority. The court's temporary order sets the stage for further legal proceedings regarding the extent of presidential power over state National Guard units. </p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering whether to join Israel in striking Iran, specifically targeting the Fordow nuclear enrichment site. Concerns have been raised about the effectiveness of the US Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs, known as "bunker busters," in destroying the heavily fortified underground facility. Israel, while already engaging in strikes against Iran's nuclear capabilities, lacks the necessary weaponry to significantly damage Fordow. Trump has signaled that he will take two weeks to decide whether to authorize a strike, weighing the potential consequences and the bomb's ability to achieve its objective. </p>

The decision follows a deterioration in relations after the military junta took over Niger in 2023, leading to the withdrawal of French troops. Orano, which holds a 63% stake in Somair, has been shut out of operations in key mines following a rise in anti-French sentiment. Niger possesses some of the world's largest uranium deposits. </p>

Trade-war fears have receded after U.S. and Chinese trade representatives agreed to honor the consensus reached in Geneva, allowing for rare earth and tech trade.

          <p>President Trump is considering striking Iran's Fordo nuclear site, viewing it as necessary to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. He has been briefed on the risks and benefits of bombing the underground facility and believes there is not much choice but to destroy it. Trump approved attack plans but has not made a final decision, setting a two-week deadline to allow for potential negotiations. Diplomatic efforts are underway to find a resolution, with foreign ministers set to meet with Iranian officials in Geneva. </p>
