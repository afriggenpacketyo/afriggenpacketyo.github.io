          <p>Berkshire Hathaway shares experienced a significant drop after Warren Buffett announced his plan to step down as CEO, with Greg Abel slated to take over in 2026. The announcement, made at Berkshire's annual meeting, marks the end of Buffett's 60-year tenure. While shareholders expressed confidence in the transition and Buffett's continued role as chairman, the news led to a decrease in both Class A and Class B shares. This transition marks a significant moment for the conglomerate, which Buffett transformed from a failing textile mill into a diversified juggernaut.</p>

          <p>The Israeli government has approved a plan to capture the entire Gaza Strip, according to Israeli officials, leading to concerns from the European Union and heightened tensions.

The plan aims to defeat Hamas and free hostages but is expected to exacerbate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The United Nations has voiced concerns, stating that Israel intends to use private security companies to control aid distribution inside Gaza, which they said violates its core principles.</p>

          <p>The Department of Education is resuming collections on defaulted student loans, ending a nearly five-year pause that began during the COVID-19 pandemic. This restart comes as delinquency rates among student loan borrowers are at an all-time high, with approximately 20% at risk of defaulting. Borrowers in default face potential wage garnishment, withholding of Social Security benefits, and damage to their credit scores. While the Biden administration attempted to provide debt relief, efforts were blocked by courts, leaving millions of borrowers struggling to resume payments.</p>

          <p>Two independent medical practices in Minnesota are suing UnitedHealth Group, alleging negligence related to a cyberattack on Change Healthcare, a United division, that disrupted the nation's health-care payment system. The practices claim they are being pressured to repay loans provided by Change Healthcare during the disruption, while UnitedHealthcare is denying claims for patient care due to late submissions. The lawsuit highlights concerns about the impact of corporate consolidation in health care, as the cyberattack exposed vulnerabilities within UnitedHealth's sprawling network of subsidiaries.

          <p>Tesla is experiencing a decline in its once-devoted fanbase due to CEO Elon Musk's political actions and perceived broken promises. Many Tesla owners are selling their cars and investors are dumping stock, leading to a decrease in used Tesla vehicle values. Musk's involvement with the Trump administration has further alienated some supporters. Despite Musk's pledge to dedicate more time to Tesla, the damage to the company's reputation and stock value appears to be significant, as the stock has fallen by more than 20% since the beginning of the year.</p>

          <p>An article discusses the declining power of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation to sway voters in Australia. Despite consistently supporting the Coalition and campaigning against Labor and other opponents, News Corp's impact on election outcomes has been negligible since 2010. The rise of diverse media platforms and the increasing importance of trust and objectivity in journalism have contributed to the waning influence of News Corp's opinionated outlets. The article suggests that progressives should focus on writing their own agenda and engaging with the world as it is, rather than reacting to News Corp's excesses.</p>

          <p>Shares of major Hollywood studios and streaming services, including Netflix, Disney, and Warner Bros. Discovery, briefly declined after President Trump proposed a 100% tariff on movies made overseas. Trump cited tax incentives offered by foreign countries as a national security threat. The impact of the proposed tariff is unclear, with questions surrounding which productions would be affected and how it would be implemented. Experts worry about potential retaliatory measures from other countries and the impact on international box office sales.</p>

          <p>President Trump has made several remarks about the possibility of seeking a third term in office, despite the constitutional limit of two terms. While he has previously teased the idea and suggested "methods" to circumvent the restriction, he recently stated that he will be a two-term president. Trump's comments have sparked debate and speculation, with some supporters calling for a constitutional amendment to allow him to run again. Experts suggest that his remarks may be a show of strength to counter any perception of him as a lame-duck president.</p>
