          <p>Germany is proactively preparing for a potential synthetic opioid crisis, particularly involving fentanyl and nitazenes. Cities like Essen are implementing model projects to expand drug testing, train emergency services, and develop early warning systems to prevent being overwhelmed, drawing lessons from overdose crises in other European cities. Addiction experts highlight a concerning trend of young people consuming drugs live on social media platforms, emphasizing the need for a nationwide strategy and better infrastructure to combat the growing threat before it escalates.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman discussed the significant ethical challenges his company faces with ChatGPT, expressing more concern over the cumulative impact of small model behavior decisions than major moral ones. He addressed sensitive issues like the chatbot's role in suicide prevention, the process for determining its ethical framework with input from philosophers, and the need for "AI privilege" to ensure user privacy from government subpoenas. Altman also touched on the potential military applications of AI and the technology's power to both eliminate jobs and broadly enhance human capability.</p>

          <p>China's market regulator has preliminarily found that U.S. chipmaker Nvidia violated the country's anti-monopoly laws and has announced it will continue its investigation. The probe relates to Nvidia's 2020 acquisition of Israeli tech company Mellanox, a deal that China had previously approved with specific conditions. This development adds another layer of complexity to the already tense technological and trade relationship between Beijing and Washington, coming shortly after China initiated separate probes into U.S. chip imports.

          <p>The fatal shooting of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University has raised serious questions about the event's security protocols. Security experts and witnesses criticized the choice of an open-air venue surrounded by buildings with clear lines of sight, which created a significant vulnerability. Attendees reported a lack of security checks, such as metal detectors or bag searches, for the event that was open to the general public, prompting scrutiny of the coordination between Kirk's private team and campus police.</p>

          <p>The South Korean government is investigating potential human rights violations against its citizens following a major immigration raid at a Hyundai factory in Georgia. Over 300 South Korean workers were detained for approximately a week, with US authorities alleging visa violations; the incident sparked outrage in South Korea and prompted criticism from its president. In response, President Trump stated that foreign experts are welcome in the U.S. to support complex manufacturing, but he did not announce any specific policy changes to address the concerns raised.</p>

          <p>The trial of a former British paratrooper, known only as Soldier F, has begun in Belfast for his alleged role in the 1972 Bloody Sunday massacre in Londonderry.

          <p>Russia has issued a stark warning that it will retaliate against any European state that attempts to seize its frozen sovereign assets to aid Ukraine. The threat comes as European Union officials explore new ways to leverage the hundreds of billions of dollars in Russian assets that were frozen after the 2022 invasion. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev stated that Russia would pursue legal and extra-legal action "until the end of the century" against any country involved in such a seizure, which Moscow considers to be theft.</p>

          <p>China is exploring a plan to convert its retiring coal-fired power plants into nuclear facilities, a strategy that could accelerate its transition to clean energy. The "C2N" initiative, proposed by a top state-owned energy company, would involve replacing coal boilers with fourth-generation molten salt reactors while preserving existing infrastructure like turbines and grid connections. This approach could offer a direct path to decarbonization, especially in coastal areas, and may face fewer hurdles with site safety requirements and public acceptance compared to building new nuclear plants from scratch.</p>
