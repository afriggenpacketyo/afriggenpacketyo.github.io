          <p>Welsh winger Louis Rees-Zammit has announced his decision to end his pursuit of an NFL career and return to professional rugby. After spending 18 months in the NFL's International Player Pathway Program and being part of the Jacksonville Jaguars' practice squad, he has chosen to come back to his original sport. In a social media post, Rees-Zammit stated it was the right time to make the move to prepare for the upcoming rugby season. The news is seen as a significant boost for the Welsh national rugby team, which has recently struggled with a long losing streak.</p>

          <p>Nintendo has announced a significant surge in its fiscal first-quarter revenue, more than doubling year-over-year due to the successful launch of its new Switch 2 console. The company reported sales of 5.82 million units for the new device within its first month, substantially boosting its video game platform business. Despite this strong performance, Nintendo has maintained its full-year financial guidance, a move some analysts consider conservative. The company also stated that potential impacts from new U.S. tariffs are not expected to significantly affect its current fiscal year earnings forecast. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany has officially reported a "favorable" conservation status for its wolf population in the northern Atlantic region, with numbers growing to approximately 1,600 individuals across 209 packs. This positive development has led the government to plan for the reintroduction of wolf hunting in that area, a move supported by farmers concerned about livestock protection. However, the conservation status for the rest of the country remains under review, delaying a nationwide decision on hunting. The article also notes a diplomatic visit by Germany's Foreign Minister to the West Bank to discuss rising tensions and the humanitarian situation.</p>

          <p>The BBC is under increasing pressure not to broadcast the upcoming series of 'MasterChef' following the dismissal of its hosts, Gregg Wallace and John Torode, over misconduct allegations. Broadcast union Bectu and women's rights charities have argued that airing the show would be inappropriate and distressing to the complainants, whose claims against the hosts were substantiated. One contestant has already been edited out of the series at her request after she opposed the broadcast. The BBC defended its decision, stating it consulted with contestants and believes it is important to showcase their work, though it acknowledges the situation is difficult.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a new policy restricting its main civil service internship program exclusively to university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. This initiative, driven by Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden, aims to increase representation from working-class families within Whitehall and ensure the civil service better reflects the country it serves. Successful interns will be given priority for the Fast Stream graduate program. The move has drawn criticism from the Conservative opposition, who labeled it as "leftist social engineering," but the government insists it is necessary to harness a broader range of talent.</p>

Nations like Cambodia and Thailand expressed relief after their tariff rates were significantly reduced from initially proposed levels, while others like Switzerland and Canada face steep duties of 39% and 35%, respectively. Several key Asian allies, including Japan and Taiwan, secured lower rates through negotiations. The new directive also imposes a 40% tariff on goods transshipped to avoid duties, signaling a broad and aggressive shift in U.S. trade policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British 800-meter runner Max Burgin is setting his sights on a World Championship podium finish in Tokyo after a strong start to his season. The 23-year-old, who broke numerous junior records, has faced significant hurdles in his senior career, including injuries and deep vein thrombosis that cost him major championship appearances. Now healthy, Burgin recently ran the fourth-fastest time in the world this year and is the third-fastest Briton in history, closing in on Sebastian Coe's national record. He hopes to finally translate his early potential into global success, starting with a strong performance at the UK Athletics Championships.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order imposing new tariffs on nearly 70 U.S. trading partners, set to take effect in seven days. The duties range from a baseline of 10% to as high as 41% for Syria, formalizing a policy aimed at reducing the U.S. trade deficit. The announcement follows a period of negotiation, where some countries like Japan and the European Union secured lower rates through deals. However, Canada faces a steep 35% tariff, and Mexico has received a 90-day extension, highlighting the administration's use of tariffs as a tool for leverage in international trade and foreign policy.

          <h2>Opinion: Millennial Women Face Burnout and Financial Precarity After Chasing Passion Over Pay</h2>

          <p>This opinion article reflects on the economic reality facing millennial women who were encouraged to pursue their passions, only to find themselves in precarious financial situations. The author, a freelance creative, describes a feeling of exhaustion and rage at a system that undervalues women's labor, particularly in creative fields, leading to a significant gender gap in income and retirement savings. The piece laments a lack of financial literacy education and contrasts the instability of freelance life with the security of traditional employment, half-jokingly suggesting a wealthy patron or spouse seems like the only viable safety net.</p>

          <h2>An Overview of Tariffs and Their Role in Current US Trade Policy</h2>

          <p>This article explains the function of tariffs, which are taxes imposed on imported goods, and their recent application by the Trump administration. Tariffs are typically used to protect domestic industries and jobs by making foreign products more expensive, though they can lead to higher prices for consumers. The administration has implemented various tariffs, including a 35% duty on Canadian goods and a baseline 10% rate for most other countries, with higher rates for specific trade partners. This aggressive trade policy has caused global economic volatility and drawn criticism, even as the administration defends it as a necessary negotiating tactic. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has frozen approximately $200 million in federal research grants for UCLA, citing allegations of antisemitism and discriminatory practices at the university. The funding suspension affects hundreds of grants from agencies like the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, impacting a wide range of scientific and medical research. UCLA's chancellor called the decision a "far-reaching penalty" that harms vital national work and stated the university is evaluating its options. This action follows similar moves by the administration against other major universities over campus culture and protest responses.</p>

          <p>A Delta Air Lines flight from Salt Lake City to Amsterdam made an emergency landing in Minneapolis after encountering severe turbulence, which resulted in 25 people being hospitalized. Passengers described a terrifying experience with significant shaking and a sudden drop in altitude, causing people and objects to be thrown around the cabin. Seven crew members were among the injured. The FAA and NTSB are investigating the incident, which experts suggest may be linked to the increasing frequency of clear-air turbulence associated with climate change, leading to potentially bumpier and more dangerous flights in the future.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a temporary order blocking the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for tens of thousands of immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling provides a reprieve for over 60,000 individuals who were facing the loss of their legal status and deportation protections. In her order, the judge stated the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in arguing that the administration's decision was racially motivated and did not fully consider ongoing crises in the designated countries. The planned terminations are now postponed until at least November pending further hearings.</p>

          <p>A 31-year-old man from Oxnard has been sentenced to 111 years to life in prison for a series of sexual assaults against five women between 2012 and 2020. The man used dating apps and social media to meet his victims, whom he would then physically overpower and assault. The investigation began after one victim reported an assault in 2020, leading authorities to discover text messages that identified four other women who had been victimized. The prosecutor's office highlighted the profound harm caused by the defendant's violence and expressed hope that the sentence would aid in the victims' healing process.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh has defended the court's process for handling the increasing number of emergency appeals, particularly from the Trump administration. Speaking at a judicial conference, Kavanaugh noted that as presidents use executive orders more frequently to bypass a gridlocked Congress, legal challenges inevitably increase, requiring the court to intervene. He acknowledged criticism about the lack of detailed reasoning in some emergency rulings but stated the court has made internal changes to ensure proper process. He emphasized that the justices maintain strong collegiality despite differing views on difficult and high-profile issues.</p>

          <p>Jen Easterly, who served as the director of CISA during the Biden administration, has had her appointment as a distinguished chair at West Point rescinded. The decision by the Secretary of the Army came shortly after a pro-Trump activist criticized the hire on social media, accusing Easterly of undermining the Trump administration through her previous work countering election disinformation. Easterly, a West Point graduate with a long military career, described the reversal as a "casualty of casually manufactured outrage." The Pentagon stated its focus is on training cadets as warriors, not engaging in censorship debates.</p>
