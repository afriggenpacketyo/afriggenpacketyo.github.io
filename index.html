          <p>Manchester United is scaling back celebrations and ticket allocations for the Europa League final against Tottenham Hotspur due to cost-cutting measures. The club will host a barbeque at the Carrington training ground if they win, but a parade is not planned. Players are limited to two free tickets each, with additional tickets available for purchase but without organized travel assistance. This decision follows redundancies and the removal of free lunches for staff as part of the club's efforts to manage expenses, and the club says they are committed to ensuring as many tickets as possible from the club's official 15,000 allocation go to supporters.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Faced with rising healthcare costs and a deepening budget crisis, California Governor Gavin Newsom is contemplating rolling back healthcare coverage for immigrants without legal status. This decision comes after Newsom expanded Medi-Cal to cover an estimated 1.6 million immigrants, leading to soaring costs of $9.5 billion per year. While Newsom initially promised universal healthcare, he now faces pressure to cut coverage or find alternative budget solutions, with potential cuts impacting marginalized communities. The governor's decision will be influenced by potential federal spending cuts on Medicaid, with some analysts suggesting he could blame Trump for the situation.</p>

The High Street giant said the personal information taken could also include online order histories, but added the data theft did not include useable payment or card details, or any account passwords. M&S was hit by the cyber attack three weeks ago and is struggling to get services back to normal, with online orders still suspended. The retailer said customers would be prompted to reset passwords for accounts "for extra peace of mind".</p>

          <p>Japanese carmaker Nissan has announced plans to cut an additional 11,000 jobs globally and shut down seven factories in response to weak sales. Falling sales in China and heavy discounting in the US have significantly impacted the company's earnings. The latest cutbacks bring the total number of layoffs announced by Nissan in the past year to approximately 20,000, representing 15% of its workforce. It is not yet clear where the job cuts will be made, and the company's proposed merger with Honda and Mitsubishi collapsed in February.</p>

          <p>Financial technology firms that benefited from interest rate hikes in 2022 are now facing a resilience test as interest rates decline. Higher rates boosted net interest income for fintechs like Robinhood, Revolut, and Monzo, but a broad decline in rates raises doubts about the sustainability of relying on this income. Some fintechs are diversifying their revenue streams to reduce reliance on interest and card fees. Falling rates may expose vulnerabilities in some fintechs, while others with broader income strategies may adapt and endure.</p>

Depardieu denied the charges, but the court found him guilty, adding his name to a list of sex offenders.

The results come as a boost for Duterte's daughter, Vice President Sara Duterte, ahead of an impeachment trial in the Senate in July over a raft of charges.

The ONS figures also showed that wage growth slowed, but pay is still rising faster than the rate of inflation. Analysts said the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) indicated April's increase in employer National Insurance contributions and the National Living Wage could be having an effect.</p>

          <p>Palestinian photojournalist Hassan Aslih was killed in an Israeli air strike on the emergency department of Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza, according to medical sources and eyewitnesses. Aslih, who was being treated for injuries from a previous strike, was targeted in what witnesses described as a drone attack on the hospital's surgical wing. The Israeli military had previously accused Aslih of involvement in the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel. The strike in April killed Aslih's colleague Helmi al-Faqawi and wounded several other journalists.</p>

          <p>India faces challenges in producing top-tier footballers compared to its success in cricket due to structural weaknesses in the sport's development pathway. While cricket boasts plentiful role models and a well-structured system, football lacks similar infrastructure, leading to a scarcity of young talent. The domestic leagues also play a crucial role, with the Indian Premier League (IPL) being far more lucrative than the Indian Super League (ISL), limiting investment in player development. There is hope that the identification of a major football talent could shift attention and investment towards the sport.</p>
