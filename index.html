          <p>Emerging market stocks are gaining traction as the 'sell U.S.' narrative strengthens, particularly after Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. Bank of America suggests that emerging markets are poised for a bull market, citing a weaker U.S. dollar, a peak in U.S. bond yields, and China's economic recovery. JPMorgan also upgraded emerging market equities due to easing U.S.-China trade tensions and attractive valuations. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has risen significantly this year, contrasting with the more modest gains of the S&P 500, indicating a shift in investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sixteen consumer groups are urging the European Union to address the baggage fee policies of several low-cost airlines, including Ryanair and easyJet. The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) accuses these airlines of misleading passengers with unclear baggage rules, causing confusion and distress during check-in. Passengers can incur extra charges of up to €280 for baggage, leading the consumer groups to call for a standard luggage allowance to be included in ticket prices. While Ryanair asserts compliance with EU law, other airlines argue that the fees are essential for managing weight and space, ensuring safety and punctuality.</p>

          <p>New figures are expected to show a fall in net migration to the UK, yet immigration remains a contentious issue. The article traces the history of immigration debates in Britain back to the 1968 Race Relations Act and Enoch Powell's "Rivers of Blood" speech. While attitudes toward immigration have softened, concerns persist, particularly among working-class voters who feel the impact of migration on their communities. The current Labour government, elected on a promise to reduce migration, is implementing stricter visa rules, but faces the challenge of balancing economic needs with public anxieties.</p>

          <p>The Senate is poised to vote on revoking three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a move Democrats are calling "the nuclear option". The waivers allow California to set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal regulations, including a rule to phase out gas-powered cars by 2035. Republicans argue the Congressional Review Act allows them to overturn the waivers, but Democrats contend the vote is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. The vote could impact numerous states that have adopted California's standards, with legal challenges expected.</p>

          <p>Sea temperatures around the UK and Ireland have risen sharply, with some areas 4°C warmer than normal, causing a marine heatwave. The heatwave, most intense off the west coast of Ireland, has been driven by an exceptionally warm spring and weak winds. Scientists are concerned about the potential impact on marine life, including disruptions to breeding patterns and the influx of jellyfish. While the waters are not yet above the upper limit that marine life can tolerate, the heatwave's persistence is unusual and may have lasting effects.</p>
