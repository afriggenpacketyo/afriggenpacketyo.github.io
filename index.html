          <p>The United Kingdom is facing its third heatwave of the year, with temperatures predicted to peak at 34°C on Saturday, particularly in the Midlands and south Wales. Amber heat health alerts are active for several regions, and wildfire warnings have been issued in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The prolonged warm, dry weather has led to hosepipe bans affecting over seven million people in Yorkshire, Kent, and Sussex. The heat has also impacted events like the Wimbledon tennis championships, which have implemented special rules to protect players from the extreme conditions.</p>

          <p>A farm worker in California has died from injuries sustained after falling 30 feet from a greenhouse roof during an immigration enforcement raid on a cannabis farm. While the Department of Homeland Security stated the individual was not being pursued by law enforcement, the United Farm Workers union linked the death directly to the enforcement action. The raids, part of a broader crackdown on undocumented immigrants, resulted in approximately 200 arrests and have sparked protests. A federal judge has since issued a temporary order pausing some of the administration's more aggressive arrest tactics.</p>

Brown, who is entering his third season, scored 14 points in 20 minutes, impressing coaches with his defense and offensive reads before the injury occurred. Team officials described the move to pull him from the game as precautionary, stating his ankle is fine. The game also highlighted strong performances from teammates Jordan Miller, who had 23 points and 11 rebounds, and rookie Yanic Konan Niederhauser.</p>

          <p>Irish boxer Katie Taylor secured a victory over Amanda Serrano for the third time, retaining her undisputed light-welterweight championship in a majority decision at Madison Square Garden. The bout, described as more of a tactical "chess match" than their previous encounters, saw two judges scoring it 97-93 for Taylor, with one card a 95-95 draw. The fight concluded the historic trilogy between the two pioneers of women's boxing. Following the win, the 39-year-old Taylor remained non-committal about her future in the sport, suggesting the Serrano saga is now complete.</p>

          <p>A multi-million pound penthouse owner has been in an eight-year legal battle with companies linked to the late Mohamed Al Fayed and his family over a property on London's Park Lane. The dispute, which began over a lift installation agreement, has escalated to include allegations of leaky roofs, botched renovations, and the "malicious" use of a noisy lift. The High Court filings detail a protracted conflict, reflecting Al Fayed's famously combative business approach. The article also references prior reporting where four women said they were raped by Fayed at a neighboring building.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered their seventh consecutive loss, falling 8-7 to the San Francisco Giants despite a late-game offensive surge. The team's bats, which had been quiet during the losing streak, came alive to score seven runs, but it wasn't enough to overcome an early deficit caused by starter Dustin May's struggles. May allowed seven runs in under five innings, putting the Dodgers in a hole they couldn't escape. The loss marks the team's longest losing streak since 2017 and shrinks their division lead to four games as they approach the All-Star break.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Israel's plan to move Palestinians into a secured camp in Rafah amounts to creating a concentration camp and would be a crime against humanity. The author, Raja Shehadeh, contends that the facade of Israel's adherence to international law has collapsed during the ongoing war in Gaza. He asserts that international law has consistently failed to protect Palestinians, dating back to the 1948 Nakba. The author places hope not in legal institutions but in Palestinian resilience and the belief that the truth of their suffering will eventually hold Israel and its allies accountable.</p>

          <p>Poland has finalized a deal for a second batch of 180 South Korean K2 tanks, part of a larger 2022 agreement to acquire nearly 1,000 units. This highlights Poland's efforts to become a major European military power and South Korea's rise as a key arms supplier, particularly as US stockpiles are depleted by conflicts in Ukraine and elsewhere. The acquisitions are driven by heightened security concerns following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with Poland's defense spending projected to reach 4.7% of its GDP by 2025. This strategic partnership underscores a shift in global defense dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A major terminal operator at the Port of Long Beach has initiated a $365-million expansion project, even as port activity has recently declined due to global trade uncertainties and rising tariffs. The project will increase cargo-handling capacity by 50% by filling in 19 acres of water and extending the quay to accommodate larger ships. Officials acknowledge the current slowdown in trade but express confidence in the port's long-term growth and its ability to persevere through crises. The expansion is seen as a crucial investment in strengthening America's supply chain infrastructure for the future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has laid off more than 1,000 employees as part of a broader Trump administration initiative to reduce the federal workforce. The involuntary cuts included 1,107 civil service and 246 foreign service staff, following over 1,500 voluntary departures earlier this year. Critics, including Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, argue the mass cuts will undermine national security and the department's effectiveness. Among those affected were nearly all civil service officers in the bureau that resettles refugees in the U.S., sparking protests outside the building.</p>

As part of the plea agreement, he will cooperate with authorities in exchange for a reduced sentence and will forfeit $80 million in assets.

The song's wistful and relatable lyrics about a past relationship have allowed it to connect with a vast audience. The band's frontman expressed his disbelief at the song's slow-burning and enduring popularity, which has far surpassed many mainstream hits.</p>

          <p>The British soft toy company Jellycat has abruptly stopped supplying its popular products to around 100 independent retailers in the UK, leaving shop owners confused and hurt. The company cited a "brand elevation strategy" in its emails but provided no specific reasons, stating the decision was final. Many of these small shops had stocked the toys for decades and relied on them for a significant portion of their income, especially after the brand's recent surge in popularity. The move has been criticized by both retailers and customers, who feel the company is abandoning the stores that helped build its success.</p>

The Israeli military stated it targeted a "Hamas terrorist" and that the incident was under review, but the aid group called it a "blatant violation of international humanitarian law." The tragedy highlights the daily dangers faced by civilians and the severe shortages of food and medicine that force them to seek aid.</p>

The King's long-held beliefs, once considered outliers, are now seen as more mainstream. The summit aimed to translate this philosophy into practice, highlighting projects in education and traditional crafts, and exploring how these principles can be applied even in areas of conflict.</p>

In a video message, Mayor Michael Vargas urged residents to "not go out unless necessary" and to know their legal rights. This warning comes as intensified federal immigration raids across Southern California have stoked widespread fear, targeting businesses and public spaces. The mayor's message reflects the significant community-level impact of the crackdown, which has left many typically lively areas deserted.</p>

          <p>A plan by the Czech Railway Authority to dismantle and replace the historic 123-year-old Vysehrad railway bridge in Prague is facing strong opposition. While the authority argues a new, wider bridge is necessary to handle projected increases in rail traffic, a coalition of experts and preservationists claims the iconic structure can be repaired for less money and with less disruption. The Vysehrad Bridge Foundation, backed by a public petition and endorsed by Unesco, has proposed repairing the existing bridge and adding a second, slender bridge alongside it. The debate highlights the conflict between urban development and heritage preservation.</p>
