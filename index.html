          <p>Customs officials at Mumbai's international airport arrested a passenger arriving from Thailand for attempting to smuggle 16 live snakes in their luggage. This marks the third significant wildlife seizure at the airport this month, following incidents involving venomous vipers and another with 100 creatures including lizards and possums. The confiscated snakes, including a rhino rat snake and a Kenyan sand boa, were mostly non-venomous species common in the exotic pet trade. Wildlife monitoring groups have noted a troubling increase in trafficking along the Thailand-India air route, driven by demand for exotic pets.</p>

This move followed President Trump's announcement that he was terminating all trade discussions with Canada over the tax, which he called discriminatory against U.S. firms. Canadian officials stated the withdrawal is intended to support the resumption of negotiations for a new economic arrangement with the United States. The tax would have applied a 3% levy on Canadian revenues of tech giants like Google and Meta. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Moderna announced that its experimental mRNA-based influenza vaccine demonstrated a stronger immune response than an existing shot in a late-stage clinical trial. These positive results pave the way for the company to seek regulatory approval for both the standalone flu vaccine and a combination COVID-19 and flu shot. The company had previously withdrawn its application for the combo vaccine at the FDA's request, pending this efficacy data. With the new results, Moderna plans to resubmit its applications later this year, hoping for approvals in 2026, which would mark a significant step in simplifying vaccinations.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has begun a marathon voting session on a massive Republican tax and spending package, a key legislative priority for President Trump's second term. The bill, which narrowly passed the House, includes increased spending for defense and border security, offset by cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimates it will add nearly $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. Democrats are using the 'vote-a-rama' process to force votes on controversial amendments, while GOP leaders push to meet a self-imposed July 4 deadline for the bill's passage.

He warned that Republicans are 'about to make a mistake on healthcare,' stating that the President has been misinformed by advisors about the bill's true impact.

Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama is reincarnated, but the current leader lives in exile and has a contentious relationship with the Chinese government, which views him as a separatist.

This development will likely be welcomed by the ECB as evidence that its monetary policy is successfully curbing inflation, potentially paving the way for another interest rate cut later this year.

          <p>Last-minute amendments to President Trump's major spending bill have alarmed the clean energy industry by accelerating the phase-out of tax credits and adding new taxes for wind and solar projects. Conversely, the bill introduces new benefits for fossil fuels, including classifying coal as a critical mineral for a manufacturing credit. The changes drew sharp criticism from figures like Elon Musk and industry groups, who warn of stranding investments and potentially raising future utility costs. This energy policy shift occurs as the bill's overall cost has reportedly grown, increasing its deficit impact to an estimated $3.3 trillion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to outline concessions on its controversial welfare reform bill in an attempt to prevent a rebellion from its own MPs. Prime Minister Keir Starmer was previously forced to scale back the proposed cuts after over 120 Labour MPs threatened to vote against the legislation. The changes, which include limiting cuts to Personal Independence Payments (Pip) to new claimants only, are expected to reduce the bill's savings from £5 billion to £2 billion. Despite the concessions, dozens of MPs still have misgivings, and the government faces a difficult vote to pass the bill. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Formerly affordable Sun Belt cities like Phoenix, Miami, and Dallas are experiencing sharp increases in home prices, mirroring the affordability crisis of coastal hubs like San Francisco and New York. While often seen as havens of loose regulation, these cities are now facing the consequences of their own restrictive zoning laws as they run out of room for suburban sprawl. An analysis by economists suggests that as these cities grow more affluent, residents are increasingly using existing regulations to block new development. This trend threatens to eliminate the nation's affordable housing alternatives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Researcher Explores the World of Canine Perception Through Smell</h2>

          <p>Alexandra Horowitz, who runs the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College, emphasizes that understanding dogs begins with appreciating their primary sense: smell. In her research, she explores how a dog's olfactory-focused world differs from the human visual one. For dogs, smells are not just good or bad but are crucial pieces of information that create a map of their environment. Horowitz suggests that dogs perceive the passage of time through the fading intensity of scents, meaning a person's presence lingers in a room long after they've left. This fundamental difference in perception creates a delightful mystery in the human-canine bond.</p>
