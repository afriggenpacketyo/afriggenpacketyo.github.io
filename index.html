          <h2>Investigation Reveals Lax Vetting on Walmart's Marketplace Led to Counterfeit Goods and Fraud</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CNBC investigation has uncovered significant issues within Walmart's third-party online marketplace, revealing that the company's push for rapid growth led to relaxed seller vetting processes. This resulted in customers receiving counterfeit and potentially dangerous products, with some sellers using stolen identities of legitimate businesses to create fraudulent accounts. The report details how Walmart's standards became less stringent than competitors like Amazon, creating a "Wild West" environment that put consumers at risk. In response to the findings, Walmart has reportedly begun to tighten its policies for sellers in certain categories.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook has stated that the recent price hikes for new iPhone models are not a result of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Speaking to CNBC, Cook clarified that the company has managed to avoid direct tariff impacts on its phones by adjusting its supply chain, such as increasing imports from countries like India and Vietnam. This statement comes after Apple raised the price of its iPhone 17 Pro by $100, a move many analysts had attributed to trade war costs. Cook also addressed concerns about Apple's AI development, asserting that artificial intelligence is integrated throughout the iPhone's system.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is expected to dismiss the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Erik Siebert, after federal investigators found insufficient evidence to charge New York Attorney General Letitia James with mortgage fraud. Sources indicate that despite the lack of evidence from a 2023 home purchase, Trump administration officials pressured Siebert to pursue criminal charges against James, a frequent political adversary. The anticipated firing raises significant concerns about the politicization of the Department of Justice and its potential use to target political rivals, a move James's attorney called a "brazen attack on the rule of law."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A potential agreement between the U.S. and China to resolve the ownership of TikTok could involve a licensing deal for the app's highly valued recommendation algorithm. This marks a possible shift from China's previous stance of blocking the sale of this core technology, which has been a major obstacle in negotiations. The framework could allow a U.S. entity to 'rent' the algorithm, enabling TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. under new ownership while ByteDance retains some intellectual property rights. However, this arrangement may not fully resolve national security concerns regarding data access and potential influence from China.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a Republican-backed bill to fund the government until November 21, narrowly avoiding a shutdown with a 217-212 vote. The legislation now moves to the Senate, where it is expected to fail due to strong Democratic opposition, as it lacks provisions for Democratic priorities such as healthcare funding. Senate Democrats have presented a counter-proposal that Republicans have dismissed, creating a legislative impasse.

          <p>Jamie Hepburn, a minister in the Scottish government, has resigned from his position after being accused of physically assaulting Conservative MSP Douglas Ross. The allegation stems from an incident where Ross claimed Hepburn grabbed him and swore aggressively in the Holyrood chamber. Hepburn acknowledged placing his hand on Ross's shoulder and using "choice words," but stated his resignation was based on not acting in accordance with his personal code of conduct. First Minister John Swinney accepted the resignation with regret, noting it was a single lapse in Hepburn's typically courteous behavior.</p>

While he praised the now-shorter game times, Wainwright expressed nostalgia for the strategic pauses that once built drama in high-stakes moments, allowing a "thinking man's pitcher" more time to strategize. He acknowledged the benefits of analytics for improving performance but cautioned against over-reliance on data, emphasizing the need to balance it with the human element of the game.

Advocates and former participants argue that cutting the program would remove a critical lifeline for a vulnerable population, potentially closing off pathways to higher education and better opportunities.

Furthermore, antifa is a decentralized movement with no formal leadership or structure, making it difficult to define as a singular organization.

          <p>A UK cabinet minister has rejected President Donald Trump's suggestion that the British military should be used to stop asylum seekers crossing the English Channel. During his state visit, Trump advocated for military intervention to deal with illegal migration, but UK Trade Secretary Peter Kyle clarified that this role belongs to the UK Border Force. Kyle emphasized that the military's primary focus is on national defense and global security threats. This response comes as the UK government continues its "one in, one out" deportation deal with France to manage Channel crossings, favoring diplomatic and law enforcement solutions over military force.</p>

          <p>Following the indefinite suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" by ABC, fellow late-night hosts have responded with a mix of humor and solidarity, condemning the move as an act of censorship. Stephen Colbert called the suspension a "blatant assault on freedom of speech," while Jon Stewart and Jimmy Fallon used satirical sketches to mock the idea of government-compliant comedy praising President Trump. The suspension came after Kimmel's comments on the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and subsequent pressure from the FCC. The collective response from the late-night community highlights widespread concern over free speech and media independence.</p>

          <h2>Legal Analysis Condemns Trump's Authorization of Naval Strikes as Unlawful</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic argues that President Trump's orders for the U.S. Navy to conduct lethal strikes on suspected drug boats from Venezuela are illegal under both international and American law. The author contends that the administration's justification—that these boats pose an imminent "narco-terrorist" threat—fails the established legal tests for the use of force, which require a threat to be instant and overwhelming. The article warns that these actions set a dangerous precedent, treating a law enforcement issue as an act of war and potentially acclimating the public to the idea of the military as the president's personal enforcement tool.</p>

          <p>Jerry Greenfield, co-founder of Ben & Jerry's, has resigned from the company, stating that its parent corporation, Unilever, has silenced its ability to speak out on social and political issues. This move is presented in an opinion piece as a symbol of the broader decline of corporate social responsibility in an era of political pressure. The article highlights recent conflicts where Unilever allegedly suppressed Ben & Jerry's board from calling for a Gaza ceasefire and advancing its social mission. The author argues that corporations are increasingly choosing to avoid controversy and curry favor with powerful political figures, marking an end to an era where businesses actively promoted progressive values.</p>

          <p>Chinese shipping firm SeaLegend Line has launched a new express service to Europe via the Arctic's Northern Sea Route, aiming to provide a faster alternative to the traditional Suez Canal path. The first vessel, the Istanbul Bridge, departed from Qingdao and is expected to reach Gdansk, Poland, in about a month, significantly reducing transit time. This service is specifically designed for time-sensitive and high-value cargo, such as e-commerce goods and power batteries. While the route is faster, the company notes that the cost per container is higher than traditional sea freight but lower than rail, positioning it as a competitive middle-ground option.</p>

          <p>False reports circulating on Chinese social media that Poland officially sent troops to Ukraine have been debunked.

The Polish Ministry of Defense clarified that any joint training or cooperation would take place exclusively on Polish territory. Despite this, sensationalist articles and videos continued to spread the false narrative, which aligns with pro-Russian and Chinese state-sponsored messaging portraying NATO as an aggressor.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced a "high-powered demography mission" to combat what he describes as a "conspiracy" of irregular migration, particularly from neighboring Bangladesh. In his Independence Day speech, Modi claimed that "infiltrators" were taking jobs and land, framing the issue as a national security crisis. Critics argue that the mission is a political tactic designed to target Muslim populations and other perceived outsiders under the guise of national interest. This move follows other controversial citizenship initiatives by Modi's Hindu nationalist government, which opponents say are intended to engineer the electorate and create a climate of fear.</p>

          <p>The job search process has accelerated for many workers, according to a recent ZipRecruiter survey of new hires. The survey found that nearly half of respondents secured a new role within one month, and the median number of applications sent before receiving an offer dropped from 30 to 24. A labor economist suggests this trend is due to a better alignment between job seekers' goals and employers' needs, with both sides prioritizing stability. While fewer hires are landing their "dream job," satisfaction remains high, with workers increasingly valuing culture fit and flexibility in a tighter labor market.</p>
