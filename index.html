          <p>The four victims killed in the Midtown Manhattan office shooting have been identified, including off-duty NYPD Officer Didarul Islam and Blackstone executive Wesley LePatner. The gunman, who authorities believe was targeting the NFL's offices in the building, also killed a security guard, Aland Etienne, and a real estate associate from Rudin Management. The shooter's motive appears linked to a note blaming a head injury on the NFL. An NFL employee was also seriously injured but is now in stable condition, as the city mourns the victims of the tragic attack.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to revoke its 2009 "endangerment finding," a scientific determination that greenhouse gases threaten public health and must be regulated under the Clean Air Act. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin described the move as a major deregulatory action, which would repeal all resulting emissions regulations for vehicles and other sources. This action challenges the legal basis for rules on cars, power plants, and oil and gas operations. Critics argue the repeal ignores strong scientific evidence and could face significant legal challenges, while proponents claim it will save billions in regulatory costs.</p>

          <p>While watermelon is a hydrating and nutritious summer fruit, health experts caution against excessive consumption due to potential negative effects. It is a high "FODMAP" food, meaning its sugars can cause digestive issues like bloating and gas, particularly for those with irritable bowel syndrome. The fruit also contains tyramine, an amino acid that can trigger migraines in susceptible individuals. Additionally, its natural sugar content, while moderate, requires people with diabetes to be mindful of their intake to avoid significant impacts on their blood sugar levels.</p>

          <p>The mass shooting in Manhattan, carried out by a Las Vegas resident, has drawn attention to Nevada's firearm regulations. The gunman legally purchased the revolver used in the attack and held a concealed weapon permit issued in the state.

          <p>Los Angeles County has recorded its highest number of drug overdose deaths in July over the past decade, and some experts believe extreme heat is a contributing factor. High temperatures can dangerously affect the body's ability to regulate its temperature, especially when combined with substances like opioids or methamphetamine. Opioids can impair the body's natural cooling mechanisms, while stimulants can lead to overexertion in the heat. However, official records often undercount heat-related fatalities, as the cause of death is typically attributed directly to the drug rather than environmental factors.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers in North Carolina successfully overrode several of Democratic Governor Josh Stein's vetoes by securing votes from a few Democratic party members. This allowed the GOP to enact new laws targeting transgender rights, permitting firearms on private school grounds, and eliminating a greenhouse gas reduction mandate. While Republicans fell short on other priorities like permitless concealed carry and eliminating DEI initiatives, the votes demonstrated their ability to build a "working supermajority" on certain issues. The divisions highlight the complex political landscape within the state's Democratic caucus.</p>

          <p>A severe hunger crisis in the Gaza Strip is escalating into a full-blown famine, according to United Nations agencies and photographic evidence of widespread suffering. Israel's blockade on most food and aid, combined with distribution challenges, has left many of Gaza's two million residents on the brink of starvation. Health authorities report over 130 deaths from famine and malnutrition since the war began. Aid groups state that the number of aid trucks permitted by Israel is far below what is necessary to avert a humanitarian catastrophe, as civilians face extreme danger seeking food.</p>

          <p>Apple has launched its new Manufacturing Academy in Detroit, offering free workshops on artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing for small and medium-sized businesses. The initiative, part of Apple's broader U.S. investment commitment, aims to help companies implement smart manufacturing technologies through training led by Apple experts and Michigan State University. The move comes as Apple faces political pressure from the Trump administration to increase its domestic manufacturing presence. The company currently produces few products in the U.S. but is expanding some operations, including this new training facility.</p>

          <p>The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a private group backed by the U.S. and Israel to manage aid distribution in Gaza, is led by Johnnie Moore, an evangelical leader and public relations professional with deep ties to Republican politics. His appointment is controversial given his lack of humanitarian aid experience and the severe hunger crisis unfolding in the region. On a media tour, Moore has defended the GHF, blaming the UN and Hamas for creating a false narrative of starvation. Critics argue his primary role appears to be managing the public relations of the crisis rather than effectively addressing the disaster.</p>

          <p>Spotify shares experienced their worst single-day drop in two years, falling over 11% after the company released a disappointing financial outlook. The music streaming service's revenue forecast for the third quarter fell short of Wall Street expectations, and it reported a net loss of 86 million euros, citing increased personnel and marketing costs. While the platform's monthly active users and premium subscribers continued to grow, its advertising-supported revenue saw a slight decline. CEO Daniel Ek acknowledged execution challenges but expressed confidence in the company's long-term strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A coalition of 20 states has filed a lawsuit to block a Trump administration directive requiring them to share personal data of recipients in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). State attorneys general fear the information, including immigration status and home addresses, will be used for mass deportation efforts, not for combating fraud as the administration claims. The USDA has threatened to withhold program funding if states do not comply. The lawsuit argues the demand is an illegal violation of privacy and a "bait-and-switch" against vulnerable families who provided information to receive food aid.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece critiques the Pentagon's recent decision under Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth to ban all department participation in conferences and events hosted by think tanks. The author argues the move stems from resentment, insecurity, and a fear of officials misspeaking and drawing the ire of President Trump. The article suggests the ban will damage vital civil-military relationships and prevent the exchange of ideas necessary for national defense policy. By isolating itself, the Pentagon leadership avoids public scrutiny but also misses crucial opportunities for learning, debate, and engagement with experts.</p>

His parents emphasized that they did not want their son's death to be in vain and urged the public to understand the risks of swimming in lakes and other freshwater bodies.

          <p>The recent deadly shooting at the NFL's Manhattan headquarters, carried out by a gunman who reportedly blamed football for giving him CTE, has reignited the debate over the league's handling of brain injuries. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated head trauma, which can only be diagnosed after death. For decades, the NFL downplayed the connection between football and CTE, despite a growing number of former players being diagnosed posthumously after suffering from severe cognitive and behavioral issues. The incident brings the sport's existential crisis over player safety back into the spotlight.</p>
