CEO Richard Dickson stated that the company does not expect meaningful price increases for consumers.

The court rejected the administration's justification under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA).

While debt settlement can be achieved through various avenues, including bankruptcy or debt management programs, it's crucial to clarify the terms with the debt relief company.

          <p>Arthur T. Demoulas, CEO of Market Basket, has been placed on leave by the company's board, reigniting a long-standing family feud. The board cited oversight concerns and disputed succession plans as reasons for the move, alleging that Demoulas planned a work stoppage and resisted an appropriate succession plan. A spokesperson for Demoulas called the board's claim "a farcical cover for a hostile takeover." This controversy follows a previous attempt to oust Demoulas a decade ago, which was thwarted by an employee strike.</p>

          <p>Coco Gauff has voiced her support for women's matches being given night sessions at the French Open, echoing the sentiments of fellow WTA star Ons Jabeur. The prime-time TV slot at Roland Garros has exclusively featured men's matches thus far, and last year, not a single women's match was selected. Gauff believes that women's matches are worthy of a night spot, highlighting the high-quality tennis and great stars on the women's side. She suggests that the tournament could improve in the future by providing more opportunities for women to showcase their talent during night sessions.</p>

The Alternative for Germany party, a nationalist and anti-immigration party, has been designated as such, enabling the government to tap members' phones and hire informants. This approach has drawn criticism from U.S. figures like Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The German constitution was shaped by the United States.
