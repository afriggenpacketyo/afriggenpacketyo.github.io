          <p>President Trump has indicated he plans to send National Guard troops to Chicago to address crime, a move that has drawn sharp criticism from Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who called the comments "unhinged." While the president asserted his right to intervene regardless of local approval, Pritzker has stated he will not request federal troops and is prepared to challenge such a deployment in court. This development follows similar federal interventions in Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles, escalating tensions between the administration and local governments over the use of military forces for domestic law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Alphabet's autonomous driving unit, Waymo, is expanding its robotaxi testing to Denver and Seattle, initially with human safety drivers behind the wheel. This move is part of the company's broader strategy to scale its driverless ride-hailing service across the United States, which is already commercially available in several major cities including Austin and San Francisco. The test fleets in the new cities will consist of electric Jaguar iPace and Geely Zeekr vehicles. Waymo's expansion signifies a continued push towards validating its technology for future fully autonomous operations in more diverse urban environments.</p>

          <p>Alphabet's stock price increased by 8% following a federal judge's ruling in a major antitrust case that spared Google from the most severe potential penalties. The court decided against forcing the company to sell its Chrome browser, a key asset for its advertising business. However, the ruling does prohibit Google from engaging in exclusive contracts that make its search engine the default on devices and mandates the sharing of some search data with rivals. The decision provided relief to investors who had feared a more disruptive outcome for the tech giant's core operations. (not investment advice)</p>

Sabalenka will now face American fourth seed Jessica Pegula in a rematch of last year's final. Pegula secured her spot by defeating Barbora Krejcikova in straight sets, continuing her impressive run in the tournament without dropping a single set. Vondrousova's withdrawal is a disappointing end for the 2023 Wimbledon champion, whose career has been frequently hampered by injuries.</p>

          <p>The government in England is planning to introduce a new law that would prohibit the sale of high-caffeine energy drinks to anyone under the age of 16. The proposed ban aims to address health concerns linked to excessive caffeine consumption in children, such as headaches, sleep problems, and heart issues. This legislative action follows voluntary bans already implemented by most supermarkets and comes in response to calls from health experts and public figures like chef Jamie Oliver. A 12-week consultation will be held to gather evidence before the law is finalized.</p>

          <p>A new cryptocurrency, WLFI, launched by the Trump family's World Liberty Financial, has added approximately $5 billion to the family's wealth on paper, despite the token's value dropping after its debut. The family holds 22.5 billion tokens, which are currently locked and cannot be sold. This venture aligns with President Trump's second-term embrace of cryptocurrency, a stance that has raised conflict-of-interest concerns among watchdog groups. The token's launch underscores the family's growing involvement in the digital asset space, which also includes other branded crypto projects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian student and prominent organizer of campus protests against the war in Gaza, has returned to Columbia University to begin his graduate studies. His return comes four months after he was arrested by federal immigration authorities during a naturalization interview and nearly deported. Mahdawi, who was never charged with a crime, stated that the government has "failed to silence me" and vowed to continue his activism for peace and justice. His case, which is still ongoing, has drawn national attention and raised concerns about free speech and the targeting of pro-Palestinian advocates.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Justice Department has authorized approximately 600 military lawyers to serve as temporary immigration judges to help address a massive case backlog in the nation's immigration courts. This decision follows a recent change that lowered the qualification requirements, removing the need for prior immigration law experience. The move is part of the Trump administration's aggressive immigration policy, which has increased arrests and deportations, overwhelming the court system. The courts have also seen over 100 judges depart this year, exacerbating the need for more judicial personnel.</p>

          <p>Howard Webb, the chief of English football's refereeing body PGMOL, has acknowledged that the decision to disallow a goal for Fulham in their recent match against Chelsea was a "misjudgement." The goal, scored by Josh King, was overturned after a lengthy VAR review for a foul in the build-up, a decision that Fulham's manager called "unbelievable." Webb stated that the call was "wrong" and did not meet the high threshold required for VAR to intervene and overturn an on-field decision. The official who served as the VAR for that game was subsequently stood down from his next assignment.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military has conducted a strike in the southern Caribbean against a vessel that departed from Venezuela and was allegedly carrying illegal narcotics.

The incident heightens the already significant tensions between Washington and the government of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, whom the U.S. has accused of leading a drug cartel. This strike follows the recent deployment of U.S. warships to the region for an anti-drug trafficking mission, a move Maduro has condemned as a threat.</p>

His betting history in tennis includes a recent loss on Taylor Fritz against Sinner in a previous final, though he did successfully bet on Sinner at the Australian Open.

          <p>This article outlines several effective methods for paying off a substantial credit card balance, such as $20,000. Options include working with a debt relief company for management or settlement, consolidating debts into a single loan with a lower interest rate, or employing payment strategies like the "debt avalanche" or "debt snowball." Additional recommendations involve increasing income through a side hustle, carefully considering a home equity loan, or making strategic budget cuts to free up funds for repayment. These approaches can provide a structured path for individuals to regain control of their finances. (not investment advice)</p>

Their lawyers report being unable to have private conversations with them and that a local attorney has been blocked from visiting them in a maximum-security prison.

          <p>Constellation Brands, the maker of Modelo and Corona beers, has significantly reduced its full-year financial guidance, citing a challenging economic environment that is weakening consumer demand. The company's stock fell over 6% after it announced that sales to Hispanic consumers, a key demographic, have seen a pronounced decline, which it attributes to concerns over immigration policies and potential job losses. The revised outlook anticipates a drop in organic net sales and beer sales, reflecting lower purchasing frequency and spending from consumers in the high-end beer market. (not investment advice)</p>
