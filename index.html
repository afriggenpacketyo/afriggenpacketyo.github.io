          <p>Samsung Electronics announced it has signed a major $16.5 billion contract to supply semiconductors, causing its shares to rise over 2%. The deal, effective from July 26, 2024, is set to run until the end of 2033. Citing a request from the counterparty to protect trade secrets, Samsung has not disclosed the name of the other company involved. This long-term agreement comes as a significant development for Samsung's foundry service, the second-largest globally, which manufactures chips based on designs from other firms, even as the company faces challenges in the competitive AI chip market.</p>

          <p>Chinese swimming prodigy Yu Zidi, aged 12, is making a significant impact at the World Aquatics Championships in Singapore. She is a contender for a medal in the 200m individual medley, which could make her the youngest medalist at a major international event in nearly 90 years. While 18-year-old world record holder Summer McIntosh is the favorite, Yu's performance has already drawn global attention. Having emerged on the national scene in China in 2024, Yu has rapidly become one of the world's fastest in multiple events, with strong prospects in the 200m butterfly and 400m medley.</p>

          <h2>Shenzhen Introduces Leniency Policy for Failed State-Funded Innovation Projects</h2>

          <p>Authorities in Shenzhen, China's technology hub, have implemented new rules mandating leniency for innovators whose government-funded projects fail to meet their goals. The policy applies to universities, hospitals, and companies, stating that individuals should not be punished if mistakes were made without misconduct or abuse of power. Exemptions cover failures due to technical difficulties, market changes rendering products unviable, or incomplete research from exploring new methods. The move aims to encourage researchers to boldly explore new frontiers without fear of their careers being hindered by unsuccessful but well-intentioned projects.</p>

          <p>Boston Red Sox manager Alex Cora has cautioned his players against believing media reports ahead of the MLB trade deadline, specifically targeting his former employer, ESPN. Cora claimed that during his time as an analyst at the network, he witnessed people in the green room fabricating trade rumors. He advised his players to block out the noise, distinguishing between responsible journalists and those who are not. An ESPN source stated the network stands by its reporting, while Cora declined to name specific individuals, noting the pressure-filled environment the rumors create for players like All-Star Jarren Duran.</p>

          <p>Japan's political landscape is experiencing a significant shift with the rise of the far-right Sanseito party, which increased its seats from one to fifteen in recent elections. Running on a "Japanese First" slogan, the party has capitalized on public frustration over economic issues like high inflation, stagnant wages, and rising food prices. The party's platform also focuses on anti-immigration rhetoric and discontent over the behavior of tourists, mirroring populist movements in other countries. This surge challenges the long-standing dominance of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and signals a new, more volatile era in what has traditionally been a stable political environment.</p>

On "Face the Nation," Vought claimed he didn't even know the specifics of the Project 2025 chapter on the Fed, despite the project's detailed plan to limit the Fed's mandate to stable money. Trump has recently intensified his attacks on Fed Chair Jerome Powell, focusing on an office renovation project, while Vought asserted the administration's primary ask is simply for the Fed to lower rates.</p>

          <p>A significant rift is forming within the Republican party over a push to release federal files related to Jeffrey Epstein, with House Speaker Mike Johnson calling the effort "reckless." Rep. Thomas Massie, a co-sponsor of the measure, warns that blocking a vote could become a political liability for the GOP in the midterms, potentially costing them their majority. Johnson argues the bill lacks adequate protections for victims, a claim Massie refutes as a "straw man argument," insisting the legislation was crafted to redact victims' names. The controversy highlights deep divisions as pressure mounts from the party's base for transparency.</p>

The performance of the concept album was framed as a satirical commentary on political authoritarianism, but the enduring power of the songs themselves remained the main draw.

Investment migration experts report a significant surge in applications from U.S. citizens, who cite concerns ranging from gun violence to political polarization.

Thousands of dogs are brought into the country annually, often sold via social media with minimal vetting, leading to issues with infectious diseases like Brucella canis and severe behavioral problems. The BBC found owners who received dogs from countries like Romania and Ukraine that were aggressive or ill, creating a "ticking time bomb" for public and animal health.

          <p>A 60 Minutes report details the emotional story of an Argentine family's search for a baby stolen by the military regime in 1978. Mariana Eva Pérez spent her life searching for her brother, Rodolfo, who was born in captivity before their mother was killed. In 2000, she found him living as Guillermo Gomez, raised by an air force intelligence officer involved in his mother's capture. The discovery brought a painful truth instead of a happy reunion, creating a complex and fractured relationship. Now a human rights lawyer, Guillermo has embraced his true identity, but the story highlights the enduring trauma and broken bonds left by the dictatorship.</p>

          <p>An investigation by journalist Miriam Lewin and photographer Giancarlo Ceraudo successfully tracked down a Skyvan PA-51 airplane used by Argentina's military dictatorship for "death flights." During the regime, political prisoners were drugged and thrown from the plane into the Atlantic Ocean. The investigators found the plane in the U.S., obtained its flight logs, and used them as crucial evidence to document the flights and identify the pilots responsible. This evidence was instrumental in a landmark 2017 trial that convicted dozens for crimes against humanity, bringing a measure of justice and an irrefutable witness to the state's atrocities.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has successfully shut down four dark websites that formed a massive network for sharing child sexual abuse material, leading to at least 18 convictions. The investigation, dubbed Operation Grayskull, targeted a network with over 120,000 members that traded millions of horrific and violent files. Among those convicted was William Spearman of Alabama, a lead administrator sentenced to life in prison, whom the DOJ called one of the world's most significant purveyors of such material. Officials described the operation as one of the most successful of its kind, dismantling a sophisticated and sadistic online community.</p>

          <p>Oscar Piastri's victory at the Belgian Grand Prix showcased the fine margins defining the championship battle between him and his McLaren teammate, Lando Norris. Piastri secured the win by taking the lead from Norris at the start, a move enabled by a braver line through Eau Rouge and a minor mistake by Norris at La Source. The race also turned on pit strategy, with Piastri opting for medium tires while Norris chose hards, a decision that ultimately left him unable to close the gap despite a late charge. The event highlighted the intense but respectful competition between the two drivers as they push each other for supremacy.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the unexpected drop in Honeywell's stock price following a recent earnings report that beat expectations and raised guidance. Despite strong performance in its aerospace and automation businesses and a strategic plan to split into three companies, the stock has underperformed. Potential reasons for the decline include the complexity of the company's structure, the long timeline for the planned spinoffs creating "spin purgatory," and a lack of significant exposure to the booming data center market. The author expresses conviction in the company's long-term value and plans to buy more shares on the dip. (not investment advice)</p>
