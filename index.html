          <p>The FBI has terminated a group of agents who kneeled at a civil rights protest in Washington, D.C., following George Floyd's death in 2020. These agents, primarily from the FBI's Washington Field Office, were photographed kneeling during the protest. The FBI Agents Association has condemned the firings, arguing that they weaken the bureau by eliminating valuable expertise and damaging trust between leadership and the workforce, ultimately posing a risk to national security. A source indicated that the agents kneeled as a de-escalation tactic when outnumbered by angry protestors, and a previous internal review found it was not a political statement. Despite the explanation, the agents were fired, raising concerns about the FBI's handling of dissent. </p>

          <p>The article discusses the potential federal government shutdown as Congress faces a deadline to pass a funding bill. Disagreements between Republicans and Democrats over healthcare protections, including Affordable Care Act premium tax credits, are stalling negotiations. A shutdown would leave hundreds of thousands of federal employees without paychecks and could delay key economic data releases. The article also notes historical precedents, such as the 2018-2019 partial shutdown over border wall funding, and highlights the potential impact on non-essential services like national parks and museums, as well as essential services like national security.

          <p>The article reports that Shane Tamura, the gunman in the Midtown Manhattan mass shooting, was found to have low-stage CTE. Tamura, who killed four people before taking his own life, left notes referencing CTE and requesting his brain be studied. CTE, a brain disease common in athletes with repeated head injuries, can cause behavioral changes and cognitive decline. The article emphasizes that CTE should not be seen as the sole cause of the violence and underscores the need to prevent brain trauma in young athletes. The medical examiner's office noted that the manifestations of CTE remain under study. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration is pressing the Supreme Court to review an executive order restricting birthright citizenship, challenging the long-standing interpretation of the 14th Amendment's Citizenship Clause. The order seeks to limit automatic citizenship to children of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a class action lawsuit against the order, arguing that it is unconstitutional and creates a permanent, multigenerational subclass. The Supreme Court's decision in "United States v. Wong Kim Ark" (1898) established that nearly all children born on U.S. soil are citizens. </p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 23:05:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has directed Justice Department agents to protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities and instructed counterterrorism task forces to investigate attacks against federal authorities. This decision follows a shooting at an ICE field office in Dallas, which resulted in one death and two injuries, marking the latest in a series of attacks targeting ICE facilities and agents. Bondi's directive includes deploying DOJ agents to ICE facilities and initiating investigations into what she describes as "domestic terrorism." The move reflects the Trump administration's increased focus on immigration enforcement and the escalating tensions surrounding ICE operations. </p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto has intensified into a Category 4 hurricane in the Atlantic, but there are no immediate coastal watches or warnings for the U.S. The storm is located approximately 390 miles northeast of the northern Leeward Islands and is moving west with maximum sustained winds of 145 mph. While it is not expected to make landfall, it could bring some downstream impacts to parts of the Southeast U.S. coast. Forecasters are also monitoring a second storm system over the northeast Caribbean that could develop into a tropical depression. </p>

          <p>The article discusses the possibility of Hurricane Humberto interacting with another developing storm in the western Atlantic, potentially leading to the Fujiwhara effect. This rare phenomenon involves two storms merging and becoming entangled around a common center. The likelihood of this occurring depends on the strength and size of each storm; a weaker system might be absorbed by a stronger one. Forecasters expect Humberto to move northwest and strengthen, while the second storm is expected to strengthen as it tracks toward the Bahamas, increasing the chances of storm surge and rainfall in the southeastern U.S. The article suggests that any interaction between the storms might slightly alter their expected paths. </p>

          <p>Three women, Ashleigh Brown, Cynthia Raygoza, and Sandra Carmona Samane, have been indicted on charges of illegally "doxing" a U.S. Customs and Immigration agent in Los Angeles. The women are accused of disclosing the agent's personal information and conspiracy, following an incident where they allegedly followed an ICE agent to their residence and shouted messages. Federal law enforcement leaders have expressed concern about the "doxing" of agents, and the indictment marks the first prosecution related to such tactics.

          <p>The cause of death for Travis Decker, accused of killing his three daughters, "may never be known," according to the Chelan County Coroner. The coroner's office received only "minimal skeletal remains," making it impossible to determine the cause, manner, or time of death. A forensic anthropologist examined the remains. Decker was the suspect in the May killings of his three daughters, and DNA testing confirmed he was the only suspect in the murders. The search for Decker began after he failed to return the girls to their mother. </p>

          <p>President Trump has directed his administration to declassify any federal records about Amelia Earhart, whose 1937 disappearance has captivated the public for decades. A lawmaker representing the Northern Mariana Islands urged Trump to release the records, citing "credible, firsthand accounts" that Earhart was spotted on Saipan. Theories surrounding Earhart's disappearance range from her being on a spy mission to simply running out of fuel. Previously released FBI documents reveal a 1967 request for a security review of a manuscript citing Navy files on Earhart. </p>
