          <p>An Australian woman, Erin Patterson, has been convicted of murdering three relatives and attempting to murder a fourth by serving them a meal containing poisonous death cap mushrooms. The jury rejected her defense that the poisoning was an accident, following a nine-week trial that captivated the nation. Prosecutors highlighted strained family relationships as a potential motive, although Patterson's lawyers argued she had no reason to commit the crime. She now faces a potential life sentence for the killings.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced his intention to impose an additional 10% tariff on any country that aligns with what he termed the "Anti-American policies of BRICS." This threat came as the BRICS nations, a bloc of developing countries, met and criticized unilateral protectionist measures, warning they could disrupt the global economy. The statement adds another layer of complexity to global trade relations, as the Trump administration prepares to finalize and implement its broader tariff strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This analysis piece posits that the European housing crisis, exacerbated by the financial sector, poses a significant political threat across the continent. Since the 2008 financial crisis, institutional investors have increasingly treated housing as a lucrative asset class, driving up prices and rents beyond the reach of working and middle-class citizens. The article argues this "corporate capture" of homes, enabled by government policies, fuels inequality and political disenfranchisement, contributing to the rise of far-right movements. It concludes that housing must be reclaimed as a public priority rather than a financial instrument. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of the devastating Texas floods that killed nearly 80 people, questions are being raised about whether officials provided adequate and timely warnings to residents and campers. Local officials stated the severity and speed of the flooding, with the river rising nearly 30 feet, were unexpected and that warning systems are limited by cost and lack of cell coverage. The National Weather Service defended its actions, stating it issued flood watches and warnings with several hours of lead time, highlighting the challenges of forecasting and communicating such an unprecedented event.</p>

          <p>Mexico secured its 10th Gold Cup title by defeating the United States 2-1 in a heated final in Houston. West Ham's Edson Álvarez scored the decisive goal in the second half, a winner confirmed by VAR after an initial offside call. The match was marked by controversy, as U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino was incensed by a denied penalty claim for a handball minutes before Mexico's winning goal. The loss concludes an uneven tournament for a second-choice U.S. squad in its final competitive match before hosting the 2026 World Cup.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Elon Musk's proposal to create a new "America Party" reveals the significant legal and logistical hurdles he would face. Experts note that establishing a new political party in the U.S. is an extraordinarily difficult and expensive process, involving navigating a complex web of 50 different state laws designed to favor the existing two-party system. Despite Musk's vast wealth, the effort would likely require years of work and hundreds of millions of dollars to overcome ballot access rules and inevitable legal challenges from the Democratic and Republican parties.</p>

          <p>An analysis by BBC News examines how Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), an al-Qaeda affiliate, has become one of Africa's most lethal militant groups. Formed in 2017 in Mali, the group has expanded its operations across Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger, exploiting local grievances and state weakness to recruit members and impose its strict interpretation of Islamic law. The article notes a dramatic spike in attacks in 2025, with the group claiming to have killed nearly 1,000 people since April, despite counter-insurgency efforts by regional governments and their international partners.</p>

They emphasized the need for international standards to ensure trust and security, and called for equal access to AI technologies for all countries, particularly those in the Global South, to prevent market barriers.</p>

          <p>A recent round of indirect ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas, mediated by Qatar and Egypt, has concluded without any significant progress. While messages were exchanged between the delegations, key obstacles and gaps remain between the two sides' positions. Hamas is reportedly holding to its demands for a guaranteed end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal, conditions Israel has previously rejected. The talks are expected to resume as mediators continue their efforts to broker an agreement to release hostages and halt the fighting in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Fire crews are making significant progress in containing the Madre fire in San Luis Obispo County, the largest wildfire in California so far this year. As of Sunday, the blaze, which has burned over 80,000 acres, was 30% contained, a substantial increase from the previous day. Favorable weather conditions and an influx of nearly 1,400 firefighting personnel have bolstered the effort. The fire, which started near New Cuyama, threatens the Carrizo Plain National Monument and has prompted evacuation orders, but officials are optimistic about continued progress before a predicted midweek heatwave.</p>

          <p>The Washington Nationals have fired manager Dave Martinez and general manager Mike Rizzo amid their sixth consecutive losing season since their 2019 World Series victory. The team, currently holding one of the worst records in the National League, has struggled to rebuild after trading away its championship-era stars. Owner Mark Lerner stated that while he was grateful for their past success, a "fresh approach and new energy" was necessary for the club. The move marks the end of an era for the franchise, which Rizzo had been instrumental in building.</p>
