          <p>A tragic coach crash in Somerset, involving pupils from Minehead Middle School returning from a zoo trip, has left four people in the hospital. The incident, which occurred when the coach slid down a 20-foot slope, resulted in the death of a 10-year-old boy. Police are continuing their investigation into the cause of the crash on Cutcombe Hill. In response to the tragedy, the local community has raised over £40,000 to support those affected, demonstrating a strong outpouring of support.</p>

          <p>Families of Israeli hostages held by Hamas are increasingly voicing their mistrust in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to secure a release deal. Protesters in Jerusalem highlight the prolonged captivity, now over 650 days, and express frustration over the negotiation process, with some placing more faith in the US administration to broker an agreement. The death of hostage Carmel Gat, who was killed in captivity after a previous truce collapsed, underscores the immense risks faced by those still held. Family members feel the government is prioritizing political goals over the lives of the hostages.</p>

          <p>Famed New York restaurateur Keith McNally opens up about his life in his new memoir, "I Regret Almost Everything," detailing his difficult recovery from a 2016 stroke that led to a suicide attempt. He discusses overcoming his embarrassment about his condition by using social media, which also led to public controversies, such as his criticism of James Corden. McNally reflects on his working-class London upbringing and his journey to becoming a celebrated figure in the NYC restaurant scene. He now emphasizes the importance of kindness, something he came to appreciate more from his staff post-stroke.</p>

          <p>England and Gotham FC defender Jess Carter has announced she is taking a step back from social media due to experiencing "a lot of racial abuse" during the Euro 2025 tournament. In a statement, Carter asserted that while fans can have opinions on performance, targeting someone's race or appearance is unacceptable. The Football Association is working with police to address the hate crime. In a related move, the Lionesses will no longer take a knee before matches, stating a need to find new ways to combat racism in football.</p>

Despite the public pressure, WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert expressed optimism that a "transformational" deal could be reached before the current CBA expires on October 31.

          <p>The concept of a fixed personality is being challenged by new scientific research, as detailed by writer Olga Khazan in her book "Me, But Better." After struggling with anxiety and neuroticism, Khazan embarked on a year-long journey to consciously alter her personality by forcing herself into uncomfortable situations, such as taking an improv class. University of Kentucky professor Shannon Sauer-Zavala supports this, explaining that intentional changes in thinking and behavior, maintained over time, can shift ingrained traits. This approach suggests that people can actively work to develop the personality they desire.</p>

The lawsuit, brought by a news outlet and a research group, sets a major precedent for the transparency of police foundations nationwide. The released records reveal the APF actively lobbied city officials to prevent a public referendum on the project, warning it would derail financing and damage the city council's credibility. This outcome is seen as a significant victory for public accountability.</p>

          <h2>Critics Warn Trump's Pro-Fossil Fuel Agenda Is Reversing Decades of Environmental Progress</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration's aggressive push for oil, gas, and coal is being criticized by scientists and watchdogs for setting back environmental progress by decades. In his first six months, the president has used a declared national energy emergency to justify expanding fossil fuel production while slashing green energy initiatives, such as gutting tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act. These actions have occurred alongside climate-related disasters and proposed budget cuts to key climate research agencies like NOAA. Critics argue the policies are unscientific, benefit fossil fuel industry donors, and pose long-term dangers to public health and the environment.</p>

          <p>Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common and difficult-to-treat hormonal disorder, are finding symptom relief from GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy. Patients report improvements in issues like irregular periods, hair loss, and weight management, which are often linked to the insulin resistance common in PCOS. While the drugs are not officially approved for this use, small studies and anecdotal evidence suggest they can be highly effective by improving insulin sensitivity and promoting weight loss, which in turn helps regulate hormones. However, the high cost and lack of insurance coverage remain significant barriers for many patients.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the Trump administration's "Restoring Gold Standard Science" executive order is a thinly veiled attempt to undermine the role of science in policymaking. The author claims that by giving political appointees the power to define scientific integrity, the administration can cast doubt on inconvenient evidence and demand unattainable levels of certainty, echoing tactics used by the tobacco industry. This "doubt science" strategy allows officials to block or delay regulations, such as those for harmful PFAS chemicals, by manipulating the scientific record to fit policy goals rather than being guided by the best available evidence.</p>

          <p>Israel's military has ordered the immediate evacuation of parts of Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, an area previously spared from a ground offensive. The order has caused widespread panic among the tens of thousands of residents and displaced Palestinians sheltering there, as it could signal an imminent attack. The targeted neighborhoods are crowded with tent camps, and families of Israeli hostages also fear for their relatives believed to be held in the city. The new directive comes as health officials report dozens more killed at aid distribution points, adding to the severe humanitarian crisis across the Strip.</p>

          <p>A tsunami threat for Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has been canceled following a series of five strong earthquakes that struck in the nearby sea. The largest quake registered a magnitude of 7.4 at a shallow depth, prompting initial warnings for the Russian coast and a tsunami watch for Hawaii, which was also later lifted. The quakes were centered east of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, a city with a population of 180,000. Despite the power of the tremors and the initial danger, there have been no immediate reports of casualties or significant damage from the seismic activity.</p>

The brothers planned a secretive adventure into the unexplored regions of China with the ambitious goal of finding a giant panda. At the time, the black-and-white bear was a legendary creature, so rare that many doubted its existence, and it was the only large mammal yet to be acquired for a museum collection. The passage captures the spirit of an era of discovery, where parts of the world remained unmapped.</p>

          <p>Vibrio bacteria, which thrive in warm, low-salinity coastal waters like the Baltic and North Seas, are posing an increased health risk due to climate change. Rising sea surface temperatures are creating more favorable conditions for these bacteria, which can cause a serious infection called vibriosis through swimming with open wounds or consuming raw shellfish. While infections are still relatively rare, severe cases can lead to life-threatening illness or limb amputation. Health officials advise avoiding swimming in these waters with cuts and to thoroughly cook shellfish to mitigate the growing threat.</p>

          <p>Contrary to recent conservative criticism, Superman's origins are deeply rooted in leftist and immigrant experiences, according to comic book author Grant Morrison. Created by the sons of Jewish immigrants, the character's first appearances in the 1930s portrayed him as a "socialist figure" who fought corrupt bosses and tore down slums to force the construction of better housing. This analysis traces Superman's evolution from this activist beginning to a patriotic figure in the 1940s and a suburban father-figure in the 1950s. The character's enduring power lies in his ability to be a timeless metaphor for humanity's best qualities.</p>
