          <p>McDonald's exceeded Wall Street's second-quarter earnings and revenue expectations, driven by a rebound in U.S. sales from promotional activities like a "Minecraft" movie tie-in. Despite this success, executives expressed caution regarding the economic health of low-income consumers, who are a crucial part of their customer base. The company is exploring more affordable menu options to re-engage this demographic and anticipates stronger performance in the latter half of the year. This article highlights the dual reality of corporate success against a backdrop of consumer economic strain.</p>

          <p>Shopify's stock price increased by 20% after the company reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analysts' predictions. The Canadian e-commerce firm also provided a positive outlook for the third quarter, projecting revenue growth in the mid-to-high twenties percentage range. Executives noted that the feared negative impact from U.S. trade tariffs did not occur, and the company has seen accelerating U.S. demand. The strong performance is also attributed to investments in artificial intelligence tools designed to attract and support merchants on its platform. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jewelry retailer Claire's has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. for the second time in seven years, citing debts between $1 billion and $10 billion. The company attributes its struggles to a slowdown in consumer spending, the shift to online shopping, and increased competition. This move follows similar actions by its Canadian and French arms, reflecting broader challenges for mall-based retailers. While U.S. and Canadian stores will remain open for now, the future of its UK operations is also under review, potentially leading to widespread closures.</p>

          <p>The Democratic party is actively recruiting high-profile candidates in an effort to regain a majority in the Senate during the 2026 midterm elections. A significant development is the entry of former North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper into the race for a retiring Republican's seat, a move seen as a major boost for the party. Democrats are also courting former Senator Sherrod Brown for a run in Ohio and are navigating competitive primary races in states like Michigan. The strategy focuses on key battleground states such as Georgia and even traditionally Republican states like Texas, where they hope to capitalize on divisive GOP primaries.</p>

          <p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif have agreed to enhance bilateral relations, aiming to increase trade to $10 billion and bolster security cooperation. Both nations face challenges from militant groups operating near their shared border and are pursuing joint patrols and intelligence sharing. The partnership comes as Pakistan also deepens its ties with the United States, creating a complex diplomatic situation. Analysts suggest that while Iran is wary of U.S. influence, Pakistan has historically avoided direct military alignment against Tehran and may act as a mediator between Iran and Washington.</p>

          <p>Ernesto Vásquez Reyna, a top federal official in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, was assassinated in broad daylight in the border city of Reynosa. Investigators believe the killing was retaliation by organized crime groups following a major seizure of stolen fuel in July. The attack, which involved multiple vehicles, highlights the escalating violence in Reynosa, a city controlled by a faction of the Gulf Cartel. Such cartels have diversified their illegal activities to include fuel theft, contributing to ongoing instability and conflict in the region near the U.S. border.</p>

          <p>The BBC has released a new season of MasterChef that was filmed before its hosts, Gregg Wallace and John Torode, were fired following a misconduct investigation. The decision to air the series has drawn backlash, although the BBC stated it was the right choice for the contestants involved. The new episodes appear to be edited to minimize banter and jokes from the hosts, creating a different tone from previous seasons. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy and others have expressed their disapproval, with some arguing the series should have been refilmed or canceled out of respect for those who filed complaints.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has characterized multi-billion dollar investment pledges from trade partners like Japan and the European Union as personal "gifts" and "signing bonuses" for the U.S. However, leaders from these partner nations describe the commitments in more aspirational and less binding terms. For example, the EU notes an "interest" from private companies to invest, which the European Commission cannot enforce. This discrepancy highlights a fundamental disconnect in how the Trump administration and its partners view these trade agreements, raising questions about the enforceability of the promised investments.</p>

The article notes an inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs presently offer higher interest rates than long-term ones, a trend that has persisted since late 2022.

          <p>Despite releasing a plan for U.S. dominance in artificial intelligence, the Trump administration has made several policy reversals that critics argue cede ground to China. The administration lifted a ban on exporting Nvidia's H20 AI chips to China, a move championed by tech billionaire David Sacks and Nvidia's CEO, which experts warn will close a critical computing power gap for Beijing. Additionally, deals to build advanced AI data centers in the UAE and Saudi Arabia are seen as placing vital U.S. assets in a volatile region. These actions are viewed by many national security experts as strategic missteps that endanger America's technological edge.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, led by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., announced it is terminating 22 federal contracts for mRNA-based vaccine research, valued at nearly $500 million. Kennedy stated the decision was based on a review questioning the technology's effectiveness against upper respiratory infections, though critics argue this move promotes pseudoscience and weakens national biosecurity. The move includes canceling a contract with Moderna for a late-stage bird flu vaccine and proposals from other major pharmaceutical companies. This policy shift occurs amid rising COVID-19 cases and concerns from public health experts.</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), a world-leading chipmaker, is facing dual pressures from an internal security breach and demands from the U.S. government. Taiwanese prosecutors are investigating three employees for allegedly leaking sensitive company files, raising concerns about corporate espionage. Simultaneously, the company is navigating pressure from the Trump administration, including a claim that TSMC would invest $300 billion in the U.S. in exchange for favorable tariff conditions. These events have intensified worries about the vulnerability of Taiwan's most critical company and its position in the global tech rivalry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A downbeat economic forecast from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr) suggests the UK is facing a budget gap of £40-50 billion, significantly larger than previous estimates. This analysis increases pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves to consider substantial tax rises or spending cuts in the upcoming autumn budget. Niesr recommends establishing a larger buffer to meet borrowing rules and avoid continuous policy changes that create economic uncertainty. With spending largely fixed, the government may need to explore changes to VAT, pensions, and income tax thresholds to bridge the fiscal gap. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite recent news of redundancies and cost-cutting measures, Manchester United appears able to finance a potential £74 million deal for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko. Football finance experts explain that the club is using clever financing, such as spreading payments for new signings over the length of their contracts. The club has also benefited financially from loaning out Marcus Rashford, receiving a payment from Chelsea's abandoned pursuit of Jadon Sancho, and from sell-on clauses for former players. While not in as strong a financial position as some rivals, the club's commercial power remains a significant asset.</p>

          <p>The EPA's Energy Star program, known for its energy-efficiency labels, is reportedly at risk of being eliminated under proposed budget cuts by the Trump administration. This move could have significant consequences for the commercial real estate industry, which relies heavily on the program's Portfolio Manager software. This tool is the fundamental infrastructure for tracking energy use, connecting utilities with landlords and helping them comply with state and local climate policies. Industry groups are concerned that losing this federally-managed platform would disrupt data sharing, increase compliance costs, and hinder efforts to improve building efficiency.</p>

          <p>A Dutch foundation has launched a multi-billion euro lawsuit against FIFA and several national football associations, which could fundamentally alter the sport's player transfer system. The claim, representing potentially 100,000 players, argues that current transfer rules unlawfully restrict the free movement of labor within the EU. The lawsuit follows a European Court of Justice ruling that found FIFA's regulations impede players' freedom. If successful, the case could shift power further towards players, potentially leading to reduced transfer fees, higher wages, and a system more aligned with standard employment law.</p>

The combined entity will have assets exceeding 400 billion yuan and will focus on high-end vessels while phasing out less efficient operations.

          <p>In a personal reflection, former Labor Secretary Robert Reich connects the rise of political figures like Donald Trump to decades of widening economic inequality that has left many Americans feeling abandoned. He argues that since the late 1970s, the basic bargain of hard work leading to a better life has eroded, with wealth being siphoned to the top. Reich criticizes both Republican policies favoring the wealthy and the Democratic party's historical shift away from the working class. Despite his disappointment and the current political crises, he expresses a dogged hope for America's long-term future.</p>
