          <h2>Trade Bullying Requires Strength, Not Appeasement, Opinion Piece Argues</h2>

          <p>An opinion piece asserts that the US administration's tariffs are harming the global economy and undermining efforts to reduce poverty, particularly in developing nations. The author contends that while the US claims to be disadvantaged by trade deficits, it actually benefits significantly from globalization. They argue that China and the US gain roughly equally from their trade relationship when all aspects, including services and local sales, are considered. The piece advocates for a firm stance against what it describes as trade bullying, asserting that appeasement is not an option. The context of the piece is the rising tensions in international trade and the potential for a global recession.</p>

          <p>Ben Houchen, the Tory mayor of Tees Valley, has suggested that the Conservative Party may need to form a coalition with Reform UK to prevent Labour from gaining power in the next general election. This statement contradicts the official stance of Tory leader Kemi Badenoch, who has ruled out any coalition with Nigel Farage's party at a national level. Houchen emphasized the importance of keeping Labour out of government and acknowledged the challenge posed by Reform UK, which is drawing support away from the Tories. The article also notes that Reform UK has stated they have "no intention of forming coalitions or pacts with the Tories", saying they "broke Britain".</p>

          <p>A recent fatal plane crash at Reagan National Airport is attributed to the misuse of a common aviation practice called "visual separation." The article details how a Black Hawk helicopter crew requested and received permission to navigate around other aircraft visually, rather than relying on air traffic control. Aviation experts have warned about the deadly risks associated with mishandling visual separation, which allows pilots to take control of navigating around other aircraft, rather than relying on the controller for guidance. The article highlights the potential dangers of this practice when not executed correctly, emphasizing that while routine, it can lead to deadly consequences if mishandled.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's recent remarks regarding the war in Ukraine have offered a glimmer of hope to Ukrainians. After meeting with President Zelensky, Trump questioned why Putin would continue the conflict while the US is trying to broker peace. Ukrainians view this as a potential sign that Trump may not force them into a disadvantageous peace plan. This comes at a critical time in the war, as the US has been pushing Ukraine to accept a deal that would require them to abandon NATO aspirations and recognize Crimea as Russian.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's ongoing conflict with the US media, particularly his lawsuit against '60 Minutes' over an interview with Kamala Harris, has ignited a debate about press freedoms and the influence of corporate interests on journalism. The executive producer of '60 Minutes' resigned due to pressure from the parent company, Paramount, which is seeking to settle the lawsuit to facilitate a sale to Skydance. Critics argue that this capitulation to Trump's demands undermines the independence of the media and threatens the democratic system. The lawsuit stems from allegations of election interference related to the editing of Harris's remarks on Israel and Gaza.</p>

          <p>Sidney Blumenthal argues that Donald Trump's actions, particularly his declaration of war against the Department of Justice and his executive orders, reveal a governing philosophy centered on the ruthless pursuit of absolute power.

The author draws parallels between Trump's approach and the authoritarian logic of Carl Schmitt, a legal scholar of the Nazi regime.

          <h2>Archaeological Dig Validates Griots' Songs About Vanished Kingdom</h2>

          <p>An archaeological dig in Guinea-Bissau has uncovered physical evidence of the kingdom of Kaabu, a realm known primarily through the oral traditions and songs of griots. The kingdom, which existed from the 1500s through the 1800s, was never visited by Europeans. The excavation of its capital city, Kansala, has confirmed details passed down through generations by griots, who serve as storytellers and historians in West African culture. The discovery is significant for allowing Africans to tell their own story and for validating the role of griots as historians.</p>

          <p>Museums are increasingly partnering with major commercial art galleries for logistical and financial support for their exhibitions. This trend raises questions about the influence of commercial interests on curatorial decisions and the selection of artists to be showcased. A recent analysis examined over 350 solo exhibitions by contemporary artists in New York's biggest art museums over the last six years to assess the extent of these partnerships.</p>

          <p>The article explores the distinct aesthetic associated with Donald Trump and his supporters, arguing that it reflects the political philosophy and policy goals of his administration. This "MAGA glam" is characterized by starkly gendered looks, extreme plastic surgery, and a connection between extreme appearances and extreme policies. The aesthetic functions as a distraction, obscuring the realities of Trump's policies behind a shiny, artificial facade. The author suggests that this over-the-top style is reminiscent of reality TV, relying on tools of distraction to divert attention from substantive issues.</p>

          <p>The Green Party is calling for the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) to withdraw its interim guidance on single-sex spaces, deeming it "ill-considered and impractical." The guidance, issued after a UK Supreme Court ruling, states that transgender women should not be permitted to use women's facilities in places like hospitals and shops. Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer argues the guidance puts trans people at risk of discrimination and is not well-thought-out. The Liberal Democrats have also raised concerns about the guidance's enforcement.</p>

          <p>Jordyn Jensen argues that the United States is witnessing a return to psychiatric imprisonment, with policies that expand the state's power to detain and "treat" marginalized people. From Governor Kathy Hochul's proposal to expand involuntary commitment in New York to Robert F Kennedy Jr's "wellness farms," policymakers are reviving the logics of confinement under the guise of care. These efforts undermine autonomy, reinforce carceral control, and divert attention from the root causes of distress, such as poverty and systemic racism. The author calls for a shift towards community-based solutions and collective care.</p>

          <p>China has strengthened its oversight of rural government workers by revising anti-corruption supervision rules for grass-roots officials.
