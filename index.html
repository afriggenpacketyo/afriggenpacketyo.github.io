          <p>Two Israeli Embassy employees were fatally shot outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. The suspect, Elias Rodriguez, was apprehended after entering the museum following the shooting. Police Chief Pamela A. Smith reported that Rodriguez chanted "free, free Palestine" while in custody and also identified the location where he discarded the weapon. Ambassador Yechiel Leiter identified the victims as a young couple about to be engaged, with the young man having purchased a ring earlier in the week. President Trump condemned the killings as antisemitic, and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser vowed not to tolerate antisemitism in the city. </p>

          <p>The Archdiocese of New Orleans has agreed to a settlement of nearly $180 million to compensate over 500 victims of clergy sexual assault. The agreement, which requires approval from survivors, the bankruptcy court, and other creditors, aims to settle a lawsuit filed in 2020. The settlement also includes provisions for safeguarding against future abuse and providing services to survivors, such as a survivors' bill of rights. However, some survivors and their attorneys have criticized the deal as inadequate, viewing it as an attempt to prevent claims from going to state court. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite showing little interest in peace negotiations with Ukraine, Russia's war-focused economy is facing increasing economic and military pressures. These pressures, including dwindling military equipment stockpiles, recruitment challenges, and sanctions on oil exports, could eventually force Moscow to the negotiating table. A slowdown in Russia's GDP growth, coupled with high inflation and production costs, is raising concerns about the sustainability of its war efforts. Tighter sanctions on Russia's shadow fleet and declining oil prices are exacerbating the economic strain, potentially leading to a budget deficit. </p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese electric-vehicle maker Xpeng have experienced a significant rally, gaining nearly 80% this year, fueled by strong sales and expectations of profitability. The company's first-quarter revenue more than doubled, driven by robust vehicle deliveries, which in turn narrowed its net loss and improved its gross margin. Analysts predict that Xpeng will achieve profitability in the fourth quarter of this year, attributing this to its strong sales momentum and pipeline of new models. UOB Kay Hian maintains a buy rating on the stock, projecting a substantial upside from its current price. </p>

          <p>The New York Knicks suffered a painful defeat in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Indiana Pacers, squandering a substantial double-digit lead in the fourth quarter. The Pacers mounted a comeback, fueled by Aaron Nesmith's six consecutive three-pointers and Tyrese Haliburton's clutch performance, ultimately forcing overtime. Despite a strong performance from Jalen Brunson, the Knicks were unable to secure the victory, losing 138-135. The series is a rematch of last year's second round, adding to the intensity of the rivalry. </p>

          <p>Martin Kettle argues that the UK is increasingly divided economically and politically, posing a significant challenge for Keir Starmer's government. Public confidence in the government is at record lows, and centrifugal forces are fragmenting the country. Starmer's attempt to address these divisions through the Council of the Nations and Regions faces challenges due to differing powers among the devolved governments and the risk of becoming merely a talking shop. Collaboration between governments and mayors is crucial for achieving priorities, but the collaborative political impulse is not widespread. </p>

          <p>A landmark review in the UK proposes allowing violent prisoners, including those convicted of sexual assault and domestic abuse, to be released after serving just a third of their sentence for good behavior. The Independent Sentencing Review also suggests managing more offenders in the community to ease prison overcrowding. Former Lord Chancellor David Gauke, who chaired the review, emphasized the need for major reforms to address the crisis and reduce reoffending rates.

          <p>Richard Poplak discusses how the myth of white genocide in South Africa, promoted by lobbyists like Ernst Roets, has gained traction within the MAGA movement and the Trump administration. Despite lacking evidence, these claims portray white Afrikaners as victims of reverse racism and targeted violence. This narrative coincides with the rise of Mr. Trump and has influenced U.S. policy, including offering refugee status to Afrikaners. The author argues that this is an attempt to flip the narrative of apartheid and cast former oppressors as victims, ultimately spreading the global white replacement conspiracy theory. </p>

          <p>The Senate is poised to vote on revoking three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a move Democrats are calling "the nuclear option." These waivers allow California to set stricter emissions standards than federal regulations, including phasing out gas-powered cars by 2035. Republicans argue they have the authority to overturn the waivers, while Democrats contend the vote is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. The California Air Resources Board claims the state has never had a waiver revoked and will sue the federal government if this occurs. </p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has strongly criticized officials following a "serious accident" during the launch ceremony for a new destroyer. The 5,000-ton destroyer lost balance and was damaged, which Kim Jong Un described as an intolerable "criminal act" caused by carelessness. He warned that those responsible would be held accountable at a plenary meeting of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea and ordered the ship's restoration. The South Korean military reported that the destroyer remains partially capsized. </p>

          <p>The Republican-controlled House of Representatives is poised to vote on President Donald Trump's massive tax and spending bill, following intra-party divisions over spending cuts. The bill cleared a procedural hurdle after the House Rules Committee approved the measure. The bill would extend Trumpâ€™s 2017 tax cuts, create new breaks, end green-energy subsidies, and boost military and immigration spending. These changes would be funded by tightening eligibility for food and health programs. </p>

          <p>President Trump's trade tactics have complicated India's trade negotiations with the United States, particularly concerning Apple's manufacturing. Despite India's efforts to attract Apple's production away from China, Trump has suggested Apple should move production to the United States instead. This demand is a setback for India, which has been positioning itself as a viable alternative to China for American companies. Indian officials are working to secure a reduction in tariffs but face uncertainty in the talks. </p>
