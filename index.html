        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Police in Kathmandu, Nepal, opened fire on demonstrators protesting a government ban on major social media platforms, resulting in at least 14 deaths and numerous injuries. The protests erupted after authorities blocked platforms like Facebook and X for failing to register for government oversight, a move critics decry as censorship. Tens of thousands of protesters, primarily from "Gen Z," had surrounded the Parliament building, leading to violent confrontations with riot police. The government has since imposed a curfew in key areas of the capital as tensions remain high.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has warned that the government could be forced to issue massive refunds, potentially up to one trillion dollars, if the Supreme Court rules against President Trump's tariff plan. The administration is seeking an expedited ruling from the court to overturn an appellate decision that found most of the tariffs illegal. While expressing confidence in a favorable outcome, Bessent acknowledged the significant financial disruption a negative ruling would cause for the Treasury. Officials are also reportedly preparing alternative plans to implement tariffs through other legal authorities if the current ones are struck down. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. housing market remains in a prolonged slump, with a shortage of affordable homes and high mortgage rates pricing many potential buyers out of the market. This shift has given home shoppers more leverage, forcing many sellers, particularly in the South and West, to lower their asking prices and offer concessions. While national median home prices have risen slightly, several metro areas are seeing declines as inventory increases due to new construction and longer listing times. Despite this trend, overall sales of previously owned homes are still below last year's low levels, indicating a tough environment for both buyers and sellers. (not investment advice)</p>

Many younger, healthy Americans fear they will be unable to get vaccinated, putting their vulnerable and elderly loved ones at risk during an anticipated surge. The new policy has created confusion and accessibility issues, forcing individuals to navigate insurance hurdles or consider paying out-of-pocket.

          <p>In a detailed interview, Palestinian organizer and Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil recounts his arrest by immigration agents and subsequent 100-day detention in a Louisiana facility. Khalil was targeted for his political views and pro-Palestinian activism, with the Trump administration seeking his deportation on foreign policy grounds. He describes the experience as a politically motivated act of cruelty, reminiscent of authoritarian tactics, especially as it caused him to miss the birth of his son. Now released on bail but still facing legal challenges, Khalil remains resolute in his advocacy for Palestinian liberation, viewing his personal struggle as part of a broader global issue.</p>

          <p>A new report highlights the growing integration between China's civilian technology companies and its defense sector, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence, which could pose significant challenges to the United States. The analysis points to examples like drone makers selling combat systems to the military and universities improving drone coordination for targeting. This blurring of lines between commercial and military development may create a more agile Chinese defense industrial base. The report suggests this trend will force U.S. policymakers to navigate difficult trade-offs between maintaining economic openness and safeguarding national security.</p>

          <p>The cultural influence of the American South is expanding nationwide, evident in trends like northern students flocking to southern universities and the mainstream rise of southern music genres. This cultural shift is rooted in decades of political, logistical, and technological changes, including the civil rights movement, the development of the highway system, and the widespread adoption of air conditioning. These factors facilitated economic growth and population increases, attracting businesses with incentives like union-unfriendly policies. This migration and economic integration have propelled southern aesthetics, from hip-hop to country music, into the national spotlight, reshaping the American cultural landscape.</p>

          <p>Rick Davies, the co-founder and distinctive lead vocalist of the British rock band Supertramp, has died at the age of 81 after a long battle with multiple myeloma. Davies, along with Roger Hodgson, wrote some of the band's most iconic hits, including "Goodbye Stranger" and "The Logical Song." His soulful vocals and signature Wurlitzer piano sound were central to the band's success, particularly on their 1979 album "Breakfast in America," which sold over 18 million copies. After Hodgson's departure, Davies continued to lead versions of Supertramp, with the group performing for the last time in 2012.</p>

          <p>President Trump's sweeping tariffs, intended to revive U.S. manufacturing, are facing significant hurdles and skepticism from businesses, as highlighted by a report from Fall River, Massachusetts. Many manufacturers report that the tariffs have increased their costs for imported materials, hurting profits and forcing them to cut other investments without providing a competitive benefit. While some businesses have seen an uptick in domestic inquiries, challenges like hiring difficulties and uncertainty about long-term demand prevent them from expanding. This on-the-ground reality contrasts with administration claims, as national manufacturing payrolls have recently shrunk, indicating a difficult path for the promised revival.

          <p>An opinion article argues that President Trump's executive order renaming the Department of Defense back to its original name, the Department of War, is a truthful reflection of his administration's aggressive foreign and domestic policies. The author contends that despite its name, the department has historically functioned as an instrument of war, with the U.S. engaging in numerous undeclared conflicts and military interventions. The piece critiques Trump's actions, from airstrikes in Syria and Yemen to the militarization of the "war on drugs," as evidence of a presidency that relishes conflict. This rebranding is presented as a move that celebrates aggression and positions the president as a warrior king.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals a growing divide in union membership across the United States, with states that protect collective bargaining rights seeing an increase in members while "right-to-work" states experience declines. In 2024, states with collective bargaining protections added nearly 10,000 union members, whereas right-to-work states lost 200,000. This divergence highlights the impact of state-level labor laws on union density, which is nearly three times higher in pro-union states. The report also correlates union membership with higher wages, better benefits, and a reduced reliance on government assistance programs for workers.</p>

          <p>A former French anesthetist, Frédéric Péchier, is on trial accused of poisoning 30 patients at two clinics in Besançon between 2008 and 2017, resulting in 12 deaths. Prosecutors allege that Péchier, 53, intentionally tampered with intravenous medicine bags to induce cardiac arrests in otherwise healthy patients, possibly as a way to demonstrate his skills or settle scores with colleagues. The investigation began after a healthy patient suffered an unexplained cardiac arrest and was found to have a potassium dose 100 times the expected level. Péchier maintains his innocence, claiming he is being framed, in a trial expected to last over three months.</p>

The National Development and Reform Commission aims to develop at least five industry-specific AI models for power grids, coal, oil, and gas by 2027. The strategy involves creating AI innovation platforms, training specialists, and identifying over 100 potential application scenarios to drive technological breakthroughs. This initiative is part of Beijing's broader effort to integrate cutting-edge technology into critical industries and establish a unique innovation model tailored to its national conditions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite widespread discussion about artificial intelligence transforming the workforce, economists suggest its overall impact on the labor market has been relatively small so far. Recent job market weakness is attributed more to general economic uncertainty than to AI-driven layoffs, which have been largely concentrated within the tech industry itself. An analysis shows that early-career workers in AI-exposed fields have seen some employment decline, but more experienced workers have not. Experts advise that for AI to be considered a broad threat, its impact would need to extend significantly into other major sectors like retail and marketing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As President Trump advocates for deploying federal troops to combat crime in U.S. cities, leaders in places like Baltimore argue for a different approach focused on community-based violence intervention. Mayor Brandon Scott points to Baltimore's declining murder rate as evidence that targeted rehabilitation and enforcement are more effective than the mass-arrest tactics of the past. The Trump administration recently defunded several of these community initiatives, favoring a show of force. This article contrasts Trump's strategy with the desires of local officials, who seek federal support for proven programs rather than military-style occupations they believe could be counterproductive.</p>

          <p>President Trump's affinity for ostentatious, gold-laden aesthetics, visible in his White House renovations, is more than personal taste; it's part of a broader effort to rebrand America in his image. This analysis argues that Trump's style, rooted in the lavishness of 1980s New York, aims to intertwine his personal brand with the state, making him an enduring symbol of the nation. This cultural project is seen as having sinister motives, promoting a nostalgic vision of a whiter America while challenging modern norms through policies targeting immigration, free speech, and gender identity. The ultimate goal is to achieve omnipresence and redefine what it means to be American.</p>

          <p>The French government, led by Prime Minister Francois Bayrou, is facing a critical confidence vote in the National Assembly that it is widely expected to lose. The vote was triggered by Bayrou's proposed €44 billion in public spending cuts to address the country's rising debt and deficit, a plan that united opposition from both the far-right and far-left. A government collapse would deepen France's political instability, which began after President Emmanuel Macron's party lost its parliamentary majority.
