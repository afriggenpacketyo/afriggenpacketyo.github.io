          <p>Cracker Barrel's stock plummeted, losing nearly $100 million in market value, after the company unveiled a new, simpler logo. The redesign removes the iconic overall-clad man, aiming for a more modern image as part of CEO Julie Felss Masino's strategy to refresh the brand. While the company insists its values remain unchanged, the move drew criticism from conservative commentators and marketing experts, with some calling it "woke" or a "fiasco" for alienating long-time fans. This financial dip highlights investor and public sensitivity to brand identity changes. (not investment advice)</p>

The report claimed the test, conducted Saturday, demonstrated the "superior combat capability" of the improved missile systems, suitable for destroying various aerial targets. This missile test occurs amidst heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula, following South Korean warning shots at North Korean troops and ongoing joint US-South Korea military exercises, which Kim has criticized as "hostile."</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-23 22:14:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to reform its asylum appeals system by establishing a new independent body with adjudicators to expedite case hearings. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper aims to address "unacceptable delays" in appeals, which currently average over a year with 51,000 pending cases, costing taxpayers for accommodation. This move comes amid public and political pressure to reduce reliance on asylum hotels, with the government committed to closing them in a "properly managed way" despite recent legal challenges against hotel use. An asylum seeker in Epping was charged with sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl, leading to protests and a temporary injunction against housing asylum seekers in a local hotel.</p>

          <p>Britain’s Foreign Secretary David Lammy received a written warning from the UK Environment Agency for fishing without a license during a trip with US Vice President JD Vance. The incident occurred at Lammy's country estate, where the two politicians also held bilateral talks. Lammy belatedly purchased a license and reported himself, calling it an "administrative error." The agency requires anyone over 13 to have a freshwater fishing license, with potential fines of nearly $4,000 for non-compliance.</p>

While some view it as patriotism, others express unease, fearing association with far-right movements and potential division.

          <p>The US immigrant population has decreased by over a million people since Donald Trump took office in January, marking a reversal of a 50-year growth trend, according to a Pew Research Center study. The decline, from 53.3 million to 51.9 million by June, is attributed to Trump's 181 executive actions targeting immigration, including mass deportations and restrictions on asylum. The study also noted 750,000 immigrant workers left the labor force. This significant shift reflects intensified enforcement and a changed policy landscape.</p>

          <p>At the closed Marineland Antibes zoo in France, a male orca, Keijo, is being sexually stimulated by trainers to prevent inbreeding with his mother, Wikie. This unusual practice arises from a stalemate between managers, the French government, and activists over rehoming the orcas before a December law bans marine zoo shows. Activists, who captured footage, question the necessity and timing, especially given Keijo's inbred status and the recent death of Japan's only male orca. Marineland denies any intent to sell semen, asserting the stimulation is natural and for the animal's wellbeing.</p>

          <p>The Democratic governors of Rhode Island and Connecticut are vowing to fight a Trump administration order that halted work on the nearly complete Revolution Wind farm. The US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issued a stop-work order, citing unspecified "national security interests" and a review prompted by President Trump's directive to reconsider existing wind energy leases. Critics, including Senator Chris Murphy, link the decision to alleged political favors for the oil industry, calling it "corruption." The project, crucial for the states' climate goals, was 80% complete and expected to power over 350,000 homes.</p>

These reconstructions, based on 3D scans and anatomical principles, aim to understand the ancestry of the region's early inhabitants, revealing features of Ancient Ancestral South Indians with traces of Middle-East Eurasian and Austro-Asiatic ancestries. The findings support the existence of an ancient independent urban civilization in southern India, adding complexity to the subcontinent's historical narrative.</p>

Lyle's hearing was disrupted by the unexpected public release of an audio recording from Erik's Thursday hearing, which prison officials inadvertently provided in response to a public records request. This caused anger among relatives and the brothers' attorney, who argued it compromised the fairness of the proceedings and violated privacy.
