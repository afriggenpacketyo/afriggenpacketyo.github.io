          <p>Donald Trump hosted a black-tie gala for top buyers of his meme coin, where attendees spent a combined $148 million for the chance to attend. Despite the opulent setting with Richard Mille watches galore, some attendees were underwhelmed, citing disappointing food and a brief appearance by Trump who rehashed old crypto talking points. Security was reportedly lax, with phones not locked away and guests checking coin prices during dinner. The article highlights the contrast between the lavish event and the muted enthusiasm among some attendees, some of whom no longer held the coin.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled upcoming concerts due to being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain disorder affecting hearing, vision, and balance. NPH involves excess cerebrospinal fluid accumulation in the brain, leading to walking difficulties, bladder control issues, and memory problems. The article notes that the condition is often underdiagnosed and becomes more prevalent with age, with symptoms easily mistaken for normal aging effects. Treatment typically involves surgery to implant a shunt, but physical therapy can also help manage gait stability; early diagnosis is crucial for better outcomes.</p>
