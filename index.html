          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, facing criticism from Sen. Chris Van Hollen regarding deportations and relations with El Salvador. Van Hollen accused Rubio of being too friendly with El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele and criticized the administration's handling of the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. Rubio defended the administration's actions, asserting the deportation of gang members and accusing Van Hollen of meeting with a human trafficker. The exchange grew heated, with accusations of unsubstantiated comments and comparisons to McCarthy-era tactics. The hearing underscored the deep divisions over immigration and foreign policy within the Senate. </p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has outlined stricter regulatory guidance for future COVID-19 vaccine boosters, requiring new clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness for healthy adults and children.

The FDA will accept immunogenicity data for high-risk individuals, such as those 65 and older or with underlying health conditions.

          <p>President Donald Trump visited Capitol Hill to rally House Republicans behind his "big, beautiful" tax bill, but faces resistance over changes to healthcare and tax deductions. The bill, which includes $4.9 trillion in tax breaks, has caused divisions within the party, particularly over state and local tax deductions (Salt). Some Republicans from high-tax states are pushing for a higher cap on Salt deductions, while conservative hardliners seek deeper budget cuts. Despite Trump's optimistic portrayal of unity, some members remain opposed, threatening the bill's passage before it reaches the Senate. </p>

          <p>Home electricity bills are projected to reach an average of $784 this summer, marking a 12-year high due to rising temperatures and electricity prices. The National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA) attributes the increase to the cost of electricity outpacing inflation, leading to higher cooling costs. Low-income families, who already spend a larger share of their income on energy, may struggle to afford air conditioning, posing health risks. Modernizing homes with insulation can help save money, but public assistance programs need to be updated to address longer heat waves. </p>

          <p>Several newspapers, including the Chicago Sun-Times, published a syndicated summer book list that included fictional books by famous authors, raising concerns about the use of AI in media. Writer Marco Buscaglia claimed responsibility, stating that the list was partly generated by AI and that he betrayed the trust of the Sun-Times. Readers and authors expressed outrage, lamenting the decline of trained professionals in favor of inaccurate AI-generated content. The incident highlights broader issues of media accuracy and the impact of defunding libraries and book review programs. </p>

          <h2>New Classification System Proposed for Traumatic Brain Injuries</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 15:05:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of neurology experts is proposing a new method of evaluating patients with traumatic brain injuries to improve assessments and treatment. The new system, published in Lancet Neurology, builds upon the Glasgow Coma Scale but incorporates additional factors such as blood biomarkers, scans, and the patient's social environment. The aim is to move beyond simplistic categories like "mild, moderate, severe" and provide more accurate prognoses and research data. The hope is that this will lead to better drug treatments and procedures for patients with traumatic brain injuries. </p>

          <p>John Mulaney's Netflix talk show, "Everybody's Live With John Mulaney," is evolving into a more refined and punchy program after a somewhat experimental start. The show initially aimed to break away from traditional talk show conventions, but has found greater success by incorporating more topical humor and tightening its structure. Mulaney's opening monologues and the show's overall taste and ambition remain highlights, and the show has also cultivated unique comedic elements, such as videos by writers Jeremy Levick and Rajat Suresh. As the late-night landscape shifts, Mulaney is making a case for risk-taking comedy. </p>

          <p>This article satirically discusses the ongoing narrative surrounding President Joe Biden's age and fitness for office, fueled by a new book, Original Sin, which details his alleged decline. The author criticizes the focus on covering up Biden's condition, arguing that his infirmity was already evident to the public. The piece also acknowledges the inherent cynicism of politics, where politicians and their staff often prioritize appearances over transparency. The author concludes that the real issue is Biden's inability to perform his duties, not the attempts to conceal his age. </p>
