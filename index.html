In a video posted on his website, Pritzker emphasized his commitment to working families and his efforts to solve problems in Illinois. He cited his record of balancing budgets, raising the minimum wage, capping insulin costs, banning assault weapons, and creating jobs.

          <p>Pentagon officials, including General Dan Caine and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, defended the success of recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities during a press conference. They presented video evidence of bunker-buster bombs being tested, emphasizing the severity of the strikes despite a leaked Defense Intelligence Agency report suggesting the strikes only delayed Iran's nuclear program by months. Hegseth criticized media coverage of the leaked report, calling it an attempt to undermine the mission's success. The officials stated that final assessments would take time, but initial battle damage assessments indicated severe damage and destruction across all three sites.</p>

Grossi noted that Iran was not cooperating in U.S.-Iran negotiations before the military intervention, though he did not criticize the military action. While not ruling out the possibility that some technology or centrifuges at Fordo survived, he said that it was just a hypothesis.</p>

          <p>A group of 40 former presidents and prime ministers, including Gordon Brown, have issued a joint appeal for a "new economic coalition of the willing" to address escalating inequality, poverty, and environmental breakdown. The former leaders condemned "narrow unilateralism" and the "outdated" 1944 economic model, advocating for debt relief, international tax cooperation, and reform of institutions like the IMF. They expressed optimism that a powerful shift is possible, calling for a restoration of development aid and global minimum taxes on multinational profits.

          <p>The Senate parliamentarian has ruled against a key Medicaid provision in the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," a major legislative package advancing President Donald Trump's agenda. The parliamentarian found that a provision cracking down on states' use of healthcare provider taxes to collect additional Medicaid funding is not in keeping with Senate rules. This ruling is a significant setback for Republican leaders, who are under pressure to move the bill to the Senate floor by a July deadline, and will require major revisions to pass the bill with only GOP votes.</p>

          <p>President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" proposes adding a work requirement to Medicaid in 40 states and D.C., sparking concerns among those with disabilities. The bill would require enrollees to prove they are working, volunteering, or attending school at least 80 hours a month, or qualify for an exemption. While the legislation lists disability as an exemption, advocates fear that strict reporting requirements and varying eligibility standards could cause many eligible beneficiaries to lose coverage. Studies show that most Medicaid enrollees already work or have a valid reason for not working, indicating that the work requirement may primarily add bureaucratic hurdles.</p>

          <p>A senior correspondent for Vox explores the MAGA movement's vision of the ideal American family, which includes a stay-at-home mother and a working father. The article examines whether it's possible to reverse trends in women's employment and encourage mothers to stay home, noting that pronatalist policies have generally not been effective. The author suggests that making stay-at-home motherhood a reality would require significant financial incentives, potentially as high as a million dollars per mother. The article also considers alternative policies for supporting American families, such as national paid leave programs and affordable child care.</p>

          <p>Closing arguments have commenced in the sex trafficking trial against Sean "Diddy" Combs, with prosecutors alleging that Combs used "power, violence and fear" to run a criminal enterprise facilitating sexual assault, kidnapping, and arson. Combs has denied the allegations and chose not to testify. The prosecution rested after calling 34 witnesses, including Cassie Ventura Fine, Combs' ex-girlfriend, who testified about being pressured into participating in "freak-offs". The defense argued that Combs' sexual habits and "kinky" lifestyle do not amount to sex trafficking, and presented loving messages between Combs and Ventura Fine to argue that she was a willing participant.</p>

Newsom criticized the deployment as an unwarranted infringement on the state's authority and filed a lawsuit, though a higher court has ruled in Trump's favor.

Concerns exist that the president may appoint someone sympathetic to his demands for lower interest rates. The uncertainty surrounding the Fed's independence has contributed to the pound's strength against the dollar. (not investment advice)</p>

The Commerce Department reported that the gross domestic product (GDP) fell at an annual rate of 0.5% from January through March. This decline was attributed to a surge in imports as companies rushed to buy foreign goods before the Trump administration's tariffs took effect.

The treatment, a new monoclonal antibody called clesrovimab, which will be sold under the brand name Enflonsia by Merck, was recommended by the powerful committee after being approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) roughly two weeks ago. The tortured vote took place a day late and after rounds of questions from the panel’s seven new members – all ideological allies of Kennedy, who views “overmedicalization” as one of the greatest threats to American children. The vote for members was whether to recommend clesrovimab, a monoclonal antibody, for all infants younger than eight months old born during or entering RSV season.</p>

          <p>An international traveler has pleaded guilty to a federal crime after assaulting a Customs and Border Protection K9 at Dulles International Airport. Hamed Aly Marie allegedly kicked the beagle, named Freddy, so hard that it was lifted off the ground, causing injury. Marie was arrested and pleaded guilty to malicious assault on a police animal, receiving a sentence of probation and restitution. The incident occurred as Freddy was screening luggage for illicit agricultural contraband.</p>

          <p>The State Department may begin laying off hundreds of Washington, D.C.-based employees as soon as this Friday, amid an effort by Secretary of State Marco Rubio to streamline what he has called a "bloated" bureaucracy. The precise timing of the cuts could be affected by a looming decision by the Supreme Court which could soon hand down a ruling on whether to leave in place a lower court's order that temporarily paused government-wide layoffs. The State Department aims to reduce its domestic workforce by up to 3,448 personnel — according to a more than 130-page notification it had submitted to Congress last month that affected around 18% of its existing staff.</p>

          <p>The article explores the monthly payments one might expect from a $200,000 annuity purchased at age 65. It notes that such an annuity can significantly boost retirement income, acting like a personal pension by providing guaranteed monthly income. However, payouts vary based on gender, annuity type, and the interest rate environment. Current estimates suggest a 65-year-old man could receive about $1,294 per month, while a woman of the same age might receive around $1,240. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Spain's Constitutional Court has upheld key provisions of a disputed amnesty law for Catalan separatists involved in the 2017 independence push. The law pardons over 300 people, with Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez hailing it as a means to guarantee Spain's unity and prosperity. The conservative opposition, however, has denounced the amnesty as unconstitutional, alleging it was a maneuver by the Socialist Party to maintain power. The ruling does not directly benefit Carles Puigdemont, the former Catalan leader who fled to avoid prosecution, as his case involves embezzlement charges.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled in favor of South Carolina's attempt to bar Planned Parenthood from participating in its Medicaid program. The court found that Planned Parenthood and a patient cannot sue the state under federal civil rights law to enforce the Medicaid Act's any-qualified-provider requirement. Justice Jackson dissented, arguing that the decision weakens civil rights protections. This ruling is likely to pave the way for more states to exclude Planned Parenthood from their Medicaid programs, which has been a long-standing goal of anti-abortion rights advocates.</p>
