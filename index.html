          <p>Rivian Automotive reported better-than-expected first-quarter results but adjusted its 2025 delivery targets downward, now projecting 40,000 to 46,000 units instead of the previous 46,000 to 51,000, and increased its capital spending guidance to $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. The company cited the uncertain global economic landscape and evolving trade regulations, particularly President Trump's tariffs, as factors impacting consumer sentiment and demand. Despite these adjustments, Rivian reaffirmed its plans to achieve a modest positive gross profit this year and anticipates losses of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion on an adjusted basis before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. The automaker also achieved its second consecutive quarter of gross profit, unlocking an expected $1 billion from Volkswagen Group as part of their joint venture. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is facing criticism over a $500 million award for vaccine research to Matthew J. Memoli and Jeffery Taubenberger, raising concerns about cronyism. The award, intended for developing universal vaccines, is seen as shortsighted given the administration's cuts to other infectious-disease projects. Critics argue that the award deviates from the traditional model of funding multiple research strategies and that the selected technology is not cutting-edge. There are also questions about Memoli's qualifications and the influence of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p>

          <p>Tesla's sales in Germany and Britain experienced significant declines in April, reaching their lowest point in over two years, reflecting a broader trend of reduced demand for the U.S. automaker in Europe. While the electric vehicle market is growing overall, Tesla's market share is shrinking due to factors such as President Trump's tariffs and anger over Elon Musk's political stances. Chinese-made electric vehicles are gaining popularity, and Germany's Volkswagen has seen a recovery in European sales. The latest numbers suggest Tesla's European challenges are deeply rooted and extend beyond model changeovers.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to enforce its policy barring transgender individuals from serving in the military while legal proceedings continue. The court agreed to pause a lower court order that had blocked the ban nationwide, with Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson dissenting. The White House celebrated the decision, while advocacy groups expressed disappointment and reiterated their belief that the policy is unconstitutional. The policy stems from an executive order targeting active-duty and prospective service members with gender dysphoria, citing concerns about military readiness and cohesion.</p>

          <p>A new Apple TV show called "Your Friends & Neighbors" starring Jon Hamm examines the lives of wealthy individuals in a Connecticut town. The show's characters are unhappy and insecure despite their wealth, which is meant to reassure the audience that being rich isn't all that it's cracked up to be. The show seems to imply that money makes divorce more likely without making it more endurable, and that wealth comes with an extreme pressure to keep up with others who are just as rich. In the end, the show is a useful balm for the resentments of people who assume that theyâ€™d definitely be happier with $10 million in the bank.</p>

          <p>Collection debt can be significantly more costly than the original unpaid bill due to accruing interest, late fees, collection agency charges, and potential legal costs. The damage to one's credit score from collection debt can also indirectly lead to higher interest rates and financial difficulties in the future. Strategies to mitigate the cost of collection debt include negotiating settlements, requesting fee waivers, seeking professional debt relief assistance, and exploring legal defenses. Taking proactive steps to address collection debt is crucial to avoid spiraling financial burdens and rebuild financial health. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked President Trump's attempt to eliminate the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), which provides federal funding to libraries and museums. The injunction was issued in response to a lawsuit filed by attorneys general from 21 states, arguing that the proposed elimination violated the Administrative Procedure Act. The IMLS is the primary source of federal funding for public libraries, particularly benefiting small and rural libraries. The ruling is a victory for the public interest, preventing the Trump Administration from hindering access to educational resources.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that the prehistoric ChavÃ­n people of the Peruvian Andes used psychoactive drugs during exclusive rituals to establish social and political hierarchies. Researchers analyzed artifacts found at ChavÃ­n de HuÃ¡ntar, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and discovered traces of hallucinogenic substances, including DMT, on bone tubes believed to be inhalation apparatuses. The small size of the rooms where these artifacts were found indicates that only certain members of ChavÃ­n society were invited to partake in these rituals. This discovery provides material evidence that hallucinogens were a focal point of these gatherings.</p>
