          <p>Charles Rangel, the former U.S. congressman from Harlem and a Korean War veteran, has died at the age of 94. Rangel served for nearly five decades on Capitol Hill and was a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus. He was known for his distinctive gravelly voice and wry sense of humor, and for fiercely looking out for his constituents, sponsoring empowerment zones and advocating for low-income housing. Rangel's career was marked by both significant achievements and an ethics censure in 2010, though he continued to serve in the House until his retirement in 2017.</p>

Joel expressed his regret for disappointing his audience and thanked them for their understanding, with refunds being offered for all affected shows. The 76-year-old musician had previously undergone surgery and physical therapy in March, though it's unclear if this was related to the recent diagnosis.</p>

          <p>A recent report indicates a significant disparity between the official unemployment rate and the "true rate" of unemployment, which accounts for those in part-time work and those earning poverty wages.

This measure includes individuals who are underemployed or earning wages insufficient to cover basic living costs. The report highlights the flaws in official data, suggesting an overly optimistic view of the economy and potentially leading to poor policy decisions (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A 62-year-old woman was surprised to receive a Social Security spousal benefit of only $1,000, rather than the expected half of her husband's $3,200 monthly benefit. The discrepancy arose because spousal benefits are calculated based on the primary insurance amount (PIA) at full retirement age, not the increased benefit from delayed retirement credits. Her husband's decision to wait until age 70 to claim benefits increased his payout, but spousal benefits are calculated using his PIA at age 66, and her benefit was further reduced due to claiming early.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicles (EVs), once a popular mode of transportation, faded into obscurity in the early 20th century due to factors like limited range and competition from cheaper gasoline-powered cars. Now, history may be repeating itself as the Trump administration seeks to undermine the growth of EVs through policy changes and tax incentives favoring oil. Despite global growth in EV sales, the U.S. market faces challenges, including gender stereotypes and political opposition, raising concerns about the future of electric vehicles in America.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's delay in implementing 50% tariffs on the European Union, analysts caution that trade tensions remain high and market volatility is likely to persist. The delay, prompted by a call with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, provides a window for negotiations but may not be sufficient to resolve underlying issues. Experts suggest that a 10% tariff agreement similar to the U.S.-U.K. deal is possible, but a larger tariff imposition could trigger retaliatory measures from the EU, leading to further economic disruption (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Republicans in Congress recently revoked California's authority to set its own mandates on electric vehicles and trucks, viewing it as a challenge to the state's outsize influence on national policy. The move reflects a broader resentment from Republican states, where the fossil fuel industry remains vital, towards California's stringent environmental regulations. Republican lawmakers argue that electric vehicles are impractical for their constituents and that California's policies should not dictate standards for the rest of the country, emphasizing ideological differences and concerns about consumer choice.</p>
